HEADLINE: Eastern Airlines Is Shutting Down And Plans to Liquidate Its Assets

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Eastern Airlines, a fixture in United States aviation since 1928 and the nation's eighth-largest airline, announced that it had stopped flying last night and would begin to sell off its planes and other assets.
The airline, which had been struggling for almost two years to rebuild under the protection of the bankruptcy court, is by far the largest casualty of the pressures brought by the deregulation of the industry 13 years ago. 
 About 5,000 of Eastern's 18,000 workers are expected to be dismissed immediately. The others will work a while longer to run ground operations, including the maintenance of Eastern's 190 planes while buyers are sought. Many of Eastern's workers live in the New York, Atlanta and Miami areas, where the carrier has its biggest operations.
 
Employees Told to Stay Home
 The airline said in a statement announcing the midnight shutdown that Eastern employees should not report to work unless otherwise notified by their supervisor. An exception, Eastern said, were reservation agents, who should come in at their usual time.
The carrier said all passengers holding tickets purchased for flights scheduled after it stopped flying would be given a full refund. Eastern said it was also working to set up ways for other carriers to honor its tickets.
Before the airline's announcement, most big airlines declined to comment on whether they would accept Eastern tickets, but American Airlines, referring to rumors, said it would honor all Eastern tickets subject to seat availability.
Ticket holders are to be reimbursed from a $50 million fund set up as part of Eastern's bankruptcy proceedings under Burton R. Lifland, the bankruptcy court judge who has overseen the airline's attempt to reorganize.
The airline's agents kept taking reservations into the early evening without telling callers that the airline would shut down. At about 7 P.M. six ticket agents behind the desk in Miami reassured passengers that the airline would continue to fly and that there was no reason to switch to another carrier.
A familiar face to residents of the East Coast, where most of the carrier's routes lie, Eastern was a ticket to the Florida and Caribbean sun in winter. Built by the World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker, it was the first large airline to ply the north-south routes along the Eastern seaboard. Its innovations included shuttle flights between New York and Washington, begun in the early 1960's, and later the added run between Boston and New York. The shuttle operation was sold to the developer and casino owner Donald J. Trump.
 
 Response to Deregulation
 Many industry analysts attributed the airline's initial problems to a poor response by management to the competitive pressures brought by deregulation after 1978, and to bad luck, with low-fare carriers like People Express expanding over much of its route system.
Eastern filed for protection from its creditors on March 9, 1989, after a strike by the machinists' union five days earlier crippled its operations. The feeling of the strikers remains so strong that several members of the union, which is still on strike, hailed the shutdown as a victory while they picketed at La Guardia Airport in New York last night .
The airline's attempt to rebuild was marred by the weakening economy and since the invasion of Kuwait last summer, by the steep rise in jet-fuel prices. All carriers have been hurt by these factors; indeed, Pan American World Airways filed for bankruptcy-court protection earlier this month, and Continental Airlines did so last month.
Eastern's decision to shut down was made at headquarters in Miami. Martin R. Shugrue, the trustee appointed to run the airline by the court, presided over the meeting, said someone who talked with Eastern's management. Only two months ago, Mr. Shugrue had argued that the airline could be turned around by March and persuaded Judge Lifland to release another $120 million from an escrow fund meant for the unsecured creditors. But yesterday, he had run out of cash.
 
 Unsecured Creditors
 The airline's unsecured creditors had argued that despite an energetic attempt to revive the airline after Mr. Shugrue took over in April, it was evident by November that its losses could not be stemmed. They urged Judge Lifland to shut down the carrier then and begin liquidating the assets while the airline still had cash to help repay them. The unsecured creditors include the aircraft makers Airbus Industrie and Boeing, the engine makers General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, banks, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which has claims because Eastern's pension are not adequately financed. The unsecured creditors are owed about $1.4 billion.
Early in the bankruptcy, when Frank Lorenzo, who was chairman of the Texas Air Corporation at the time, was still in control of Eastern, he was fond of reciting the value of Eastern's assets and saying that creditors could expect to be repaid in full. Now, after losses that totaled more than $1.5 billion since the strike began, it is uncertain whether the unsecured creditors will get anything at all.
 
 Valuable Assets
 One person involved in the bankruptcy said there is definite interest by Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. American Airlines already moved to obtain emergency permission to operate from Miami to Toronto and from New York to Montreal.
The person, who insisted on remaining anonymous, said that only after the carrier was liquidated would it be known whether the unsecured creditors would get any money.
The unsecured creditors in the last year have become increasingly disillusioned by attempts to revive the airline as money meant for them was turned over by the court to offset huge losses.
Even the secured creditors, mostly bondholders that hold assets like planes as collateral, are worried that they can not be sold for enough to pay them off in full.
 
 
Planes Are Less Valuable
 At one point, even Eastern's older planes, like its Boeing 727-200's, were considered valuable for resale. But the huge increase in the cost of fuel and a weakening economy that has reduced demand for such planes have brought down their value.
A liquidation will also have effects on the economies of New York, Atlanta and Miami, where thousands of employees work for Eastern.
Eastern still maintains a large operation at La Guardia; its flights at Newark International Airport have been cut back substantially.
E. J. Breen, an Eastern Airlines co-pilot who was chairman of the strike committee of the pilots's union, expressed sorrow at news of a shutdown. "The first reaction is, it's something we understood would happen," he said. "But now that it has, it's like the loss of a loved one."
The pilots and the flight attendants joined the machinists' walkout in March but both unions gave up in November 1989.
Barely several hundred of the 2,000 pilots who refused to cross the picket lines were rehired by Eastern, Mr. Breen said. "Inevitably, most of the guys went to other airlines or retired early," he said.
 
 Unions Saw No Choice
 Charles Bryan, the union leader who led Eastern's 9,500 mechanics and ground service workers out on strike, said the airline's failure was a tragedy. But he added that if he were given a chance to run the strike all over again, he would do nothing differently.
"I regret that the strike had to happen, but there was absolutely no choice, and I have yet to meet a striking machinist who didn't think so," he said.
Mr. Bryan said the mechanics could draw some comfort from the fact that they had driven out Mr. Lorenzo as the chairman of Eastern's parent, the Texas Air Corporation, which is now called Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. "It's a terrible price to pay, but at least he's out of the industry," he said.
The machinists who at one time numbered about 12,000 at Eastern have not called off their strike. A few still maintained the picket lines at big airports.
 
 Machinists Paid High Cost
 Most of the machinists have been forced to find other jobs, often at lower wages, while some have had a hard time finding employment and have paid severely for supporting the walkout. Families have broken up and there have been suicides.
The strike was an odd turn of events, as it had been Mr. Bryan who helped Mr. Lorenzo gain control of Eastern on Feb. 23, 1988, hoping that the two could work together to revive the carrier.
The two men soon became locked in a bitter conflict. Among other things, Eastern's machinists' and pilots' unions accused the airline of doctoring maintenance records and not making repairs properly in an effort to cut costs.
The charges drove away fliers, particularly business travelers. Even now the carrier is fighting such charges after some Eastern workers were indicted for falsfying maintenance records.
The conflict intensified when Mr. Bryan led his members out on strike. It was not a bread-and-butter strike over wages and benefits. The unions including the pilots and the flight attendants who walked out in sympathy wanted to force Mr. Lorenzo to sell the airline with the unions getting a large stake in Eastern in return for concessions.
For a time the unions seemed near victory when Peter Ueberroth, who had resigned as Commissioner of Baseball, had put together a group which in cooperation with the unions would buy out Mr. Lorenzo.
 
 Issue of Lorenzo's Control
 The unions, however, insisted that Mr. Lorenzo give up control before the deal was closed and that a trustee be appointed.
The effort failed and then other attempts also foundered. Meanwhile Eastern's flights had been crippled by the strike. Mr. Lorenzo, however, began to rebuild by hiring new pilots, machinists and flight attendants.
By the summer a large part of the airline was flying again and some strikers, particularly pilots, were worried that there would not be any jobs left for them to go back to. About 500 broke from the strike and returned that August. Mr. Lorenzo's strategy of breaking the strike by replacing strikers with new employees began to work.
By November the pilots and flight attendants broke off their strike. Even though Mr. Lorenzo had rebuilt the airline with largely new, lower- paid workers the legacy of the labor conflict drove away many travelers and left many travel agents uneasy about booking Eastern.
Another attempt to remake Eastern's battered image was made last April when Judge Lifland finally accepted the union's demand that Mr. Lorenzo give up control and that a trustee be appointed.

HEADLINE: View in Poll: a Recession

 BODY:
An overwhelming majority of Americans say the country is in a recession, according to a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll.
That perception is now almost universally accepted, although the downturn has not lasted long enough to be officially declared a recession. The Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve have acknowledged for months that the economy was growing ever more slowly, but only in recent weeks have they begun to use the word "recession." 
 Seventy-eight percent of the Americans polled on Thursday said the nation was in a recession, up nine points from October. This is the highest reading since The New York Times/ CBS News Poll began asking the question in August, when 52 percent of Americans said the nation was in a recession.
A committee of economists, known as the Business Cycle Dating Committee, is the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end. The group declared in December that a recession probably began between June and September. But the committee postponed a final, official ruling until later.
Normally, it does not declare turns in the economy until six months or longer after they occur. The committee is sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a privately financed research organization in Cambridge, Mass.
The new poll was conducted by telephone with 544 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Jordan;
In Jordan, the Iraqis Regain Respect by Striking at Israel

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Saturday, Jan. 19

 BODY:
In his photo store in central Amman, Naser Jafr had not known about the Iraqi missiles that crashed into Israel early Friday, until a friend called with the news at 4 A.M. And then, he said, he was filled with delight.
"The world said Saddam Hussein was weak," the 27-year-old Palestinian said. "Today he proved he is not." 
 The friend, Zeki Hamdan, 35, seemed inspired, too. "Now there is a leader for the Arabs and he is Saddam Hussein," he said, gesturing excitedly at television images of the missiles' impact on Tel Aviv.
This morning, Iraq launched a second missile attack against Tel Aviv.
The euphoria after the first missile offensive, ignoring Western accounts of the progressive destruction of Iraq's power, reflected a profound and precipitate swing in mood in this capital on Friday., Initial accounts of American successes in the gulf war on Thursday had filled many with anger, disbelief and a nascent sense of betrayal by Iraq.
That feeling was expressed by a banker quoted Friday in The Jordan Times. "If Saddam has no gear to retaliate, then it is all over," he said. "We have been mocked at again."
 The missile strikes "really built back Iraqi credibility," said Assad Abdu Rahman, a leading analyst of Palestinian affairs. Khaled Nasser, a prominent Palestinian academic, said, "This attack only indicates one thing: that Iraq is powerful and is the only Arab country capable of doing something to the Israelis."
Israel said Friday that eight Iraqi missiles had struck in the Haifa and Tel Aviv areas, slightly injuring 15 people. The weapons were identified as Soviet-made Scud missiles carrying conventional warheads.
The strikes on Tel Aviv and Haifa, and the prospect of Israeli reprisals, sharpened and brought closer a decision that King Hussein of Jordan has sought to avert since the gulf crisis began in August.
While many of the people he rules -- more than half of them Palestinian -- draw hope and faith from the belief that President Hussein will somehow lead the Arabs to redeeming victory, the King and his advisers seem filled more with foreboding that the conflict will spread into a ruinous, regional war that will engulf Jordan.
"This is what we were afraid of," said a senior military officer, referring to the Iraqi missile strikes. "We don't know how events will unfold."
 
Jordan Reopens Border
 Fearful of offending Palestinian and Iraqi sentiment, King Hussein's Government on Thursday condemned the Western allied assault on Iraq as a "brutal attack against an Arab and Muslim country and people." It withheld all comment on the Iraqi missile strikes on Israel, seeming to indicate that King Hussein saw no option but to support Saddam Hussein.
Jordan announced Friday that it had reopened its border to refugees from Iraq, following United Nations agreement to underwrite the costs of coping with a new exodus.
When the gulf crisis first erupted in August, around 860,000 people, many of them Asians working in Kuwait, fled through Jordan in a relief operation that, according Jordanian officials, left this cash-strapped country between Iraq and Israel with a $40 million debt.
As war approached this week, Jordan closed the border with Iraq to all non-Jordanian travelers except those who could pay for their stay in and passage out of the country.
The move seemed intended to press relief organizations into advance agreement to finance a new influx following the outbreak of hostilities, diplomats said.
 
A 'Tragic Situation'
 The effort seemed to have been successful. But by siding with Iraq, the King has jeopardized the long-term Gulf Arab and Western financial support he needs to rescue his country from a deep economic crisis. With the missile strikes on Israel, he now also faces the possibility of embroilment in a war and critical military decisions.
In an interview with American television, his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, spoke of the region's "tragic situation" and said that, if Israeli warplanes overflew Jordan on reprisal raids to Iraq, "we will have to try to defend our airspace within our capabilities."
"Jordan is not going to stand still if its territory and airspace are violated," a senior Government official said. "And it seems that the war could be lengthy."
Jordan is equipped with American- and Soviet-supplied air-defense systems. But deploying them against Israel's vastly superior air power would invite Israeli reprisals. Jordanian airspace offers the shortest route between Israel and Iraq.
 "Jordan might be able to pretend it has not seen the Israelis on their way out, but it would be difficult to argue that they had not spotted them on the way back," said a Western official, requesting anonymity. "It would have to choose between offending the Iraqis by not attacking Israels, and offending the Israelis by taking action."
Such imponderables do not play well in a city seized by passions that draw on well-springs of pride and lost dignity.
"Now the war will spread," said a 33-year-old vegetable seller who identified himself only as Samir. "If Israel retaliates, all the Arab people will be with Iraq against Israel. People were sad when it looked like Iraq had been hit by the first strike. Now they believe Saddam has more powerful weapons."
"I am happy and sad together," said Jiryis Qusous, who owns a restaurant. "I'm sad because this situation has arisen, and happy because it is the first time the Arabs struck inside Israel."
Many people interviewed Friday suggested that President Hussein had somehow duped the West and was waiting to unveil a greater, hidden arsenal of chemical and other weapons.
 As much as anything, the comments evoked the desperation of people who have known nothing but defeat for decades and are thus ready to clutch at any intimation of even the most token victory.
But more troublesome to Arab and Western diplomats pondering President Hussein's intentions is the worry that he now believes he has only one strategic option: to draw in Israel and split the Arab coalition supporting the American and Western deployment.
"If that is his thinking," a Western envoy said, "his only option is to try something horrific that will leave the Israelis no choice but to get involved."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Israel;
Iraq Fires New Missle Attack at Israel; Allies Continue Bombing; Seek Launchers

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Saturday, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Iraq launched a second missile attack against Tel Aviv this morning, military officials said. The Israeli authorities said the missiles carried conventional explosives, like the missiles that hit Tel Aviv and Haifa early Friday.
The Mayor of Tel Aviv was reported on radio and television to have said that two missiles landed in the city in the latest attack and that a few people were slightly wounded. 
 On Friday, Israeli officials had warned that the earlier attack could not stand without retaliation, even though President Bush has urged Israel not to respond, out of fear that this would shatter the coalition against Iraq and bring a larger Middle East war.
 
Warning of Retaliation
 But an Israeli Cabinet member, Health Minister Ehud Olmert, told ABC News today that retaliation was now "almost inevitable" because of the second attack, which came a bare 30 hours after the first assault.
In Washington, the Pentagon confirmed that at least three missiles were launched from western Iraq. Baghdad radio said later that Iraq had launched 11 missiles "at the enemy."
Aid raid sirens sounded nationwide shortly after 7 A.M., and for the fourth time since early Friday, Israelis took refuge in rooms sealed against chemical attack. An hour later, the army radio confirmed that there had been a missile attack, but said that citizens could now safely leave the safe rooms and take off their gas masks.
Israeli officials had warned Friday that they intended to respond to the first attack, in which houses and cars were severely damaged and 15 people suffered slight injuries.
"After the dreaded attack in the middle of the night, with children in their beds asleep," Foreign Minister David Levy said Friday of the first missile offensive, "we say to our friends, how could anyone restrain himself and refrain from reacting? If we do, will Saddam Hussein refrain from firing more missiles?"
He and others said they believed that Iraq has more mobile launchers for its Scud surface-to-surface missiles that it has hidden from American bombers.
Bush Administration officials had said Friday they were hoping Israel would not retaliate, or that if it did, the damage would be not be so severe that Arabs would bolt from the coalition against Iraq.
Israelis had been told to stay home for another day on Friday, close to their gas masks and gas-resistant safe rooms. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned that "the danger still hasn't passed."
Just before 9 P.M., air raid sirens warning of a chemical-weapons attack sounded nationwide.
The army said that alert, which proved to be a false alarm, was based on satellite information passed on by the United States suggesting that the Iraqis were about to launch more missiles. Similar alarms were sounded in Saudi Arabia.
Another air raid alert, also a false alarm, sounded briefly in the Tel Aviv area early today. The army issued another alert in Jerusalem five hours later after hearing an explosion north of the city, but said later there had been no attack and told residents to return to bed.
Even before the second missile attack, the renewal of the air raid alerts seemed to harden the Israeli view. Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was being interviewed in the Cable News Network studio here when the first false alarm went off. Immediately after the all-clear signal sounded, he declared: "We're not going to allow Israel to be in a position where every night or every day its citizens are threatened with gas attacks by this savage, brutal dictator. You should know that."
If Israel responds, he said, "it's not retaliation. It's self-defense."
Lieut. Gen. Dan Shomron, the Army Chief of Staff, told Israel television earlier Friday that n the initial missile attack "requires a response." And Defense Minister Moshe Arens said: "We'll respond. But you don't expect me to announce the date today."
Despite such comments, Mr. Levy had said after an emergency Cabinet meeting on Friday morning that the Government had not decided what it would do. This appeared to be the line the Government was taking with the United States, and it convinced some officials in Washington that Jerusalem had decided not to act immediately.
But several military officials and analysts said they believed that Israel was likely to retaliate with attacks on missile launcher sites -- if not immediately, then certainly after another Iraqi attack.
American officials worked throughout the day to persuade Israel to hold off, saying that the allied forces were tracking down the remaining Iraqi missiles and their launchers.
The White House press secretary said Friday night that President Bush had told Mr. Shamir in a telephone conversation that "he basically appreciated their restraint and asked for their understanding."
 
Hard to Certify Hits
 Allied forces reported that they had destroyed six Iraqi missile launchers on Friday. Still, President Bush acknowledged at a news conference that "when you hide a mobile missile, as they have done, it's very hard to certify that they have been hit."
Mr. Netanyahu noted that the missiles fired on Friday morning had been "targeted at Israel's heartland," the coastal plain where 80 percent of the country's people live.
Though Iraq declared on Friday that its missiles had hit "important political and economic targets," the missiles fired in the first attack in fact hit low-income residential areas and open fields.
Those eight Iraqi missiles, armed with conventional warheads, struck Israel just after 2 A.M. Friday. Two fell in Tel Aviv, three in or near Haifa and three in open fields.
 Military censors forbid publication of the precise locations or detailed descriptions of the areas hit. The army fears that the Iraqis could use such information to help them aim missiles in future attacks.
Several homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in that attack. The 15 people who were reported injured mostly received glass cuts or suffered from shock. But the authorities said four other people died Friday as a result of the civil-defense alert that was declared while the missiles were falling.
Three elderly women were found dead in the safe rooms of their apartments on Friday. All had failed to take the seals off their gas-mask filters before putting them on, and had suffocated. A 3-year-old girl died from suffocation as her parents struggled with her to put on her mask.
Dozens of people appear to have panicked and injected themselves with atropine provided in their state-issue chemical warfare kits. Atropine is a powerful antidote to gas poisoning that can be harmful if gas is not actually ingested. People who had such injections were treated and released.
 
False Claim by Iraq
 As Israel debated what it should do on Friday, Iraq moved to capitalize on its first attack by asserting that Israel had been drawn into the war. Baghdad radio reported falsely in a morning broadcast that Israeli warplanes had flown to Saudi Arabia and were participating in the bombing raids.
Analysts here and elsewhere have said they believe Iraq's goal in attacking Israel was to draw the country into the conflict, and prompt Arab countries to abandon the anti-Iraqi coalition rather than fight on the same side as Israel.
Syria, a member of the alliance against Baghdad, has said it would switch sides and help defend any country, even Iraq, if that country is attacked by Israel.
Israeli retaliation could also draw Jordan into active military support of Iraq. Jordan has tilted toward Iraq politically but is militarily neutral.
Yet the Amman Government has said repeatedly that it would seek to attack any Israeli warplanes sent over its territory. Jordan's military is already at its highest level of alert since the 1967 Middle East war. Members of the Jordanian Popular Army, a civilian militia, were given firearms on Wednesday in preparation for combat.
On Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun, commander of the Israeli Air Force, said his planes would fly over Jordan if ordered to attack Iraq. If Jordan tried to attack his planes, General Bin-Nun said, he would order his pilots to destroy the far smaller Jordanian Air Force.

HEADLINE: What Prompted Investigations Into Pricing of Baby Formula

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
The infant-formula industry, which likes to project a warm and comforting image, now finds itself at the center of Federal and state price-fixing investigations.
The antitrust inquiries promise to shed light on how the $1.9 billion industry works and to answer such questions as whether producers illegally collaborated to drive prices up. 
 But the story of how those investigations came about also provides insights into the formula industry's lobbying tactics and shows how a major antitrust inquiry develops.
The investigations largely focus on contracts awarded to the major formula producers under the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. The program, which is federally financed but run by the states for the benefit of low-income families, accounts for about one of every three cans of formula sold.
The Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General in New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Texas are looking into whether the producers rigged bids on the contracts or overcharged consumers by creating anticompetitive conditions. In Florida, Attorney General Robert Butterworth recently sued the three largest formula producers -- Abbott Laboratories , Bristol-Myers Squibb and the American Home Products Corporation -- over pricing issues.
All three companies have denied any wrongdoing. Citing pending litigation, company officials declined to be interviewed.
Together, Abbott, which markets Similac through its Ross Laboratories unit, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, which markets Enfamil through its Mead Johnson Nutritional Group, account for almost 9 of every 10 cans of formula sold. American Home Products, which accounts for about 9 percent of sales, markets SMA brand formula through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
Since 1980, the average wholesale price of formula has doubled; a 13-ounce can of concentrated formula is now $1.80 to $2.30. The three major producers have often charged virtually the same wholesale price for their products. Federal investigators want to determine the business reasons for the pricing patterns.
 
Giveaway Programs
 The major producers market their formula through giveaway programs in hospitals and doctors' offices. Because Federal law requires all formulas to have the same nutrients, many doctors consider the products so generic that hospitals often rotate them.
Companies that sell formula do not release figures on its contribution to overall earnings, but some analysts believe it is substantial.
"The major formula companies are tremendous cash cows," said James E. Post, a professor of management at Boston University who has studied the formula industry.
The roots of the current investigations stretch to the mid-1980's, when virtually all state WIC programs were paying full retail prices for formula because there was no competitive bidding. As formula prices rose, state WIC directors saw their budgets erode, said Debra Stabeno, the director of the program in Texas. In 1986, the WIC program there lacked the money to serve needy families in 40 counties, Ms. Stabeno said.
The WIC program's plight was noticed by researchers at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit group in Washington concerned with Federal economic policies.
"Most WIC directors hadn't really thought about competitive bidding as a way to control costs," said Stefan Harvey, the director of the center's project that monitors WIC.
Ms. Harvey and her colleagues urged state officials to start competitive procedures. In 1987, Texas followed Oregon and Tennessee in announcing it would give the WIC contract to the formula company that provided the biggest rebate in competitive bidding.
The major formula companies tried to counter the move. "In a nutshell, both Ross and Mead Johnson opposed us and heavily lobbied the Texas Legislature and medical community," Ms. Stabeno said.
More than 100 Texas pediatricians protested to state health officials that competitive bidding might endanger children's health by preventing doctors from prescribing certain brands of formula. Ms. Stabeno said that fear was unfounded.
A Mead Johnson sales manager, James A. Poloni, wrote to Texas officials in 1987 to warn that the company might end its longstanding policy of supplying free formula to state hospitals if the bidding plan went forward. "The high probability exists that formula companies would begin charging hospitals," he wrote.
 
Investigation in Texas
 Both Ross and Mead Johnson said they would give rebates but wanted to keep the so-called open-market system. In that system, a WIC voucher is exchanged in stores for any brand of formula; under competitive bidding, the voucher is good only for a specific brand. Under an open-market system the market share of each of the companies tends to remain the same because consumers usually buy the brand that doctors recommend.
The lobbying by Ross and Mead Johnson against competitive bidding became so intense that in 1988 the Texas Attorney General's office opened an investigation. It was dropped shortly afterward when the bidding system was adopted. Mead Johnson submitted the winning rebate bid of about $1 a can, nearly twice the rebate it said it would give under the open-market system.
As a result, Texas has saved about $35 million a year on formula and expanded its WIC program to serve an additional 110,000 residents, Ms. Stabeno said.
As more states turned to competitive bidding, formula companies competed furiously to win WIC contracts, particularly in larger states. Rebates rose steadily, reaching a high of $1.51 a can in Michigan.
Some of the pressure for higher rebates came from Wyeth-Ayerst, which had the smallest market share of the three major producers and thus the most to gain.
"Whoever wins the WIC bid gets more shelf space in supermarkets, so there is a spillover into regular retail sales," Ms. Harvey said.
With WIC rebates rising, Ms. Harvey said she and her colleagues believed that their strategy had triumphed. But a complete victory may have been short-lived.
Beginning in early 1990, rebates offered by producers began to drop. Some financial analysts said the rebates fell simply because they had become so high they cut deeply into profits. But for Ms. Harvey and her colleagues, the turnabout raised the question of possible collusion. As a result of their telephone calls, officials of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities met with the staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights, headed by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio.
In Senate hearings in May, a Federal Trade Commission official said the agency would investigate the formula industry for possible antitrust violations.
One clue being followed by Federal investigators is a March 1990 letter by Donald G. Harris, Mead Johnson's president, to WIC directors in Arizona, Montana, Oklahoma and West Virginia. The letter is unusual because in it Mr. Harris announced the rebate Mead Johnson planned to offer in sealed competitive bidding, 75 cents a can.
"We're looking at questions concerning why a company might want to announce prices in advance," said Kevin Arquit, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Competition. Mr. Arquit said the commission expects to finish its inquiry in several months.

Players and Clubs Show Figures for Arbitration

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Additional evidence of baseball's new world of economics erupted yesterday when 138 players and their clubs exchanged figures for salary arbitration. The salaries sought and offered reflected the contracts other players have signed this winter:
*Eleven players sought salaries of $3 million or more. 
 *Those 11 and 3 other players were guaranteed 1991 salaries of $2 million or more because of the figures their clubs submitted. In the previous 15 years of salary arbitration, clubs went in at $2 million or more a total of five times.
*In all, clubs offered 41 players, or 30 percent of the group, salaries of $1 million or more. Clubs offered $1 million or more a total of 57 times in prior years.
*Sixty-one of the players, or 44 percent, asked for $1 million or more. Players in the first 15 years did that a total of 108 times.
*The numbers were so large that in nine instances player and club were $1 million or more apart in their submitted figures.
 
Thigpen Reaches Terms
 Fourteen players who had filed for arbitration reached agreements with their clubs yesterday and did not exchange figures.
Leading the list was Bobby Thigpen, the relief pitcher for the Chicago White Sox. Thigpen, who had 57 saves last season, will receive $9 million over three years, making him the 30th player to average $3 million or more a year. The White Sox have two option years at salaries of $3.25 million and $3.35 million.
In the arbitration process, to begin the first three weeks of next month, an arbitrator awards either the club's figure or the player's figure, not anything in between. For all of the stratospheric salary figures submitted yesterday, perhaps the most intriguing one was $225,000. The Montreal Expos and Scott Boras, the agent, both filed that number for Drew Hall, an Expos pitcher.
That was only the second time club and player have had the same salary in mind. In 1987, David Palmer and the Atlanta Braves each submitted $725,000. In two instances, with Mike Edwards of Oakland in 1980 and Mike Flanagan of Baltimore in 1982, the agent submitted a lower number than the club.
 
Davis Seeks the Most
 Glenn Davis, recently traded by Houston to Baltimore, filed the highest number, a record-setting $3.65 million. The previous high was Robin Yount's $3.4 million a year ago.
The Orioles' $2.9 million figure for Davis was the highest offer from a club this year, but it fell short of the Brewers' $3.2 million for Yount.
Also guaranteed $2 million or more were three members of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Bobby Bonilla, Doug Drabek and Barry Bonds; Mike Greenwell and Tom Brunansky of Boston; Jack Morris of Detroit, Kelly Gruber of Toronto, Fred McGriff of San Diego, Mark McGwire of Oakland, Gary Gaetti of Minnesota, Ruben Sierra of Texas, Tom Candiotti of Cleveland and Fernando Valenzuela of Los Angeles.
 
$1 Million Gaps
 McGwire and Jose Rijo of Cincinnati, the Reds' World Series hero, have the largest gaps -- $1.3 million -- with their clubs. McGwire wants $3.3 million to Oakland's $2 million, and Rijo wants $2.9 million to the Reds' $1.6 million. Also $1 million or more apart are Morris, Sierra, Bonilla, McGriff, Drabek, Gruber and Jim Gantner of Milwaukee.
Lee Guetterman was one of the players who negotiated a contract, agreeing yesterday to a $1.05 million salary with the Yankees. The relief pitcher earned $500,000 last year.
In other agreements, Randy Myers raised his salary from $875,000 to $2 million with the Reds, Joe Orsulak accepted a two-year, $2.4 million deal from Baltimore and Mitch Williams approved a raise from $1,125,000 to $1.5 million with the Cubs.

HEADLINE: Accountants as Financial Planners

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIAN WELLS, Calif.

 BODY:
The nation's certified public accountants are beginning a major effort to convince the public that they are the best sources of advice on financial planning. Other financial planners who are not accountants say that is not necessarily so.
At this desert resort near Palm Springs recently, accountants attending a meeting of the personal financial planning division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, their profession's largest group, outlined their effort. 
 It will include, among other things, a toll-free number, (800) 969-7371, that prospective clients can call for the names of qualified accountant-planners and brochures about the accountant's role in financial planning -- a subject emcompassing all elements of personal finance, including insurance, investments, taxes and estates.
Even in this period of recession, many people are turning to professional financial planners for counsel on such objectives as paying for their children's education or preparing for retirement. But many consumers have long been confused about where to go for financial planning.
There are no Federal or state licensing requirements; anyone can call himself or herself a financial planner. And although the designations "certified financial planner" and "chartered financial consultant" indicate competence, they are conferred by private organizations and have no government sanction.
"Of all the people who are 'players,' we are the only ones licensed by the states," said Howard Safer, a partner in Kraft Brothers , Nashville accountants, and co-chairman of last week's conference. "We paid our dues as a profession."
Stuart Kessler, a partner in the New York accounting firm Goldstein Golub & Kessler and the chairman of the accountants' financial planning division, said: "We are bound by enforceable standards of conduct. The C.P.A. is thought of in the public mind as being independent and objective."
However, some consumers may be more inclined to choose a different type of adviser when it involves putting a financial program into effect.
 
The Issue of Liability
 Accountants in all but seven states -- Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas -- are barred from accepting commissions for selling investments and insurance policies. And most accountants are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers, nor do they want to be.
Thus, their advice about stocks and bonds is usually generic rather than specific. Clients often have to select someone else to put the plan into effect.
"Accountants feel they can be involved without having to take on some liability and risk for the client," said Mary Malgoire, the regulatory representative of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisers, a group of planners who do not accept commissions but are paid a set fee, just as most accountants are.
And while accountants emphasize that their expertise on tax matters and in managing budgets makes them especially capable as financial advisers, others whose education and experience are in fields like securities and insurance argue that they are at least as qualified as accountants are.
"I'm not convinced that any one particular background prepares a person any better to provide competent financial planning advice," said Robert A. Hewitt, the chairman of the International Association for Financial Planning, one of the largest groups in the field. Its members receive fees, commissions or a combination of both.
"Any background you come from is a pretty narrow background," Mr. Hewitt added, "and it's up to the planners to pick up the other skills that they need."
Even some accountants who are financial planners are aware that some of their number may not always be right for the job.
"Some C.P.A.'s may offer complicated and exotic solutions to problems that generate high professional fees when there may be simpler approaches," said Larry Fowler, a Bellevue, Wash., accountant who is an official of the accountants' financial planning division.
Finally, there is the matter of expense: The fees charged by most accountant-planners are at the high end of the range for financial planners, generally between $100 and $350 an hour, and many people cannot afford them.
Nevertheless, accountants charging that kind of money have shown that they can offer tax services to a broad segment of the population, especially in personal income tax matters. Accountants who specialize in financial planning hope to attract many kinds of customers.
"Being an accountant gives you more credibility to start," said Joel S. Isaacson, a partner in Weber Lipshie & Company in New York, who is active in the professional education programs of the accountants' planning division, "but with financial planning services, you have to know what you're doing."

Pick a Card. Any Card?

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:

Most interest rates are declining, but three-quarters of all credit-card holders will not reap the benefit. The reason: their interest rates are fixed and rarely change. To find lower rates, they must shop around. The remaining quarter of all credit cards offer variable interest rates, usually tied to the prime rate. Last year the average cost of financing purchases on a standard fixed-rate Visa card or Mastercard was 18.86 percent. The Bank Rate Monitor, an industry weekly, says these three banks offer the best deals on credit cards in the country, taking into account interest rates, annual fees and grace periods before interest charges are added.

To the Editor:
While serving time recently as a clear-liquids patient at New York Hospital, I began to understand the impact of what you aptly condemn in "The Europeans Sabotage Trade" (editorial, Dec. 8). You point out that the European Community protects its 10 million farmers by keeping prices high and shutting out foreign imports. The high prices generate huge surpluses that are dumped on world markets at artificially low prices, amounting to what you term "economic warfare" against American, Canadian and third world farmers.
At the hospital I was served prune juice made from concentrate produced in France and West Germany; apple juice from West Germany; pineapple juice from Thailand and the Philippines (has Hawaii run out of pineapples?); and grape juice from Argentina and Brazil (another grape juice container identified the contents as coming from Argentina and Chile). The only fruit juice with anything made in the United States was cranberry -- and even it had to share billing with concentrate from West Germany.

HEADLINE: A Quick Victory? It Better Be

BYLINE: By John Mueller; John Mueller, professor of political science at the University of Rochester, is author of "War, Presidents and Public Opinion."

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, N.Y.

 BODY:
President Bush has vowed that the war with Iraq "will not be another Vietnam." In its essential shape, however, the war will be quite similar, except that everything will be compressed in time. And, as in Vietnam, the key to the outcome is not the unquestionable American ability to impose damage but the enemy's ability to maintain a fighting force that can inflict casualties on Americans.
In a Gallup Poll taken last Wednesday, 79 percent of Americans supported the U.S. decision to go to war. Of those interviewed, 17 percent said they thought it would last a few of days, 39 percent saw it ending in a matter of weeks and 23 percent feared a war of some months' duration. Only 5 percent could imagine the war lasting a year or more. 
 By contrast, when the Vietnam War began in 1965, a "can do" military generally anticipated, or hoped, that the enemy would break after suffering punishment for some two or three years -- about the duration of the Korean War. The public and Congress seemed to accept that estimate, and they generally supported the war for that long.
While President Bush has said that no cost would be too high to liberate Kuwait, the public obviously envisions -- and, in all likelihood, will only tolerate -- a walkover war attended by casualty rates more like those suffered in Panama than in Vietnam.
In several recent polls, for example, support for war falls off quickly when casualty numbers are added to the query. In one, taken shortly before the war broke out, approval dropped by 19 percentage points -- from 63 to 44 percent -- when the question suggested that 1,000 U.S. troops might die. This attitude may have been reinforced in the war's early stages by reports of widespread destruction of Iraqi military and industrial installations and remarkably light allied casualties.
Tolerance for losses is far lower in the gulf than in Vietnam for at least two reasons. First, in Vietnam (as in Korea) the enemy was seen by the Administration, Congress and public to be part of the international Communist threat that had as its ultimate goal the destruction of the United States itself. Accordingly, the war inspired high levels of support, at least at first. Saddam Hussein may threaten American interests, but no one sees him as that sort of menace.
Curiously, the military often claims that a central lesson from the Vietnam experience is that forces should not be committed to war unless there is solid public backing. That was not a problem when the Vietnam War began. It is now.
Second, in Vietnam (and also in Korea) there were seen to be no alternatives when American troops were sent into action: Either the troops went in or the enemy would succeed. In Kuwait, by contrast, there was the option of continuing with the economic sanctions.
To inspire a decline in support for the war in the U.S., the Iraqis need not win a single battle. They need only maintain a dedicated fighting force that is able to push American casualties beyond tolerable levels -- and those levels are far lower than they were in Vietnam or Korea.
Of course, the Iraqis may very well collapse on cue. The Communists in Vietnam accepted losses that, as a percentage of population, were all but unprecedented in modern warfare -- about twice the rate of the Japanese in World War II, for example.
But, as Clausewitz observed, war is the least predictable of human activities. The Iraqis -- or significant numbers of them -- might refuse to break, and develop instead a Masada or Alamo complex. Massive bombing, in fact, does not usually break the targeted people's will, particularly in the short run. It often generates rage and cohesion, creates martyrs, stiffens resistance and inspires the perception that there is nothing more to lose.
The Iraqis might, for example, be able to sustain a Tet-like house-to-house battle in Kuwait City. Or they might retreat from Kuwait and launch persistent counter-attacks from Iraq, requiring a quagmire-like invasion of that country.
If something like that comes about, American losses will become intolerable and public support for the war -- Bush's war, it will surely be called -- will swiftly erode. As in Vietnam, the battle will be over American public opinion, and the Iraqis seem to understand this. There is still a danger they may conquer us even while being devastated on the battlefield.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: The West Side Viaduct;
Conrail Looking to a Revival of Its Freight Traffic

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
WITH demolition under way on the southern end of New York Central's unused elevated freight railroad through the industrial West Side of Manhattan, the Federal Government last week rebuffed an effort by local property owners to force an abandonment of the entire line.
On Jan. 7, a Manhattan developer began razing five blocks of the viaduct, known as the High Line, from Gansevoort to Bank Streets. Further demolition would have opened the prospect of development from the West Village to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. New construction in the area has been inhibited in part by the railroad tracks that thread their way around and even through the factories and warehouses along 10th Avenue and Washington Street. 
 A group called Chelsea Property Owners has been trying to force Conrail involuntarily to abandon the northern part of the line, from Gansevoort Street to the John D. Caemmerer West Side Yards, between 30th and 33d Streets. Their application to the Interstate Commerce Commission was supported by City Hall.
"It's been nothing but an obstruction to our businesses and properties for over 10 years and we want to end that," said Douglas E. Sarini, president of the owners' group and a vice president of the Edison Parking Corporation, based in Newark, which owns a critical site under the High Line.
But Conrail, based in Philadelphia, has been talking about reactivating the High Line for use in hauling waste and recyclable materials from lower Manhattan to points north.
And on Thursday, an administrative law judge at the commission, Paul J. Clerman, denied the property owners' request.
"There is credible evidence of potential traffic for movement on the High Line," he wrote. "Restoration of this line to service would comport with the objective of the commission."
Although he acknowledged the "legitimate interests" of the property owners, Judge Clerman concluded that "the public's interest in a revived transportation service over the High Line must take precedence."
After years of isolation, the High Line could once again be linked to the mainland over Amtrak's new West Side rail line, called the Empire Connection, which runs from Pennsylvania Station through a tunnel beneath the Caemmerer yards and is scheduled to open in April. Conrail has reserved a freight easement from Amtrak, according to Jonathan Broder, a Conrail attorney, who said that the railroad has been negotiating for the waste removal service with Browning-Ferris Industries of Houston.
"We're trying to preserve valuable infrastructure at a time when the market looks very positive for rail traffic," he said. "If we are able to get the line reactivated, we have received interest from other shippers in lower Manhattan to use the line again. It could be used to bring meat into the meat market and there is an opportunity to work with the Post Office or United Parcel Service."
BOTH Community Board 2, which includes the West Village, and Community Board 4, which includes Chelsea and Clinton, have called for the preservation of the High Line -- at least long enough to examine ways to use it for freight shipments or mass transit or as a recreational route.
But the City Planning Department believes the case is closed. "Future uses -- even at fairly significant densities -- would not generate a need for a new transit service that could sustain itself at the fare box," said Robert E. Flahive, director of the planning agency's Manhattan office.
As for freight use, he said: "It didn't make a lot of logistical sense. You have a spur line with no loading and storage facilities, no place for trains to queue up. You have to provide some substantial staging area."
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who supported the general notion of reusing the line while he was Manhattan Borough President, now says its continued presence "would significantly limit the city's ability to consider other development strategies for the area."
The most ambitious strategy is that envisioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the Caemmerer yards. One plan called for 3,000 apartments in towers along 12th Avenue, a 900-room hotel and 8 million square feet of office space in five enormous buildings on 11th Avenue. Given the collapse of the market, the M.T.A. is not now pursuing this project but it has supported abandonment of the viaduct.
SOME commercial redevelopment is already going on in and around the High Line route. Until the 1960's, the railroad ran as far as the sprawling St. John's Park Freight Terminal, between Washington, West, Spring and Clarkson Streets.
The terminal is now being marketed as an office building called St. John's Center, with 200,000-square-foot floors and rents of $12 a square foot. Merrill Lynch already occupies about 700,000 square feet of the million-square-foot structure. A deal is pending for 300,000 square feet more, said Josh N. Kuriloff, an assistant director of the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage, which represents the owner, Eugene M. Grant.
Also, eight floors of the 500,000-square-foot Merchants Refrigerating Company Building on 10th Avenue, between 16th and 17th Streets, are being remodeled for use by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Once a cold-storage warehouse, the building had its own spur track from the High Line, which has now been severed.
The top three floors of the building are owned by Edison Parking and used for storage; the lower eight floors by Hirschfeld Realty of Manhattan and the Belz Investment Company of Memphis, which originally planned to convert the building into a factory-outlet shopping center. The architects are Emery Roth & Sons of Manhattan.
"We look for sturdy and secure buildings," said Robert A. Bryden, special agent in charge of the New York field division for the enforcement agency. "Perhaps more importantly, it has as many as 700 indoor parking spots. Keeping our cars inside and out of view is very much a plus." There is also fairly quick access to major roads, bridges, tunnels and Federal courts downtown. The project will bring up to 800 workers into the area.
Ultimately, however, the High Line's defenders fear that jobs will be lost with the removal of the viaduct, one of the last buffers protecting industrial tenants from development pressures. "There's a very strong and very viable economy there, with a lot of jobs," said Elliott D. Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University, "I'm still a believer that rail transportation is going to be very important to the stabilization and development of that area."
About demolition, he asked: "Why is there such a need to rush? No one is proposing to build anything. It's not that you're doing any harm to private interests right now."
But the property owners believe strongly that their interests are harmed. For instance, Edison Parking owns a whole block bounded by 17th and 18th Streets, 10th and 11th Avenues. The High Line runs over the eastern portion of the parcel.
"We have had inquiries from a manufacturer to develop that property and from a motion-picture studio which wanted to go there," said Mr. Sarini, Edison's vice president. "But nothing could be done because of that structure overhead. It's really a physical barrier to manufacturing development. Both of those deals went by the wayside."
The peril is not just economic but physical. "The cement underneath the tracks has fallen and almost killed one of my men," said David Duchini, president of Adolph's Trucking Company, which operates beneath the High Line, from 24th to 25th Street.
Meanwhile, demolition has begun on a portion of the viaduct, from Gansevoort to Bank Street, which was bought from Conrail by the Rockrose Development Corporation, which owns three blocks over which the High Line travels. Rockrose has already converted the Manhattan Refrigerating Company Building, between Horatio and Gansevoort Streets, into the West Coast apartments. Now it hopes to build two new apartment buildings to the south.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The 'Cuomo Tax';
As the Gravy Train Slows, Questions Rise

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IN real-estate circles it is universally known as the "Cuomo tax," and that surely does not displease Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Soon after his first term as Governor began in 1983, when city and state governments alike were looking for ways to wring more revenue sooner from rising real-estate sale prices, the Governor won from the Legislature a novel form of gains tax. The state would take 10 percent of the gain in any sale of $1 million or more. 
 "There was a boom in real estate and a feeling that the people who were benefiting should make a contribution to the state," said James W. Wetzler, who became state Commissioner of Taxation and Finance in 1986.
The contribution proved heftier than the state expected. Initial projections were that the tax would raise about $80 million a year. In fact, $158 million poured in during the first year and the state's take climbed steadily each year through 1987. That was the peak year, with $792 million in net revenue.
But now the take has dropped sharply, as has the level of transactions. The slump in the market has thrown into bold relief the problems associated with the tax from the beginning.
The most striking is that its method of computing "gain" taxes even those who find that their project has produced no economic gain at all. The state wants the tax even when a project is experiencing such losses that its "sale" must be to a creditor.
As with any major tax on transfers, the gains tax has likely had a dampening effect on sales, with some owners preferring to remortgage rather than sell commercial property to avoid tax penalties. But it is residential development that the effects of the tax have been thrown into boldest relief in New York City. Developers or converters are barred from claiming a whole series of project-related costs as part of their "original purchase price," the cost basis for determing the gain on which the 10 percent tax is calculated.
Carolyn Ichel, a lawyer with the Manhattan firm of Roberts & Holland, listed the following disallowances that she said contribute to the state's magnified notion of a developer's gain: interest costs on site-acquisition loans; the post-construction cost of carrying unsold space; marketing and advertising expenses; the expense of buying Section 421a abatement certificates for Manhattan residential construction; leasing-up costs; brokerage commissions for leasing; tenant relocation expenses; marketing and advertising expenses.
"THE inequities are most glaring in the case of projects constructed for sale, or disposed of shortly after completion," she said. "In these cases virtually all the income from the project is subject to the gains tax, and the disallowance of any cost can immediately be seen as producing inflated gain."
The effects are especially notable in New York City development projects, because they frequently involve long lead times, predevelopment costs and sales-related costs -- to say nothing of the added interest and real-estate tax burdens that result from slow sales in a poor market.
In the case of conversions of rental property to co-ops or condominiums, for example, Time Equities, once one of the city's largest converters, stopped buying rental buildings for conversions as long as five years ago because of what it deemed the tax's confiscatory effect on potential sales profits.
The fiscal problems of Time Equities and other conversion sponsors who hold hundreds of renter-occupied apartments derive in part from the gains tax. The tax in effect imposed a penalty on sponsors who might have at one time made package deals with buyers before the slump, and reports of potential fiscal problems for co-op corporations unsettled the market.
Condominium and co-op sales by developers or converters have been a major source of income under the 10 percent gains tax, although the state finance agency could offer no breakdown in dollars.
In the 1990 fiscal year, 26,425 of the total 33,461 sales were of this type. The state could make no breakout of conversion and new construction. The state's position is that even an ownership entity that files for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy should pay the tax. It is appealing a decision won in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York by 995 Fifth Avenue Associates. That bankrupt entity incurred a $2.6 million gains tax when it sold the Stanhope Hotel in Manhattan to a Japanese company.
The decision strengthens the use of the Chapter 11 procedure as a method of working out the problems of a troubled project, said Joshua J. Angel of the firm of Angel & Frankel, which represented 995 Fifth Avenue Associates.
But the gains tax can be an impediment in other workout approaches, said another lawyer, Stephen S. Ziegler of the firm of Lowenthal Landau Fischer & Ziegler, which is litigating on behalf of Time Equities in its efforts to change the state's treatment of the gain tax in co-op conversions.
If a property has declined in value below the amount due on the mortgage, the debtor would owe tax on the higher mortgage value rather than the true market value if he transferred the deed, Mr. Ziegler said. In essence, an added penalty is imposed on the owner-debtor who cannot come up with cash to pay down the debt to the market value of the property.
If there is a formal foreclosure proceeding, the tax may be even higher. The referee dealing with an uncooperative debtor may assume the gains tax will equal 10 percent of the foreclosure sale's proceeds..
THE workings of the tax in foreclosure situations, which has led to litigation, demonstrates how it has stood in the way of efforts to work out debtors' problems. But it also shows in general that the tax was conceived as a device to use in upbeat markets. It has lacked flexibility in a down market. Unlike a capital gains tax, for example, it does not allow taxpayers to offset gains with losses experienced in other transactions.
The Real Estate Board of New York in November carried its longstanding case against what it considers inequities in the administration of the gains tax to the state's chief economic development official, Vincent Tese, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Economic Development.
According to the board, the state's administration of the tax has resulted in effective tax rates of 13 to 35 percent of the true economic gain in real-estate sales. In four projects brought to the board's attention, the gains tax aggregated $4.4 million "when in fact there was no economic gain at all," said Steven Spinola, president of the board.
Another lawyer, Robert Schachat, tax partner in the firm of Wien Malkin & Bettex, gave an example to illustrate how a condominium developer in Manhattan could find himself owing a huge gains tax at a time when he "thought he was breaking even." The hypothesis is that the developer spends $10 million to buy land for an apartment project and breaks ground after three years.
In a typical case this developer will have put into the project $34 million in equity and borrowed money, but only $29 million will be allowed as the "original purchase price." The $5 million difference comes from the disallowed preconstruction interest costs and real-estate taxes of $3 million and the $2 million in construction-period interest expense allocatable to the land.
Assuming $4 million in post-completion interest payments, real estate taxes and marketing expenses, the developer will see himself as breaking even if he sells out all the apartments within two years for $38 million.
But from the tax collector's standpoint, this is a $9 million gain and $900,000 in tax is owed.
For the co-op converter the situation is even worse, said Mr. Schachat, because the state ignores "negative carry" as part of the original purchase price. This is what the sponsor must pay the co-op to make up for rents that don't equal maintenance payments for the renter-occupied apartments.
Commissioner Wetzler, for his part, believes that legislative action is needed for most of the changes in the law sought by the real-estate industry. That cannot be expected under current circumstances, he said. Any administrative changes would involve "looseners and tighteners" that would be revenue-neutral.
"We're studying the suggestions and engaging in a dialogue with the industry," said Commissioner Wetzler.

HEADLINE: Redefining 'Affordability' for the 90's

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
MORE than a decade after soaring real estate values made "affordable housing" a rallying cry across much of the nation, economists, builders and community activists are challenging deeply ingrained assumptions about how much Americans can -- or should -- pay for housing.
Housing costs have always caused severe hardships for the poor, whose plight deepened in the 80's. But now the debate has broadened to include middle-income and affluent households, some of whom may have stretched their budgets too far in recent home purchases. 
 "The term 'affordable housing' has become a meaningless cliche," said Michael Stone, a professor of community development at the University of Massachusetts. In studies of how much people pay for rent or homeownership, he concluded that 27 million households, or nearly a third of the country's population, are "shelter poor" because they have too little left over for food, education, medical bills, transportation and other needs.
One clear shift as the real estate boom of 80's gives way to the economic austerity of the 90's is that housing has, indeed, become more affordable. While incomes have risen, mortgage interest rates and home prices have declined sharply. Analysts say more Americans can now buy homes than at any time since 1978.
But that comes as little comfort to low- and moderate-income families living in publicly assisted housing who are required to pay up to 30 percent of their income in rent, an amount fixed in Government policy that experts say is claiming too much from some households living at or near the poverty level.
And for many homeowners, the gains in affordability are at best a mixed blessing. Millions who bought in the late 80's, believing their homes would prove to be lucrative investments, went further into debt for mortgage loans than has traditionally been considered prudent. Now, caught in a nationwide real estate slump and facing the propspect of selling for little more -- or even less -- than they paid, many are staying put, cutting back on other expenses and paying housing costs that are a heavy load.
For others, just staying put has become impossible. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, foreclosures on homeowners rose more than 30 percent in the first nine months of 1990. Evictions of renters are also on the rise; court records in New Jersey indicate they have risen by over 25 percent since 1986, to 163,994 last year.
"There is no question that people are feeling pinched and house poor," said Robert Engelstad, vice president for mortgage standards at the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of real estate loans from thrifts, banks and mortgage companies.
Nor has the problem escaped the attention of home builders.
"People in the 1980's expected to hold on to a home for two or three years and sell at a profit, so they thought it was O.K. to fall behind on their MasterCard bills in the meantime," said George Yankowich, a developer in Greenwich, Conn., one of the nation's wealthiest communities.
Mr. Yankowich is seeking approval from the town's Planning and Zoning Commission to build eight condominiums priced at $95,000 to $170,000, far below the cost of most Greenwich housing.
"Buyers have become much more conservative," he added. "It just makes business sense" to build housing "at a moderate price that people will buy to live in for a long time."
Central to the debate over housing affordability are two financial formulas that had long been accepted as national guidelines but that were either adjusted or ignored over the last decade.
One rule, affecting low- and moderate-income renters, is the Government's index for how much of their income should be paid in rent. For decades, that limit was 25 percent of income, but it was raised to 30 percent under President Ronald Reagan and has since been set at 30 percent by Federal, state and city housing agencies across the nation.
For home buyers, the rule had traditionally dictated that no more than 28 percent of their income be devoted to mortgage payments, real estate taxes and home insurance premiums. The 28 percent limit was intended to prevent people from going too far into debt. It also stipulated that the totality of a home buyer's debt obligations, including payments on the home loan, car loans, credit card purchases and other personal debts, should not claim more than 36 percent of income.
But for recent home buyers, particularly in the most expensive urban areas, the guidelines have been stretched widely. A 1990 survey of hundreds of home buyers in 18 large metropolitan areas, to be released later this month by the Chicago Title and Trust Company, found that most were paying more -- sometimes much more -- than 30 percent of their income for mortgage and real estate tax payments. Deepest in debt, the survey found, were 1990 buyers in the New York area, who are now paying an average of 40.6 percent of their incomes to mortgage lenders and tax collectors.
BUYERS and lenders alike have found many ways to stretch the limits. "In most cases, the rules have been adjusted for very legitimate reasons," said Mr. Engelstad of Fannie Mae, which still adheres to a general policy in which it will buy mortgage loans held by people paying up to 28 percent of their income in mortgage, real estate tax and insurance bills.
But even Fannie Mae increased its limits in the 80's, to as high as 33 percent for some buyers.
Lenders say some of their customers, having profited from the sale of other property, agreed to make down payments of more than the normal 20 percent of the purchase price of their new homes and in turn were allowed to take out larger-than-normal mortgages.
Wealthy buyers around New York and in other expensive markets have turned to so-called "jumbo" mortgage financing from banks and mortgage companies, in which traditional limits are often ignored. And many who bought in the late 80's have now found themselves paying a larger share of their income in mortgage payments because they have adjustable-rate loans that started with artificially low "teaser" interest rates that have since gone up.
As an example, a family with $60,000 in income, willing to pay 40 percent of it for a home, would be paying $2,000 a month in mortgage and real estate tax bills. Assuming the family made a 20 percent down payment and took a mortgage at 10 percent interest in mid-1990, it might have bought a $280,000 house, a modest three-bedroom residence in one of New York's more expensive suburbs. But the $3,000 the family would have left after paying for its house each month might be spread thin to meet other expenses -- income taxes, commutation costs, education bills and entertainment, among them.
John Pfister, chief economist for Chicago Title and Trust, who conducts the survey each December, said the costs for new buyers in and around New York were even higher in the late 80's, reaching a peak in 1988, when the average buyer paid out 44.5 percent of his income for housing.
Elsewhere, 1990 buyers went only slightly less deeply into debt. Mr. Pfister said those in San Francisco are paying 40.2 percent of their incomes for mortgage and real estate tax payments; in Los Angeles, 38 percent; in Boston, 34.9 percent, and in Chicago, 33 percent.
Of the 18 metropolitan areas surveyed, only Memphis and its suburbs were found to be on the better side of the 28 percent ratio of income-to-housing costs; people there were paying an average of 27.6 percent of their incomes for mortgage and real estate tax bills, Mr. Pfister said.
While it is generating a fresh round of debate in the most expensive areas, affordable housing is much less of a problem outside large metropolitan areas. In most of the nation, where real estate prices are far lower, home ownership claims less of people's incomes.
"There are people everywhere who can't afford housing, but middle-income people really can afford a home in Saginaw," said Lee Knudson, president of the Michigan National Bank in Saginaw, where well-maintained ranch or split-level houses, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, can be bought for under $55,000.
Mr. Knudson's city represents an extreme in housing affordability, which varies widely across the nation.
A study of 100 cities in November by Mortgage-Wright, a mortgage-banking company in Richmond, Va., found Saginaw the most affordable. It said people with the city's median income of $37,200 make more than twice as much as they need to buy a median-priced Saginaw home, costing $49,500.
By contrast, it found that in New York City and its suburbs -- the least affordable housing market -- a family with the area's median income of $36,900 would have only 68 percent of what it needs to buy a median-priced home, costing $175,000.
THE study assumed buyers had enough to make a 20 percent down payment, and would pay 28 percent of their income for mortgage payments, real estate taxes and insurance premiums.
Other research shows that housing affordability gradually improved during the 80's in most of the nation. While homes remain more expensive than in the 70's, rising incomes and relatively low interest rates have made current prices a bargain compared to those of a decade ago.
The trend is reflected in annual surveys by the National Association of Realtors, a trade group based in Washington. Comparing interest rates, median incomes and median selling prices across the nation, it found that by last November the median family income of $35,353 was 110 percent of what was needed to buy the median-priced home, costing $98,300.
That came after nine years of steady improvement. In 1981, the least affordable year -- when interest rates on mortgage loans had risen to more than 16 percent -- the national median income was only 69 percent of what was needed to buy the median-priced home, costing $66.400.
Indeed, homes in some parts of the country, especially the most expensive metropolitan areas, have become even more affordable over the last three months with a sharp decline in interest rates and a continuing slump in prices. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, which were over 10.5 percent in mid-1990, have fallen to near 9.5 percent.
"This is an unusual window," said Mr. Pfister of Chicago Title and Trust, referring to the rate. "There have been very few periods before when we've seen interest rates falling at the same time home values are flat or declining."
But to whatever extent the current slump offers opportunities, some experts say, buyers, renters, lenders and government agencies should all reconsider what affordability means to the complex mix of American households.
"I challenge the notion that any single index of affordability makes sense," said Mr. Stone of the University of Massachusetts.
The most widespread problems, he added, have arisen in publicly assisted housing and its pervasive rules that tenants pay up to 30 percent of their income in rent. In some cases, he said, these tenants are paying less than they can afford.
IN one example, he said, elderly couples with more than $10,000 in income, and whose tax bills and other personal expenses are low, could get by if they paid more than 30 percent of it in rent if they are in good health.
But those with lower incomes are in a bind, he said. Many single old people, particularly widows without pensions, have less than $6,000 in income. Taking 30 percent of that for rent leaves "almost nothing" for other expenses, he said.
The system also puts a disproportionate burden on large low-income families, he added, who often cannot afford food, education and clothing bills for their children after 30 percent of their income is claimed in rent.
For renters and homeowners alike, "housing costs make the first claim on income," Mr. Stone said. "They are large and inflexible, and the mistake people have made is in failing to fully consider how much they really need to have left over for nonshelter expenses."
 
THE KEY TO AID ELIGIBILITY
FOR people in publicly assisted housing programs designed to enhance affordability, the formulas used for eligibility across the nation are based on Government calulations of the median income for their area. Most who qualify pay 30 percent of their income in rent. Those in programs that enable them to purchase homes usually pay 28 percent of the income in mortgage, real estate taxes and insurance bills. But in some cases the limit for homeowners, as for renters, is 30 percent.
Critics of the system argue that median income -- at least as reported by the Federal Government -- is a flawed measure because it is calculated for metropolitan statistical areas, which include cities and some of their surrounding suburbs. In New York City, programs are administered on the basis of a median income figure of $32,401 for a family of four. But advocates for the poor say a more accurate figure would be $26,000 to $28,000.
More than 30 publicly assisted housing programs are administered in New York City and funded through city, state and Federal sources. Most are targeted for families with incomes up to 50 percent of the median, or $16,200, or between 50 percent and 80 percent of the median, or $26,001 to $32,400.
In New Jersey, the Mount Laurel court decision and the subsequent Fair Housing Act of 1985 require all communities to support housing affordable to low- and moderate income families. Low income is considered below 50 percent of the median, and moderate income is considered 50 percent to 80 percent of the median.
Median incomes are calculated for each New Jersey county, and they vary widely. For example, the median for a family of four in Hudson County is $32,100, in Bergen County it is $48,000 and in Morris County it is $43,700.
In Connecticut, housing officials rely on Federal median income figures for metropolitan statistical areas. For four-member families, they range from a median of $67,300 in the Stamford area to $40,200 in the Waterbury area. -- THOMAS J. LUECK

To the Editor:
Your article on Dec. 30 entitled "Audubon Society Creating Power-Saving Offices" on energy efficiency renovations planned for the National Audubon Society's headquarters in Manhattan did not mention that the new, high-efficiency, gas air-conditioning system in the society's Manhattan headquarters will be supported by an estimated $45,000 in rebates available through Con Edison's "Enlightened Energy" program. We also had helped fund the Natural Resources Defense Council building's lighting retrofit project, which already is paying energy bill dividends.
'Enlightened Energy" rebates are available to Con Edison customers for a wide variety of energy-saving applications, including high-efficiency lamps, ballasts and lighting controls, motors, and air conditioning systems. We also offer free energy audits as a first step in proving the economic benefits of energy efficiency.

DRAWINGS OF WOMEN
 Mary Bell worked as a laundress for Isabel Lachaise, wife of the sculptor Gaston Lachaise, in Boston during the 1920's and 30's. At night she would go to her attic bedroom and draw simple pictures, mostly of women, in crayon and graphite. Thirty-six of her drawings are on exhibition through March 21 at the Yale Art Gallery in New Haven, preserved and in some cases commissioned by a coterie of intellectuals that included Carl Can Vechten, Gertrude Stein and Mr. Lachaise.
 "It's interesting that these people gave so much attention to this primitive black artist, in a rather condescending way, and so little attention to the serious, trained black artists of the period," said Marie Weltzien, spokeswoman for the gallery.
 Ms. Bell died in 1942 at the age of 69. Van Vechten, the photographer and writer, had commissioned 100 drawings from her between 1937 and 1939, and he was the author of numerous letters to her, to Lachaise, and to other local intellectuals. A selection of those letters is on view through Feb. 28 in the Beinecke Library at Yale, where the drawings and letters are part of the permanent collection.
 The exhibition was organized by Mary Kordak of the gallery staff and Theresa Leininger, a graduate student in art history. The gallery, at Chapel and York Streets, is open Tuesdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sundays from 2 to 5 P.M., and Thursday evenings from 5 to 8. The library is at 121 Wall Street, open Monday through Friday from 8:30 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. and on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. For more information call 432-0601.
 
'ALICE IN WONDERLAND'
 Michael Uthoff, director of the Hartford Ballet, has choreographed "Alice in Wonderland" to the music of Bach's Brandenburg Concerti and the California sound of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Combined with the contemporary visuals of Jerome Sirlin's other-worldly sets, the production has an appropriately wild unreality that should appeal to all ages.
 The world premiere performances are scheduled at the Bushnell in Hartford on Friday and Saturday at 7:30 P.M., with matinees at 2:30 P.M. on Saturday and 1 P.M. on Sunday. Tickets are priced from $10.50 to $40.50. The box office number is 246-6807.
 
BANNED BOOKS
 A series of four book discussions titled "Once Banned, Now Classic" begins at the Turn of River branch of the Stamford Public Library, 752 High Ridge Road, on Thursday at 7:30 P.M. Led by Catherine Riordan, the first session focuses on James Joyce's autobiographical novel "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."
 Subsequent evenings will be devoted to "Lady Chatterley's Lover" by D. H. Lawrence on Feb. 14; Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" on March 7, and "Native Son" by Richard Wright on March 28. Ms. Riordan, who received her Ph.D. on the development of the novel from Fordham University, will discuss the sociological climate in which each of the books was banned.
Copies of the books will be available for lending, and reading them is not a prerequisite for participating in the discussions. Admission is free.
 
WINTER FESTIVAL
 Whether the weather wanders from its recent low temperatures or not, the Eighth Annual Winter Fun Festival and Ice Harvest goes on as scheduled today from noon to 4 P.M. at the Inn on Lake Waramaug, 107 North Shore Road in New Preston.
 If necessary, snow will be imported to accommodate participants in the snowman and snow sculpture competitions and in the accurate snowball throwing contest. Members of the Inn's staff said the lake stays sufficiently frozen to provide fine demonstrations of ice cutting with antique tools. The blocks are raised with special poles for transportation to the icehouse.
 Visitors may watch the proceedings, take part in the contests and bring their skates for scooting out over the lake, all without charge. A bonfire will be fueled continuously, and hot cocoa and toddies will be available. Call 868-0563 for more information.
 
WALK WITH SKIS
 Experienced cross-country skiers are invited to take a nature walk on skis at the White Memorial Conservation Center in Litchfield on Saturday at 2 P.M. Paul Gros, chairman of the Conservation Commission of the Litchfield Hills Audubon Society, will lead the group, spotting winter wildlife in the fields and woodlands of the center's grounds. Mr. Gros leads such walks regularly, drawing on his expertise in skiing, hiking, birding and photography.
 The group will start from the museum entrance, south of Route 202 between Litchfield and Bantam. There is no charge for participating. Call 567-0857 and ask for the museum to obtain more information.
 
SEASCAPES FROM NEW ZEALAND
 A. D. Blake, a marine artist from New Zealand, is having his first American show at the Wind Borne Gallery, 559 Post Road in Darien, opening on Saturday with a reception from 4 to 8 P.M.
 Mr. Blake has been a sailor since he was 6 years old, placing second in a National Championship Race off the New Zealand coast, for which he designed his own 18-foot catamaran.
 After graduating with honors from Auckland University's Engineering School, he left his career as a civil engineer to devote himself to painting. His oils cover a wide range of historical and emotional scenes of the sea, from the great clipper ships of past centuries to modern ocean racers. The gallery is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.
 
ROYAL ART
 Anglophiles and art lovers will find their milieu this week at the Yale Center for British Art; two lectures and a symposium have been organized around the current exhibition, "Crown Pictorial: Art and the British Monarchy."
 Tom Wood, English portraitist, will discuss "A Royal Commission: Painting Prince Charles" at 5:15 P.M. on Thursday, and Sir Roy Strong, a British art historian, will lecture on "Cecil Beaton and the Image of the British Monarchy" at 5:15 on Friday.
 The symposium is scheduled from 10:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. on Saturday. The morning session is composed of three talks -- "Royal Building: the First Thousand Years" by J. Mordaunt Crook, professor of architectural history at the University of London; "Royal Imagemaking: the First Fifty Years" by Duncan Robinson, director of the Center for British Art, and "The Economics of Visual Culture at the Early Stuart Court" by Malcolm Smuts, associate professor of history at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
 From 2 to 4 P.M., Linda J. Colley, professor of history at Yale, will speak on "From Distance to Splendid Domesticity: The Construction of a Royal Esthetic 1650-1850"; Hermione Hobhouse, editor of Survey of London, will talk about "Prince Albert, Patron of the Arts and Sciences," and the final topic will be "The Monarchy, the Media and the Message: Representing Royalty from Victoria to Elizabeth" by David Cannadine, professor of history at Columbia University.
 Admission to all events is free. The center is at 1080 Chapel Street and the exhibition may be seen through Feb. 17 from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday, and from 2 to 5 on Sunday. Call 432-2850 for more information.

HEADLINE: New Approach Is Offered for a White Plains Mall

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
STUNG by the effects of the recession, a White Plains developer has scaled down his proposal for a 75-store high-fashion shopping mall on the former Alexander's department store site. He has offered instead a 25-store complex that would attract bargain-conscious shoppers.
The developer's change in plans for the Westchester Pavilion, as the project is known, suggested uncertainty about the county's economic climate. But it was praised by local retailers and city officials as providing a needed balance for the White Plains retail market. 
 They say the new proposal, which was presented to the Planning Board on Jan. 10 and includes tenants like Filene's Basement and Toys 'R' Us, will complement rather than compete with the one-million-square-foot Fashion Mall that has been proposed for the adjacent site, where the former B. Altman's building now stands. The 150 speciality stores in the Fashion Mall proposal would fill 840,000 square feet of retail space and are expected to generate $24 million in sales-tax revenue. The rest of the space would provide parking.
 
'A Marriage Made in Heaven'
 The Fashion Mall proposal is now before the Planning Board. If it is approved, the anchor stores would include Neiman Marcus and the Seattle-based Nordstrom's department store. A third anchor store has not yet been named.
Discussing the potential interplay between the two projects, one local real-estate broker said, "It's a marriage made in heaven." The broker, David M. J. Saunders, owner of Saunders and Company in Rye, which works exclusively with retailers, cited the drawing power of popular value-oriented stores like Toys 'R' Us: "It's a classic real estate situation -- an upscale regional mall next door to a power center. Is a Neiman Marcus customer a Toys 'R' Us customer? Absolutely. Everybody is looking for a deal."
The new retail mix would have particular benefits for White Plains residents, several members of the Common Council agreed last week. "When Alexanders left, we lost a level of shopping very important to many people in White Plains," said Mary Ann Keenan, a member of the Council.
The new plan, however, eliminates the six-screen movie-theater complex that would have served the city's downtown, which now has only two movie theaters, both in the Galleria Shopping Mall. "We desperately need theaters," Mrs. Keenan said. "People need to be entertained if they are to patronize area restaurants, which keep opening and closing."
The developer cited space requirements as the reason the theaters were dropped. "The multiplex industry was looking for a larger number of theaters than we could provide," said J. Michael Divney, a partner in WP Centre Associates, a joint venture of the Hamilton Development Corporation of White Plains and Fischer-MacLeod Associates of Manhattan. "We couldn't accommodate eight or 10 theaters and still provide parking."
 
Seeking the Middle Market
 The new plan would meet the needs of the county's "very underserviced" middle-class market, Mr. Divney said, by providing stores that offer "a combination of quality and value." The new stores should appeal to a broad spectrum of customers, he added, because "people of every income level have become conscious of value."
The partnership purchased the Alexander's site, bordered by Post Road, South Broadway, Maple and Hale Avenues, in 1988 for $16 million. Soon after the search for stores began, Mr. Divney said, it became clear that potential tenants were concerned about worsening economic conditions. Competition from the proposed Fashion Mall was also a factor, he conceded, saying that some tenants made unreasonable requests for improvements. "They were playing us off against the potential of the other mall," he said.
As the credit market tightened and underwriting pressures increased, Mr. Divney said, "We realized we were chasing our tail and that we couldn't accomplish our goals."
But meanwhile, the partnership found that "high-quality, value-oriented" retailers were eager to find large spaces, he said. So the new concept was developed around those needs.
The cost of the new proposal is estimated to be $55 million, about half the cost of the original proposal; at 277,000 square feet, it is about 20 percent smaller than the original proposal. It provides for "up to" 25 stores instead of the 75 first planned.
The first plan had called for the Alexander's building to be demolished. Under the new proposal, only the top level of the parking structure would be removed. The building will be completely redesigned, Mr. Divney said, to resemble "the traditional city storefronts, with numerous display windows and awnings."
 
Existing Retailers Seem Pleased
 In interviews last week, local White Plains retailers appeared pleased about the retailing plan, which they said they believed would complement and stimulate a weak retail market along Mamaroneck Avenue, the main downtown shopping area, which is mostly value-oriented.
"These are value-oriented stores that will appeal to the local area and bring in local traffic," said Julian DiDonato, president of the White Plains Merchants Association, an organization of 45 downtown store owners.
"We are real happy that the space is being used," said Mr. DiDonato, the owner of Dakota Drygoods, a men's and women's apparel store on Mamaroneck Avenue. "There is nothing worse for the downtown than a vacancy, especially one that large."
Thirty-two stores are currently vacant among the 150 located along Mamaroneck Ave, Mr. DiDonato said, the highest vacancy rate in a decade.
Local store owners are pleased that the original "pedestrian friendly" design for the Westchester Pavilion has been retained, one that features numerous street-level entrances. They hope this factor will encourage shoppers to walk to and from Mamaroneck Avenue to the Westchester Pavilion.
Mr. DiDonato said he was still concerned about the potential impact of the proposed Fashion Mall on White Plains retailing. Its enclosed design, he said, would limit pedestrian access and make the complex "an island in the middle of White Plains."
 
Would Some Stores Relocate?
 Local retailers and several Common Council members said they also were worried that existing high-quality stores in the Galleria and along Mamarmoneck Avenue would be tempted to relocate to the Fashion Mall, leaving more empty spaces.
It was these issues, as well as the pace of development here that helped elect Robert E. Greer, a Democrat, to the White Plains Common Council in the last election, giving the Democrats a majority for the first time in 15 years. With a campaign slogan asking, "How Much Is Too Much?," Mr. Greer said his victory reflected voter concern about just how much retail and office development the city needs.
The new Democratic majority on the Common Council strongly supports a $250,000 traffic study, approved unanimously in October by the the previous Council. The study might not be completed until next fall, and Democrats say they must have a completed study before they consider approving plans for the Fashion Mall.
The O'Connor Group, the Manhattan developers of the Fashion Mall, said it needs a commitment from the Common Council by April. "It's absolutely essential," said Jerry O'Connor, the company's president. "The agreement we have with Nordstrom's is for a 1993 opening, and we must have a commitment on or about April 1 if we are to have a chance of opening in 1993."
 
'Too Big a Decision'
 But Dennis Power, a Democrat on the Common Council, said: "A lot of White Plains's future depends on how we are able to deal with traffic. The city doesn't have to be held captive to one store. Nordstrom's would be very appealing, but there is more than one plan or one store we could consider. This is too big a decision."
Other members of the Council said they were concerned about the rapid pace of development in White Plains, whose population of 47,000 swells to nearly 300,000 each workday. To build too much more, they say, could alter the character of the city in unacceptable ways.
"Could this be the kiss of death for Mamaroneck Avenue?" Rita Z. Malmud, a Democratic member of the Common Council, asked about the proposed Fashion Mall. "I need careful study before I grant special permission to a new project that might greatly hurt White Plains."
Mrs. Malmud said she was concerned about the amount of retailing the city can or should sustain. "This is a city of homes," Mrs. Malmud said. "And while we want to keep a healthy commercial and retailing section, we don't want to strangle the healthy home life that is here."
Mayor Alfred Del Vecchio, a strong supporter of development in the city, did not respond to repeated telephone calls to his office last week requesting comment.
 
A Fear of Losing Nordstrom's
 Accusing the Democrats on the Council of acting in a partisan manner, Michael A. Coffey, a Republican member, said he was worried that "Nordstrom's will walk away." He liked the concept of the Fashion Mall, he said, and added: "I want to keep Mamaroneck Avenue thriving. But the retailing community is always changing."
While the merits of the Fashion Mall is debated by the Council, support for the Westchester Pavilion seems more certain. The original project received unanimous Council approval for a change in zoning soon after it was last year, and site-plan approval of the new design seems likely.
Leases with Toys 'R' Us and Filene's Basement, now in the final stage of negotiation, may be signed by the end of the month, Mr. Divney said, adding that "intense discussions" were being held with four other tenants.
When these negotiations are complete, he said, financial underwriters of the project will be satisfied and an opening by next Christmas could be possible. "Once we get over the initial hurdle," Mr. Divney said, "we won't have space for all the tenants who want to be there."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Mr. Hussein, Please Surrender

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
From the way the world's markets reacted last week, one would have thought that victory in Iraq had already been won. The Dow Jones industrial average gained more points than it ever had in a week, amid general rejoicing over early success in the air war.
The buying, which sent the Dow up 145.29 points, or 5.8 percent, to 2,646.78, reflects hopes for a lovely bullish scenario. That calls for a victory in Iraq to send the price of oil spiraling down, providing extra cash for newly confident consumers to spend. And that spending, in turn, makes the American recession short and relatively painless. 
 That scenario has a lot to recommend it, if only because the alternatives are not fun to contemplate. If things do not pick up, the high leverage of the 1980's threatens to create a wave of defaults, doing severe damage to the economy -- to the extent that the Government does not choose to pick up the tab -- or to the currency, to the extent it does.
From city hall in Philadelphia to Rupert Murdoch's three-continent media empire, the other important battles going on involve debtors pleading for cash.
Both Philadelphia and Mr. Murdoch were claiming victories last week in arranging temporary financing to tide them over until something else turns up. Philadelphia is so desperate it will pay an effective interest rate of something like 24 percent on its $150 million short-term loan. The News Corporation, which Mr. Murdoch controls, is to get $600 million from its banks while stretching out repayments on its existing loans. It is expected to pay a fee of about $85 million for the loan, plus another $85 million in three years. Unless a snag develops, the cash should be forthcoming by next week.
News Corporation owns assets ranging from The Times of London to an Australian sheep ranch, and including Twentieth Century-Fox, the studio with this year's surprise hit, "Home Alone." It earns enough money to cover its interest payments, but not, alas, enough to make principal payments. The bank deal will give it time to find buyers for a billion or two worth of assets.
It is not Mr. Murdoch's fault that there are recessions in Britain, Australia and the United States, his three primary markets. But it was his choice to pay high prices for TV Guide and other acquisitions in the 80's and to finance his purchases with short-term debt. He evidently assumed he could always sell equity or long-term bonds if necessary.
Now, with both the bond and equity markets effectively closed to him, Mr. Murdoch may be forced to surrender a significant amount of management freedom to the banks that only a year ago were clamoring for the privilege of lending him money.
Mr. Murdoch has always landed on his feet, but to do so again he has only a limited amount of time to find buyers willing to pay good prices for some subsidiaries. The best hope for News Corporation, and for a lot of other companies that borrowed too much, is that last week's rosy market scenario will turn out to be accurate.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A Direct Hit on the Pessimists

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
One thing the intensive air attacks on Iraq did last week was knock out the war pessimists. Money managers and analysts who had worried that a war would not go well, even at the beginning, were transformed by the success the United States and its allies had in the air. Even the Iraqi attack on Israel on the second day of fighting did not significantly undermine this confidence, as reflected in the rise in stock markets in Japan and the United States Friday and the relatively small declines in Europe.
"I stand agog at what has gone on in the markets," said David Roche, an international strategist, referring to the worldwide rallies in markets Thursday, just hours after the bombing of Iraq began. 
 The main market indexes in Germany and France jumped record amounts. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose more than 1,000 points, or 4.47 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 114.60, or more than 4.5 percent, the largest one-day point gain since just after the 1987 market crash.
 "I was wrong because I assumed that Saddam Hussein was more efficient," said Mr. Roche, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company in London. "I went wrong militarily."
Investors counting on a negative reaction to the opening of hostilities were disappointed, showing that conventional wisdom can lead one astray. Because stocks did not fall with the start of fighting, those who had hoped to buy on a decline lost out. Indeed, the rallies were so strong and rapid, it was difficult to buy at all.
There were rude surprises in other markets, too. Gold, which was around $400 an ounce before the fighting started Wednesday night, jumped quickly to $410 to $412. But then it fell a near-record $30 Thursday and ended Friday at $374.20 on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
And as the week ended, the dollar continued to sag; by Friday it was worth less than 1.50 marks, a decline of 3 percent since the war began. There was no boost from the fighting, as many had thought there would be, partly because the battle went so well so soon. This defiance of consensus expectations is a good reminder of the weak economic fundamentals underlying the American currency.
But success so far in the war has not done much to change the opinions of pessimists and optimists on the underlying outlook for the world economy -- and the stock and bond markets that feed on its performance. As with the dollar, the fighting has not changed the need to remember the economic fundamentals still in play. Some of the problems that the world's economies and markets are facing -- including recessions marked by a dearth of consumer confidence -- can be alleviated by a quick war but aggravated by a protracted one.
Nor does the success so far of the United States-led coalition eliminate the chance for major setbacks. More attacks on Israel are possible, as well as Israeli retaliation against Iraq. And the ground fighting, which is still ahead, could get quite bloody.
The optimists, like Roger Palmer, the overall strategist at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, believe that even with some setbacks, the markets will not fall that sharply. The reason: an abundance of investors who missed the Thursday rally, many of who will scramble to get in when there are downward corrections.
"Having already missed the boat, they will be keen not to miss it again," Mr. Palmer said. This is why the declines in Europe on Friday were so slight, he added.
The optimists also argue that the underlying outlook for markets around the world is not that bad. They say a quick war -- of which they are much more confident now -- will bring down oil prices, revive consumer confidence and insure that the slowdown in Continental Europe and Japan and the recessions in the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia will not be prolonged.
But others, including Mr. Roche and Heinz Hockmann, managing director at Commerz International Capital Management in Frankfurt, are still pessimistic about the economy, even if less so about the war. While a decline in oil prices and interest rates would help struggling economies, they point to problems in the banking systems in the United States and Japan, the general shortage of capital and the deterioration of both the Government and economy in the Soviet Union. These problems, they say, cast a long shadow over the world's economy, notwithstanding a good outcome in the war.
"There is more mood than real economic activity behind this," Mr. Hockmann said of last week's rally. "We do not see the need to jump on the train."
Another reason to question boarding is the impact of the rally itself. The sharp rises have made some markets that were good values a little overpriced.
"Yesterday, I would have said France," said Martin Paling, international investment strategist at James Capel Ltd. in London, when asked on Thursday about a market that was cheap. "But after a 7 percent rise, it needs a correction." And Germany, which had fallen sharply this year, has quickly moved back into expensive territory.

HEADLINE: Food Shortages, Now Violence Make Soviet Investing Dicier

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
At the same time as war engulfs the Middle East, the Soviet Union continues to unravel both politically and economically. After five years, the democratic reforms and economic liberalization initiated by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev seem to be backfiring, threatening, among other things, the future of thousands of joint-venture plans between Western and Soviet enterprises, only a small fraction of which are in place.
Last month, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Schevardnadze resigned, expressing fears that the country was moving toward dictatorship. A week ago, Soviet troops moved tanks and machine guns into Lithuania, killing 15 demonstrators among the thousands demanding independence for the republic. The violence touched off protests throughout the country and around the world. Despite roadblocks, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians, Poles and Byelorussians walked to Vilnius later in the week to attend the funerals of the demonstrators and quietly protest Moscow's rule. To surpress criticism of his administration for its actions in Lithuania, President Gorbachev advocated suspending a law that guarantees a free press. The White House said the Soviet Army's actions threatened next month's summit meeting between the two heads of state. 
 Boris N. Yeltsin, the popular president of Russia, the largest and wealthiest of the republics, continues to challenge Mr. Gorbachev's leadership. At Mr. Yeltsin's urging, the Russian Parliament voted last month to reduce by 90 percent its payments to the Soviet central government, threatening the government with bankruptcy.
"The entire distribution system has broken down," said Charles Hugel, a former chairman of Asea Brown Boveri Inc.
In most cities, consumer goods are nonexistent and, despite a record harvest, food is scarce. The United States has extended $1 billion worth of credits to help the Soviet Union buy American grain, but many analysts predict even this will not be enough to stave off starvation.
The problem, according to Arthur Hartman, a former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, is that those opposed to reform have deliberately brought about the disintegration of the society.
What has happened to the Soviet Union and where is it headed? Five experts present their views.

 
 
JUDY SHELDON
Research fellow, the Hoover Institution; author of "The Coming Soviet Crash"
 The Soviet Union is now on the verge of civil war and Western investors will get burned. They are in the same position as they were just before the Bolshevik revolution. Then, France had one-quarter of its foreign investment in Russia. It lost it all. Countries that are now overinvested in the Soviet Union could be in a similar situation.
We will continue to see more sporadic incidents of violence in Lithuania, Georgia and the Ukraine and more people will get killed. It will be calculated violence that will be used in an attempt to quash the independence movement. But there is no way President Gorbachev can cow the people back into the old system.
Mr. Gorbachev is like Moses -- able to lead the people out of Egypt but not into the promised land. Unlike Moses, he won't step down voluntarily. But he can't remain. I wouldn't say that there will be anything as dramatic as an assassination, but perhaps the People's Deputies will remove him. In any event, he will be phased out. I can't imagine this situation going unresolved for another six to nine months.
At the same time, the economy is absolutely falling apart. The one who is causing most of it is Mr. Yeltsin of the Russian republic. He is saying that when push comes to shove, his territory is Russia. He is creating a pattern will be followed by the other republics, which will also say that they don't have to share their wealth with Moscow. As a result, revenues to Moscow will fall off, causing the union to disintigrate. It will go bankrupt.
In eight to 10 years, there will be a federation of republics. In terms of a model, Canada would be a good choice. But this will come after the republics really understand what they have to gain by coming together.
 
ANTHONY M. SOLOMON
Institute for East-West Security Studies, in New York City.

I am convinced that President Gorbachev has lost his maneuvering room because of the actions at Vilnius. He can no longer go back and forth between the economic reformers and the conservatives. He is now locked into the conservatives, the military and the K.G.B. The implications are that there will not be any more economic reform from Mr. Gorbachev.
From now on, the only way there will be any meaningful reform is from Mr. Yeltsin and the heads of other republics as they confront Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Yeltsin is vigorously supporting the Baltics. He could even call for civil disobedience. He has cards he can play and he may be able to organize the other republics to go along with him.
Will the new repression be able to intimidate all 15 republics? In the short run -- a few months or even years -- yes, it will. But in the long run, you can't intimidate 290 million people. Especially as the economic situation goes to pot with a 5 percent drop in national income this year after a 4 percent drop last year.
If you look at economic reform in the Soviet Union, you see that much of it has been divorced from reality anyway. For example, there has been a big bank reform, which looks reasonable on paper. Although there is now a central bank, reform can't be meaningfully implemented as long as there is still a command-economy structure that subsidizes the losses of the large state-owned enterprises. By subsidizing losses, the Government has lost control of the money supply. For example, Izvestia, the Soviet newspaper, said that instead of a 60 billion ruble deficit in 1991, the Government would have a 250 billion ruble deficit. To pay for this, the Government can only increase the money supply. It has no other way to finance its deficit. This will add even more to inflation.
 
VLADIMIR KVINT
U.S.S.R. Professor of Political Economy; former professor in Moscow.
March will bring a drastic worsening of the economic situation in the Soviet Union because the last reserves of food will have been eaten. The cattle will have been slaughtered so there will be no meat. Hunger will make the political situation dramatically worse. President Gorbachev is now astride two beasts, the K.G.B. and the military. Western food aid will only go to feed those two beasts, it will not get to the people. I fear President Gorbachev's revolution will turn into a civil war.
The truth is that Mr. Gorbachev did not want to move to a market economy while the old economic system was still alive. Now the old system is dead, but there is no new one. The economy just can't produce. The army might force the people go to work, but it can't get them to do anything once there.
What makes me angry is that so many people are asking if Mr. Gorbachev gave the order to use tanks in Lithuania. He said he didn't know about it, but who else in the Soviet Union can give orders now? The Council of Ministers is practically abolished, the Prime Minister was in the hospital, the President's Council has been abolished and Alexander Yakovlev and and Mr. Schevardnadze, the main promoters of democracy on Gorbachev's team, are gone.
There is not a lot of hope for Western investment. The big Chevron joint venture is is largely in Kazakhstan, which is unstable. The Combustion Engineering and Occidental Petroleum projects were oriented to the decisions of the old centralized system and did not sufficiently take account of the independence movements of the individual republics. And Occidental didn't take into account the ecological catastrophes occurring in the region where it is located.
 
CHARLES HUGEL
National Foreign Trade Council; formerly with Asea Brown Boveri Inc.
 It has been evident in the last year that the country has lost its command structure, so it is possible that the troops could have killed the demonstrators in Lithuania without President Gorbachev's knowledge. With the command structure gone, the country is moving to a state of anarchy. But although people are concerned about a civil war, I can't see it happening. The people there are not armed. They have no organization and nothing to pull them together. They just don't have the ability to wage war. I also don't think starvation will occur. There is plenty of food. The problem is getting the food to the people; it is part of the anarchy.
The trend toward anarchy is what Mr. Gorbachev is trying to deal withnow. Making Valentin S. Pavlov the Prime Minister is a good sign for business. He is a trained financial person, knows Western markets and is a proponent of the market system. His son spent time in New York, working for a major bank. I think this says that the reforms are still on course; that the Soviet Union is still moving to become a market economy.
Mr. Schevernadze's replacement as Foreign Minister, Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, is also a positive sign. He knows the United States, because he was Ambassador here and has lived here. His appointment says to me that Mr. Gorbachev is concerned with the way the United States views him. I think Mr. Gorbachev will remain in power.
What the loss of a command structure means for business is that you can't get decisions that were made in Moscow carried out in the republics. The Soviet Unionwas never an easy place to do business, and these events haven't made it any easier. But it has enormous wealth. The people that run it just don't know how to run businesses. I think they are going to make it, but it will take a long, long time -- 20 or 30 years.
 
ARTHUR HARTMAN

The events in Lithuania signal quite a reactionary step backwards. The picture emerging is one of a reassertion of authority by the old elements that have been against change, those who have been in charge of the command system have now returned to stop all moves toward reform.
In addition, the reason for the poor performance of Mr. Gorbachev's reforms and for the disintegration of the economic system is that the old guard -- the bureaucrats -- fought back deliberately against the reforms in an alliance with the K.G.B. and the military.
The Soviet Union may be on the brink of civil war with the military authorities who have attempted to set up nonexistent reasons for intervention similar to the reasons they gave for intervening in Hungary and Czechoslovakia a generation ago. This is not a static situation, however. The bureaucrats have been entrenched since before the Bolshevik revolution. It was too much to hope they would be driven out in one leap.
But I am heartened by a couple of things. Some of the elected representatives in parliament are reform minded. I don't think they will go back home and do nothing.
There are also some new institutions like the Council of Nations, made up of the presidents of the republics. Most significant is that Mr. Yeltsin has spoken out against the Baltic problems and called on Russian troops in the Soviet Army in the Baltics to disobey their orders. Outside of Moscow, people are taking seriously the words used in the reform legislation. They are beginning the privatization process and forming cooperatives. They would like to take over gas and oil and the country's biggest paper plant -- something too big for them, but it is heartening.

WAR IN THE GULF
 
Why Can't America Make a VCR to Match Its F-117?
 
Radar-jamming F4-G Wild Weasels carrying antiradiation missiles disrupted Iraqi defenses Wednesday night. As F-117 stealth fighters led the attack, the skies were initially all theirs. The first reports indicated that America's technological superiority was manifest. So why can't the United States make the world's best VCR's? Or subcompact cars? Scholars say the nation's military sophistication at best leaves its economic competitiveness unharmed. "Defense needs are not the same as civilian needs in most industries," said Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School in his recent book. Defense products can sometimes serve other ends; the first military jet transport evolved into the Boeing 707. But sometimes, he said, military contracts merely blunt healthy business competition. Paul Kennedy, a Yale historian, goes further, saying that the nation's military responsibilities are eroding its economic advantages. "Rome fell; Babylon fell; Scarsdale's turn will come," he said. Only the week before last, the Pentagon canceled a $57 billion program to build a new Navy attack plane when the ultimate cost appeared far greater than Scarsdale and the rest of the nation can afford.

Traders in Battle
 
American traders were as awesomely prepared as the military for war in the Middle East: all set for a furious aerial battle, the destruction of Saudi oil refineries and panic buying of oil. They had pored over tables showing that when war breaks out, investors dump stocks. And so, when American jets flew virtually unopposed Wednesday night and the Saudis initially escaped with damage to a single storage tank, traders were able to change course faster than F-15's. On Thursday, the Dow climbed 114.60 points on heavy volume, the second-best day ever. Oil futures dropped by more than $10 a barrel in a day, then, on Friday, fell by $2.19, to $19.25. And yet, the euphoria may prove fleeting; William H. Donaldson, the New York Stock Exchange Chairman, warned investors against acting in haste.

Oil Companies React to War
 
The oil companies responded to the American assault with their own patriotic proclamations. Terrified of seeming to profiteer from a war, they announced wholesale price freezes and restricted deliveries of gasoline. Then oil prices fell. Companies quickly rewrote their press releases to define the frozen price levels as ceilings.
 
CNN's Coup
 
Gen. Colin L. Powell tuned in to CNN for the latest from Baghdad, and Tom Brokaw interviewed one of its correspondents when NBC's own line to Iraq went dead. On Wednesday night the network scored its highest ratings ever, with 11 million homes tuning in. Gripping accounts of the attack on Baghdad from the only three reporters able to stay on the air throughout the evening gave CNN an audience in a class with the three broadcast networks for the first time. As the networks economize, CNN boasts of its advantage in covering crises abroad. Ted Turner's challenge has been to keep everyone watching once trouble subsides.
 
Several television advertisers pulled their commercials off the air during war coverage last week. Some said that the upbeat news so far was encouraging them to return.
 
A Damper on Airlines
 
Nothing is worse for airlines than higher fuel prices and a recession. The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, lost $215.1 million in the fourth quarter, its worst quarterly loss ever. The UAL Corporation, which runs United Airlines, also expects to report its worst quarter. And the fuel costs contributed to the shutdown of Eastern Airlines. International airlines said the war had caused some cancellations, but domestic lines saw little difference. Airline executives hope that last week's plunge in oil prices will bring them relief.
 
Meanwhile . . . in Lithuania
 
With the United States and Western Europe preoccupied in the Middle East, the Soviet Army assaulted Lithuanian patriots last week. Tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled through a crowd to seize the republic's broadcasting tower. James H. Giffen, chairman of the Mercator Corporation, said the underlying issues concern control of Soviet property, tax revenues and lawmaking. He spoke of having to negotiate a Soviet oil-drilling agreement with four agencies where, in the old days, one would do. "Am I distressed by it as an investor? Yes," he said. He expects business conditions to improve when an All-Union agreement is signed, but few other analysts are as optimistic.
 
 
 
COMPANIES


Last Flight at Eastern
 
Eastern Airlines shut down at midnight Friday, the victim of labor strife, disaffected travelers, fuel costs and leverage. Founded in 1928, the airline was the favorite ticket for millions of pallid Northerners seeking to bask in the Florida or Caribbean sun. Eastern has struggled to turn a profit since filing for bankruptcy protection almost two years ago in the grip of a strike. About 5,000 of 18,000 employees face immediate dismissal. Assets to be sold include 190 planes and some routes that rivals covet. But travelers are bound to emerge happier than unsecured creditors. The court has set aside $50 million to reimburse holders of Eastern tickets.
 
A Difficult Time for Banks
 
Thomas H. Hanley, a managing director at Salomon Brothers, has analyzed the banking industry for 24 years, but the fourth quarter of 1990 shocked him. "I've never seen anything like it," he said. "It's probably the most difficult quarter during the entire postwar era." For most banks, the only question was whether earnings and bad loans were as awful as expected, or worse. Citicorp had already predicted large losses, but Manufacturers Hanover had seemed relatively safe from real estate woes. A few of the strongest banks, like J.P. Morgan and BankAmerica, had stronger earnings, and lower interest rates helped many banks improve their margins. But analysts say there is no end to bank losses in sight.
 
I.B.M. Beats the Recession
 
The International Business Machines Corporation defied the recession by reporting higher earnings and revenues in the fourth quarter. Net income rose fourfold to $2.46 billion, from a final quarter a year ago that included heavy charges for cutting the work force. The company's operating income still rose 16.1 percent. I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, cautioned that global uncertainties lie ahead.
 
Bankruptcy's Yield
 
Truth in labeling comes to Wall Street: Bear, Stearns & Company announced the creation last week of a new, merged department of bankruptcy and high-yield trading and sales. "What can I tell you?" said a Bear Stearns representative. "Bankruptcy and high yield seem to have something to do with each other." The new department's two leaders have the right experience. Nancy Havens-Hasty made a well-timed move in 1987 from the firm's risk arbitrage department to its bankruptcy group, and Donald Mullen was a managing director at Salomon Brothers in high-yield sales.
 
At Oxy, No Sacred Cattle
 
Ray R. Irani wants everyone to know that all the changes he plans at the Occidental Petroleum Corporation are no reflection on the Armand Hammer legacy. Circumstances change, Mr. Irania said. And so he christened "the new Oxy" -- his words -- last week. He intends to concentrate on oil and chemicals, sell $3 billion in assets, take a $2 billion charge against earnings and cut the dividend from $2.50 to $1 a share. It so happens that many of the money-losing businesses up for sale were Dr. Hammer's favorites, among them a Soviet petrochemical project, Chinese coal mining, Arabian horses, Black Angus cattle and the film production company whose perennial star was Dr. Hammer himself.
 
Daily News's Future Dims
 
The Daily News threatened on Wednesday to close or seek a buyer by early April unless it stems losses that it says are running at $1 million a day. The announcement gave the newspaper's nine striking unions a choice of signing new, cost-cutting contracts or facing the permanent loss of jobs. The Tribune Company, the corporate parent, demands as much as $70 million in labor cuts and the right to make future changes in work rules without having to bargain. Miscalculations may have brought The News to this point. Tribune executives did not sell the newspaper when it still had a circulation of 1.1 million and loyal advertisers; union concessions would make it far more valuable, they figured. Now at least half the readers, most of the advertisers and probably most potential buyers have deserted. Only a pile of unfunded liabilities remains.

 
 
THE ECONOMY


Few Inflation Fears
 
Was anyone fretting last week about the highest annual inflation rate since 1981? Certainly not most economists, and probably not the Fed. True, the 6.1 percent increase in consumer prices for 1990, up from 4.6 percent in 1989, could not be attributed entirely to the cost of oil. "We still have some problems," said Joseph A. Wahed, senior economist at Wells Fargo. "Service costs are high. Medical costs are high." But the raging price increases of a few months ago have quieted, leaving December's index just three-tenths of 1 percent higher than in November. Inflation seems so much less of a threat than continued recession that those close to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said he has wanted to lower interest rates faster all along, but those pesky presidents of the Fed's regional banks would not let him. Mr. Greenspan has made no apologies; he reportedly said last week that lower oil prices and interest rates could help ease the recession.
In Brief
 
The White House plans to ask Congress for an additional $80 billion to rescue 225 more failing savings and loan institutions. Legislators reacted sceptically. By next month, the Government expects to exhaust the $50 billion bailout fund set aside last year.

U.S. Technology Won't Win the War

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
The sophisiticated war equipment fashioned by military contractors may not be enough to win a war in the Persian Gulf, according to Steven L. Canby, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. Mr. Canby, a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University, contends that the American military has spent too much on technology and paid too little attention to strategy. Currently an adjunct professor of national security studies at Georgetown University, he spoke about the cost of a gulf war with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times. 
 Question. Can you assess the cost of a gulf war?
Answer. The cost of the war depends on the strategy. If we had stayed with a blockade, the costs would be very low. The main costs are the additional or incremental costs, since the basic costs, like the soldiers' salaries, are paid whether or not there is war. The incremental costs are largely the cost of ammunition, the costs of moving troops, maintaining supplies, the cost of extra training and the cost of mobilizing reserves.
The estimates of these costs are arrived at this way: If there were a war in Europe, these incremental costs would be about $4 billion a day. This war will be smaller, so the estimates are that it will cost between $1 billion and $2 billion a day should fighting start. This will be averaged over the length of the fighting.
But this estimate does not include the cost of the consumables. It does not include the cost of lost equipment or lost aircraft. For example, an F-15 jet costs between $40 million and $50 million depending on how it's equipped. At this price, during war, it won't take long before total costs are several billion dollars a day.
The loss rate for equipment is very heavy. In the first few days of the last Arab-Israeli war, hundreds of tanks and airplanes were lost. There was a very high equipment cost almost at once.
If the war is short -- and everything works -- it could be a big boost to the economy. America will be seen as great. The Taiwanese, who have been withdrawing their money from our banks for a long time, will put that money back. But if we get bogged down, it will be a big negative.
Q. America is banking on its superior technology to win. Why are you doubtful about this strategy?
A. The technology is overrated. What people forget is that most of the money has gone into the Air Force and Navy, where we are already overwhelmingly superior. It hasn't gone into new technology for ground forces. I don't think our ground forces are that superior to Iraq's when it comes to technology. We do have lots of gadgets, but in basic weapons, we're not so superior.
For example, we're inferior in artillery and our infantry weapons are roughly equivalent. We have a better tank, but the M1 is a real gas guzzler. It has wonderful electronics, but it burns so much fuel that it doesn't have much reach. And it doesn't have a bulldozer blade up front and that's a great limitation in the desert. It can't scoot into position.
The Navy has real superiority, but much of it is irrelevant. The aircraft carriers are in the Gulf of Oman and in the Red Sea, far from Iraq. The airplanes they launch have to be refueled in the air to go into battle. This limits the number of sorties.
The Air Force has problems of interdiction. Its planes are vulnerable to shoulder-held missiles and other relatively simple air defense systems. We have overwhelming air superiority, but do we use those hyper-expensive airplanes to go after trucks in the desert?
Q. Is the problem with the weapons or how they are used?
A. The problem is with how the forces are deployed. Most of the information I have says that the forces can only make a frontal attack and a shallow left hook, or flanking attack. But in this situation, that's a trap.
As long as Iraq's Republican Guards, which are its best troops, are concentrated in Basra, Saddam Hussein has a very powerful force for us to overcome in Kuwait. With that force there, we're making a mistake by attacking frontally. If we do, which seems to be the plan, we play into Saddam's hands. Superior technology and all the money we spent won't matter.
Q. Is this what the Iraqis are betting on?
A. I think Saddam Hussein came to the conclusion we would back down because our troops are headed for his most heavily defended areas. He concluded our use of ground forces is not credible.
Q. But doesn't most of the analysis say the fighting will be primarily in the air?
A. The American plan seems to have three phases: First, lots of airpower to take out the Scud missiles. I think that our forces will be successful there, but winning air superiority will not be that easy or inexpensive. A lot of planes will be lost.
The second phase is the heavy use of airpower and battle ships. There is the hope that this bombardment will destroy Iraq's fortifications for a later infantry attack.
The final phase is an infantry attack on Kuwait. But what the Israelis found out very painfully is that when Arab troops were attacked frontally, they performed well. The Israelis learned they had to attack from behind to get the Arab troops out of their positions. In the field, the Arab troops panic. But our plan is to make frontal attacks.
Q. But if the first phases are successful, won't the other parts of the plan fall into place?
A. The issue is really strategy, generalship and diplomacy. The proper way to undertake this war would be to have American and Turkish troops in Turkey. From there they would threaten Baghdad. Troops from Syria could also threaten Baghdad.
That would draw the Republican Guards out of Basra and Kuwait to defend Baghdad. It would make Iraq's best troops vulnerable to air attack as they went back to Baghdad, which would play into our strengths. It would shift the center of gravity of the fighting.
But you can't do this because the Turks won't allow it. My understanding is the Turks -- as a price for entering into this fight and for allowing American troops to attack from the north -- wanted to be able to join the European Community. But Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's Foreign Minister, doesn't want the Turks in the Community. As a result, the Turks haven't been persuaded to allow our troops to pose a threat from their soil, which would give them a strategic advantage. That has nothing to do with technology.

A Buick Show Car Takes to the Road

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
Think luxury cars today and you'll probably think imports. Mercedes-Benz. BMW. Lexus. Infiniti. You might even think Lincoln or Cadillac, but you probably wouldn't think Buick.
A big part of that, no doubt, is the pinch-penny philosophy that led General Motors to homogenize its cars in the 80's, building Buicks on the same line with Chevys and using parts from the same bins. Certainly, the lack of distinctive design hurt Cadillac, an insult to "The Standard of the World" that has only recently been redressed. 
 But G.M.'s thinking has changed up and down the line, and Buick's Park Avenue Ultra is just the latest in a series of good examples. It is also likely to put Buick back where it once was, as Middle America's aspiration.
The Park Avenue is that rare bird, a designer's toy that grew full feathers as a production model. Fresh out of the egg, the Buick was called "Essence," and it made the tour of the auto shows back in 1989, a concept car dressed in exquisite blue green paint.
In more conservative hue (dark metallic blue, in the case of the tester), it has taken to the road as a front-drive four-door sedan, sleek, polished, full of high-tech and very pleasant indeed.
For '91, the Electra nameplate has been dropped, and the Park Avenue Ultra is Buick's flagship. It is moderately big, eight inches longer than its predecessor, and the extra space has been added to the rounded trunk. Roundness is, in fact, everywhere, and the combination of shape and flush glass has produced a thoroughly aerodynamic .31 coefficient of drag.
In addition, the body's structure has been redesigned and strengthened, both for safety and a feeling of solidity. To that end, the number of parts required to build the car has been reduced by 25 percent, and the company calls it the quietest and smoothest sedan Buick has ever offered.
Inside, our car had blue leather and -- surprisingly for a Buick -- full instrumentation, including a 7,000-r.p.m. tachometer. There was a 200-watt sound system with built-in compact-disk player, and the radio actually was easy to tune. That's because G.M., unlike most other manufacturers, has had the good sense to keep knobs on its radios instead of hard-to-use arrow switches. Compliments to the chef.
On the other hand, the Buick has rear windows that go down less than half way, and that is inexcusable in a car this size. And then there is the silly bin in the armrest between the front seats, the one made to hold tape cassettes. In a car that has only a CD player, it sort of makes one wonder.
But there are thoughtful touches, too: a cupholder and place for toll change, a good big ashtray, six-way power seats with memory, and dual temperature controls so driver and front-seat passenger can tailor two sorts of climate.
In fact, ambient comfort has been given a lot of attention in the Park Avenue, and "solar-control" glass makes its debut all round. The glass reduces solar heat by as much as 30 percent, and it cuts ultraviolet rays by almost half.
What that means is a more comfortable interior, increased efficiency for the air-conditioner and longer life for interior materials. And, just to make sure everything stays cozy, twin sun sensors on the dash compensate for interior warming and automatically maintain the temperatures selected by driver and front-seat passenger.
For safety, there is an air bag in the hub of the leather-wrapped wheel, and antilock brakes are standard. But there is further technostuff, including an oil-life monitor to help a driver cope in these days of self-service gas stations.
The monitor measures engine temperature, average revolutions per minute and vehicle speed, then calculates the projected life of the oil and tells the driver when to change it. Control of the new four-speed automatic transmission also is handled by electronics, with shift points figured out for smoothness by the same computer that manages the 3.8-liter V6.
The engine, mounted transversely, puts out 170 horsepower, sufficient to propel the 3,662-pound boulevardier to 60 miles an hour in about 9.5 seconds. That is comfortably quick, and it is enough to get you safely off the ramp and onto the highway, even if it won't win many drag races.
But Buick buyers won't care about that. What they will care about is the gas they can save, with economy rated at 18, city, and 27, highway. They will care about the pretty face, about the appointments and about the silky ride.
In fact, there is only one thing missing. With a sticker of about $29,000, you don't get to pay the new luxury tax.

HEADLINE: The War Machine Drives U.S. Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Michael Boskin, now acknowledges that "after the longest economic expansion in the peacetime history of the United States, the country probably has entered a recession" (Business Day, Jan. 3).
The first part of that statement, referring to the 93-month-long upswing that began in November 1982, represents another neoconservative effort to rewrite history. It has been uncritically accepted by many, including your own economics reporters (see, for instance, "Why It's Too Soon to Predict Another Great Depression," The Week in Review, Nov. 11, 1990, and "Leading Indicators in 5th Drop: 1.2% November Fall Suggests No Early End to Downturn," Business Day, Dec. 29).
Dropped from sight in this version of history is the record-setting 105-month expansion of February 1961 to November 1969. Escalation of the Vietnam War took place during the last half. What counts for economic purposes, however, is not whether warfare is being waged, but the degree to which military spending is stimulating the economy.
During the first half of the expansion of the 1960's, the military spending share of the gross national product actually fell, from 9 percent in 1961 to 7.2 percent in 1965. By contrast, the first half of the 1980's upswing was powerfully assisted by the Reagan Administration's $2.2 trillion military buildup. The military proportion of gross national product rose steadily, from 5.3 percent when President Reagan took office, to a peak of 6.7 percent in mid-1986.
If the expansion of the 1960's was prolonged by Vietnam outlays, as was certainly the case, it must also be noted that the expansion of the 1980's would have begun later than November 1982 in the absence of Mr. Reagan's ballooning military budgets. From July 1981 to November 1982 the United States economy was going through one of its two deepest post-World War II recessions to date, with unemployment reaching 10.8 percent and fixed business investment declining 15 percent. During these months only military spending was growing rapidly.

HEADLINE: The Needs of the Old And the Young

 BODY:
The "Tenafly Journal" on Dec. 2 describes the admirable achievements of Tenafly's elderly residents in raising $190,000 in public and private funds to enhance their senior center. Their efforts as well as the generosity and assistance of the entire community are to be commended.
But it is somewhat ironic that many of these same residents (who reached out to their neighbors for help) have utilized the same unceasing energy, time and skills to defeat Tenafly's school budgets, wrestle control of the school board and wage a battle to cut numerous worthwhile programs that are directed toward the town's youngest citizens.
It is unfortunate that in these uncertain economic times Tenafly's elderly residents have sometimes failed to recognize that a civilized society must have a social pact between the generations. Just as the entire community rallied behind the elderly in their effort to enrich their later years, one would hope that they could provide a more positive influence in supporting the schools and the children.

HEADLINE: Newly Militant Indians in Ecuador Unnerve Propertied Class

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Looking forward to the 500th anniversary of Spain's discovery of the Americas, Ecuador's increasingly militant Indians say they wish that Christopher Columbus never left home.
"Five hundred years of oppression, five hundred years of resistance," is a popular slogan among Indians here, for whom the 1992 anniversary has suddenly become a catalyst for redressing centuries of European colonization. Across Latin America, Indian and black groups are drawing plans to protest anniversary celebrations.
Indian peasants have started to unnerve the largely white owners of Ecuador's large farming estates by rallying under banners reading: "Not one plantation left by 1992."
 
Part of the Landscape
 For centuries, Ecuador's European and mixed-race ruling classes took the Indians for granted as a passive part of the rural landscape -- men in ponchos and felt hats and women in woven skirts and braids toiling stoically on mountainside fields.
But last June, all that changed with what everyone here refers to now as simply "the uprising."
Up and down Ecuador's central Andean spine, a million Indians rose up in peaceful protest. For almost one week in early June, Indians barricaded highways with trees and occupied churches and estates.
"The country was turned upside down," said Benjamin Ortiz, editor of a Quito newspaper, Hoy. "We had always ignored the indigenous population. It was like the United States in the 1950's when blacks suddenly became visible."
 
Presented List of Demands
 To the shock of Ecuador's establishment, leaders of the nation's 10 Indian tribal groups presented a series of demands. The list included distribution of estate lands, official recognition of Ecuador as a multinational country, Indian control over archeological sites, Government money for bilingual education and research of traditional Indian medicine, and the expulsion of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, an American Baptist evangelical group accused by many Indians here of destroying traditional culture.
Negotiations have sputtered on and off for the last six months. Nex week, they are to resume.
Indian leaders were outraged by the Government's inital reaction -- that foreign agitators and Marxist priests stirred up the nation's traditionally docile Indian population.
"Whoever says that does not believe in the capacity of the indigenous movement and maintains a 17th-century mentality," said Luis Macas, a Quechua who is president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador.
 
Number of Indians Disputed
 In an interview, Mr. Macas estimated that 45 percent of Ecuador's 11 million people are Indians. His opponents put the figure at 10 percent. Last November the confederation carried out an Indian boycott of Ecuador's once-a-decade census.
Independent analysts attribute the sudden emergence of the indigenous movment to a constellation of factors: Ecuador's economic stagnation in the 1980's, which dried up Indian job prospects in the cities; growing demographic pressure in what already is South America's most densely populated country, and the increasingly pro-Indian stand of the Roman Catholic Church.
"Some of the bishops are agitators, the priests are Marxists," said Ruben Espinosa Roman, a dairy farmer who is manager of the Association of Highland and Eastern Ranchers.
Mr. Espinosa, one of the Indian movement's most vocal opponents, produced a 35-page report documenting Catholic church support for the Indian uprising -- use of radio stations, parish halls and the celebration of solidarity masses.
 
Land Is the Issue
 At the heart of Ecuador's sharpening clash is real estate, and different cultural attitudes toward land.
Mr. Espinosa and his 5,000-member association argue that a distribution of estate land to peasants in 1964 crippled food production. Today, he says, most of Ecuador's food production comes from a third of the nation's arable land that remains in the hands of private farmers with estates larger than 50 acres.
He argues that Ecuador would be forced to import food if land distribution advocates have their way with the 18 percent of the nation's arable land that is now in estates of more than 250 acres.
Simon Bustamante Cardenas, president of the ranchers' association, wrote recently: "If we admit to an indigenous population of 1.2 million people and we proceed with a big, new distribution of arable land, we would have an eloquent result: one hectare per Indian and hunger for everyone, especially for the cities."
 
'Destroyed Our Culture'
 The Indian confederation, which represents the 10 Indian groups, argues that its ancestral lands have been usurped by European colonialism.
"The colonizers ignored the relationship between the Indians and their land," they said in a statement read last July at a meeting here of Indian groups from across the continent. "The European invasion destroyed our cultures."
Mr. Macas said that crop totals fell after the 1964 land distribution because Indians received arid, poorly irrigated land and because the Government did not follow through with low-interest credit, education and agricultural extension services.
Frustrated by years of fruitless legal action, Indian communities are currently threatening to take over "unused" land on about 60 estates. To defuse the pressure, the Catholic Church announced in November that it was starting an Indian land fund by buying at a steep discount $28 million in Ecuadorean foreign debt titles. The Government is to redeem the titles in local currency at a moderate discount.
 
Violence Is Feared
 Although Ecuador, an oil-exporting nation, earned an extra $270 million from higher oil prices in the last half of 1990, the Government has shown little interest in using the oil windfall to buy farm land for Indians.
Indeed, in a continent where racial politics are often played out with guns, many people fear that violence may erupt in this generally peaceful nation.
Peru, Ecuador's southern neighbor, is racked by the Shining Path, a guerrilla group that draws its recruits largely from the nation's Quechua and mixed-race population. To the north, peace talks in Colombia appear to be leading Quintin Lame, an Indian-based guerrilla group, to disarm after years of action.
In the Andean highlands here, landowners have started hiring private guards and military commanders have said that they will not allow a second mass protest to stop the nation's road traffic for a week.
"For the first time, the landowners in the highlands are arming," warned Elsie Monge, coordinator here of the Ecumenical Commission for Human Rights. "Another uprising would not be peaceful."

HEADLINE: Chinese Dissident Relives the 1989 Massacre

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Jan. 15

 BODY:
In the 18 months since the Chinese Government crushed the democracy movement that she helped lead, Chai Ling has tried to put the memory of the tanks rumbling through Tiananmen Square behind her.
But the news that Beijing recently sentenced a group of her fellow students to prison for the protests -- and planned to put more on trial -- has rekindled for Ms. Chai painful images of the night of June 3-4, 1989, forcing her to confront suppressed emotions of frustration, rage and guilt. 
 "It has all come back to me with the trials," she said in an interview on the Princeton University campus.
Ms. Chai, who was a psychology major at Beijing University when she became one of the principal leaders of the protests, went into hiding after the crackdown, in which hundreds of people were killed. She then avoided arrest for 10 months before escaping to France.
She moved to the United States last fall and has settled in Princeton, where she is a visiting scholar in a program that has attracted more than 20 other prominent Chinese dissidents and intellectuals.
She has been working to keep alive the democracy movement by lobbying government officials around the world about the plight of the students imprisoned in China.
Ms. Chai, who is 24 years old, said that when she first learned of the trials, she was ashamed that she had evaded punishment while so many others had been caught or killed.
"I feel kind of guilty," she said in a soft voice, struggling to find the words in English. "We try our best, but we don't know how we can help them. Even when we do our best, we still feel very guilty."
 
Working on Autobiography
 Ms. Chai has begun work on an autobiography in which she hopes to vent some of the emotions that she has bottled up since the crackdown.
"I want to tell from my perspective what China is like, and why such a moment could happen," she said. "The key issue for the demonstrators was that people were used to being treated like slaves, and the people naturally wanted to become human beings, have equality, dignity and freedom."
She said that despite the continuing repression, she was optimistic that the political situation in China would improve.
"It has to get better, because the people have experienced 10 years of reform," she said, referring to the period before the protests, when the Chinese leadership gradually relaxed some political and economic control. "When you've tasted freedom, it's very difficult to go back."
Ms. Chai said she longed to return to China. But she remains on the Government's most wanted list, and she said she was certain that the moment she set foot in her homeland, she would be arrested and executed.
So she waits, assuming the identity of just another foreign student, a backpack over her shoulder as she bicycles to the library each morning.
But, she said, she knows that she can never again be just a student.
"In Buddhism, they think that when people die, they can change their life and be reborn," she said. "Sometimes, I feel I was reborn even during my lifetime. I feel a part of me really died during the massacre. My old life died. We buried our past."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Turkey;
Turkey's Role in Air Assault Sets Off Fear of Retaliation

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Turkey's decision to let its territory be used as a second front in the air war against Iraq has deeply divided the Muslim country, with many people worried that they now face retaliatory strikes.
The rally-round-the-flag consensus that almost always prevails here on important foreign-policy matters has broken down over President Turgut Ozal's aggressive anti-Iraq stance in the Persian Gulf war. 
 Mr. Ozal has his admirers, and some foreign diplomats said they sensed that support may be building for his argument that Turkey must play a war role to eliminate President Saddam Hussein and to share in any rewards from the hoped-for allied victory.
But opposition leaders and many influential commentators in the press have refused to close ranks with Mr. Ozal, accusing him of dragging Turkey into an unwanted war for personal glory or for potential national benefits that they dismiss as ephemeral.
 
Bombers on Turkish Bases
 Emin Colasan, a columnist for Hurriyet, a large Turkish daily, called Mr. Ozal "irresponsible" today, adding, "Who will shoulder the responsibility if Saddam's chemical and biological weapons explode over Turkey and thousands of our citizens face harm?"
Newspapers today published a poll taken by Mr. Ozal's governing Motherland Party that showed that 74 percent of those surveyed oppose Turkey's entry into the war.
Even the Government is obviously nervous about the bombing runs that American war planes have launched in the last three days, with official Turkish blessing, from the Incirlik air base near the southern city of Adana. It has not formally acknowledged that the raids are taking place, and there has been a news blackout about the subject on the state television and radio and by the more or less official press agency.
But diplomats here and reporters outside the Incirlik base said there was is no doubt that four bombing missions involving dozens of F-16, F-15 and F-111 fighters and bombers had struck at targets in northern Iraq. Presumably, they were trying to eliminate Iraqi missile launchers, but there has been no word about their degree of success.
 
Fear of Iraqi Missiles
 Like the Government, the United States Embassy has declined to discuss operations at Incirlik, where American strength is being shored up to include 96 war planes and new Patriot air-defense missiles.
There are also 42 German, Belgian and Italian planes stationed in eastern Turkey, but they are there only as a NATO tripwire in case Turkey, a member of the Atlantic alliance, is attacked by Iraq. The other 15 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization affirmed this week that they would come to Turkey's defense if Iraq attacked.
Although it effectively has turned its bases over the United States, the Government insists that Turkish forces have not entered the war, and will not unless Iraq attacks. But critics say giving the Americans free rein at those installations amounts to a first strike by Turkey, handing Iraq the justification to hit back.
Fears of Iraqi missiles have risen despite Government assurances that the chances of an attack are remote. The Iraqi missile assaults on Israel have not reassured Turks, and tens of thousands have fled their homes in southeastern regions near the border to seek temporary shelter elsewhere.
 
Jittery Ankara Shopkeepers
 Even in Ankara, about 500 miles from the frontier and presumably in no danger, there are reports of some people leaving town and of jittery shopkeepers closing their shutters.
In general, Turks tend to be nervous about roles in Middle East disputes. Since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920's, they have sought neutrality, achieving it conspicuously during the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran. They know that historically they are not loved by Arabs, and so they strive, sometimes almost painfully, to avoid any action that could smack, however slightly, of an offense.
That attitude is conspicuous within the military and foreign-policy establishments, two pillars of Turkish public life that feel it would not take much to bring out anti-Turkish resentments even though Ankara is on the same side as many Arab states in this crisis.
 
Despised Neighboring Despot
 Also, most Turks want to stay out of war, no matter where it may be. They recall that the Ottomans made the mistake of letting Germany pull them into World War I, only to wind up losing the war and their empire.
But Mr. Ozal's supporters reply that Turkey has to side with the West against Iraq, and also has a great deal to gain from being seen as a full partner on what they presume will be the winning side. The perceived benefits include removal of a despised neighboring despot, promises of new economic aid and military equipment from the United States and perhaps a seat at any postwar peace conference that will be held.
Mr. Ozal said in a television interview Friday night that his decisions in the crisis were not a gamble, as his opponents assert, but rather a "calculated risk."
"There is no profit without risk," he said.

HEADLINE: New York's Gordian Knot of Labor Talks, Layoffs and Pay Freezes

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
New York City's effort to get its fiscal house in order is particularly complicated because of the Dinkins administration's labor strategy of simultaneously trying to settle past, present and future contracts and ordering the first major layoffs in more than a decade.
Some financial monitors say this approach is piecemeal and short-sighted, but Mayor David N. Dinkins's aides say it is part of a broad plan to cope with extraordinary budget gaps. 
 The round-robin negotiations could last a year or more because of the multitude of unions, the shorter length of contracts and their staggered expiration dates. Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private monitoring group financed by business, said, "It's nonstop bargaining and nonstop budgeting."
Until the issues are resolved, the city faces labor tension and fiscal uncertainty. Wages and benefits constitute half of the city's $28 billion budget, so contract costs affect spending, work force size and service cuts.
 
Teamsters Authorize Strike
 Each step in the negotiating process is fraught with controversy because of contract relationships, competing unions and special circumstances.
For example, the teamsters last week authorized a strike of 8,500 Housing Authority workers, hoping to win raises bigger than those at other city agencies. The union argues that the authority's Federal financing exempts it from city budget constraints.
Mr. Dinkins instructed city negotiators to limit all raises to no more than the 1.5 percent increase allocated in this year's budget, unless outside revenues were available. So far, three unions have settled their contracts, all with raises exceeding 1.5 percent -- thanks to savings achieved by reducing the amount that the city contributes to pension funds and increasing the estimates of what the funds will earn.
But reliance on pension maneuvers provoked new problems, since different city agencies are covered by different pension funds and their potential savings vary.
 
Breaking With the Past
 Traditionally, the city has agreed on a contract with a lead union, setting a precedent for raises for other unions. The uniformed unions usually held out for a bit more. Contracts ran two or three years, giving budgetary stability. When they expired, the cycle began anew.
The Dinkins administration's bargaining broke with the past. On Oct. 1, the city settled with the United Federation of Teachers for a 5.8 percent raise in wages and benefits. On Jan. 2 Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees settled for less: a 3.5 percent wage increase for the first year of a 15-month contract, an additional 1 percent in the final three months and a 0.5 percent increase in benefits.
But the city has already gone back to the unions that it settled with, seeking contract concessions to save money and avert layoffs.
And still to be settled are 130 contracts with smaller but often crucial unions, including those of firefighters and police officers.
As the city's negotiators struggle to complete those contracts, the Mayor has set the stage for bargaining for labor agreements that will begin in the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. He declared a year's pay freeze. But Mr. Dinkins cannot unilaterally enforce such a freeze; the unions can seek a raise through arbitration.
 
'A Very Puzzling Process'
 While revising existing contracts, negotiating new ones and preparing for the next round of bargaining, the city is also negotiating procedures for laying off thousands of workers.
"It's a very puzzling process," said Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. "The most troublesome thing is the city has to come in with a credible financial plan because the city has to finance against it. An open-ended labor situation makes it very awkward. I don't how you put together a solid plan under these circumstances."
Similarly, Allen J. Proctor, director of the State Financial Control Board, which was set up in the 1970's to monitor the city's fiscal condition, said: "We're the guardians of long-term planning and orderly process. This bargaining round certainly makes long-term planning harder." He called for coalition bargaining, combining all unions, as was done in the 1970's fiscal crisis.
But the city's Labor Relations Commissioner, Eric J. Schmertz, defended the Mayor's policy: "What appeared to be short-term contracts are part of the game plan," Mr. Schmertz said. "We had this in mind all along. I'm now pleased it's beginning to unfurl, both fiscally and logically."
 
2-Year Arrangment
 The city achieved its goal in the contracts with the teachers, teamsters and District Council 37. It stuck to the 1.5 percent raise that comes from budgeted funds, Mr. Schmertz said. He said the new contracts are shorter than usual because the recession made revenue estimates unreliable. Succeeding forecasts have shown revenues dropping by hundreds of millions of dollars, justifying that caution and prompting Mr. Dinkins's pay-freeze declaration, which Mr. Schmertz said is not a ploy.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel described the shorter contracts, with the pay freeze to follow, as essentially a two-year arrangement that allows for very modest raises.
Recalculating the city's contribution to its pension funds to finance those raises both simplified and complicated matters.
For most city workers, who are covered by the New York City Employees Retirement System, the new contracts set an easy precedent. By reducing its contribution to the system, the city freed two percentage points to add to the workers' raise. The teachers, in a separate pension fund, added 2.5 points.
But the pension device threatens disparities for diverse groups ranging from managers to day-care workers.
The Managerial Employees Association has warned that it may sue to block the changes in the Employees Retirement System. Managers are covered by the fund, but since the Mayor has frozen their salaries, they would not be entitled to raises from the pension savings. The 7,000 day-care workers belong to a private pension fund that is unlikely to allow the city to reduce its pension contribution, said Robert W. McEnroe, director of District Council 1707 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
 
Pension Funds
 The pension issue also jeopardizes the historic pay parity among police, firefighters and correction officers, with wages for sanitation workers at 90 percent of those of the uniformed services.
Sanitation workers and correction officers, who are covered by the Employees Retirement System, expect to realize two percentage points of their raise from pension savings.
But the police and firefighters have different pension funds with less money. The police could find savings elsewhere, by prolonging the time that officers must serve to reach top pay. But the Fire Department is in the midst of a hiring freeze, so it could not save money in that way.
The president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, James J. Boyle, suggested that schedule revisions could yield savings for raises and that changed payroll deductions could increase take-home pay.
Economies at the Fire Department have fueled discontent among firefighters, leading Mr. Boyle to a terse analysis of the challenge facing the city and its unions: "It's a mess."

HEADLINE: Small Florida Community Has a Death in the Family

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI SPRINGS, Fla., Jan. 19

 BODY:
This small community cheek by jowl with the sprawling Eastern Airlines headquarters has long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the airline. It was Eastern, said James Stadnik, a local pharmacist and former Chamber of Commerce official, "which made everything possible."
So after the announcement on Friday that Eastern would cease operations, Mr. Stadnik, 73 years old, said it was like "losing a member of your family." While Miami Springs is not so completely dependent on Eastern as it was in the 30's and 40's, the imminent disappearance of the company cast a pall over the town. 
 In his own personal memorial today, Mr. Stadnik took a visitor through the Miami Springs Historical Society Museum on the second floor of his pharmacy, where pictures and documents extolled the town and Eastern's connections with it. There were photos of the stewardess training school that brought generations of young women to live here, and of the homes that some pilots built, as well as evidence of the civic and economic life they helped create.
 
'It's Been -- Like Family'
 "I remember the dedication of the headquarters complex in 1947 because I was president of the Chamber of Commerce and Captain Rickenbacker and I were on the dais together to make our speeches," Mr. Stadnik said, recalling the legendary aviator who was Eastern's longtime chief executive, Eddie Rickenbacker. "I told him I had to cut my speech short because that was also the day that my daughter was born. But that's the way it's been -- like family."
Eastern's demise will have an effect well beyond this town of 12,500. The news was perhaps the harshest reminder yet for the city of Miami and south Florida in general that an industry that helped fuel its own growth is seriously troubled. About 7,000 Eastern employees live in the area.
Martin Shugrue, the trustee appointed by the Federal bankruptcy court in New York in April to run the airline, said at a news conference today: "Regretfully this will be a blow to this fine community which has nurtured us. There are many already out of work in the region and there will now be more than before. There are local vendors and suppliers who will be affected also."
 
Closing Down the Airline
 Karen Ceremsac, Eastern's vice president for corporate communications, said 3,000 to 4,000 people nationwide would be kept on to oversee the closing of the airline, including several hundred in South Florida. Those numbers will decline rapidly as the liquidation is completed, she said.
Outside Eastern's headquarters on Northwest 36th Street in Miami picketers from the International Association of Machinists marched this morning.
Paul A. Dombroski, the secretary of Local 702, said that at its peak in 1972, Eastern employed 5,600 of the union's members.
The number had declined to 4,200 in March 1989 when the union went on strike. Now 2,400 members are still picketing and receiving strike benefits of $100 a week.
 
Will the Picketing End?
 It is not clear whether the picketing will continue, said Mr. Dombroski, who himself waxed a bit nostalgic as he talked about the airline and the union's salad days.
"In the 50's and 60's, if you were employed by Eastern you had the premier job with the premier airline in a good and growing industry," he said. "The salaries were good and so were the benefits. The bad part was that if you were black or Catholic or anything other that a southern white Baptist you couldn't get a union job there, but that changed."
Don Davidson, a 28-year pilot with Eastern who is now vice president of flight operations, recalled coming to the company in 1963 when "Miami and Eastern were synonymous -- It was an exciting place."
Last spring his 25-year-old son became an Eastern pilot and even then, he said, Eastern seemed an exciting place to be.
 
No New Slogans
 "It's difficult when it sets in that there is no tomorrow for Eastern," Captain Davidson said wistfully. "I find myself being the eternal optimist. We've operated under the slogan the 'New Eastern' for the last year. Why couldn't we keep on going and be the New, New Eastern?"
Vera Gray-Wagner, who now owns the Century 21 real estate agency in Miami Springs, worked full time in the airline industry until last year as a purser for Pan American World Airways, said Eastern's demise would have a tremendous impact on real estate sales in the area.
In 1989, when the strike began, her office was besieged by speculators seeing distress sales in the area.
"It got so bad I closed the office for a few days," she said. "I've already had a couple of deals fall through in the last week after lenders found that the buyers were Eastern employees. Suddenly they weren't qualified buyers."

HEADLINE: Eastern Airlines Brought Down by a Strike So Bitter It Became a Crusade

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
As word filtered out Friday night that Eastern Airlines would shut, some members of its machinists union, which has been on strike since March 1989, rejoiced.
Some passengers and communities served by Eastern, as well as other employees, lamented the end of a 62-year-old airline that for a time dominated the routes between the Northeast and the sun, but the strikers celebrated a victory. 
 Not only had they forced Frank Lorenzo, the former chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, which owned Eastern, to give up control of the airline in April, but the thousands of non-union pilots, flight attendants and machinists that he had hired to break the strike are also out on the street.
 
At the Heart of the Shutdown
 The hatred and passions stirred by the long strike of the International Assocation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers lie at the heart of why Eastern was forced to park its 190 planes and begin selling its assets.
Certainly, other pressures weakened Eastern over the years, notably the competition brought by deregulation. When the Government began in 1979 to allow airlines to fly wherever they wanted, loosened the rules on fares and made it easy for new airlines to enter the business, upstart rivals like People Express and Air Florida forced Eastern to charge fares that did not cover its costs.
Those problems were compounded when the management at the time, led by Frank Borman, miscalculated and ordered a large number of planes, loading the company with debt when most other carriers were more appropriately cautious.
And the final blow for Eastern probably came in August, when the price of aviation fuel surged after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, greatly increasing operating costs and making it impossible for Eastern to get a grip on its debts.
 
Similar Pressures Elsewhere
 But other airlines faced similar pressures and managed to adapt. Some airlines, including United Air Lines and Trans World Airlines, had also gone through strikes.
Indeed, several large American airlines are also in acute financial distress: Pan American World Airways and Continental Airlines have both filed for bankruptcy protection, and Trans World Airlines is planning to sell some of its profitable routes to London.
Nowhere other than Eastern, however, did the labor struggle last as long or assume the form of a crusade.
And in the end, the conflict destroyed an airline that had been run by two renowned figures in aviation. Founded in 1928, Eastern was led until 1963 by Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace. In 1975 Frank Borman, a former astronaut, became the airline's president; in his early tenure he was often asked for autographs by his employees.
Throughout the years, Eastern's strength was warm-weather vacations. The airline had many routes to Florida, special promotions in conjunction with Disney World and extensive operations in the Caribbean and Latin America.
 
New Balance of Power
 In 1984, Eastern seemed on the verge of achieving a new balance of power between labor and management. In an agreement with its three unions, which made large concessions on wages and benefits, Eastern gave 25 percent of its stock to its 38,000 workers. The unions received four seats on Eastern's board, two of them held by union leaders.
But after Texas Air and Mr. Lorenzo acquired Eastern in 1986, the alliance unraveled, the union leaders' board membership was ended and labor relations rapidly deteriorated.
Jack Bavis, the leader of the pilots union at Eastern for much of the strike, said that what had started out as a struggle to keep Mr. Lorenzo from selling Eastern's assets to bolster other parts of his airline empire became a personalized confrontation in which some union leaders were determined to get rid of Mr. Lorenzo at any cost. At its forefront was Charles Bryan, the head of the machinists union and a onetime ally of Mr. Lorenzo.
As part of their campaign, the unions turned to new tactics that inflicted huge damage on Eastern. The unions lobbied in Washington against Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern's president, Phil Bakes, portraying the airline as negligent in its safety practices.
As a result of the pressure, the Federal Aviation Administration inspected Eastern's fleet and concluded that Eastern was safe to fly. But the agency said it was concerned that the labor conflict could cause safety problems.
 
Losing Business Travelers
 Some customers had already been put off by having to cross picket lines, and the specter of safety problems led many others to shun Eastern.
This was particularly true of business travelers, who generally do not pay for their trips themselves and found little incentive to fly Eastern when it introduced very low fares.
The virtual boycott of Eastern by business travelers was devastating, because airlines rely on these full-fare passengers to make a profit.
In April, after a year in bankruptcy protection, Mr. Lorenzo was ousted from control of Eastern by Federal Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who said Texas Air had neglected and mismanaged it. The airline was taken over by Martin R. Shugrue, the trustee appointed by the court.
Before Mr. Lorenzo was ousted, he succeeded in breaking the strike of the pilots and flight attendants, who had followed the machinists union to the picket lines.
Using nonunion replacements, Mr. Lorenzo gradually rebuilt Eastern operations, much as he had done at Continental Airlines in 1983, after he put that airline into bankruptcy protection to break its unions.
 
Much Lower Wages
 Most of Eastern's striking pilots and flight attendants and almost all the machinists were replaced by people who worked for up to two-thirds less. New pilots, for example, were paid $27,500 a year, compared with average of $72,000 before the strike. Ramp workers made $5 an hour instead of $15.
But it was a Pyrrhic victory for Mr. Lorenzo. The rebuilding did not go smoothly. Eastern was plagued by mechanical problems, and the new people, while highly motivated, lacked experience and polish. Eastern's business remained disappointing, and the airline continued to lose money.
The safety issues aside, Eastern's prospects for a revival were probably damaged when an examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court, David Shapiro, found last spring that there were 12 transactions between Texas Air and Eastern where there was evidence of possible improper action.
As a result, Mr. Shapiro said, Texas Air, which is now known as Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., could have deprived Eastern of $280 million to $400 million. This finding seemed to bulwark the unions' earlier complaints that Mr. Lorenzo was stripping Eastern of some of its most profitable operations, like its computerized reservation service, in order to prop up Continental Airlines.
Mr. Shugrue acknowledged when he took control that the most serious problem facing Eastern was the public's concerns about safety. He quickly began an advertising campaign that tried to convince the public that the safety problems had been resolved.
But in the midst of this effort, a grand jury indicted nine Eastern managers on charges of falsifying records to make it appear that repairs had been done when they had not.
When Mr. Shugrue took over, Judge Lifland allocated another $80 million to keep Eastern flying.
At the time, Eastern had 800 flights a day and a huge hub at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta. But even there it faced formidable competition from Delta Air Lines, which was based in Atlanta. and is one of the nation's strongest airlines.
 
A Determined Executive
 Most airline analysts believed Eastern could survive only if it could link up with a more successful airline.
But Mr. Shugrue, a chain-smoking, restless 50-year-old, was determined to revive Eastern. He traveled constantly among Eastern's hubs in New York, Atlanta and Miami, raising employee morale and meeting with travel agents.
For a time, he seemed to be on the way to success. Low fares brought back old Eastern travelers who had defected to Delta and USAir. Even some business travelers began to give Eastern a second chance.
Then came the Iraqi invasion and sharply higher fuel prices.
And Delta, which had higher fares, than Eastern's, began to match them. Business travel began to slow as the economy deteriorated.
And despite a huge advertising budget, Eastern could not shake its image as the airline that had been torn apart by its struggle with its unions.
Yet even yesterday, with Eastern's planes grounded, Mr. Shugrue held out some glimmers of hope.
He said he continued to talk with financial and airline organizations. He acknowledged that the suspension of flights "obviously makes the task more difficult, and I truly don't want to hold out false hopes."
Few people give him any chance of success, especially since the creditors of Eastern are determined to force the liquidation of its assets.
And outside Eastern's headquarters in Miami yesterday, members of the machinists union continued to picket, jeering at nonstriking employees who were leaving with their belongings.
"We told you so," they shouted, waving signs that said, "Eastern Airlines: Rest in Peace" -- and "Rest in Pieces."

HEADLINE: PAN AMERICAN GAMES;
Cuba Puts It All On 1991 Games

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
A substantial number of construction workers seemed busy as usual at the new aquatics center on a gray and unusually cool morning here last week. But for all their efforts, one of the walls had still not been erected, a major support beam for the roof sat unattended on the ground, and not a shovelful of dirt had been removed from where the pool will be.
"Perhaps this one is our most difficult venue," said Renaldo Gonzalez Lopez, the executive director of the committee organizing the 1991 Pan American Games. "But I am sure everything will be finished by May." 
 Whether it's actually completed in May, June, July or even by Aug. 2, the day of the opening ceremony, on this day Gonzalez and other Cuban sports officials expressed no concern that the center might not be finished on time or the games not proceed as scheduled. In fact, most of the facilities under construction or renovation are well on target for completion, and the others are not far enough behind to cause alarm.
What seemed far more uncertain to outside observers is why a country with so many obvious economic needs would continue such massive efforts to organize an event of the magnitude of the Pan American Games.
For 30 years, Cuba has endured under a trade embargo by the United States, which left the Soviet Union as the island's major economic benefactor. Yet with its own worsening problems, the Soviet Union began reducing its trade with Cuba last year by limiting oil exports, demanding payments in hard currency and lowering price subsidies on sugar, Cuba's major export. Other important trading partners, like Eastern European countries once within the Soviet sphere of influence, also started demanding payments from Cuba in hard currency.
With the economic squeeze tightening, President Fidel Castro proclaimed in September that the country was entering a "special period" of austerity. To most Cubans, that simply meant more belt-tightening and sparse supplies growing sparser. By last week, there was little to suggest otherwise, as local citizens stood in lines to buy bread and walked by other stores with few goods to sell. All around were buildings in dire need of paint and repair, eroding sidewalks and clouds of carbon monoxide, spewed from Soviet-built cars and Bulgarian buses.
At the same time, preparations for the Pan American Games have continued, to a large degree, at the expense of these problems and others. As a requirement of the special period, work on most projects has been stopped, and proposed ventures delayed. Just about the only other uninterrupted work has been construction of new hotels and resorts, as the government turns to tourism to generate additional hard currency.
"We have a sacred commitment to the Pan American Games, and we will honor it," Castro told a group of Western journalists last week. "So the Pan American Games have been given a high priority, and they will continue to enjoy a high priority."
The Pan American Games were first held in 1951 in Buenos Aires, moving to another Western hemisphere city every fourth year. In 1987, they were staged in Indianapolis, where competition between athletes from Cuba and the United States, countries without formal diplomatic relations, provided the games their highest drama.
This will be the first time for the games in Cuba, which has been ruled by Castro's Communist Government since 1959. Most of the events will be staged here, with several others in Santiago de Cuba, a smaller city in the southeast corner of the country, 548 miles away.
The Cuban organizers expect nearly 6,000 athletes, coaches and officials from 38 countries, not to mention hundreds of journalists and other visitors. The United States Olympic Committee expects to send a delegation of 1,045 athletes, coaches and staff.
Cuba has seldom had the opportunity to receive so many foreigners, especially such a large number from the United States. For that reason, the 1991 games have become an important source of national pride, a chance to show off progress despite the onerous embargo from the north.
"Staging these games is a psychological question for Cuba," said a European diplomat based in Havana, who requested anonymity. "A Cuban, in general, is not always a convinced Communist, but he is a convinced nationalist. He's proud to organize the games; they assimilate national prowess."
The cost of the 1991 games is nearly impossible to measure because of Cuba's socialist economic system. Outside of some items that had to be purchased with hard currency, like a synthetic surface for the track in the Olympic Stadium from Germany and bowling lanes from Japan, the Havana games are home-grown. Cuban-made materials are being used for the 10 major venues under construction, including a 35,000-seat Olympic Stadium, the aquatics center, a velodrome, a tennis center with 14 courts, a regatta course for rowing and canoeing -- in each case, the first of its kind in Cuba -- plus a complex of 1,473 apartments for athletes and officials that will be turned over to the city after the games.
Four years ago in Indianapolis, where most of the venues had already existed, organizers spent nearly $90 million to stage the games.
Castro put the cost at "less than 1 percent of the current investment being made in our country." But his failure to elaborate left hanging the questions of cost and proper emphasis. These days, these questions are difficult to avoid with an increasing number of people using bicycles because gasoline has grown scarce and bus service has been cut back, oxen replacing tractors for farm work, horse-drawn carriages instead of taxis.
"When they decided to organize the games, they had no problems with the Soviet Union and the ex-Eastern bloc still existed," said the European diplomat, giving Castro the benefit of the doubt. "So Fidel had no more problems than any other countries. Then, all of a sudden, in one year everybody was surprised and everything changed."
Castro alluded to that when he noted that "none of our problems existed in November 1986," when Cuba won the right to stage the games.
And so his country has clung to its "moral and ethical principles" by forging ahead, he said, citing residual benefits that he suggests make the venture more valuable, like housing for 6,500 citizens in the village apartments, the availability of the venues for general use and a possible increase in tourism.
"It's all in the way you look at things," said a former Cuban Government official, who asked that his name not be mentioned. "Cubans may lack some of the necessities of life, but no one is starving. Compared to other Latin American countries, our quality of life is much better. We fought very hard to get the games. They mean a lot to us. It would be very hard for us now to renounce them."

HEADLINE: Pax Americana;
What the United States Has Taken On In the Gulf, Besides a War

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT takes a long time to plan a war, but it takes an even longer time to design a peace. Many people are already beginning to ask: If the anti-Iraq coalition emerges victorious from this conflict, what will the peace look like and how long will the United States have to remain heavily involved in the Persian Gulf?
In the wake of any American victory, Washington's political influence in the region could be greater than at any other time in the postwar era. Even before the war, Soviet involvement in the Middle East was on the wane, or, as Saddam Hussein derisively put it, Moscow had pulled a "disappearing act." It is quite possible that when the smoke clears America will find itself the only superpower in the Middle East and its greatest enemy might well be the illusions that naturally attend victory -- illusions about how much any outside power can reorder an ancient region that has so long defied reordering. 
 Administration officials are the first to admit that they have done relatively little thinking about the shape of peace in the Persian Gulf, largely because the focus of all of their energy since Aug. 2 has been on building the diplomatic and military coalition to confront Iraq. Now that diplomacy has failed and it has come to war, though, Administration planners have thought about peace at least enough to conclude that "victory," in their eyes, will consist of at least five elements.
 
The Elements of Victory
 Although the Administration has never said it out loud, the first element is the total destruction of Iraq's military infrastructure, weapons development factories, missile sites and as many tanks, airplanes and artillery pieces as possible. The goal is to render Iraq unable to project power beyond its borders for years to come. The unprovoked Iraqi missile attacks on Israeli cities last week drove home the point to anyone who might have doubted it that Iraq under its present leadership is an outlaw state that will stop at nothing and therefore must be destroyed militarily -- irrespective of whether it gets out of Kuwait. Even if Mr. Hussein promised to get out of Kuwait tomorrow, the coalition probably would not stop bombing.
The second element of any victory, officials say, is a total and complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, so that the 12 United Nations resolutions calling for this outcome will have been implemented. Historians may question whether it was ever right for the Bush Administration to make the "liberation of Kuwait" a prime war aim, instead of focusing exclusively on dismantling Iraq's offensive military capabilities, which, after all, were the real threat to stability in the gulf and therefore the real threat to American interests. Nevertheless, having made the restoration of the Emir to his throne in Kuwait a prime objective, the United States cannot now content itself with devastating Iraq and simply ignoring who rules Kuwait. The credibility of the United Nations and the United States is at stake.
The third element, Administration officials say, would have to be a new, stable balance of power in the gulf. Historically, there have been two regional powers, and two regional powers only, in the Persian Gulf: Iran and Iraq. These are the only countries in the neighborhood that have a large enough population, with sufficient economic resources and educational advancement to be able to develop potent armies. Saudi Arabia, for example, has the money and the advanced weapons, but unlike Iraq or Iran it could never put a million men under arms.
Given these realities the rules of geopolitics in that region have been very simple. When Iran and Iraq are fighting each other, everyone else is relaxed. When one dominates the other, everyone else must live in fear. Most recently, countries such as Kuwait wanted the Americans to act as a counterbalance by sitting just over the horizon. That strategy was exposed as bankrupt by Saddam Hussein when he crushed Kuwait, precisely because he knew the Americans were over the horizon and believed they were not about to budge.
In the wake of this war -- again, assuming victory by the American-led coalition -- some outside power is going to have to sit indefinitely on the horizon to make sure that Iran does not take advantage of the power vacuum in Iraq to reassert dominance. And that power will have to make certain that a wounded and embittered Iraq does not lash out at its neighbors in ways that might not necessarily be life-threatening but could nevertheless be highly destabilizing.
Guess who that power is going to be? Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has already warned, repeatedly, that the United States would have to help develop some stabilizing "security structure" in the aftermath of war. This structure would require the presence of American ground troops, air units and naval units, possibly for months, maybe for several years. Washington would hope to remove its ground forces from Saudi Arabia and from the Kuwait-Iraq border as soon as possible, and have them replaced either by an Arab League force, a force from the Gulf Cooperation Council or a United Nations peacekeeping force, with the Americans sitting offshore on naval vessels.
American officials once thought of this structure almost like a Middle Eastern NATO, but in the last few months they have learned how hard it is to build an anti-Iraq coalition from shy Arab states with their constantly shifting alliances.
So rather than a single structure, American officials now envisage a series of bilateral relationships between the United States and Saudi Arabia, between Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, such as Egypt, and between the gulf states and themselves. The idea is to develop a muscle that is militarily strong enough to check Iran and Iraq, while politically invisible enough not to leave its members open to charges that they are lackeys of the West. This network of alliances would have to keep Iraq weak enough not to threaten its neighbors, but not so weak that Syria, Turkey or Iran begin to prey upon it.
Another element of this military balance, Secretary Baker has already said, would involve a United Nations arms embargo to keep Iraq from acquiring new chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or missiles.
American officials insist that this security arrangement would have an economic component as well. That means serious pressure from Washington on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the other Arab gulf states to share their wealth more with their poor Arab neighbors. "Saddam really touched a hot button with his economic arguments," said Ghassan Salameh, a Lebanese political scientist at the University of Paris. "There can be no stable balance of power in the gulf without a redistribution of wealth."
The fourth element of victory, in the American view, would be the restoration of oil prices to reasonable levels. Since the war started, crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels since midsummer -- below $20 a barrel. Economists say that if the fall is maintained, it should restore consumer spending power and generate funds for business investment, as well as give the Federal Reserve more room to reduce interest rates in an effort to fight the recession.
"Victory in oil terms is very complex," said Thomas A. Petrie, chairman of Petrie Parkman & Company, a Denver-based oil company. On the one hand, he said, it is important that Iraq be militarily defeated so that it cannot in the future intimidate Saudi Arabia and Kuwait into pushing oil prices way up. On the other hand, it is important that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait do not feel a need to overproduce after the war in order to punish Iraq by keeping prices low and Iraq out of the market.
"It would be in our long-term interest to see oil prices at levels equal to, if not slightly higher than, they were before the war," Mr. Petrie said. "Prices that are too low simply stimulate our own demand and consumption. Prices slightly higher than $20 a barrel would be both affordable and enable us to make a smooth transition to a mix of different energies and also reduce our dependence on foreign oil."
But how much energy will the American people have for managing such a victory, should it come -- particularly when America's "vital interests" in the region are being redefined? For the past 40 years the United States has defined the free flow of oil at reasonable prices from the Persian Gulf to Western Europe and Japan as a vital interest. The United States was not particularly dependent on Persian Gulf oil, but its European and Japanese allies were. As the leader of the Western alliance, the United States felt it had a vital interest in guaranteeing the economic viability and stability of its major allies so that they could help defend the free world against the Soviet threat. But if the Soviets are no longer seen as a threat, how long will the American people consider it their vital interest to maintain a free flow of oil to Japan, especially if Japan uses that oil to surpass the United States industrially?
One burden of victory will be intensified pressure on the United States to address the Palestinian-Israeli dispute. Politically speaking, all of the Arab states that have aligned themselves with the West against Saddam Hussein will be under pressure to prove to their Arab audiences that they are as concerned about the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait as they are about the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. But settling the Palestinian-Israeli dispute has already been made more difficult by the Iraqi missile strikes on Israel and the way in which it was applauded by Palestinians in Jordan and in the Palestine Liberation Organization.
"Saddam's missile attack and the Palestinian response has undone everything positive which the last three years of Palestinian-Israeli contacts might have produced," said the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi. "The conflict is once again about existence, not about where the border between us should be. To sit here in my house in a sealed room, looking at my elderly father, my wife and my children through a gas mask, and knowing that the Palestinians are applauding means to me that there is no future for coexistence here. It undercuts every Palestinian claim that they are prepared to live with Israel."
As for his views, President Bush said last week: "When all this is over we want to be the healers. We want to do what we can to facilitate what I might optimistically call a 'new world order,' but that new world order should have a conciliatory component to it. It should say to those countries that are on the other side at this juncture, and there aren't many of them, 'Look, you're part of this new world order. You can play an important part in seeing that the world can live at peace in the Middle East and elsewhere.' "
But this war was never about healing. It was about checking a well-armed local despot who was making a bid for regional supremacy, and who broke all the local rules along the way. This war was never about competing visions for the future of the Arab world. It was about a thief who had to be stopped, and since the Arabs could not stop him alone they had to call in the West. Therefore victory in this war will likely produce little euphoria among the victors, only relief. For the Arabs, it will be a relief once the status quo has been restored, with a more stable balance of power, and a less dangerous Iraq. And for American soldiers it will be a relief that they can leave this region.
"Let's not forget something," remarked Mark Heller, a visiting Middle East expert at the Canadian Institute For International Peace and Security, "The challenge Saddam Hussein has posed is not typical of the challenges the United States has confronted in the Middle East and the response of the United States is not typical of its involvement in the area. Both are historical aberrations. So don't look for America to now be running the Middle East and don't look for the problems there to continue to take the Iraqi form. The indigenous problems there are still there and will still be there. Before we start proclaiming a new world order in the Middle East, let's not forget that a lot of the old order will still survive this war."

The Dinkins Budget Is a Long Way From the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
THE worst-of-both-worlds preliminary budget that Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed for New York City last week was, as usual, only the first step down a long road. But even more than usual, the path is strewn with rocks and roadblocks and bridges to cross.
The obstacles range from the constituent groups that will howl about hundreds of millions of dollars in service cuts and city officials who will fight to protect their turf to the fiscal monitors and credit raters with whom the budget must pass muster and the City Council, which must pass it by June 30. 
 In one sense, Mr. Dinkins's call for $580 million in new taxes, and savings through spending and service cuts, was old hat to New Yorkers used to paying more for less in each of the last three years. But precisely because of the cumulative effects of the past, and the dim economic prospects for the future, this year is particularly bad.
"This is definitely going to be the toughest budget I've ever seen," said the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone. "And it's going to require a good deal of statesmanship and a willingness by many people to make the tough decisions."
In a process known more for gamesmanship than statesmanship, the challenges include potential cuts in state aid that could make the city's problem far worse, uncertainties about whether municipal unions will make concessions to minimize layoffs, the reluctance of the State Legislature and City Council to approve higher taxes in the wake of record increases last year and a special Council election next fall.
<> <> Gloomy as it is, the Mayor's $29.3 billion plan is predicated on a range of assumptions that may be too rosy. For example, the proposal assumes no increase at all in state aid, not even to cover inflation. On the other hand, it does not take into account what would happen if the state reduced aid further, a distinct possibility since it faces huge budget gaps of its own.
The Mayor's plan calls for up to 16,000 layoffs. But the work force, which stood at 247,000 last November, had been scheduled to grow at such a rate that such action would produce a net decrease of only 8,500 by June 30, 1992.
Some critics, including Mr. Vallone, are already questioning whether the Mayor has cut far enough, fast enough and in the right places.
Mr. Vallone conceded that some new taxes would be inevitable, but not before he is convinced that all fat has been trimmed from the budget. Legislative leaders in Albany, whose assent is needed for all the proposed taxes except the property tax, are already looking at the city's requests with a good deal of disapproval.
 
Increases in Some Agencies

 
 Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, the watchdog agency created to monitor the city's finances in the fiscal crisis of the 70's -- and which could resume control over the city budget if it fell out of balance -- questioned whether some of the hard decisions had actually been deferred.
Mr. Proctor said he was surprised to see that a number of smaller agencies, including the Board of Elections and the law and personnel departments, still expected to increase the size of their work force (although not as much as they had planned), while bigger ones like the Board of Education, Sanitation Department and other agencies were slated for deep cuts.
"It is not too soon to talk about priorities, and what message comes from that," he said. "But I'm very puzzled. I'm struck at the number of secondary agencies that are still going to grow."
City officials said the biggest single proposed cut, of 6,000 jobs in the Board of Education, was included as a spur to the state to provide as much education aid as possible. As a strategy, however, it lacks subtlety and holds little guarantee of success. Moreover, Mr. Proctor questioned whether cuts of such scope in education could violate a state law that bars New York City from making disproportionate cuts in the education budget.
Many of the most sweeping kinds of cost-saving ideas, including some that have been discussed for years, were relegated to a series of rhetorical questions in the middle of the Mayor's budget message: Should the Fire Department assume more duty for emergencies, freeing the police to fight crime? Should the city's vast welfare agency be broken apart? Should authority for the East River bridges be transferred to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which would mean tolls?
Mr. Dinkins has named an advisory council of business and labor leaders and former city officials to answer those questions and others, but probably not in time for this budget.
Even as the Mayor searches for cuts, interested parties will resist them. Some of his own deputy mayors blocked proposals to consolidate or reshape agencies under their jurisdiction, arguing that the savings were too small to justify the disruptions. And leery as they are of raising taxes, the Council members will also find it hard to surrender to service cuts that could make their constituents even more unhappy.
 
'Not Hiding the Deficits'
 Perhaps the most troubling question is whether the city can find solutions that will work for some time -- instead of simply getting through one more year only to leave big gaps still yawning down the road.
<> <> "Our concern is to deal with the spending levels," said Hyman Grossman, a managing director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the Wall Street rating agency that has already placed the city's bonds on a credit watch.
"Based on the last three years, using a bigger tax package is only 50-50 in terms of achievement," he said.
Mr. Proctor of the Control Board said the Mayor benefits from the very strictness of the laws that are a legacy of the earlier crisis and that force him to present his blueprint so early.
"Clearly the world is shifting under our feet, so the numbers will change," Mr. Proctor said.
"But he's not hiding the deficits, and financially, he has tried to find enough solutions," he said. "We may disagree with his strategy and the likelihood of it coming to pass, but he's faced up to the job."
For his part, Mr. Dinkins has acknowledged the difficulties that lie ahead and the help he needs to overcome them.
"The road before us is a hard one," Mayor Dinkins said last week, "made easier only if we work together, think together and, in this time of straitened circumstances, innovate together.
"Now, more than ever, New York City's most precious resource is its collective imagination."

In Crime, Too, Some Gender-Related Inequities

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
BY one measure, at least, violent crime seems to be declining. But as in so many other things, the trend appears to be benefitting men more than women.
According to a new study by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, about 2.5 million women a year are robbed, raped or assaulted, and about a quarter of such crimes are comitted by family members or men they have dated. 
 One in five of the women victimized by a husband or ex-husband said that they had suffered at least three similar assaults in the previous six months. And almost a quarter of the women victimized by an intimate received medical care, compared with only 13 percent of the victims of other offenders.
The study, based on interviews with about 50,000 households a year, found that violent crime, reported and unreported, against people over 12 years old had declined from 1973 to 1987, but that most of the decline hade been in crimes against men, which dropped about 20 percent. Of the 4 million men a year who are victims, only 6 percent are attacked by family members or women they have dated.
"The trend is that the men's rates are coming down closer to the women's," said Caroline Wolf Harlow, who wrote the report. "But the main lesson is that violent crime against women is different than crime against men because it's six times as likely to be committed by their intimates."
Violence against women has become the focus of increasing concern througout society, with new fears about campus date rape and law enforcement authorities seeming powerless to to stem a pattern of assault and murder by the estranged husbands of women already living under court protection orders. Feminist groups argue that it is a troubling reflection of how much less political and economic power women have than men.
Last week, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. proposed measures to increase penalties for sex crimes involving Federal violations, provide money for campus rape prevention programs and earmark $300 million for programs that help to combat violent crimes against women.
The Justice Statistics study said that the women victimized most frequently are poor black women living in metropolitan areas. Women aged 12 to 24 are more than twice as likely to be victimized as women over 35.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Starting With Upbeat Economy, Richards Sets Out For 'New Texas'

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
THE symbolism was heavy in Austin at Ann Richards's inauguration on Tuesday as the 45th Governor of Texas. From the winter-white dress Ms. Richards wore, to the invitation she issued to the crowd to join her as she strolled to her new office in the Capitol, everything about the day was carefully designed by the team that organized the 1988 Democratic Convention. Their buzzwords were "fresh," "pure" and, above all, "new."
As a candidate, Ms. Richards campaigned on the slogan "The New Texas." In her first speech as Governor, she welcomed 20,000 onlookers to "the first day of the New Texas." 
 Which led many here to ask: What was the Old Texas, and what can Ms. Richards do to change it?
The answer seems to depend on which side one takes in the continuing debate over how the new Governor won in the first place. Her margin was slim: Ms. Richards won 50 percent of the vote; the Republican, Clayton Williams, got 47 percent; the rest went to the Libertarian candidate. Ms. Richards's majority was barely 100,000 votes of the 3.7 million cast.
One interpretation of her victory is that many of those votes were cast not for her, but against Mr. Williams, a billionaire businessman who made a number of self-destructive gaffes, most of them in the last days of the campaign.
First, he compared rape to inclement weather, saying if it was inevitable, "relax and enjoy it." Then he told a reporter that, as a young man, he had been "serviced" by prostitutes. In the last days of the campaign he said he forgot how he marked his absentee ballot -- under state rules, he could have cast it anytime from about three weeks to five days before the election -- on the only constitutional question listed, a proposal affecting gubernatorial appointments. Finally, after refusing for months to release his Federal income tax returns, he volunteered that he paid no income taxes in 1986 because, while still one of the richest people in Texas, he lost money that year.
"She won because she wasn't him," said a Republican political consultant, Carl Rove. "I'm not sure too many Texans really wanted to have a new Texas; they just didn't want a particular candidate."
 
A Historical View
 Those who hold this view describe the Old Texas as a state on the upswing, three years after the worst of the oil bust and with average unemployment figures at the lowest levels since 1985. Oil prices, always the wild card in the economic game here, continue to fluctuate with the war in the Persian Gulf, but Texas is less dependent on oil revenues than ever before. Oil accounts for 10 percent of the state's economic activity, or half the level before oil prices went into decline, contributing heavily to the retreat of other sectors of the state economy as well.
With the rebound, the state even ended the 1990 fiscal year with a $767 million surplus. Budget analysts say that next year it will take between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion more than the state expects in revenue to provide the current level of services. But optimists point out that those numbers are not nearly as dire as the ones faced by most other large states.
"Things are looking good," Mr. Rove said, adding that Ms. Richards does not have the mandate to make broad, sweeping changes.
Those who take the other view of Ms. Richards's election, that the voters bought her image of a New Texas, believe that Mr. Williams, with his cowboy hats and boots, represented a yearning for a romanticized past that had little bearing on the life of the average Texan in the 1990's. A vote for Ms. Richards, they argued, was an acknowledgement that times had changed and the state's problems had changed.
 
'Last of His Breed'
 "The convenient and simple explanations that Claytie lost it all by putting his foot in his mouth near the end aren't going to wash," a Democratic consultant, George Shipley, said. "Of course he lost it. But she won it, too."
<> <> Paul Burka, executive editor of Texas Monthly magazine, describes Mr. Williams as "the last of his breed," a businessman first and politician second. "The 'Old Texas' was based on the notion that government serves business," he said. "That's down the drain with Ann Richards. I don't think the voters were saying they want a bad business climate but that they care about a whole different range of things."
This school of thought finds a lot wrong with Texas and argues that Ms. Richards does, in fact, have a mandate for change. Three state systems -- the prisons, mental health institutions and schools -- are operating under court supervision. Gov. William Clements Jr., who Ms. Richards succeeds, has been fighting an order to provide more equitable financing to poorer school districts; Ms. Richards says she will try to comply with the order.
The State Legislature has been tainted by periodic scandals in recent years. The latest came earlier this month when a grand jury investigating influence peddling at the Legislature indicted the House Speaker, Gib Lewis, on two misdemeanor ethics violations. The indictment charges that he accepted a gift from a San Antonio law firm and did not report it as required by state ethics laws. Ms. Richards has endorsed a bill that would limit campaign contributions and gifts from lobbyists.
But as in any debate, there are some who hold the view that the entire discussion of why Ms. Richards won is irrelevant. The Texas constitution sharply limits the authority of the governor, and the only real power of the office is a product of the force of the officeholder's personality.
"Once you're elected, you can create the mandate," said Ernesto Cortes Jr., director of the Texas Industrial Areas Foundation, a coalition of community action groups.
"She is the Governor now; she can frame the debate," Mr. Cortes added. "Once she's the Governor, how she got there doesn't really matter."

HEADLINE: The World;
War Offers Turkey a Chance to Take a Larger Role

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey

 BODY:
THE Turks may record the Persian Gulf crisis as the occasion when they proved they still count -- assuming, that is, that the war goes well, which here means above all that not a drop of Turkish blood is shed.
Even before Turkey allowed American planes to launch bombing runs on Iraq from Turkish soil, the struggle against Iraq certainly had been costly for Turkey, and had created any number of risks for future relations with neighboring Arab states. But so far, Turkey has made the best of an ordeal by turning it into an opportunity: an occasion to acquire economic help, new military hardware and, perhaps most of all, large measures of fresh international respect. 
 Turkey's geopolitical importance was in doubt as recently as the day before Saddam Hussein sent his troops into Kuwait. After nearly 40 years as NATO's dray horse on the eastern front, Turkey was being written off in many circles in the post-cold-war era.
Its strategic value had long been rooted in the perceived Soviet menace. But when that threat seemed to evaporate, NATO suddenly no longer loomed so large and neither did Turkey's stalwart presence. And without that military trump card, a popular argument went, what chance would Turkey have of one day realizing its ambition of joining the European Community? The Community had already told the Turks to put their dream on ice for a few years. The Turks, European diplomats say, are too poor for their club, too populous, too tolerant of human-rights abuses and, yes -- off the record, of course -- perhaps too Muslim.
But the gulf crisis has greatly blunted the forget-about-Turkey viewpoint. No matter how the war turns out, the West has been reminded that Turkey lives in one mean neighborhood and that it has always been NATO's tripwire against potential dangers in the Middle East.
Most Turks seem to enjoy being back in the limelight, no one more so than their pugnacious President, Turgut Ozal. He has single-handedly orchestrated Ankara's gulf policy, tossing aside opposition objections that he is exceeding the bounds of a traditionally ceremonial office. The crisis has given him lots of television exposure overseas, which he appears to relish, but he also has vigorously promoted Turkey's interests while trying to turn the presidency into a true executive post.
Yet many Turks worry that Mr. Ozal has played a dangerous game, first by making them active participants in the alliance against Iraq, and much more so last week by letting the Americans open a second front from Turkey in the air war. People in the southeast, near the Iraqi border, fear Mr. Hussein's ruthlessness so much that they began fleeing their homes last week by the tens of thousands, even though their leaders insist they want to stay out of this war.
Ask Turks, and they will tell you that their Ottoman Empire legacy makes them unloved among Arabs, and only grief can come of getting involved in Middle East battles. Two establishment pillars in particular -- the military and the Foreign Ministry -- fret that their President is engaged in perilous brinkmanship. In late fall, two Cabinet ministers and the chief of the armed forces resigned to protest Government policies. And some in the opposition accuse Mr. Ozal of kowtowing to Washington, whose goal, they say, is to drag Turkey into an unwanted war.
While foreign policy specialists and most of the press here want Turkey to abide by the United Nations sanctions against Iraq, they also want to avoid any high-profile action. For them, that rules out all saber-rattling.
But Mr. Ozal has persistently pushed harder. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, he quickly shut off the flow of Iraqi oil through pipelines in southern Turkey. He doubled Turkish troop strength at the border, pinning down 100,000 Iraqi soldiers who might have been used at the Saudi Arabian frontier. All along, he has been a front-row rooter for President Bush, warning repeatedly from his perch on the edge of the Middle East that one must be tough with Saddam Hussein. After war erupted, he arranged through Parliament for anti-Iraq strikes to be possible from Turkish air bases, something that most Turks probably oppose as too risky. The Americans made prompt use of the opportunity.
There are future payoffs to be harvested, Mr. Ozal's supporters insist. During this emergency, the United States has sent nearly 100 advanced fighters and bombers to Turkey and is installing sophisticated Patriot air defense missiles -- equipment that the Turks covet, and some of which may remain after the war. Washington is also considering sharp increases in future military and economic aid; it has already raised import quotas for Turkish textiles. A few Turkish optimists even believe that their stalwartness will persuade the European Community to look more favorably on their application.
But the gulf crisis cannot camouflage fundamental problems here, including labor unrest, galloping inflation and growing Islamic fundamentalism that worries secular Turks. These troubles and others have combined to make Mr. Ozal broadly unpopular, and his ruling party could be toppled in elections next year.
Much, however, is likely to depend on what happens in the war. What really worries Turks is that Iraq may shatter into pieces and that Iran and Syria will swoop in to gobble them up. If that happens, Mr. Ozal says, or if an attempt is made to create a Kurdish state in northern Iraq, Turkish troops would be ready to join the fray. A few radical nationalists go so far as to argue that Turkey would be within its rights to take over the oil-producing provinces of Kirkuk and Mosul, unfairly given to Iraq, they say, when the collapsed Ottoman Empire was carved up in the 1920's.
But they are a minority voice. Turkey for now seems glad just to have its importance recognized again. Now the question is whether being NATO's bulwark against the Arabs can prove more profitable for Turks than when their guns were pointed mainly toward Moscow.

HEADLINE: The World;
Experts Say Oil Shocks Are Unlikely To Go Away

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
THE oil price fever that has burned since August -- the industrial world's third bout with the malady since 1973 -- was broken last week when traders concluded that the intense air raids on Iraq had eliminated the threat to Saudi installations. The price of crude fell by more than $10 overnight and ended the week at a level lower than before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
No one is sure what will happen to prices in the weeks ahead. Government officials went to great pains to argue that this was not a case, as demonstrators keep chanting, of "blood for oil." But attention inevitably turned to techniques other than carpet bombing for assuring access to oil or, better yet, reducing the economy's dependence on a commodity that can jump in price by 150 percent in a few weeks, and fall by 33 percent in a few hours. 
 The case for making the world safe for oil-importing countries is clear, said Joseph Stanislaw, a Paris-based oil expert for Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Even if Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait never marched on to Saudi Arabia, "the intimidation would have been enough to have given them effective control of OPEC pricing," he said, "putting not only the American economy, but the industrialized world, at the mercy of one man."
 No matter how successful the war against Mr. Hussein, however, energy security will be far from assured. The American oil industry would like to produce more at home. But when it comes to oil, geology is destiny. The United States has about 26 billion barrels of proven reserves in the ground, of a global total of one trillion barrels. And the oil is getting harder to find; since the oil price crash of 1986, domestic daily oil production has shrunk by an amount larger than Kuwait's normal production.
"It's clear that U.S. production of those reserves will have a very limited impact on the world oil market," said Robert K. Watson, an energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has fought hard against drilling in parts of Alaska and the outer continental shelf. The reason is the volume elsewhere, including 650 billion barrels in the Persian Gulf. Iraq and Kuwait each have roughly quadruple the reserves of the United States; Saudi Arabia's are 10 times larger.
But the United States is an oil giant of another kind; last year it consumed 16.96 million barrels a day, or about 28 percent of world production. So the country is addicted to imports, 46 percent of supply last year. After the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, industry and consumers switched to other fuels or simply used less. Americans used .27 metric tons of oil per $1,000 in gross domestic product in 1970, but by 1989 the figure was down to .18 tons, a drop of 33 percent. In the same period, Japan improved by 46 percent.
With domestic production declining 5 percent last year and probably more this year if low prices prevail, the United States will have to run hard just to stay in place in terms of imports. That means, said Mr. Watson and others, "the only way we can really affect the amount of oil available to provide energy services is by getting a handle on demand."
The United States has been at a disadvantage in weaning itself from oil, partly because it relies on market forces, which do not reflect the cost of war. Despite three oil shocks, oil is still easy to find, cheap to buy, and easy to use. Oil may be depletable in theory, but because of exploration and better technology reserves have nearly doubled since 1970. And, fever aside, the price is usually low. Cambridge Energy Research Associates calculates that prices in 1989 were one-fourth lower than in 1980, adjusting for inflation, and the price has stayed consistently below the price of oil from shale or tar sands.
Supply is a prominent issue when it is threatened, but almost always, moving oil is very easy. It generally does not require long pipelines, as does natural gas, and when refined and delivered for use it is an extremely compact energy package. Two efficiency experts, Amory B. Lovins and Hunter B. Lovins, calculated in their book "Brittle Power" that a gasoline station with 20 pumps running is delivering as much energy as a medium-sized nuclear plant.
 For months, the Energy Department has been developing a National Energy Strategy, presenting the White House with a menu of steps to increase supply or cut demand. But experts outside government think the former is more likely.
 The chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, Michael R. Deland, said, "It will be extremely difficult to lessen our dependence on imported -- and hence Middle Eastern -- oil." The economy can switch to other technologies, but the most important will not be in wide commercial use until the next century, he said. A new generation of more economical, publicly acceptable nuclear power plants, photovoltaic cells and other "renewable" energy sources, including batteries to run vehicles, will be needed, he said, along with a general improvement in efficiency.
At Citizen Action, a Washington-based nonprofit group, Ed Rothschild, an energy expert, called for a plan stressing efficiency. But he added, "The decline in oil prices may have a perverse effect, taking the pressure off to have a national energy strategy."
 Others argue that no energy strategy is good energy strategy. Fereidun Fesharaki, an oil analyst at the East-West Center, a research center in Honolulu, defined energy policy as "taking my tax dollars and subsidizing something uneconomic."
"It creates industries which do not deserve to be created," he said, referring to synthetic fuels and other failed efforts. When oil rises in price, he said, alternatives will emerge on their own.
In the meantime, he suggested, events like Iraq's invasion of Kuwait or other triggers for oil shocks are "something we may face every 10 or 15 years."

HEADLINE: The New World Order So Far

 BODY:
Troops from more than 15 countries, backed by stern authority of the United Nations, last week began to fight Iraq in the first post-cold-war war. They share goals that are both limited and lasting: to drive Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, and in the process to establish a "new world order" assuring that collective security, not the law of the jungle, replaces the recent pattern of proxy conflicts and thermonuclear deterrence.
Reality has not fully lived up to the rhetoric. The overwhelming majority of combat forces are from just one country, the United States. Decision-making has also been mainly American. But these are quibbles. What remains extraordinary about the war to evict Saddam Hussein from Kuwait is that the international alliance endures. 
 Never before has the world been so united on the same side of a major conflict. Never before has there been such an opportunity to build a broad-based and durable peace.
Whether that opportunity can now be realized depends on the future conduct of the war, and the shape of the eventual peace. Americans must take care to let neither short-run domestic political calculations nor passing military convenience deprive them of this bright hope of peace backed by a successful example of collective security.
"New world order" is an unfortunate phrase, reminiscent of Nazi sloganeering. But what is now within reach is a way to give it a positive new meaning. A practical, cooperative system can address the needs of people as well as states. It can deal with issues like the environment and human rights as well as aggression.
Yet any practical system of cooperation must reflect the real world of states. As many states as possible should be brought into the system, which will only succeed if it addresses the needs of the poor and weak. Nevertheless, the most important military and economic powers will play a central role. Today, that means principally the U.S., Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union and secondarily other members of the European Community, China, Korea, India and Brazil.
They have wide differences. The U.S., for example, has a special commitment to the security of Israel. Europe and Japan would like to see an overall Mideast peace agreement usher in new opportunities for investment and trade. The Soviet Union and China are mainly interested in preserving their seats at the big-power table, not in establishing new international codes of conduct. And Arab members of the coalition against Saddam Hussein, having bravely broken with nationalist dogmas, need to show their populations that the world respects legitimate Arab grievances.
All these interests can be addressed in coming days, first by the way the alliance wages war, and second by the way it makes peace.
The massive military force now assembled should be applied in the service of clear political ends. Measured, not maximum, force is the best guideline for a military operation successful in long-range terms.
And the best possible peace is one based on justice and regional stability. Indulging feelings of vengeance would only lay the seeds for future conflict. A sovereign Iraq should and will exist after the war, with or without Saddam Hussein.
But settling for a return to the status quo of Aug. 1, 1990, would be equally shortsighted. Iraq's reckless attacks on Israeli civilians are only the latest example of its flagrant disregard for international law. It will have to accept rigorous methods of inspection, verification and enforcement of postwar arms limits. And the need for wider regional arms control agreements is increasingly evident.
The cold war era knew only the absence of global war. People learned to live with insecurity. The new world order offers a finer prospect: peace.

EDUCATED IN ROMANCE
Women, Achievement, and College Culture.
By Dorothy C. Holland and Margaret A. Eisenhart.
273 pp. Chicago:
The University of Chicago Press. $19.95. 
 For those who believe that higher education must enrich and transform the lives of women, "Educated in Romance: Women, Achievement, and College Culture" brings no comfort. Instead, it suggests that what goes on in classrooms is largely irrelevant to the lives of female students. Peer culture, it argues, is actually the most powerful force on campus; its imperatives can transcend even the most persuasive pedagogy or progressive curriculum.
The evidence for this view is drawn from a study of the lives of 23 women on two pseudonymous Southern campuses: "Bradford" is historically black, "Southern University" predominantly white. Both are state-funded institutions that attract a primarily regional, non-elite student body. Dorothy C. Holland and Margaret A. Eisenhart, who are anthropologists, interviewed each of the women at three different points between 1979 and 1987: in their sophomore year, as they were about to graduate and again when they had begun their adult lives. As good ethnographers should, they listened closely to the language of their informants and monitored their educational and social choices throughout college. The story is discouraging because of what it suggests about the continuing power of a patriarchal system to shape female aspiration and achievement despite influential educational developments such as women's studies.
At Bradford and Southern, women students are subjected to the indignities of what the authors call a "sexual auction block," run by peers. In short order, they come to accept the fact that grades on sexual attractiveness are more important than their grade-point average. A woman's real value in college will be determined by attractiveness and proximity to high-status men; friendships with other women will take a back seat to relationships with sympathetic males.
In this environment, young women's career aspirations evaporate, go underground or get derailed. By default, most fall into reliance on men for marriage and economic support. Both institutional practices and informal networks reinforce it. College-sponsored activities, such as mixers, presume an interest in finding a boyfriend; friends and roommates admire most those young women who are treated well by males. Gifts, phone calls and demands by men for exclusivity become highly valued signs of female status. As a result, college women allow themselves to be "mobbed by romance" rather than books and ideas. To escape the pressures of the "sexual auction block," many enter less than happy long-term relationships because couplehood seems like the best protection.
When college becomes a search for Mr. Right, young women narrow rather than expand their professional and personal options. The most interesting portion of this book describes how Bradford and Southern students scaled down their ambitions, so that most ended up with the desired heterosexual romantic relationship but also a marginal career and inferior preparation as a wage earner. These stories of declining ambition are all too familiar; they sound more like the 1950's than the 1980's: Paula was a straight-A student who wanted to become a physician but finally became a nurse; Lisa wanted to be an art major, but because of her college boyfriend's interest in her future earning potential she became a speech therapist; Velma left school altogether when she realized that marriage and motherhood were inevitable.
Basic attitudes toward the meaning of education also figure in the formation of female identity. Ms. Holland and Ms. Eisenhart articulate three different approaches: those who attend college in order to get their schooling over and obtain credentials; those who want to do well to please parents or receive recognition; and those who regard college as an opportunity to learn from experts. Career identities were most likely to erode among women in the first two groups: those with what the authors call the "getting over" interpretation became bored with schoolwork, and those most interested in "doing well" were easily discouraged by any academic difficulties. When schooling became unrewarding or disappointing, these were the students most likely to develop a major in romance.
There are, of course, some women who do not rush headlong into intimate heterosexual relationships. The strategies of postponement employed by these "resisters" varied, but they were all highly individualistic and usually well within the accepted values of the peer culture: Karla chose a boyfriend who was a workaholic so that she could have time for her studies; Susan had an absentee boyfriend who provided her with a way of avoiding invitations from men on campus. Only Kandace and Sandy found refuge in close female friendships; both seemed to drop out of the world of heterosexuality but eventually entered romantic relationships with men after graduation. All of the women who wanted to escape the peer culture felt alone, despite the presence of women's studies programs that could provide a sense of community and an alternative vision.
Eventually, one must consider whether the imperatives for heterosexual success are quite as potent at educational institutions outside the South that attract different students. Ms. Holland and Ms. Eisenhart clearly understand that the formation of female identity is shaped by ethnicity. Bradford women, for example, were more realistic than Southern University students about the need to prepare for economic independence because of the inequities and economic instability experienced by black males. But it is surprising that anthropologists would miss an opportunity to explain how a distinctive Southern culture may put young white women of a certain class at particular risk of finding their identity in men. Despite this limitation, and the size of their sample, this is a powerful book because of the point that it makes about the virulence of peer culture. Feminist educators should take heed: we need to talk less to one another and more to our young women and young men.

WITHIN OUR MEANS
The Struggle for Economic Recovery
After a Reckless Decade.
By Alfred L. Malabre Jr.
167 pp. New York:
Random House. $21. 
 No other nation on earth is such an easy sucker for a speculative boom as the United States. Having created a culture of salesmen, small-town boosters and consumers, we are natural denizens of stock exchanges and gambling dens, gulled by our own public relations. But we soon repent of our prodigal ways and gnash our teeth in lamentation. Within a year of the 1929 crash, we were engaged in a national orgy of self-flagellation. The days of easy living, babbittry and bootleg gin soon passed into stoic calls for thrift and sacrifice.
In "Within Our Means," Alfred L. Malabre Jr. surveys the economic sins of the 1980's and outlines the stations of atonement. Breast-beating has arrived with a vengeance. "If self-indulgence marked the 1980s," he writes, "increased concern about the future seemed the watchword of the new decade." He sees the United States attempting to "regain competitive stature through the neglected avenues of hard work and sacrifice." Time for sackcloth and ashes, folks.
As the economics editor of The Wall Street Journal and the author of a previous book entitled "Beyond Our Means," Mr. Malabre is ideally positioned to bring us this news. In his skinny front-page columns for The Journal, he was our foremost chronicler of the longest peacetime expansion in American history. He stalked the Reagan boom as doggedly as paparazzi tail Madonna. For economics buffs, it was a great luxury to have a column devoted to the profile of an expansion.
Here, Mr. Malabre provides a crushing list of problems that accumulated with prosperity. He doesn't stick to the usual economic suspects: lopsided budgets, exorbitant debt, scanty savings and gargantuan consumption. We must also wade through a Spenglerian catalogue of other ailments neglected by the Reaganites, from AIDS and the hole in the ozone layer to the Exxon Valdez oil spill and crack babies. By about page 10, some readers may find suicide a preferable alternative to completing this book. But if you need a brief polemic to flip onto the stoop of the boastful Reaganite next door, "Within Our Means" should do the trick.
As a born Cassandra and registered Democrat, I found myself clucking in sympathy as Mr. Malabre proceeded with his grim diatribe. I checked my watch darkly as he informed me that the budget deficit was rising at a rate of $900,000 per minute and that the surviving savings and loans were losing money at the rate of $3 million per hour. I groaned with horror when he forecast a nightmarish deficit of $640 billion at the depth of the recession. I nodded at the injustice of a country so rich in stretch limousines and homeless people. All this Mr. Malabre documents with a stupefying diligence.
But though I share his bearish forecast and much of his indignation, I found myself increasingly displeased with his approach. I am partial to nice paragraphs of English prose and balk at airless compendiums of facts. Many of Mr. Malabre's pages offer one numbing statistic per sentence. I wish he had framed his abundant facts with an interesting narrative or arresting argument. I don't find the notion of living "within our means" a powerful or original theme, however merited. Ditto for his exhortation that "the situation cries out for bold leadership in the White House and Congress." And his jeremiad about the budget deficit isn't so much wrong as painfully familiar.
In "Within Our Means," Ronald Reagan and his brand of economics become a shorthand explanation for every ill. George Bush comes off as little more than a weaselly Reagan clone, deaf to the arguments that speak to Mr. Malabre with thunderous conviction. (A characteristic device of the book is to cite a problem, then conclude, more or less, with the finger-wagging refrain "Still, Bush seemed unconcerned.") Mr. Malabre simply rides his hobbyhorse too hard. Many problems that upset him -- from drugs to crime to illiteracy -- didn't originate with Mr. Reagan or Mr. Bush, even if they didn't help matters. Greater fairness would have strengthened the polemic.
Many of us prefer to believe in Presidential omnipotence when it comes to managing the economy. Yet in retrospect, much of the drift that Jimmy Carter was blamed for would have plagued any President grappling with rising oil prices and global inflation. Similarly, in the 1980's, many things happened to the American economy other than President Reagan -- the globalization of financial markets, for example. The liquidity boom that fed the 1980's owed as much to Paul Volcker's Federal Reserve Board policies as to Ronald Reagan's tax cuts. The easy credit and low interest rates that followed Mr. Volcker's celebrated conquest of inflation led straight to leveraged buyouts, more permissive lending and manic deal making. Some type of Wall Street boom would have occurred even with Walter Mondale in the Oval Office. Where Mr. Reagan erred -- like his Republican predecessors in the 1920's -- was in steadily pumping high-octane tax cuts into a motor already dangerously souped up. And his Administration's disregard of speculative lending, costly takeovers and financial gamesmanship is a governmental scandal that will haunt us for years to come. The current fragility of our financial system is terrifying.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Malabre offers a spartan regime of higher taxes, less spending on entitlement programs and more stringent regulation. He proposes a lengthy list of budget cuts, from reducing school lunch programs to paring down small-business loans, and another equally lengthy list for expanded spending, from recruiting an army of savings and loan investigators to repairing our decrepit highways. (At the last moment, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait made him modify his hopes for the "peace dividend.") Again, the lists are sound but not new. Mr. Malabre should have enunciated broad principles of budgetary reform instead of piling up details. By the end, he has not so much persuaded the reader as wrestled him, weary, to the ground.

Tradition as Change
 
Roxana Waterson argues that "tradition" within a society is actually an active, essential process that never ceases accumulating and discarding ideas -- rather than the unthinking worship of the past with which we often confuse the term. This is from "The Living House: An Anthropology of Architecture in South-East Asia" (Oxford University).
It is not only in Western cultures that a bias is evident toward an understanding of tradition as something deserving of reverence, which ought to be upheld without change. It has a tendency to become equated with stasis, whereas its implied opposite -- "modernity" or "modernization" -- is just as indissolubly equated with change. But "tradition" really describes a process of handing down, and as such is just as dynamic and as historical as any other social process. The idea of tradition, however . . . and its clash with the ideology of modernization, as this is translated into action in the form of national policies, for example . . . are also a part of the total social dynamic and need to be considered as such. Tradition, like history, is something that is continually being recreated and remodelled in the present, even as it is represented as fixed and unchangeable.
 
Disposable History

 
 Americans have long been undecided about the importance of history to our lives -- a confusion mirrored in our culture. This is from "Representations: Essays on Literature and Society" by Steven Marcus (Columbia University, paper).
To begin with, the sense of the historical past, the awareness of history and of histories, has always led a relatively precarious existence here. The nineteenth- and early twentieth-century genteel snobberies about our American culture desert and historical vacuum had this much point: that the monuments, the detritus, the archives, the material leavings of the past -- all the visibilia that dot and clot the European landscape -- were simply not to be found here and were therefore not part of a world that Americans internalized. . . . This situation has produced any number of anomalies and contradictions. For example, Americans were and are quite capable of devouring historical romances and seeing limitless numbers of historical movies while at the same time believing with Henry Ford that history is the bunk. Or more recently there is the phenomenon known as urban renewal, in which the term "renewal" regularly means destruction. Our cities are a material part of our history; one way in which we preserve that history is by razing it to the ground.
 
A Mirror With Fur

 
 William Matthews offers an engaging portrait of a pet as a poet's muse in the poem "Every Dog Has a Silver Lining." This is from "Blues if You Want" (Houghton Mifflin).
There's no marled froth grizzling its snout.
It won't sit on your chest when you wake up,
and snarl and lick you fetchingly. It doesn't eat
when you're depressed. Its motto is Quo vadis.
It's like a mirror with fur. You'd kick it
if you could. When your friends ask "Where's Bill these days?" it tells them "Bill's working on his book.
He's drowned his phone in the East River."
If you should mope instead of work, it takes
you for a walk. "Remember how you always said
how much you'd love a dog," it will explain
to you, should you grow blue. "Well, now you do."
 
The Discovery of Boredom

 
 Wayne C. Booth offers a witty history of the rise of boredom -- an affliction that gained prominence only with the onset of modern times. This is from "The Vocation of a Teacher: Rhetorical Occasions 1967-1988" (University of Chicago, paper).
Before the romantic individual was invented, people suffered from things like tedium vitae, melancholia, the spleen, or ennui, all of them internal conditions. The Copernican Revolution occurred when people began blaming everybody but themselves for their condition. The first Englishman recorded as using "bore" as a transitive verb was apparently Earl Carlisle, in 1768, and as you would expect, he and his contemporaries blamed it all on the French: it was "the French bore" and it was Frenchmen who bored. . . . Within another fifty years the notion was fully developed that boredom was what the world threatened clever people with. As Lord Byron put it: "Society is now one polished horde, / Formed of two mighty tribes, the bores and bored."
 
A Play as Real as Life

 
 Wendy Smith re-creates one of the more stirring moments in the modern American theater: the overwhelming reaction of the opening night audience in 1935 to the climactic scene in Clifford Odets's militant play "Waiting for Lefty," in which the oppressed workers declare a strike. This is from "Real Life Drama: The Group Theatre and America, 1931-1940" (Knopf).
Suddenly the entire audience, some 1,400 people, rose and roared, "Strike! Strike!" The actors froze, stunned by the spontaneous demonstration. The militant cries gave way to cheers and applause so thunderous the cast was kept onstage for forty-five minutes to receive the crowd's inflamed tribute. "When they couldn't applaud any more, they stomped their feet," said Ruth Nelson. "All I could think was, 'My God, they're going to bring the balcony down!' It was terrible, it was so beautiful." The actors were all weeping. . . . When the astounded stage manager finally rang down the curtain, they remained out front, talking and arguing about the events in a play that seemed as real to them as their own lives. Actors and playwright were overwhelmed and a little frightened by the near-religious communion they had just shared.

PATHS TO RUSSIA
From War to Peace.
By F. Wilhelm Christians.
Translated by Joachim Neugroschel.
Foreword by Helmut Schmidt.
236 pp. New York:
Macmillan Publishing Company. $24.95. 
 These days it is almost poignant to recall Lenin's confident prediction, "The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them." (Whether Lenin ever really said this is another matter.) As the Soviet Union's economy collapses before our eyes, the West ponders whether there is anything it can, or should, do to try to avert utter chaos in what remains of the Soviet empire.
Now comes a timely memoir by one of Europe's most powerful bankers, who has done business with Moscow for some 20 years and was, in early 1985, the first Westerner invited to meet the new General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev. In "Paths to Russia," F. Wilhelm Christians, the chairman of the supervisory board of Deutsche Bank, relates with bracing clarity his experiences in financing some of the most ambitious projects in Soviet history, from the Yamal pipeline that supplies Europe with Soviet natural gas, to the immense Amur-Baikal-Magistrale railroad project.
Mr. Christians encountered his share of animosity from the United States Government for his role in such undertakings, and at times he tries, though unpersua sively, to justify them as attempts at furthering international understanding. One cannot help wondering, though, whether Mr. Christians' real object was the pursuit of the almighty Deutsche mark. He is, after all, a businessman.
Nevertheless, this memoir, fluidly translated by Joachim Neugroschel, is a rare glimpse into the mind of an extraordinarily influential European banker, a type that normally prefers discreet silence, and for that reason alone it is valuable. Unusual among businessmen who have journeyed to Moscow, Mr. Christians appears to have a rich appreciation for Russian culture and a shrewd understanding of the workings of the Soviet bureaucratic mind. "Paths to Russia" is not without its narrative longueurs (can anyone who doesn't stand to make some money off it really care very much about the Kaliningrad industrial zone?), yet the book is enlivened by some intriguing tales of how inextricably entangled Soviet trade has always been with politics.
In the winter of 1969, Mr. Christians went to Moscow as a representative of Deutsche Bank and head of a German banking syndicate. (He tells us that previously, as a young lieutenant in Hitler's Wehrmacht, he had visited the Soviet Union under somewhat different circumstances.) Politics held sway over every deal he made from then on -- but Mr. Christians rarely if ever let it get in the way of business.
Late in 1979 he was urgently summoned to Moscow to discuss plans for building the Yamal natural-gas pipeline. Twelve days later Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan. Mr. Christians is curiously silent about why (despite what he calls "negative worldwide reaction" to the Afghan incursion) Deutsche Bank evidently gave no thought to calling off the deal. His rather tame way of expressing displeasure was to cancel a posh reception in Moscow to which he had invited the Russians to enjoy German draft beer and Bavarian white sausages. The negotiations, of course, proceeded apace.
And when the Reagan White House, in the spring of 1982, sent what Mr. Christians describes in an almost comic scene as "seven men in dark suits" to "question" him about the pipeline, as an expression of American concern about expanded German economic ties with the Soviet Union, he argued that the deal was intended as "a modest contribution to a very difficult and lengthy process of easing tensions." How this was supposed to work, and whether it did, are questions he does not address.
In a provocative final chapter, Mr. Christians says that only by helping to rebuild the Soviet Union -- by helping Mr. Gorbachev's Government directly -- will the West be able to integrate the Soviet Union into a united Europe. Mr. Christians is convinced that "massive Western assistance" to Moscow will save the Soviet Union from utter chaos and internecine bloodshed and give us a "historic chance of a restructuring for the entire European continent."
His advice is undoubtedly well-meaning but, finally, misguided. International bankers like Mr. Christians sometimes view the Soviet Union as a huge corporation that is simply in need of a healthy infusion of capital, maybe a management overhaul. But helping to strengthen Mr. Gorbachev's regime (as against, for example, the increasingly independent republics and the fledgling democratic movements) may in fact retard genuine political and economic reform. As the example of South Korea so vividly demonstrates, capitalism and democracy don't always go hand in hand. The transformation to a democratic system ultimately isn't something that can be purchased, with dollars or with marks.

HEADLINE: Secession of the Successful

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich teaches political economy at Harvard University. This article is adapted from his book, "The Work of Nations: Preparing Ourselves for 21st-Century Capitalism," to be published in March by Alfred A. Knopf.

 BODY:
The idea of "community" has always held a special attraction for Americans. In a 1984 speech, President Ronald Reagan celebrated America's "bedrock" -- "its communities where neighbors help one another, where families bring up kids together, where American values are born." Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, with a very different political leaning, has been almost as lyrical. "Community . . . is the reality on which our national life has been founded," he said in 1987.
There is only one problem with this picture. Most Americans no longer live in traditional communities. They live in suburban subdivisions bordered by highways and sprinkled with shopping malls, or in tony condominiums and residential clusters, or in ramshackle apartment buildings and housing projects. Most of them commute to work and socialize on some basis other than geographic proximity. And most people pick up and move to a different neighborhood every five years or so. 
 But Americans generally have one thing in common with their neighbors: they have similar incomes. And that simple fact lies at the heart of the new community. This means that their educational backgrounds are likely to be similar, that they pay roughly the same in taxes, and that they indulge in the same consumer impulses. "Tell
me someone's ZIP code," the founder of a direct-mail company once bragged, "and I can predict what they eat, drink, drive -- even think."
Americans who own their homes usually share one political cause with their neighbors: a near obsessive concern with maintaining or upgrading property values. And this common interest is responsible for much of what has brought neighbors together in recent years. Complete strangers, although they may live on the same street or in the same condominium complex, suddenly feel intense solidarity when it is rumored that low-income housing will be constructed in their midst or that a poorer school district will be consolidated with their own.
The renewed emphasis on "community" in American life has justified and legitimized these economic enclaves. If generosity and solidarity end at the border of similarly valued properties, then the most fortunate can be virtuous citizens at little cost. Since most people in one neighborhood or town are equally well off, there is no cause for a guilty conscience. If inhabitants of another area are poorer, let them look to one another. Why should we pay for their schools?
So the argument goes, without acknowledging that the critical assumption has already been made: "we" and "they" belong to fundamentally different communities. Through such reasoning, it has become possible to maintain a self-image of generosity toward, and solidarity with, one's "community" without bearing any responsibility to "them" -- the other "community."
America's high earners -- the fortunate top fifth -- thus feel increasingly justified in paying only what is necessary to insure that everyone in their community is sufficiently well educated and has access to the public services they need to succeed.

LAST YEAR, THE TOP FIFTH of working Americans took home more money than the other four-fifths put together -- the highest portion in postwar history. These high earners will relinquish somewhat more of their income to the Federal Government this year than in 1990 as a result of last fall's tax changes, although considerably less than in the late 1970's, when the tax code was more progressive. But the continuing debate over whether the wealthy are paying their fair share of taxes obscures a larger issue, with more profound implications for America: the fortunate fifth is quietly seceding from the rest of the nation.
This is occurring gradually, without much awareness by members of the top group -- or, for that matter, by anyone else. And the Government is speeding this process as Washington shifts responsibility for many public services to state and local governments.
The secession is taking several forms. In many cities and towns, the wealthy have in effect withdrawn their dollars from the support of public spaces and institutions shared by all and dedicated the savings to their own private services. As public parks and playgrounds deteriorate, there is a proliferation of private health clubs, golf clubs, tennis clubs, skating clubs and every other type of recreational association in which costs are shared among members. Condominiums and the omnipresent residential communities dun their members to undertake work that financially strapped local governments can no longer afford to do well -- maintaining roads, mending sidewalks, pruning trees, repairing street lights, cleaning swimming pools, paying for lifeguards and, notably, hiring security guards to protect life and property. (The number of private security guards in the United States now exceeds the number of public police officers.)
Of course, wealthier Americans have been withdrawing into their own neighborhoods and clubs for generations. But the new secession is more dramatic because the highest earners now inhabit a different economy from other Americans. The new elite is linked by jet, modem, fax, satellite and fiber-optic cable to the great commercial and recreational centers of the world, but it is not particularly connected to the rest of the nation.
That is because the work this group does is becoming less tied to the activities of other Americans. Most of their jobs consist of analyzing and manipulating symbols -- words, numbers or visual images. Among the most prominent of these "symbolic analysts" are management consultants, lawyers, software and design engineers, research scientists, corporate executives, financial advisers, strategic planners, advertising executives, television and movie producers, and other workers whose job titles include terms like "strategy," "planning," "consultant," "policy," "resources" or "engineer."
These workers typically spend long hours in meetings or on the telephone and even longer hours in planes or hotels -- advising, making presentations, giving briefings and making deals. Periodically, they issue reports, plans, designs, drafts, briefs, blueprints, analyses, memorandums, layouts, renderings, scripts or projections. In contrast with people whose jobs tend to be tedious and repetitive, symbolic analysts find their work varied and intellectually challenging. In fact, the work is often enjoyable.
These symbolic analysts are in ever greater demand in a world market that places an increasing value on identifying and solving problems. Requests for their software designs, financial advice or engineering blueprints come from all parts of the globe. This largely explains why most (but by no means all) symbolic analysts have become wealthier, even as the ever-growing worldwide supply of unskilled labor continues to depress the wages of other Americans.

Successful Americans have not completely disengaged themselves from the lives of their less fortunate compatriots. Some devote substantial resources and energies to helping the rest of society, not through their tax payments, but through voluntary efforts. "Generosity is a reflection of what one does with his or her resources -- and not what he or she advocates the government do with everyone's money," Ronald Reagan said in 1984.
The argument is fair enough. Government is not the only device for redistributing wealth. In his speech accepting the Presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in 1988, George Bush said that the real magnanimity of America was to be found in a "brilliant diversity" of private charities, "spread like stars, like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky."
No nation congratulates itself more enthusiastically on its charitable acts than America; none engages in a greater number of charity balls, bake sales, benefit auctions and border-to-border hand holdings for good causes. Much of this is sincerely motivated and admirable.
But close examination reveals that many of these acts of benevolence do not help the needy. Particularly suspect is the private giving of those in the top income-tax bracket. Studies have revealed that their largess does not flow mainly to social services for the poor -- to better schools, health clinics or recreational centers. Instead, most voluntary contributions of wealthy Americans go to the places and institutions that entertain, inspire, cure or educate wealthy Americans -- art museums, opera houses, theaters, orchestras, ballet companies, private hospitals and elite universities.
And even these charitable contributions are relatively skimpy. Last year, American households with incomes of less than $10,000 gave an average of 5.5 percent of their earnings to charity or to a religious organization; those making more than $100,000 a year gave only 2.9 percent. After the 1986 tax-code overhaul reduced the benefits of charitable giving, the very rich became even stingier. According to Internal Revenue Service data, taxpayers earning $500,000 or more slashed their average donations to $16,062 in 1988 from $47,432 in 1980 .
Corporate philanthropy is following the same general pattern. In recent years, the largest American corporations have been sounding the alarm about the nation's fast deteriorating primary and secondary schools. Few are more eloquent and impassioned about the need for better schools than American executives. "How well we educate all of our children will determine our competitiveness globally, and our economic health domestically, and our communities' character and vitality," said a report of The Business Roundtable, a New York-based association of top executives.
Accordingly, there are numerous "partnerships" between corporations and public schools: scholarships for poor children qualified to attend college, and programs in which businesses adopt individual schools by making conspicuous donations of computers, books and, on occasion, even money. That such activities are loudly touted by corporate public relations staffs should not detract from the good they do.
Despite the hoopla, business donations to education and charitable causes actually tapered off markedly in the 1980's, even as the economy boomed. In the 1970's, corporate giving to education jumped an average of 15 percent a year. In 1990, however, giving was only 5 percent over that in 1989; in 1989 it was 3 percent over 1988. Moreover, most of this money goes to colleges and universities -- in particular, to the alma maters of symbolic analysts, who expect their children and grandchildren to follow in their footsteps. Only 1.5 percent of corporate giving in the late 1980's was to public primary and secondary schools.
Notably, these contributions have been smaller than the amounts corporations are receiving from states and communities in the form of subsidies or tax breaks. Companies are quietly procuring such deals by threatening to move their operations -- and jobs -- to places around the world with a more congenial tax climate. The paradoxical result has been even less corporate revenue to spend on schools and other community services than before. The executives of General Motors, for example, who have been among the loudest to proclaim the need for better schools, have also been among the most relentless in pursuing local tax abatements and in challenging their tax assessments. G.M.'s successful efforts to reduce its taxes in North Tarrytown, N.Y., where the company has had a factory since 1914, cut local revenues by $1 million in 1990, part of a larger shortfall that forced the town to lay off scores of teachers.

THE SECESSION OF the fortunate fifth has been most apparent in how and where they have chosen to work and live. In effect, most of America's large urban centers have splintered into two separate cities. One is composed of those whose symbolic and analytic services are linked to the world economy. The other consists of local service workers -- custodians, security guards, taxi drivers, clerical aides, parking attendants, sales people, restaurant employees -- whose jobs are dependent on the symbolic analysts. Few blue-collar manufacturing workers remain in American cities. Between 1953 and 1984, for example, New York City lost about 600,000 factory jobs; in the same interval, it added about 700,000 jobs for symbolic analysts and service workers.
The separation of symbolic analysts from local service workers within cities has been reinforced in several ways. Most large cities now possess two school systems --a private one for the children of the top-earning group and a public one for the children of service workers, the remaining blue-collar workers and the unemployed. Symbolic analysts spend considerable time and energy insuring that their children gain entrance to good private schools, and then small fortunes keeping them there -- dollars that under a more progressive tax code might finance better public education.
People with high incomes live, shop and work within areas of cities that, if not beautiful, are at least esthetically tolerable and reasonably safe; precincts not meeting these minimum standards of charm and security have been left to the less fortunate.
Here again, symbolic analysts have pooled their resources to the exclusive benefit of themselves. Public funds have been spent in earnest on downtown "revitalization" projects, entailing the construction of clusters of post-modern office buildings (complete with fiber-optic cables, private branch exchanges, satellite dishes and other communications equipment linking them to the rest of the world), multilevel parking garages, hotels with glass-enclosed atriums, upscale shopping plazas and galleries, theaters, convention centers and luxury condominiums.
Ideally, these complexes are entirely self-contained, with air-conditioned walkways linking residences, businesses and recreational space. The lucky resident is able to shop, work and attend the theater without risking direct contact with the outside world -- that is, the other city.
Carrying the principle a step further, several cities have begun authorizing property owners in certain affluent districts to assess a surtax on local residents and businesses for amenities unavailable to other urban residents, services like extra garbage collections, street cleaning and security. One such New York district, between 38th and 48th Streets and Second and Fifth Avenues, raised $4.7 million from its residents in 1989, of which $1 million underwrote a private force of uniformed guards and plainclothes investigators. The new community of people with like incomes and with the power to tax and enforce the law is thus becoming a separate city within the city.
When not living in urban enclaves, symbolic analysts are increasingly congregating in suburbs and exurbs where corporate headquarters have been relocated, research parks have been created, and where bucolic universities have spawned entrepreneurial ventures. Among the most desirable of such locations are Princeton, N.J.; northern Westchester and Putnam Counties in New York; Palo Alto, Calif.; Austin, Tex.; Bethesda, Md., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
Engineers and strategists of American auto companies, for example, do not live in Flint or Saginaw, Mich., where the blue-collar workers reside; they cluster in their own towns of Troy, Warren and Auburn Hills. Likewise, the vast majority of the financial specialists, lawyers and executives working for the insurance companies of Hartford would never consider living there; after all, Hartford is the nation's fourth-poorest city. Instead, they flock to Windsor, Middlebury, West Hartford and other towns that are among the wealthiest in the country.
This trend, too, has been growing for decades. But technology has accelerated it. Today's symbolic analysts linked directly to the rest of the globe can choose to live and work in the most pastoral of settings.
The secession has been encouraged by the Federal Government. For the last decade, Washington has in effect shifted responsibility for many public services to local governments. At their peak, Federal grants made up 25 percent of state and local spending in the late 1970's. Today, the Federal share has dwindled to 17 percent. Direct aid to local governments, in the form of programs introduced in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations, has been the hardest hit by budget cuts. In the 1980's, Federal dollars for clean water, job training and transfers, low-income housing, sewage treatment and garbage disposal shrank by some $50 billion a year, and Washington's share of spending on local transit declined by 50 percent. (The Bush Administration has proposed that states and localities take on even more of the costs of building and maintaining roads, and wants to cut Federal aid for mass transit.) In 1990, New York City received only 9.6 percent of all its revenue from the Federal Government, compared with 16 percent in 1981.
States have quickly transferred many of these new expenses to fiscally strapped cities and towns, with a result that by the start of the 1990's, localities were bearing more than half of the costs of water and sewage, roads, parks, welfare and public schools. In New York State, the local communities' share has risen to about 75 percent of these costs.
Cities and towns with affluent inhabitants can bear these burdens relatively easily. Poorer ones, faced with the twin problems of lower incomes and greater demand for social services, have had far more difficulty. And as the gap between the richest and poorest communities has widened, the shift in responsibility for public services to cities and towns has functioned as another means of relieving wealthier Americans of the cost of aiding less fortunate citizens.
The result has been a growing inequality in basic social and community services. While the city tax rate in Philadelphia, for example, is about triple that of communities around it, the suburbs enjoy far better schools, hospitals, recreation and police protection. Eighty-five percent of the richest families in the greater Philadelphia area live outside the city limits, and 80 percent of the region's poorest live inside. The quality of a city's infrastructure -- roads, bridges, sewage, water treatment -- is likewise related to the average income of its inhabitants.
The growing inequality in government services has been most apparent in the public schools. The Federal Government's share of the costs of primary and secondary education has dwindled to about 6 percent. The bulk of the cost is divided about equally between the states and local school districts. States with a higher concentration of wealthy residents can afford to spend more on their schools than other states. In 1989, the average public-school teacher in Arkansas, for example, received $21,700; in Connecticut, $37,300.
Even among adjoining suburban towns in the same state the differences can be quite large. Consider three Boston-area communities located within minutes of one other. All are predominantly white, and most residents within each town earn about the same as their neighbors. But the disparity of incomes between towns is substantial.
Belmont, northwest of Boston, is inhabited mainly by symbolic analysts and their families. In 1988, the average teacher in its public schools earned $36,100. Only 3 percent of Belmont's 18-year-olds dropped out of high school, and more than 80 percent of graduating seniors chose to go on to a four-year college.
Just east of Belmont is Somerville, most of whose residents are low-wage service workers. In 1988, the average Somerville teacher earned $29,400. A third of the town's 18-year-olds did not finish high school, and fewer than a third planned to attend college.
Chelsea, across the Mystic River from Somerville, is the poorest of the three towns. Most of its inhabitants are unskilled, and many are unemployed or only employed part time. The average teacher in Chelsea, facing tougher educational challenges than his or her counterparts in Belmont, earned $26,200 in 1988, almost a third less than the average teacher in the more affluent town just a few miles away. More than half of Chelsea's 18-year-olds did not graduate from high school, and only 10 percent planned to attend college.
Similar disparities can be found all over the nation. Students at Highland Park High School in a wealthy suburb of Dallas, for example, enjoy a campus with a planetarium, indoor swimming pool, closed-circuit television studio and state-of-the-art science laboratory. Highland Park spends about $6,000 a year to educate each student. This is almost twice that spent per pupil by the towns of Wilmer and Hutchins in southern Dallas County. According to Texas education officials, the richest school district in the state spends $19,300 a year per pupil; its poorest, $2,100 a year.
The courts have become involved in trying to repair such imbalances, but the issues are not open to easy judicial remedy.
The four-fifths of Americans left in the wake of the secession of the fortunate fifth include many poor blacks, but racial exclusion is neither the primary motive for the separation nor a necessary consequence. Lower-income whites are similarly excluded, and high-income black symbolic analysts are often welcomed. The segregation is economic rather than racial, although economically motivated separation often results in de facto racial segregation. Where courts have found a pattern of racially motivated segregation, it usually has involved lower-income white communities bordering on lower-income black neighborhoods.
In states where courts have ordered equalized state spending in school districts, the vast differences in a town's property values -- and thus local tax revenues -- continue to result in substantial inequities. Where courts or state governments have tried to impose limits on what affluent communities can pay their teachers, not a few parents in upscale towns have simply removed their children from the public schools and applied the money they might otherwise have willingly paid in higher taxes to private school tuitions instead. And, of course, even if statewide expenditures were better equalized, poorer states would continue to be at a substantial disadvantage.
In all these ways, the gap between America's symbolic analysts and everyone else is widening into a chasm. Their secession from the rest of the population raises fundamental questions about the future of American society. In the new global economy -- in which money, technologies and corporations cross borders effortlessly -- a citizen's standard of living depends more and more on skills and insights, and on the infrastructure needed to link these abilities to the rest of the world. But the most skilled and insightful Americans, who are already positioned to thrive in the world market, are now able to slip the bonds of national allegiance, and by so doing disengage themselves from their less favored fellows. The stark political challenge in the decades ahead will be to reaffirm that, even though America is no longer a separate and distinct economy, it is still a society whose members have abiding obligations to one another.

HEADLINE: SoHo Stares at Hard Times

BYLINE: BY JAMES SERVIN; James Servin has contributed articles on the arts to 7 Days.

 BODY:
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, MARGO DOLAN AND her husband, Peter Maxwell, dealers in contemporary art, ambitiously absorbed the gallery next to their New York headquarters at 156 Wooster Street. It was an effortless expansion. The newly acquired, 3,500-square-foot space already boasted the typical gallery accouterments: track lighting and a small kitchen.
Over a candlelit dinner, the couple toasted their staff and their success. Ceremoniously, they chose to have the dinner not in a restaurant but in the vacant new space. 
 Today, Dolan/Maxwell's logo has been scraped from the building's enormous first-floor windows. The gallery stands empty. Dolan/Maxwell's demise (and subsequent retreat to Philadelphia) was accompanied last fall by the closing of the Paula Allen Gallery, the Joe Fawbush Gallery and the Penine Hart Gallery, as the struggling, smaller galleries outside the superstar orbit of Leo Castelli, Sonnabend and Pace fell victim to 1990's anemic market, which nearly everyone in SoHo agrees was the worst the contemporary-art world has ever witnessed. Lisa Giamella, the SoHo editor of Art Now's Gallery Guide, says that by this spring, another cluster of SoHo's galleries will have disappeared.
Nine months after Dolan and Maxwell's celebrated expansion, they grimly composed what amounted to two letters of resignation. The first letter, dated Oct. 18, was mailed to 900 New York City business acquaintances. "Dear Colleague," it read, "We want you to know in our own words, outside the rumor mill, that we have decided to close the gallery space in New York -- at least for the next year or so. The current dire economic climate has, unfortunately, claimed our New York space as a victim." Their second letter was mailed to 15 or so artists and more intimately explained that the gallery had negotiated with banks, retained a financial adviser and searched for additional backing with little success.
"If this autumn had been a normal one," it read, "we feel strongly that we would have pulled the gallery into solvency. However, we were close enough to the edge to be pulled into insolvency by extrinsic circumstances."
These extrinsic circumstances, Dolan explains, leaning forward on a chair in her office, are as general as "the uncertain political climate, a gyrating stock market, an unstable real-estate market, the threat of war in the Middle East." And as specific as the fact that in 1990, Dolan/ Maxwell's business dropped drastically."It was like turning off a faucet," she says.

As a malaise settles into the galleries of SoHo, dealers with uncertain futures in the market are plagued with feelings of paranoia and vertigo. "It's like a virus," one dealer says of the galleries closing around him. "As it spreads, chances are that it will happen to you." (Although more than 250 galleries remain in SoHo, many are looking to economize and consolidate. Julian Pretto, for instance, who had boasted three SoHo locations, now has only one.)
Leo Castelli, the father of the contemporary art world and still one of its most influential figures, put it this way: "The great wave of optimism we had over a year ago, the tremendous prices of famous painters and not-so-famous ones achieved at auctions, has changed. We had sales last spring that were . . . uh, not so good. The regular collectors, the people who really care for the art whether or not it goes up or down, will go on buying. In other words, the market will be more selective."
Remarkably, the anxiety isn't palpable on the weekends, when crowds converge on the 26-block J-shaped area south of Houston Street and north of Canal Street known as SoHo. There is festivity and fashion; street musicians serenade an ongoing parade of out-of-town voyeurs. Belying the vitality of SoHo's crowded streets and its appearance of economic well-being, however, is the abundance of for-lease signs plastered on the windows of first-floor commercial spaces.
Nevertheless, at the corner of Prince and Greene Streets a smiling young man exclaims, "Art!" and points to crudely painted canvases clipped to a chain fence. He introduces himself as "Marco, the artist." "All of these canvases are waterproof oil," he says. "They're all under $100. You should buy one. In a couple of years, they'll quadruple in value."
Such bravado epitomized the art world of the 80's, when swaggering art celebrities like Julian Schnabel declared themselves mythic heroes, the next Jackson Pollocks. But no matter how fashionable it may have become today to bash self-promotors, their method is still a time-proven way to win over collectors, if not critics. Says Martin Margulies, a Miami-based collector of works by emerging artists: "It's extremely simple. What makes an artist popular? A consensus."
David Row, an abstract artist with the John Good gallery, built his consensus like this: in 1986 he met Good, a young dealer who had made many contacts while working with Leo Castelli for five years. Good took Row to a party thrown by Mera and Donald Rubell, who days later purchased a Row canvas for $2,800.
For Row's first show, Good made sure each painting was sold before the show opened, with the customary 10 percent discount offered to prominent and influential collectors going to the Rubells. Press was also a crucial factor. Row received a positive review in The New York Times.
Four years, two solo and seven group shows later, Row's prices have climbed from $2,800 to $15,000.
Collectors, for their part, do anything they can to add cachet to their art inventory. They lend to museums, actively court promising new artists and lavishly entertain prominent dealers. Some patronize auction houses to avoid being manipulated by dealers.
"Collecting is the only socially commendable form of greed," declares Eugene Schwartz. He and his wife, Barbara, are part of the small group of high-profile New York collectors that includes Donald and Mera Rubell, S. I. Newhouse and Elaine Dannheisser. Of course, Schwartz is quick to point out that this is greed inspired by a ferocious, undying love for art. Another collector, Emily Spiegel, gushes: "Art? Just talking about it, I'm having palpitations."
There is, Schwartz emphasizes, an infinite difference between collecting art for the love of it and collecting it for that unspeakable purpose -- investment.

BEFORE WALL STREET TOOK NOTICE OF the contemporary-art market in the mid-80's, before the faces of Eugene and Barbara Schwartz were splashed across the cover of the April 1987 issue of New York magazine, headlined "Art Fever," SoHo was a shell of cast-iron buildings desirable only to doll and textile manufacturers and a few renegade artists.
From the late 1950's to 1971, artists dwelled illegally in the spacious, if rundown, lofts. They constantly battled eviction notices, but with time a symbiotic relationship formed between landlords and tenants.
In 1968, Paula Cooper, a enterprising young dealer, opened the first gallery south of Houston Street, a 5,000-square-foot loft. Her first show was a benefit for student and veteran antiwar groups. Until then, contemporary art tended to be relegated to pockets along 57th Street.
By opening her SoHo gallery, Cooper made the downtown art scene completely autonomous from the Upper East Side. She acknowledged the SoHo art world's viability by meeting it in its still technically illegal work space.
By 1971, after much pressure from SoHo inhabitants, the city declared that artists could live and work in factory lofts without threat of eviction, and SoHo fast became the world's official center for contemporary art. That year, Leo Castelli moved his contemporary-art business from the Upper East Side to 420 West Broadway. Boutiques and restaurants followed; realtors, seizing on a burgeoning market, drove away resident artists more effectively than city inspectors ever could. By 1975, 84 galleries had opened in SoHo. As a final seal of approval, the cast-iron factories were declared historic landmarks.
From his "factory" at Union Square, Andy Warhol looked down to SoHo, where Leo Castelli represented him. SoHo, in turn, looked to Warhol as the 70's gave way to the 80's and Reaganomics. From 1979 to 1988, Christie's and Sotheby's saw an enormous surge in growth. In 1979-1980, only 14 postwar paintings sold for $1 million or more; in 1987-1988, the figure rocketed to 121. In that same year the two auction houses together recorded over $3 billion in sales of art.
The commercialism that Warhol had espoused -- art is a business, commerce is an art -- encouraged young dealers and artists to meet the sudden demand. Names like Schnabel, Robert Longo and Jean-Michel Basquiat were selling like old masters, and the dealers representing them looked very smart indeed.
"Artists are the rock stars of the 80's," declared the nightclub impresario Steve Rubell (the late brother of Donald Rubell). They posed for Gap ads and contributed their work to Absolut Vodka ad campaigns. Andy Warhol was a guest star on "The Love Boat."
In 1986, a painting by Ross Bleckner sold for $30,000. Two years later, when the number of galleries in SoHo had risen from 100 to 250, it resold for $187,000.
"Art was such a hot commodity," says one gallery owner, who insisted on anonymity, "that you actually had to train people to produce for you. Everything sold. My specialty throughout the 80's was making studio visits and 'guiding' a not-so-very-good artist into at least a salable one."
Inevitably, critics raised their antennae, sensing foul play. "Since art of real quality is, if anything, in even shorter supply than usual, the very notion of quality in art has been discarded," sniffed Hilton Kramer in his 1989 essay "An Academy of Kitsch." "To believe in quality would, for one thing, depress the booming art market and, for another, deprive a lot of people of their fun."
John Good recalls a film producer who carried art transparencies with him everywhere. "It was like DeLorean allegedly selling cocaine to finance his car company. He'd say, 'I'm not an art dealer; I'm trying to raise money for my movie.' "
Other dealers speak of Warhols being sent unsolicited over fax machines for round-robin telephone bidding. Collectors began to complain that they had been abandoned by dealers, many of whom instituted "waiting list" policies, which rewarded those who supported a gallery's entire stable of artists with access to its most sought-after works.
Loyalties and business credibility were strained as the market pushed forward. The most glaring sign of an overinflated art boom came in November 1989, when two paintings at Sotheby's, a Jasper Johns and a Willem de Kooning, netted a total of $38 million, $5.6 million more than Sotheby's total contemporary sales in all of 1986.
As the spring of 1990 approached, the financial world turned its attention to the S. &L. crisis, the falling dollar and an uneven Japanese stock market, all of which contributed to pull the rug from under the art world. With the erosion of confidence of those in the financial world, the art market unraveled with astonishing speed. Around the time of the May 1990 contemporary art auctions, Christie's and Sotheby's brought in only half of an expected $100 million. Six months later, the gloom persisted. Of 554 art works expected to sell at the two auction houses, only 332 did, at $49.6 million below their combined lowest estimate. At Sotheby's, a Julian Schnabel canvas failed to elicit a single bid. After some silence, cynical laughter and a round of applause followed.
Collectors expressed some relief at the purge. "Gallery people call me now with good works they really want me to buy," says Agnes Gund, a private collector who is also chairman of the trustees' painting and scupture committee at the Museum of Modern Art. "Last year they wouldn't have thought of me."
"The speculators had the money," says Jeffrey Deitch, a New York-based collector, "but they failed to really get to the center of the art world. They failed to understand that you've got to be at the openings, meet the young artists, the dealers and the critics to get the information you need. It's a full-time job."
Adds Eugene Schwartz: "People were buying on the principle that a Lichtenstein is a Lichtenstein. Well, even Lichtenstein has bad days. The conceptual base of art and the foundation of the stock market are not the same. The myth of art as a good investment was shattered."

Back when there was still promise in SoHo for a young dealer with limited financial backing, Bess Cutler, a native of Boston, opened a medium-size gallery on Mercer Street. After two years of struggle and innovative fund raising, Cutler's gallery finally showed signs of making a profit.
By 1989, the gallery had moved to expanded quarters on Broadway: two floors, 15,000 square feet of space, 12 bathrooms and a conference room. But business was scarcely good enough to warrant, or even maintain, the space. In October 1990, panic set in. Sensing that others in SoHo might be in a similar predicament, Cutler phoned a few friends to organize a support system.
The bottom line on Bess Cutler's attempt to organize a SoHo collective: no one was interested.
"There's such a lack of honesty in the art world," says Cutler. As she talks, she doodles on a napkin with a felt-tip pen. Mostly, she draws sharklike creatures devouring each other.
"Everyone always says, 'Oh, I hear so-and-so's doing poorly, but I'm doing great,' " she says. "Still, I thought maybe five of us could have a discussion about what we could do to bring in more business and activate our markets. Well, they had no initiative and I just said, 'Forget it.' "
Since the art world wasn't willing to go into group therapy with Cutler, she and her associate, Herbert Swartz, found coping mechanisms of their own. They developed markets in places like Texas, Miami and the Midwest, where collectors still welcome overtures from New York dealers.
A year ago, Cutler says, business used to come right through the door. Now, she says: "Everything's push, push, push. I used to give my assistant a list of five collectors a day to call. Now I give her 30. A lot of other galleries don't bother. They'll call the same collectors -- the Rubells, the Schwartzes, whomever. They'll keep trying those same 10 names. Those dealers are out of action now."

ONE OF THE MOST TELLING SYMPTOMS OF distress in the downtown art world has been the persistent rumor that the Mary Boone Gallery is bankrupt. Boone, one of the most successful dealers of the 80's, brought Julian Schnabel, Eric Fischl, David Salle and Ross Bleckner to stratospheric career peaks.
Boone understood the 80's art-world game: "Placing the painter in certain shows, getting the right attention from the right art magazines, throwing the right parties at the right clubs: it's all so very important," she said in 1982.
Her undoing, it was said, had to do with her policy of buying back her artists' paintings at auctions at astronomical prices in order to keep their market value artificially inflated. Last summer, Boone began to find herself in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly defend her business credibility in order to keep investors, collectors and, especially, artists. "Check the bankrupcy courts," she says. "Doesn't anybody do this sort of research?"
Undismayed, she continues to show Eric Fischl, Barbara Kruger and Sherrie Levine. "Unfortunately," she says, her voice rising in scorn, "a lot of people find that they get a great deal of self-importance by saying things as fact when they're not fact. Are we in a recession? We absolutely are. Does it make me go bankrupt? No."
Boone is seated posture perfect at her desk, on which there is a bowl of ivory-colored capsules. Boone has a cold. Talking about the 80's makes her feel worse. The mere mention of art world "mystique" sends Boone into an orbit of rage.
"Baloney!" she fumes. "Art and the quality of art has only very simply to do with the way in which it affects the esthetic historic development of art in this country. Absolutely only. The fact that Leo Castelli is connected to Jasper Johns makes him a prominent dealer. Period. It has nothing to do with mystique. It has to do with quality. Period. Simply to do with quality. It is not marketing, it is not promotion. Period."

PAULA COOPER, WHO OPENED SOHO'S FIRST gallery, is typically diplomatic on the subject of Mary Boone. "Those rumors were probably wishful thinking on the part of a lot of people," she says with a enigmatic smile one Saturday afternoon in her unadorned office.
In SoHo, Cooper is as well known for her long-term commitment to her artists (among them are Joel Shapiro, Elizabeth Murray, Jennifer Bartlett, Carl Andre and Jonathan Borofsky) as she is for presenting such events as music recitals, dance performances and poetry readings in her gallery. When asked for her opinion on the development of SoHo over the last decade, Cooper says, "It's really been kind of vile. Everything's become so opulent and wasteful and fancy. I always wondered how young galleries could afford to do things the way they did: 8-by-10 transparencies, and ab-solute-ly per-fect of-fices, full-page advertisements. I just don't know how they could afford to do it. But now, maybe we can all stop talking about money and start talking about art again."
If the art world is talking about money at all these days, it's talking about cutbacks, about "correction" and "adjustment." People like Bob Crozier, one of Paula Cooper's shippers, are talking about settling into a "mean and lean" period. "A lot of gallery people are working on Mondays," he says. "They never used to. If a collection isn't selling, they're moving it right out of the back rooms and into storage. Everyone's tightening his belt. Even me -- I've cut my night staff, and I've been running six trucks a day, on the average, instead of ten."
On a more rarefied level, the auction houses are lowering price estimates. Christie's has dispensed with the majority of its costly pre-sale, socialite-packed cocktail parties. Sotheby's recently announced that it would no longer lend money to qualified buyers, a policy the auction house promoted in 1988 to provide the credit its customers were requesting. And a recently amended gift tax should encourage more museum donations. (Phillipe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, reported that gifts to the Met fell by 70 percent after a penalizing 1986 tax law.)
But the die-hard inner circle continues to buy. "There's more of an interaction among the artist, the dealer and the collector," says Donald Rubell, who with his wife has a collection of more than 500 works of postwar art, including works by Jeff Koons, Donald Judd and Cindy Sherman. "And there's more time to think about something before you buy it."
The Museum of Modern Art recently purchased a sculpture by an emerging artist, David Hammons, whose work addresses issues of black American heritage. Agnes Gund, who oversaw the acquisition, believes Hammons typifies the next wave of contemporary artists. "He's not from a particular school, and he's not a 'hot' artist from what I call the yuppie line of things," she says. "The art world is seeking its own level now. Everyone knows that it will never go up so high. It will never be the same again."
Paula Cooper has seen more changes than she'd care to. She may have planted the pioneer's flag for SoHo's art community back in 1968, but Cooper has long lost any sentimental attachment to the area.
Beyond SoHo, beyond New York, Cooper has been actively looking in Paris's Marais district for a foreign headquarters for the past year and a half. To many SoHo dealers, the European market is looking increasingly attractive, representing an opportunity, perhaps, to capitalize on the weak American dollar from the other side of the Atlantic. But Cooper's interest dates to the early 80's, when she and the Parisian dealer Yvon Lambert swapped gallery spaces for a month.

LAST NOVEMBER, ALL OF SOHO LOOKED TO the contemporary art auctions with eagerness and dread. A good showing might put to rest the rumors that the art world was in trouble; a bad showing would confirm the negative reports. At Christie's and Sotheby's collectors, dealers, artists, curators -- all the players in the art world -- confronted reality: the disastrous May auctions were no fluke.
Twenty minutes after Christie's evening auction, Bess Cutler's associate, Herbert Swartz, was found around the corner in a coffee shop. "The art world is a business, but it's not run like a business," he groaned. "It's a game of perception. And according to perception, everything's in the gutter." He scribbles some wavy lines on his place mat. "This is the stock market," he says. "It goes up, it goes down, it levels off. It's always shifting. But in the art world," he says, drawing another wavy line, this one with more force, "if a price on a painting goes down at auction, it becomes what's known as 'burned' -- it's stigmatized as a shaky investment. But that's ridiculous. The work doesn't change."
He considers the cover of Christie's catalogue, a nine-panel Warhol self-portrait. The painting fell $1.4 million short of its $3 million lowest estimate and wasn't sold. Bathed in blood-red and orange hues, Warhol's repeated image, with his fingers placed pensively to his mouth, seems to contemplate the consequences of the Faustian bargain art made with commerce in the 80's.
Swartz flips to the final picture. Another Warhol self-portrait. This, a black-and-white rendering of the King of Commerce in a shock wig, also failed to sell. Bidding began at $200,000 and crept slowly upward before stalling at $320,000, whereupon the auctioneer cracked his gavel and murmured, "Pass."
Alongside this self-portrait, the catalogue informed potential buyers that the work was "stamped Andy Warhol and inscribed 'I certify that this is an original painting by Andy Warhol completed by him in 1980.' "
What it didn't say was that this self-portrait had appeared alongside Warhol himself in a print ad for Drexel Burnham Lambert.

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
Finally, a Lincoln Center for American Music

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous

 BODY:
A year or so ago, while on a panel about the arts in this country, I fully meant to rouse the rabble in the audience when I shouted what would become my mantra for the rest of the discussion: "There are no Lincoln Centers for American music!" A bit obvious, but effective.
The upper echelon of American culture has ignored home-grown musical contributions in favor of a music and performing system imported stone by stone from Europe. I felt safe that I would be able to use my grandstanding in lectures for years -- what could possibly change? If, by 1990, the cultural establishment was still avoiding its own backyard, why should things improve soon? 
 I was wrong, and I'm glad for it. A slender beam of light has now broken through the clouds with the unlikely announcement that Lincoln Center plans to set up a jazz department that will eventually be on the same level as the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic, though its projected annual budget of $1 million falls $22 million short of the Philharmonic's. The announcement comes in the wake of another major development: the Lila Wallace/Reader's Digest Fund has begun a $3.4 million endowment to support nonprofit jazz promoters across the country. This is extraordinary news for jazz and culture in the United States, and combined, the new programs begin to deal with some of the institutional bias against jazz.
The announcements were made at a time when there are grave discrepancies between how jazz and European music are treated with respect to prizes, contests, concert halls and public support; the differences seem especially glaring in light of how Europeans have supported and institutionalized jazz. At the same time, jazz is undergoing a renaissance, the likes of which have not been seen since the late 1950's, with more young jazz musicians willing to commit their lives to a difficult, financially precarious art. Repertory companies -- most notably the American Jazz Orchestra and Lincoln Center's Classical Jazz Orchestra -- have revived the idea that important orchestral works from jazz's past deserve live performance.
But major American musical institutions have never fully supported jazz. Obviously, new performing arts centers aren't feasible for economic reasons; free marketers argue that jazz -- because it has a network of nightclubs and developed in ballrooms of the 20's and 30's -- should support itself. But jazz isn't pop music anymore, and it lacks the kind of audience that would support, for example, a big orchestra; like European classical music, it needs underwriting to produce large-scale shows. To adopt jazz into the system makes perfect sense.
The ramifications of this sort of adoption, if done correctly, are immense. For one, it can begin the process of de-ghettoizing, which jazz must still undergo to dispel the predominate images of it as banal happy-time entertainment and primitive, spontaneous emotionalism. If Lincoln Center does what is wanted by Rob Gibson, head of the new department, jazz will appear as often as the New York Philharmonic; there may also be year-round film series and lectures along with the music. Lincoln Center's midsummer Classical Jazz program was a worthy, well-executed series for a handful of nights a year and helped fill a hall that would otherwise have been dark.
But suddenly, the music has become, at least on paper, equal in importance to everything else at Lincoln Center. And the benefits work both ways: as audiences for European classical music age and dwindle, jazz, like the Serious Fun festival at Lincoln Center, will lure a younger crowd.
This is not to argue that jazz as an art needs legitimization: it doesn't, and jazz musicians aren't going to hear this announcement and suddenly begin to take themselves seriously -- they've been doing so for 90 years. But the creation of the program makes it clear to other musical establishments and money-dispensing institutions that the environment has changed, that Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Sonny Rollins, Charlie Parker and Muhal Richard Abrahms have a place in their halls and bankbooks. If the program succeeds, it could mark a watershed in American musical history, one with political implications: the regular inclusion of black culture into the hallowed halls of white culture is unprecedented; it can't come too soon.
A jazz program with the visibility promised by Lincoln Center will also stimulate arguments and thought. Inevitably, anything undertaken on that scale will be scrutinized, argued over, loved and despised; like a reef attracting fish, it will act as a magnet for ideas, innovations, discord and debate, all of which are healthy.
At that panel discussion, someone in the audience complained that to put jazz in Lincoln Center meant the end of the music. The music's creativity comes from clubs, went the argument, and that environment acts as an incubator for ideas and allows musicians the room to experiment, to play in front of a live audience and to learn their craft. The assumption was that once the art enters the institution, all this creativity is eliminated. But a jazz program at Lincoln Center and experimentation at Manhattan clubs like the Knitting Factory or Village Vanguard aren't mutually exclusive. The inclusion of jazz at Lincoln Center is an admission that the music is no longer the mass entertainment it was in the 20's, 30's and 40's -- hardly a revelation. It's also a declaration that jazz has ended one form of life and come alive in another.

HEADLINE: Will the Gulf War Reignite a Battle Over Stock Futures?

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After being in the hot seat for most of last year, Wendy Lee Gramm is not about to start gloating now. "Reports of my victory have been greatly exaggerated," she said recently, in a dry twist of Mark Twain's famous retort about his death.
Mrs. Gramm, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Chicago, appears to have prevailed in her battle to retain control over the trading in stock-index futures, which the Treasury Department had tried to put under the Securities and Exchange Commission's command last year. 
 But even as the dust settles from that fight, a new threat brought on by the war in the Persian Gulf, could return Mrs. Gramm to the political firing line. The furor over stock-index futures, the contracts to buy baskets of securities at a particular price at a future date, popular in the 1980's, could well be eclipsed by worries about speculation in oil.
With warfare in the Middle East, the prices of futures contracts for crude oil, gasoline, heating oil and other commodities are expected to go through their wildest gyrations ever. Indeed, the price of oil dropped by a third, closing on Thursday at $21.44 a barrel, after the first strike on Wednesday by the United States and allied forces on Iraq.
Extreme volatility could cause poorly positioned traders to fail, disrupting commodities markets and putting Mrs. Gramm in the hot seat again. In response to the possibilities, Mrs. Gramm has put the exchanges her agency governs -- the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York and Chicago Mercantile Exchanges -- on red alert.
Among other things, the agency has ordered them to increase their capital requirements on traders, to hunt for traders who could get into trouble by the overwhelming volatility, and to set up emergency lines of credit.
"You can never say you're prepared for every uncertainty," said Mrs. Gramm. "But we have a lot of experience dealing with volatility. This is what we do."
Nevertheless, Mrs. Gramm, who has headed the commodity commission since late 1987, appears to be prepared for another round of political heat. In her power struggle with Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C., and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, she emerged as a steely, technically sophisticated force, overcoming the image she established during Congressional hearings after the stock market crash of 1987 as a somewhat tongue-tied academic who became lost in technical details.
"She has become recognized as a strong and active champion of the agency, and she has succeeded in getting the message across," said Robert Petersen, head of the National Grain Trade Council, one of the groups that fought the Brady proposal. "She's very outspoken, even a bit of a dynamo."
 Still, when Mr. Brady proposed that Congress shift her agency's jurisdiction over stock-index trading to the S.E.C. last spring, Mrs. Gramm appeared to be destined for a political drubbing.
To defend her agency, she had locked horns with Mr. Brady, one of President Bush's closest advisers. Although the commission is an independent regulatory agency, Mrs. Gramm was waging her battle at precisely the time that she was up for renomination by the President.
She also had to overcome harsh criticism. Wall Street has long complained that trading in stock-index futures, which are central to computerized program trading, roils the stock markets.
Critics complain that the agency is unwilling to slow the speculation by raising margin requirements -- the cash deposits required to buy a stock-index futures contract -- to levels closer to those required to trade stocks and bonds.
They also worry about the agency's inability to rein in abuses like the one that resulted in the recent series of indictments against commodities traders, who allegedly favored their own accounts over their customers'.
The mini-crash of the stock market in October 1989, which many on Wall Street blamed on program trading, renewed pressure to put the S.E.C. in charge of stock-index futures. Last spring, Mr. Brady concluded that transferring power to the S.E.C. would make it easier to "coordinate" the different markets by evening out the margin requirements.
But the original Brady proposal was stopped dead in the Senate and a much tamer compromise died in the final days of the last session of Congress.
Last week, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, reintroduced a compromise measure that leaves the agency's power intact but gives the Federal Reserve authority to set margin requirements. The measure, though, would also let stock exchanges, under the S.E.C.'s authority, introduce products that resemble stock-index futures.
Many attribute Mrs. Gramm's success in part to her polite but tenacious determination to champion her agency. Diminutive yet intensely energetic, with a fondness for light-hearted needling, she was praised in the Brady battle for sticking to the issues rather than grandstanding.
"You could fight it on perceptions or, if you had the issues on your side, you could fight it on the issues," said Leo Melamed, who retired as chairman of the executive committee of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange last week. "Her instincts told her to stick to the issues, and that turned out to be the right move."
 Marshalling evidence from academic studies, she was able to show that a shift in jurisdiction would have no effect on the gut political issue of market turbulence. "You look at the proposals, and the reasons people want change, and there aren't any that really hold water," she said.
And thanks to the coaching of Republican supporters, including Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, she also learned to couch her arguments in the rhetoric that Washington understands. "We have become the world leader under this regulatory structure," she likes to say. "We're the ones who have been the innovative leaders in these markets. You don't want to do anything that harms them."
 Most crucial to her victory was the fierce opposition to the Brady plan from agricultural groups like the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, grain traders and commodity exporters. They immediately waged a full-scale lobbying offensive, fearing that reducing the commission's power could inadvertently damage its ability to regulate commodity futures like grain, which farmers use to insulate themselves against price changes.
As the debate proceeded and became increasingly mired in technical issues, lawmakers began to view it as little more than a turf battle between the agencies. On balance, that made the Brady plan seem more controversial and less compelling.
 Her nomination by President Bush in the midst of the battle for a second, two-year term as chairman of the commission also helped solidify her position. She was confirmed by the Senate in August.
In fact, the debate about the market volatility of stock-index futures has since become almost moot. The go-go 80's have evolved into the debt-worried 90's, causing trading in stock-index futures to plunge by about 40 percent since the crash of 1987. Today, the hottest pits at the Chicago Merc, which pioneered stock-index futures, trade Eurodollar contracts, used as hedges against short-term interest rates, and Treasury bond futures, or hedges against long-term rates.
The Persian Gulf conflict has suddenly thrust oil futures into that lineup and prompted the commission to prepare for chaos. For a start, the agency ordered the exchanges to run what amount to computerized war-games, in which computers simulate the impact that a major price jolt would have on particular traders.
These "what if" simulations are not new to traders. But in instructions issued on Dec. 26, the commission told the exchanges to test what seemed like unimaginable price swings -- say, a swing of as much as $15 a barrel in the price of crude oil in a single day -- to pinpoint the most vulnerable traders.
The agency has told so-called clearing firms, which provide traders with day-to-day credit, to look out for traders who, among other things, lack well-established records or who may have loaded up too heavily on a particular commodity.
In addition, the agency is pushing firms to set up special wire-transfer arrangements so that traders can move unusually large amounts of cash to cover their obligations. Fearful that big traders may default anyway, setting up what could be a domino effect of unmet obligations, the regulators have urged clearing companies to arrange extra lines of bank credit.
Finally, the exchanges themselves have dramatically increased the amount of cash traders need to put down as deposits when they buy contracts for oil, gasoline or even stock-index futures.
 
 
A BELTWAY BACKGROUND
 Wendy Gramm is an economist by training. The granddaughter of Korean immigrants -- her grandfather worked in the sugar cane fields of Hawaii -- Mrs. Gramm graduated from Wellesley College and earned a Ph.D. in economics at Northwestern University.
She met her husband, Sen. Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, when she took a teaching job in the department of economics at Texas A&M, where Mr. Gramm was a professor of economics. After Mr. Gramm was elected to Congress in 1978, she was hired by James Miller 3d at the Federal Trade Commission and later followed Mr. Miller to the Office of Management and Budget.
There, as director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, she played a key role in the Reagan Administration's efforts to deregulate industry -- an effort that drew fire from Capitol Hill but earned her kudos in the White House. "One of the things I've found in Washington is that you don't agree with everybody," she said.
On one occasion, President Reagan reportedly called Mrs. Gramm "my favorite economist." He nominated her in 1987 to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

HEADLINE: Roemer's New Tack for Old Problems

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La.

 BODY:
As visitors to the Louisiana governor's mansion pass the guard's desk they are likely to see a photograph of the current occupant showing him in profile with his eyes squinting and his mouth tight. It is very much the angry young man that Buddy Roemer used to be.
The portrait, however, would seem to be out of date. Governor Roemer has recently taken to proclaiming himself a changed man both personally and politically. 
 Mr. Roemer, a Democrat, is seeking re-election this year, and the race promises to be bruising. His likely opponents in one of the major political events of this election cycle are David Duke, the Republican State Representative and former Ku Klux Klan leader who ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate last fall, and Edwin Edwards, the Democrat whom Mr. Roemer unseated in 1987.
A "Roemer revolution" was what the Governor promised in 1988 when he took over a Louisiana government rotted with corruption and on the brink of financial collapse. Back then he was tirelessly righteous in demanding that people follow his prescription for civic salvation.
The preacher's fury that marked his pleas for reform is now rarely seen. Cheerful boosterism has entered his repertory along with self-deprecating jokes, as when Mr. Roemer, a former Congressman with two Harvard degrees, introduces himself as "just an old redneck from Bossier City."
Timothy Ryan, an economist at the University of New Orleans, said: "The Governor came in wanting to make major changes in a blitzkrieg fashion. But now he is taking a much more gradual approach, seeking smaller changes and assuming a lower profile himself."
 
'I Paid a High Price'
 On a more personal level, the Governor said that after going through a divorce last year, "I decided that I wasn't any good to anybody if I didn't have peace and happiness and comfort in this job."
He added: "For my first 30 months in office I tended to be angry. I had good reason to be angry. I fed on my anger. It was a source of energy, but I paid a high price for it."
Taking over what he called "a sinking ship," the Governor faced conditions that in some ways paralleled those confronting governors of financially troubled states today. Mr. Roemer introduced some modern management practices to the baroque, patronage-heavy world of Louisiana government, and he redirected spending toward environmental protection and education.
Louisiana's economic condition stabilized in the aftermath of the collapse of oil prices in the 1980's. And through borrowing and tax increases, the state government moved from monstrous deficits to balanced budgets. As a result, the rating on Louisiana's state bonds improved last month for the first time in 21 years.
But some of Governor Roemer's boldest ideas, including his plan to overhaul Louisiana's tax system to reduce the state's reliance on revenues from the oil and gas industry, were rejected either by the Legislature or by voters in referendums. As a result, Mr. Roemer has altered his tactics.
 
Complicated Campaign Likely
 No longer an angry outsider who can simply denounce the corruption and torpor of the past, the 47-year-old incumbent will have a record to defend in next fall's elections. Moreover, the political dynamics could be complicated by others on the ballot.
Mr. Duke, who appeals to white crowds by telling them how much they suffer when government helps blacks, captured 44 percent of the vote in his first statewide race, challenging the Democratic incumbent Senator, J. Bennett Johnston Jr., last fall.
Announcing his intent to run earlier this month, Mr. Duke said, "If we don't slow down the cycle of taxes and spending our state has been in for so long, I think we are headed for ruin."
Also considering a candidacy is Mr. Edwards, who dominated much of Louisiana politics in the 1970's and 1980's.
Mr. Edwards said in a television appearance last year: "Buddy Roemer is weak. It would be fun to run against him and use his campaign ads from three years ago to remind people what he said on TV then and compare them to what he has actually done."
Under Louisiana's open primary system the Democrats, Governor Roemer and Mr. Edwards, and the Republican, Mr. Duke, and any other candidates would all run against one another on the same ballot Oct. 19. If no one captured more than half the votes, the top two would face off in November.
In a recent interview, the Governor predicted a tangled three-way race. Then, putting down a cigarette, he held his hands far apart to represent Mr. Duke and Mr. Edwards.
"I'm in here," he said, indicating the space between his hands, "and I think the voters will reject the extremes. I think most of us live in the center. I think most of us build our homes on solid land."
As an example of his moderation, Mr. Roemer cited his decision to veto two anti-abortion bills passed by the legislature last summer because, he said, they did not make sufficient exception for victims of rape and incest.
 
'Serious Flamethrower
 Charles Elson Roemer 3d was born in Shreveport and attended school in Bossier City, a town of 50,000. After Harvard, he managed Scopena, the family's cotton plantation, and worked as a business executive and a banker. In 1980, he won a seat in Congress on his second try.
"I was a very serious flamethrower and maverick," he said of his time in Washington, frequently voting with Republicans on economic issues.
When he challenged Governor Edwards, Mr. Roemer was little known outside his Congressional district, but he came from behind to win an eight-way primary. Mr. Edwards, who had been twice tried and acquitted of corruption charges, declined to enter the runoff.
Governor Roemer's most sweeping objective was tax revision. He argued that the state leaned too heavily on business and allowed too many people to avoid property taxes.
In April 1989, after a long and heated campaign, the voters rejected the core of the "Roemer Revolution," defeating by 55 percent to 45 percent a constitutional amendment that would have made extensive tax changes.
"That hit me hard," he said. "I had a period of self-examination. I found that even my allies worried about my anger and I was turning off the people who I needed."
Governor Roemer went before a new session of the legislature last April and made a startling apology. He told the lawmakers: "I felt driven by the desperate conditions to take no prisoners, to tolerate minimum dissent, and to allow my anger at finding Louisiana in such dire straits to guide my approach to you and to this job. Please forgive me if you can."
Some opponents and some of those he offended are skeptical. "At first Buddy wanted us to step in line because he knew best," said Jim Carvin, a New Orleans political consultant. "Now he's saying, 'Do what I say because I'm a nice guy.' What's the difference?"
One difference is that he is now proposing incremental changes, and having far greater success. The voters have affirmed constitutional amendments that created three types of tax increases and made important changes in the way the state's money is handled.
Change has brought Governor Roemer some political risk. "The oil and chemical people feel they've been hit hard on the environmental side by Buddy but haven't seen the big changes he promised on the tax side," said Ed Steimel, a veteran Baton Rouge lobbyist for business interests. "They may back Edwards even if they think he is a scoundrel."

BREAKING BARRIERS
A Memoir.
By Carl T. Rowan.
Illustrated. 395 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $22.95. 
 At the age of 65, after 40 years of high-profile journalism and Government service in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, Carl T. Rowan now looks back, mostly in satisfaction, at a life spent breaking down barriers imposed -- but not for long in his case -- by the structures of race and class in American society.
Mr. Rowan has been moving at a fast clip from the day he boarded a Jim Crow train in his hometown of McMinnville, Tenn., to join the Navy, where at 19 he became one of its first black officers and gentlemen. Determined after the war "to bust open the lily-white journalistic establishment in America," he enrolled at Oberlin College and was encouraged to write by an English teacher who, after reading "an angry bit of prose" he had shown her, told him, "I think you'll make it." Her affirmation, Mr. Rowan writes in "Breaking Barriers," "put 40 years of wind under my wings."
That wind carried him to The Minneapolis Tribune in 1948. After two years on the copy desk, Mr. Rowan went on general assignment with the understanding that, as he told his editor, "You will not assign me to any story simply because I'm a Negro; you will never deny me an assignment simply because I'm a Negro." For The Tribune and Mr. Rowan, the deal paid off quickly. His career soared after he toured the South in 1951 and wrote an 18-part series, "How Far From Slavery?"
His flight path after that took him on assignments at home and abroad and eventually to stints as a State Department spokesman and Ambassador to Finland in the Kennedy Administration. In 1964 President Lyndon B. Johnson named him to succeed the ailing Edward R. Murrow as director of the United States Information Agency. Since leaving that position in 1965 he has been a nationally syndicated columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times and a regular on the television talk show "Inside Washington."
If Mr. Rowan's anecdotally rich memoir is self-serving, so be it. Although there is hardly a scene where he does not give himself either the last word or the best line, that's all right, because the interests of a whole spectrum of readers are well served, too -- from subway riders looking for a quick read to serious students of contemporary American culture, who will treasure his vignettes for what they reveal about the state of race relations in this country during a half-century of convulsive change.
Not everyone will enjoy this book, of course. If he reads it, Ronald Reagan, for one, will hate it. "For all his selective amnesia and his personal charm," Mr. Rowan writes in summary of the Reagan years, "Ronald Reagan knew precisely what he was doing to America and Americans. I would never find reason to forgive him." And if there still are active members of the J. Edgar Hoover Fan Club around, they will be enraged by Mr. Rowan's lingering questions about what role he suspects the Federal Bureau of Investigation played in events leading up to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
But most of all this book will infuriate several prominent black Americans because Mr. Rowan, besides breaking barriers, breaks ranks and dares to speak candidly to his black brothers, from the former Washington Mayor Marion Barry to the former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, from Louis Farrakhan (a "trash-the-Jews demagogue") to the Rev. Jesse Jackson (who is advised to show in 1992 "something other than his ability to run the Democratic Party . . . into the ground").
Not surprisingly, given the amount of publicity it received, Mr. Rowan devotes his penultimate chapter to a straightforward but indignant account of "the shot heard round my world." In June 1988 Mr. Rowan became a cause celebre when he wounded an intruder who was trying to break into his Washington home. The intruder was shot in the wrist by Mr. Rowan, who fired an unregistered pistol. Although the charges filed against him for possessing the weapon were dismissed by a jury, Mr. Rowan, still capable of angry prose, recalls that incident as a time when "fate came close to wiping out every honor I ever received and destroying me personally."
Mr. Rowan comes out in his closing chapter shooting verbally with both barrels, one for whites, the other for blacks.
"White leadership playing to white racism is largely responsible for America's crime, drug, unemployment, education, and other woes," he writes. "But I cannot exhort white America to a new agenda for this nation without first telling my fellow blacks how they have contributed to the malaise within this society. . . . We black people must get away from ceremony and memories and self-congratulations for deeds done a quarter century ago and deal with the problems of today."
It has never been easy -- some would say it is impossible -- to be a prophet with honor on both sides of a biracial society divided against itself. Carl Rowan has tried -- and he has done it far better than most.
 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MOVEMENT?
 You look back over six decades and you see a lot of people, groups, individuals, political parties, that you think have let America down. In every year of breaking barriers I have thought . . . about how we black people have let ourselves down. I still see myriad ways in which we imprison ourselves.
I almost weep when I see what has happened to the civil rights movement, the bloody struggles for racial justice for blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities, and governmental and private compassion for the poor, the hopeless of this land. So much that was won over the bites of police dogs, the truncheons of bigoted cops, has been diluted -- or lost. . . .
I watched on television a black reenactment of the outrages in Selma a generation past. There were Jesse Jackson and a host of others, in Reagan-type photo opportunities, saying, "Look what we did." Tote up the costs of the airplane tickets and hotel rooms of those who put on that exercise of self-applause and see that the money could have provided hundreds of college scholarships to black kids who were abandoned by Reagan.
That reenactment in Selma didn't change a city government that is still driven by notions of "white power forever." Spending that money on bright young blacks could change another generation. -- From "Breaking Barriers."

ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION
By James M. McPherson.
173 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $17.95. 
 The recent surge of popular interest in the Civil War did not begin with last fall's PBS television series; it started in 1988, with the publication of James M. McPherson's one-volume history of the Civil War era, "Battle Cry of Freedom." That 900-page book was a sprawling and comprehensive narrative; now Mr. McPherson follows it with a slim volume of short essays that go right to the heart of the meaning of the war and Abraham Lincoln's role in it. How could the two sides have espoused such opposite notions of liberty? Was the North fighting for union or against slavery? What was Lincoln's real feeling about abolition? And what, finally, did it all achieve? Such questions linger for many students of the war despite all the books. Mr. McPherson, a professor of American history at Princeton University, goes right at them in crystal-clear, well-reasoned, supremely informed essays.
The first and last of these address the giant question of what, ultimately, the war accomplished. Mr. McPherson takes issue with those who, especially in the 1960's and 70's, have argued that the Civil War changed little or nothing, that Lincoln's "new birth of freedom" never happened. The war, he argues, left the regional balance of power in the nation forever reversed, the slavery-based economy of the South devastated and blacks undeniably better off. Moreover, it gave liberty itself a new meaning. Liberty had always meant freedom from government power; the war made it mean freedom of opportunity, which only government power could guarantee. The Federal Government became the agent of freedom rather than its enemy. Many of the revolutionary gains won by the war were overturned in what the author calls a counterrevolution in the mid-1870's, when Reconstruction was abandoned, but that neither diminishes what had passed nor denies what endured.
The five intervening essays examine Lincoln himself -- as a conservative or a revolutionary, as a champion of the shifting concept of liberty, as Commander in Chief, as speaker and writer and, to use Isaiah Berlin's terms, as a steadfast hedgehog among wily, wavering foxes. A central theme connects all of the essays: that the very nature and purpose of the war changed radically from 1861 to 1865 and that Lincoln brilliantly perceived this, guided the conflict and saw it through. At first the war was a limited war, its only aim to put down an insurrection. But between the early Union disaster at Bull Run and the high point of Gettysburg, the conflict evolved into a full-scale war and then into total war -- a death-embrace struggle between two powers neither of which could survive unless the other was completely vanquished. The Union couldn't last if states were free to leave it; the South could not continue without disunion and slavery.
Lincoln uniquely grasped the significance of this as it happened. Since the institutions of the South would have to be smashed before the South would yield, emancipation would have to become a strategy of the war. Since the economy of the South would have to be overthrown, Lincoln would turn to total-war generals like William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan. As emancipation became the cause, it would necessitate a whole new concept of liberty in America: freedom from government intrusion must yield to freedom enforced by government power. Lincoln saw this and gave it eloquent, powerful voice. And Lincoln's resolute single-mindedness enabled him to concentrate un swervingly on preserving the United States while virtually everyone around him hedged and panicked.
He did not consider abolishing slavery until it could become a weapon in preserving the Union. When he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, it liberated not only slaves but also Lincoln himself -- he was now freed, in Mr. McPherson's words, "from the agonizing contradiction between his 'oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free' and his oath of office as president of a slaveholding republic. It fused the 'organizing principle' of liberty that guided Lincoln before 1861 with the 'single central vision' of Union that became his lodestar during the war."
The war proved that a republic could survive in a world of kingdoms and empires. It transformed the concept of liberty. It made the Federal Government supreme where the states had formerly prevailed. It obliterated an archaic, repressive economic system. It enfranchised blacks and created a nation in which -- at least for a time -- troops would protect that franchise. Mr. McPherson deftly and convincingly sketches out how Lincoln's vision and leadership made the necessary revolution possible.

PROMISES KEPT
John F. Kennedy's New Frontier.
By Irving Bernstein.
Illustrated. 342 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $24.95. 
 It was "a wonderful time to come to work for the government," says William L. Batt Jr. about the celebrated thousand days of the Administration of John F. Kennedy. In 1961 Kennedy had plucked Mr. Batt from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry to run a new agency dedicated to reviving the economy of Appalachia and other depressed areas. The sunny words of this idealistic bureaucrat form the leitmotif of Irving Bernstein's careful but flawed study of Kennedy's domestic policies.
"Promises Kept" is a book with a mission. Mr. Bernstein, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, portrays brilliant, energetic young men (and, very occasionally, women) who came to Washington with innovative ideas about curing racial discrimination, structural unemployment, substandard public education and apathy toward government -- fulfilling, in effect, their chief's campaign pledge to "move this country forward." Although seriously hampered by the conservative bloc in Congress, they accomplished far more, Mr. Bernstein maintains, than today's critics on either the right or the left have acknowledged. In his view, Kennedy "was a very successful President" and "the revisionists were dead wrong."
If one's critical yardstick for a Presidency is the number of significant bills signed or advanced far along the Congressional pipeline, then Mr. Bernstein makes a persuasive case. The author, who is best known for writing a fine three-volume history of American labor between the world wars, draws, with a series of lucid narratives, a balance sheet of the issues that Kennedy and his associates came into office to solve. At the time the President embarked on his fateful trip to Dallas, a comprehensive civil rights bill had easily cleared the House Judiciary Committee; the Peace Corps, manpower training and a higher minimum wage had already been enacted into law; final action was almost completed on a measure to pay for construction at many colleges; and, despite the expense of these new programs, Congress was about to pass a tax cut for both individuals and corporations. Only Medicare was stalled, a victim of the American Medical Association's relentless campaign against what it called socialized medicine and of widespread fears of what the first Federal health insurance program might cost.
While gracefully written, Mr. Bernstein's study is not for readers who like their history filled with high drama, intriguing personalities or glimpses of anonymous faces in the crowd. Aside from his chapters on civil rights, which retrace familiar ground, all the subjects he discusses were debated, the bills won or lost, largely within a small network of policy intellectuals, elected officials and their aides. Most had spent their careers battling over the social policy terrain first charted during the New Deal.
In passing, Mr. Bernstein does provide acute thumbnail portraits of a few liberal heroes, such as the cantankerous Senator Wayne Morse, who worked tirelessly for education bills and received Kennedy's praise as "the only man in the Senate who speaks in precise paragraphs without a text." But on the whole, Mr. Bernstein is content to demonstrate, in great detail, how well the President and his men maneuvered through the heavy legislative undergrowth, always willing to compromise in order to gain a higher, enlightened end.
And therein lies the problem. Mr. Bernstein's approach cannot refute more significant criticisms of the New Frontier (and of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the subject of Mr. Bernstein's next book) that transcend the question of which proposals got through Congress. Was the antipoverty program doomed from the start because it didn't attempt to redistribute income, as advocates on the left charge? Did the imposition of new Federal agencies and regulations retard economic growth and punish entrepreneurial initiative, as those on the right contend? Did the decision to emphasize aid to specific groups identified as disadvantaged -- blacks, senior citizens, the chronically unemployed -- alienate middle-class whites who could have been attracted by more universal programs?
To praise the creative energies of the New Frontiersmen and to chronicle their achievements are honorable tasks for an unrepentant liberal. But Mr. Bernstein's account cannot explain why Kennedy's political ideology, as distinct from his iconographic renown, began a steep decline in popularity a few years after his death. In domestic policy, as with the war in Indochina, the best and the brightest failed to comprehend the mounting discontent of the not-so-silent majority.
 
 
WHISPER IT IN GEORGETOWN
 Joseph P. Kennedy, the President-elect's father, had urged his brother for Attorney General. But Robert did not want the job. He was worried about the charge of nepotism. Also, "I had been chasing bad men for three years and I didn't want to spend the rest of my life doing that." Finally, he did not relish the prospect of the "Kennedy brothers" taking the heat on civil rights. He really wanted to be the number two man at Defense responsible for closing the so-called "missile gap." But Robert S. McNamara, the new secretary, thought it would be awkward having the President's brother taking orders from him. John, therefore, reluctantly concluded that Robert should go to Justice. He wanted someone he trusted near at hand and he was certain that Robert would make a fine Attorney General. Both expected sharp criticism. When asked how he would make the announcement, John said, "I'll open the front door of the Georgetown house some morning about 2:00 a.m., look up and down the street, and, if there's no one there, I'll whisper, 'It's Bobby.' " The appointment got a bad press. John tried to laugh it off: He wanted to give his brother "a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law." -- From "Promises Kept."

HEADLINE: HARLEM'S ARDENT VOICE

BYLINE: By Joel Dreyfuss; Joel Dreyfuss is the managing editor of Business Tokyo, a New York-based magazine. He also writes frequently about black-American affairs for various publications.

 BODY:
THE REV. CALVIN O. BUTTS 3D HAS JUST been badly disappointed by a telephone call. His effort to arrange a meeting with a major religious leader has been rejected. Sitting in his modest office, the 20th pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem pauses for a moment to regain his composure. Finally, he leans forward in the way he has of making every conversation seem intimate. An uncommon weariness creeps into his voice. "I came from the left," says Butts, joining his palms over the left edge of his cluttered desk. "I moved to the center because I have this institution." The hands shift to the middle of the desk. "I'm trying to work in the center." He shrugs inside his double-breasted suit. "I don't want people to be surprised when I finally flip out. I want people to know we did try and we were rejected."
The incident is a glimpse at the private battle that rages inside Calvin Butts. Taking control a year and a half ago of what may be the most famous black church in America, he has become one of the most visible new leaders in New York City. The early reviews from church members, politicians and fellow pastors have been good. His church, once led by the flamboyant Adam Clayton Powell Jr., is standing room only on Sundays and the collection plate is full. "Abyssinian," as old-time Harlemites call it, has long been a center of hope and social action for black New Yorkers, and Butts, as the leader of that church, has a following that draws the attention of politicians and positions him as an emerging force for social change. 
 Butts, however, is a product of the 1960's; moderation and compromise, so essential in politics, do not come easily to him. So the 41-year-old pastor is leading a double life. There is the establishment Butts: managing the construction of several multimillion-dollar housing complexes that will serve the elderly and the poor in Harlem; building coalitions with leaders of other black churches; working, until recently, as chairman of the Harlem Y.M.C.A.; joining a group of community leaders hoping to create a replacement for the bankrupt Freedom National Bank. Then there is Butts the protest leader: whitewashing billboards that pitch tobacco and alcohol to blacks and picketing the corporate headquarters of Philip Morris Companies; thundering against police brutality and economic injustice, lashing black and white political leaders for "opportunism" and a "lack of courage"; associating with controversial figures like the lawyers C. Vernon Mason and Alton H. Maddox Jr.; quoting the Black Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan; challenging pillars of the establishment like John Cardinal O'Connor and the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
His ambivalence is similar to the one that blacks have wrestled with for generations. What is the best way to make change? Do you build institutions or do you agitate? Do you work within the establishment or attack it from outside? Do you assimilate or create a black base?
In a city where black leadership is often defined by access to the news media, Butts is a very visible figure. He has been in the spotlight almost since he arrived at Abyssinian as a junior minister in 1972. He has been willing -- some would say eager -- to plunge into controversy and politics, prompting comparisons with the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the politically ambitious minister who used his church base to catapult himself into elected office. "I'm just running for the kingdom of God," Butts says dutifully. But within moments of this denial he talks about the temptations of elected office.
There is no evidence of ambivalence on Sunday mornings, when Butts presides over the rousing service at the Gothic-style church on West 138th Street between Malcolm X Boulevard and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. The congregation is solidly black and middle-class, about evenly divided between elderly and middle-aged Harlem residents and younger, more affluent black professionals who come from the West Side, the boroughs outside Manhattan, from Long Island and New Jersey. European tourists, whispering excitedly in French, Italian and German, shuffle into back pews, anticipating a "real Harlem" experience.
Butts's voice can plummet to a whisper, roar with emotion, cajole, plead and snap with humor as he talks about politics, world affairs or relations between ethnic groups in the city. But his sermons are more cerebral than a lot of Baptists are used to. His talks are sprinkled with learned references: quotations from philosophers and black intellectuals, as well as verse from psalms and spirituals.
One Sunday, Butts asks a man, whom he recognizes from the cover of Black Enterprise magazine, to stand. "I hear you're worth $2.4 million, brother; we want to talk to you," says Butts, to a ripple of laughter. On another Sunday, Butts announces the presence of Marvis Martin, a former choir member who has performed in a Metropolitan Opera production of "Porgy and Bess." She comes forward and quickly establishes the world-class quality of her voice in a spiritual that raises goose bumps. Butts's celebrations of success are not casual. In a community so often identified with failure and pathology, his digressions are reminders that it does have successes and triumphs.
Black involvement in Christianity began when slave owners decided that turning their property into good Christians might help tame the slaves. But the church's teachings, as interpreted by blacks, quickly became a rallying point for resistance, a shelter from the storm of racial prejudice and repression, a safe harbor where black people could walk out recharged and girded for the battles they must wage in a hostile world. It is important to see Butts in this context to remember his primary mission: ministering to his flock.

A MEETING IN BUTTS'S office over a neighborhood dispute shows how charming he can be. An executive and a community affairs director for a telephone company meet with Butts to respond to a community activist's complaints that the utility is cutting services to Harlem. The complaint was triggered when the phone company stopped doing business with a black-owned Harlem company that had been subcontracted to receive phone payments. The phone company representative explains that the subcontractor ran into financial problems. The phone company reopened an uptown office so that Harlem residents could pay bills, place orders and make deposits without traveling downtown.
Butts listens carefully, takes notes and asks questions. He finally seems satisfied that there is no role for him here. He banters with the phone company man. What school did he go to? What church does he attend? Butts seems genuinely disappointed that the man belongs to a congregation on Long Island.
"Well, come to our church when you can."
I will, says the phone company man.
"May I call you if I have a problem?"
Absolutely, says the man, handing over a card with his home number scribbled on the back. Calvin Butts has just acquired a direct line to the senior management of the phone company.
The issues that grab Butts's attention don't always find a tidy resolution. He has been criticized for flitting from one cause to another. "I'm working on that," he says, plowing through a stack of telephone messages and requests for speaking appearances. "I'm learning how to say 'No.' " What about his well-publicized campaign to whitewash billboards advertising liquor and tobacco in Harlem? "It's on hiatus," he concedes, complaining that he didn't get the support of other church leaders.
Some community leaders who depend on tobacco companies for financing and charitable support said their programs were damaged. "Calvin's campaign has been used by companies who did not want to do much in our communities anyway," says Lloyd A. Williams, president of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce. Butts responds that nothing prevents the companies from advertising less-harmful products. But why not continue to picket? He offers a vague explanation about not wanting to let his supporters picket without him because they might get arrested, then acknowledges that things might have gone better with more cooperation from his fellow pastors. "I might have tried harder to enlist their support," he admits.
He has begun to apply the same sort of self-criticism to his relationship with New York politicians. Butts says he has muted his comments about black politicians because of an insight acquired at a meeting with Edward I. Koch, who was then the Mayor. Koch bluntly told a group of black community leaders that he owed them nothing because they had not supported him at the polls. Butts conceded to Koch's raw political logic. He thought about how he himself had criticized a former Manhattan Borough President, Percy E. Sutton, during Sutton's mayoral campaign and how different the meeting might have been had Sutton been behind the Mayor's desk instead of Koch. "I used to fight Charlie Rangel all the time," says Butts, referring to the Democratic Representative from Harlem. "I realized: he's the Congressman. Unless you run against him or support someone against him, you might as well work with him the best you can without compromising your principles."
Butts has been able to work with politicians when he wants to. When Andrew J. Stein was Manhattan Borough President, Butts lobbied him for money for the Harlem Y.M.C.A. The minister came to his office and presented the case for the Y. Then he got Stein to come up to Harlem to see the center. Stein remembers him as forceful and persuasive. "Resources were very scarce," Stein says, "but he convinced us." The Y.M.C.A. got $750,000. Still, it's not only Butts's charm or moral suasion that draws an Andy Stein to Harlem. It's the political clout of Abyssinian and a half-century of conscientious voting habits among its members, and the perception that Calvin Butts is a leader who can influence those voters.
Some of Butts's proposals would startle those who would categorize him as another black liberal. He would order the enforcement of laws against public nuisance: gambling, public drinking and public urination. He would set curfews for teen-agers and confiscate cars in which loud music is being played. His strategy would find support among criminologists who argue that a sense of public order reduces crime. He's also shrewd about the political outrage it would cause. "On some of that stuff, you'd have fights with the unions and the civil liberties groups, but I would win the support of New Yorkers -- black and white," Butts says. "You'd get cooperation because people would begin to see the difference."
But the Calvin Butts who can sound like a mayoral candidate and calculate the mainstream political support he might win still lapses easily into his old activist posture. He complains that Ed Koch, a former nemesis, was more accessible than Mayor David N. Dinkins. He says he's been frustrated in his efforts to get a meeting with Cardinal O'Connor. (The Cardinal's office denies he's been approached.) "I get the sense there is absolutely no regard for black religious leadership on the part of these leaders," Butts says.
Further, Butts has engaged in a very public battle with District Attorney Morgenthau over the lack of administrators from minority groups on the prosecutor's staff. Morgenthau's office says the number of blacks working for the District Attorney has vastly increased during his tenure. Butts says that response fails to answer the question of black administrators. The District Attorney refused to further discuss the conflict for this article, but disagreements between the two men go back a few years. In 1985, Butts was chairman of Vernon Mason's quixotic campaign against Morgenthau. Although Mason was given no chance by political experts and had a total budget of $70,000, he collected a surprising 32 percent of the vote.
Mason's credibility has since been badly damaged by the Tawana Brawley case. However, Butts, who has been known to have furious arguments with Mason, refuses to discuss the substance of those disputes and continues to defend their friendship. Mason is an apprentice deacon at Abyssinian and a fellow graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta. "If the Brawley case proves to be a hoax -- I don't think it has been proven -- Mason is in it only because he was lied to," Butts says.
The minister also refuses to condemn the other controversial attorney in the Brawley case, Alton Maddox, who has been suspended from practice because of his refusal to appear at a New York State disciplinary committee. Maddox, he says, was the first New York lawyer to send him a detailed paper on the problems in New York's criminal-justice system. Says Butts: "It's a travesty of justice to have him suspended." One suspects that Maddox appeals to the protest side of Butts, that Maddox is a renegade lawyer fighting for truth and justice, and the minister won't abandon him because the establishment has turned against him.

CALVIN BUTTS, WHO will soon be moving from the South Bronx to Harlem with his wife, Patricia, and three children, was born in New York City. His father worked as a chef in Manhattan; his mother was a supervisor in the city's welfare system. Until he was 8, Butts lived in the predominantly black and Hispanic Lillian Wald Houses on the Lower East Side. Many summers his family sent him south to visit relatives. His grandmothers, both committed Christians, lived a few miles apart in rural Georgia and the young Calvin spent a lot of time in churches.
In 1957, his family moved to a mostly black section of Queens. Racial self-awareness and self-help were part of family life. "My father was the kind who would say, 'If a black man opens a store, go shop in it,' " Butts recalls. He also remembers an uncle who was an ardent black nationalist bringing an early recording by Louis Farrakhan to the Butts house. The title was: "A White Man's Heaven Is a Black Man's Hell." But there was no preaching or railing against whites in his immediate family. He was bused to junior high school in Forest Hills at a time when white parents were protesting integration via busing, and he went on to attend the predominantly white Flushing High School in 1963. One measure of his ability to appeal across racial lines was evident in his senior year, when he was elected class president.
In the fall of 1967, Butts enrolled at Morehouse, one of the most prestigious black colleges in the United States and a fountainhead of black leadership. Faculty members and fellow students remember Butts as a student who stood out. One reason was that he often wore a suit and carried a briefcase and looked like a graduate student or professor. Another was that he was very inquisitive. "Calvin was always ready with the 'What if?' remembers Anna Grant, chairwoman of the sociology department at Morehouse. "But he also managed to disagree without being obnoxious."
The late 1960's was a time of anger and rebellion for many young blacks. Daniel Klenbort, one of a number of whites who taught at Morehouse, had Butts in his freshman history class. "One day he walked into class and asked: 'What would you do if I came to class with a gun?' " Klenbort remembers. "I said: 'Well, that's where discussion ends and coercion begins. I'd throw you out of class.' He seemed satisfied with that answer. I think he appreciated that I wasn't threatened by the anger. He had the militancy and he also managed to be a good student."
Butts's anger against racial injustice boiled over on the night in 1968 that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. Butts and several other students joined the rioting, and he admits that they firebombed a neighborhood store. For a few unforgettable seconds, Butts found himself staring down the barrel of an Atlanta policeman's shotgun. He escaped unharmed, but that moment of confrontation convinced him that violence was not the solution he wanted to embrace.
A Morehouse education was rooted in the classics but leavened with black history and a sense of racial responsibility. Butts's list of people who inspired him reflect the dichotomy that continues to haunt his actions. On one hand he lists conventional black establishment figures: the theologian Howard Thurman; Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays, who was president of Morehouse; Mordecai Wyatt Johnson, a renowned black educator who was president of Howard University. Then there are the revolutionaries: Malcolm X, of course; the slave rebels Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey; the abolitionist Sojourner Truth.
What gives the list coherence for Butts is religion. All his heroes were preachers, formally trained or lay. But he felt no tug to the cloth as a student. He went to Morehouse planning to study industrial psychology. But when three seminary recruiters turned up on his campus within three days, he said he thought "somebody" was trying to tell him something. He switched to philosophy with a minor in religion. When he graduated from Morehouse, he went to Union Theological Seminary in New York and soon channeled his anger into religious commitment.
Butts's new direction didn't dampen his propensity for controversy. Classmates at Union remember a sermon Butts delivered in which he started out talking about black-white relations, but, somehow, segued into condeming homosexuality. It was an unorthodox view at the liberal seminary -- but a fairly conventional position for black Baptist preachers. Today, he still says the Bible condemns homosexuality as a sin, but he has been outspoken in defending the rights of homosexuals. Richard Goldstein, executive editor of The Village Voice and a gay-rights advocate, praises Butts on his opposition to violence against homosexuals. "What sticks with me is his specifically including gay people as people who are victims of violence," Goldstein says. "Nobody's demonstrating not to be called a sinner."
Butts was recruited by the Abyssinian Baptist Church in 1972. William S. Epps, now pastor of Los Angeles's Second Baptist Church and then an associate minister at Abyssinian, was asked by Abyssinian's newly installed pastor, the Rev. Dr. Samuel D. Proctor, to recruit some young ministers for his staff. Epps was impressed by Butts: "He had a passion to do something to correct the conditions that confronted our community." For Butts, Abyssinian was the ideal place to test his theories of the ministry as a vehicle for social change.
The church's central role in social issues should be no surprise; the tradition goes back to its very beginnings. Abyssinian's beginnings go back to 1808 when 13 Ethiopian merchants had tried to worship at a white Baptist church in the Wall Street area. When they were ordered to sit in the segregated balcony, the merchants, along with several African-Americans and a white preacher from Boston, started their own church a few blocks away, naming it after the old word for Ethiopia. The Abyssinian church eventually followed the black migration further and further uptown.
When Adam Clayton Powell Sr. retired as pastor of Abyssinian in 1937, 14 years after moving the congregation to Harlem, his son Adam Jr. took over. Almost immediately, a group of black doctors asked Powell to help them get the right to practice at Harlem Hospital. He began a series of successful attacks on barriers that had made New York as segregated as any Southern city, using boycotts and demonstrations to force the telephone company, a bus company and the stores on 125th Street to start hiring blacks.
The church, built by Powell Sr. on a formula of self-reliance, ballot power and Baptist theology, was the base for Powell Jr.'s civil rights activities and a perfect platform for his leap into politics. By the 1950's, he was the most influential black politician in America and in 1960 became chairman of the powerful House Education and Labor Committee. But Powell was as much the bon vivant as he was the legislator and he neglected his base. In the early 1960's, he became embroiled in a protracted defamation-of-character lawsuit. Found guilty and fined, he initially refused to pay the sum and only ventured to New York on Sundays to avoid arrest for contempt of court. By the time he died in 1972, Abyssinian was in deep trouble.
Powell's sucessor, Samuel Proctor, refocused the church on its mission. During the 17 years of his tenure, Proctor said the annual operating budget soared from $146,000 to over $1 million. He kept a low profile on public issues and managed to avoid becoming a household name in New York. Proctor also knew how to delegate. He turned over much of the day-to-day operations to his eager young associates. Butts was initially hired as youth minister to oversee the church's programs for children and teen-agers, but became a one-man media blitz. He criticized black and white politicians, including Percy Sutton, then the Manhattan Borough President, and Charles B. Rangel, who had taken over Powell's seat in Congress. He called Mayor Koch a "racist" and an "opportunist." He accused New York's black elected officials of being afraid to take a stand on issues like police brutality. Butts traveled to Washington to urge John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan and then chairman of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, to hold police-brutality hearings, which were then held in New York in 1983.
He refused to condemn Farrakhan's reference to Judaism as a "gutter religion" in 1986, triggering a boycott of an Abyssinian concert by more than a third of New York Philharmonic's players. Butts said later that if anyone had asked him, he would have condemned Farrakhan's attacks on Judaism. Instead, he said, he was being asked to repudiate the Black Muslim preacher, whose doctrine of self-help he continues to embrace. "I will not be your boy," he told Jewish leaders through the newspapers. The concert series, a marvelous extension of downtown into the increasingly isolated Harlem community, came to an end.
As Butts became identified with some of the city's most controversial figures, his ties grew to be useful to the establishment. For instance, in 1987, he served as a liaison between Mason-Maddox and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's office in setting up a special prosecutor in the Howard Beach racial assault case.
But however visible he became in the 1980's, Butts, unlike Powell, didn't neglect his work for the church. He performed the hospital visits, baptisms and funerals and other routines of a young minister. In the process, he built important ties with church members. Other young ministers came and went, but Butts stayed. "He recognized he was in a place where the action was," says Lawrence Jones, dean of students at Union Theological when Butts arrived at the school and now head of Howard University's School of Divinity. Jones also credits the management style of Proctor with Butts's progress. "Calvin never had the feeling he was just an assistant pastor. He was part of the ministry."
Eventually, Butts won over key members of the congregation. When Proctor announced he was retiring, he recommended Butts for the job. The board of deacons met and voted, in a secret ballot, to waive the bylaw requiring a search for a new pastor. Butts was then voted in, being named on 89 percent of the ballots.

CHARLES RANGEL says New York is due for a generational change of black leadership. The established leaders of the black community are all in their 60's now: Rangel, Dinkins, Percy Sutton, the former chairman of Inner City Broadcasting, Basil A. Paterson, a former New York Secretary of State. Butts is often linked to an emerging generation of black Harlem politicians whose primary political experience was forged in the 1960's: State Senator David A. Paterson, son of Basil; A. Virginia Fields, Councilwoman from Harlem, and Peggy M. Shepard, Democratic district leader from West Harlem who some expect will run for a seat on the newly redistricted City Council. While their ages and experiences may be similar to Butts's, they have made their choice to play inside the boundaries of the political establishment. Butts, meanwhile, shifts uneasily between being an impatient, dissatisfied outsider and the leader of a respected institution. He has an effective forum and is now looking for the most effective voice.
Butts's inaugural sermon as pastor of Abyssinian in 1989 signaled that restlessness. "I have a dream" he said, in a nod to Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous speech: "It's time to move from the hope to making what we hoped about and dreamed about real. Now is the time for the prophecy to be fulfilled. We must make this real."

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: DR. KENNETH R. DARDICK;
Tips for Staying Healthier on the Road

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WITH the weather turning colder, a lot of people are making plans for travel to warmer places. Dr. Kenneth R. Dardick of Mansfield, the author of the recently published "Foreign Travel and Immunization Guide" (Medical Economics Books, Oradell, N.J.), is a principal in the Center for International Health and developer of Immunization Alert, a computer compilation of international health data. Dr. Dardick, 44 years old, is a family practicioner. A graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Medical School, he was born in New York City and grew up in the Danbury area.
In a recent interview at his office, he discussed how to travel and stay healthy. Here are some excerpts from the conversation. 
 Q. How did a family practitioner get into the field of international health?
 A. Being next to the University of Connecticut. University people do a lot of traveling. So a professor comes in and says: "Look, Ken, I'm going on sabbatical, and I need to know what I need for 10 countries. I'm going to be gone for six months." Before I came along with this service, a doctor would either have to say, "Gee, I don't know what to do," or they would have to look in the book published by the Centers for Disease Control, "Health Information for the International Traveler," look up each country, try to figure out what the codes referred to, then try to coordinate one to the other.
If you go to country A, what does country B require? It was a lot of work. And the fact is, I don't care where you practice, your patients are traveling. We are a global community. It's nothing for someone to show up in my office today, who three or four days ago was in a distant part of the world.
 Q. How important is it that the average doctor know anything about international health?
 A. Let me give you an example: we've got how many troops in Saudi Arabia now? These men and women are going to be coming back to the United States, having been exposed to a variety of exotic diseases. We need doctors here who are able to diagnose them. If you're in the military and just came back from Saudi Arabia, and you've got a non-healing sore on your leg, there is a disease called leishmaniasis, and most doctors in the U.S. don't have much awareness of it, even though it is terribly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. Some of it is a little esoteric, but some of it relates to every physician seeing patients in the United States.
 Q. How much do some of these exotic diseases pose a problem for doctors in terms of diagnosis?
 A. If someone shows up in February with flu symptoms, and everyone in town has the flu, it probably is the flu. But you know, malaria looks just like the flu, and if that patient was just in Kenya, it's not inappropriate for the doctor to do a test for malaria. There was just a bulletin published by C.D.C. about two cases in malaria in New Jersey, in two people who had gone to Mexico to be treated for Lyme disease and were purposely infected with malaria. The point is, someone could come into your office tomorrow with fever and chills and have a real oddball infection.
Someone wrote an editorial for one of the premiere medical journals, with the question, in Latin, "Unde Venis?" -- "Where have you been?" It pointed out that doctors, no matter where they practice, have got to be constantly thinking that a patient with funny symptoms may have been somewhere they have to know about.
 Q. Does your advice apply just to people who've been to faraway countries?
 A. Not at all. The example I give is if you're a doctor in middle America, and your patient has been visiting Connecticut and now has a swollen knee, you've got to think about Lyme disease. The point about travel is it's not just exotic, international travel, it could be anywhere.
 Q. Do travel agents prepare people for health problems in the countries they are visiting?
 A. Most travel agents, unfortunately, have not bought into this concept of travel health. I don't want to be unkind to travel agents, but there have been studies worldwide asking what kind of advice people get from their travel agents, and it falls into two categories: either the travel agent dismisses the issue entirely or focuses on the narrow question of whether you need a shot to enter the country.
The fact is, for most of the countries in the world, you don't need a shot to get in. Say you're booking a trip to Yucatan, and you ask the agent, "Do I need any shots?" and you're told, "No." The better question would be: "Are there any health issues I should think about?" And the problem is there are a lot of them.
 Q. Have you ever advised people to stay away from a country because of a health risk?
 A. The most dangerous country is the one you're not prepared for. I've got people who've gone to the deepest jungles -- from the university I've got archeologists and entomologists -- but if they're prepared, they stay relatively well.
 Q. How can the average person find out about how to prepare?
 A. We're trying to increase the level of awareness so doctors will have some sense about the dangers. I always tell people to speak to their travel agent and speak to their doctor. The C.D.C. has a phone number travelers should know about, (404) 332-4559, their travelers' hot line. It will cost them a few bucks, but C.D.C. updates it pretty regularly, and it's worth it.
 Q. How does Immunization Alert work?
 A. Immunization Alert is a service I developed in 1983 sort of in parallel to the work I do here, but it's run as a separate business. It offers travel information really designed more for the corporate sector, in which large health departments -- the City of New York, the State of Massachusetts, the World Bank, Quantas Airlines -- all come to me for updated weekly service. If they've got an employee going off somewhere, they can punch it into their computer for information. It keeps up with things like State Department advisories, not just health alone, but social and political developments. It was the first, worldwide, to bring all of this together in one computerized service. There's still only a few of us worldwide who are doing anything like this. There's a guy in London at the School of Tropical Medicine, and another guy in Milwaukee. I also provide individual reports for travelers.
 Q. How much does it cost to use Immunization Alert?
A. For individual travelers, I charge $40, and that includes up to four different countries. It's generally a couple of pages per country. Beyond that, it's $10 a country. That is expensive, but on the other hand, that gives them what they need, and they can take that to their own doctor. For corporations, I sell a computerized service that is updated every week, and that's $700 a year.
 Q. How do you find medical care if you're in a foreign country?
 A. It's tough, and you have to do some advance planning. There is a non-profit group called I.A.M.A.T., the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers, in Lewiston, N.Y., which maintains a list of English-speaking doctors worldwide. It's not an endorsement of their qualifications, but they do speak English. I also strongly recommend that travelers contact a service like International SOS. If you get sick, you call their 800 number, and they will help you find a doctor, get in touch with your doctor back home, evacuate you if need be, help you with your funding.
 Q. What's the greatest common danger to the traveler?
 A. Auto accidents are the No. 1 killer of travelers abroad, for two reasons. First, because autos are inherently dangerous, more dangerous than jet planes. Second, because if you're in a third world area, you don't have 911, you don't have E.M.S., you don't have high-quality care around the corner. The broken leg you sustain in the jungle, or even in a major third world city, is inherently more dangerous than a broken leg in Taftville. Sexually transmitted diseases are another major issue. AIDS, worldwide, was spread as a traveler's illness.
 Q. What about medical supplies? Any you should bring with you?
 A. If you're taking pills, obviously take them with you. Keep them labeled in their original container, and keep them on your person. Don't pack them in your luggage, because if your luggage goes east and you go west, you're in trouble. Syringes are generally not a problem, but have a note from your physician. I always tell people not only to take an extra pair of glasses if they wear them, but carry a copy of their prescription. The general rule is, the longer you're going to be away, and the farther you're going, the more attention you pay to these issues.
 Q. Certainly one of the most common problems for the international traveler has got to be jet lag. Any tips for sufferers?
 A. There is some really good research that shows bright sunlight will help you set your internal clock, much faster. The problem with jet lag is your body says it's 9 o'clock in the morning when it's 3 in the afternoon, so you have to advance your clock. Or you go to Hawaii, and it's really earlier in the day. If you go to the east, bright light in the morning, getting out of doors early in the day, helps to advance your clock.
I tell people going to London to stay outside in the mornings, and if they're going to museums, do it in the afternoon. When you go to the west, bright light in the afternoon is much better. So if you're going to Hawaii, stay on the beach in the afternoon.
Jet lag is invariable. You can't escape it. So people just have to know that they can't crash ahead. If they're going on business, you can't just crash into intensive negotiations the first day. Try to build in one day as a buffer. Drink lots of fluids, because the planes are very dry, and you get dehydrated, and avoid caffeine and alcohol.
 Q. How about motion sickness?
 A. Motion sickness, air sickness, sea sickness, car sickness, they all derive from the same problem, an imbalance in the inner ear. The fact is your eye is seeing something different from what your body is experiencing. Movement of the head accentuates the problem. If you are prone to motion sickness, sit in your seat and try to keep your head motionless. Look out at the horizon. As far as medicine, there are those little patches you wear behind your ear, and it is the most effective medicine we have. You can't use it under 12 years old, so you're pretty much limited to Dramamine, but that makes you drowsy.

HEADLINE: Cross-Country Skiers Are Taking Off With a Swoosh

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
FORGET the long lift lines. Forget the long hours traveling north to the mountain resorts. If cross-country skiing is on your agenda this winter, your playground may not be far from your front door.
And if you are worried about the latest fashion for outdoor sports this season, you can forget that, too. All that is necessary to enjoy cross-country skiing is a pair of Nordic skis, boots, poles, light layers of ordinary outdoor clothing and one more critical ingredient -- snow. 
 Without traveling farther than the boundaries of Westchester County, there is sufficient open space in the form of parks, golf courses, nature preserves and trails to satisfy both the beginner and the most skillful cross-country skier. Entrance to the state and county sites is free, although some places charge a parking fee.
In northern Westchester, the county Department of Parks, Recreation, and Conservation allows cross-country skiing, conditions permitting, from dawn until dusk seven days a week at the Blue Mountain Reservation in Peekskill, Croton Gorge in Cortlandt, the Kitchawan Preserve in Yorktown, the Mohansic Golf Course in Yorktown Heights, Mountain Lake Camp in North Salem and the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation in Cross River.
In the central part of the county, the department has designated the following sites for cross-country skiing: Maple Moor Golf Course in White Plains, the Marshlands Conservancy in Rye and the Saxon Woods Golf Course in Scarsdale.
To the south, there is the Dunwoodie Golf Course, the Lenoir Preserve, the Sprain Lake Golf Course and Tibbetts Brook Park, all in Yonkers.
 
Groom Your Own Trails As You Go
 The curator at the Lenoir Preserve, Timothy K. Barton recommended the 40-acre Yonkers preserve as "very good for beginners." There are 1.5 miles of level trails available at the site. In snow, the trails -- with names such as "Great Horned Owl Path" and "Pheasant Way" are ungroomed, "the make-'em-your-own-way" kind, Mr. Barton said.
In addition to the county-run sites, there is the state-operated Rockefeller State Park Preserve in Pocantico Hills. On its 750 acres, there are 20 trails, a total of 14.8 miles going through wetlands, woodlands, meadows and fields. The park entrance is on Route 117 from the eastbound lane only.
Rockefeller Park's pathways, with names such as Witch's Spring Trail, Swan Lake Trail, Spook Rock Lane and Peaceful Path, are coded for levels of difficulty, from "even grade" to "steep." The steep half-mile Overlook Trail offers hikers and skiers a panoramic view of Swan Lake on the preserve and the surrounding woodlands, said James F. Moogan, manager of the park. Old Railroad Bed is a shorter, even trail that was once part of the New York & Harlem Railroad line.
A trail map can be got by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to The Rockefeller State Park Preserve, 132 Bedford Road, North Tarrytown, N.Y. 10591. By calling 631-1470, skiers can get the latest update on snow conditions at the preserve and at nearby Rockwood Hall Park in North Tarrytown.
The Old Croton Aqueduct, also operated by the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and officially known as the Old Croton Trailway State Park, is another favorite among skiers. Following a snowstorm, one can spot skiers who live along the 26-mile pathway coming out of their backyards and picking up the trail as it winds its way south along the Hudson River from Croton to the New York City line. The state number for the Croton trailway and Franklin D. Roosevelt Park in Yorktown Heights, where cross-country skiing is also permitted, is 245-4434. Entry is from side streets all along the way.
For those new to the sport and for the experienced skier who wants to sharpen rusty skills, the county is offering free ski-touring clinics and workshops this winter.
Today at 11 A.M., at the Trailside Museum of Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, the county will hold its second clinic of the season. All of the workshops planned this winter will be held regardless of weather, said Mary Kay Koch, spokeswoman for the county's Department of Parks, Recreation, and Conservation.
If there is snow on the ground, the clinics will be held outdoors and participants should bring skiis and dress for the weather, Ms. Koch said. In the case of no snow, "dry clinics" will be held indoors and proper skiing techniques and shaping-up exercises will be discussed.
Among the highlights of the county programs this winter are a ski tour at Kitchawan Saturday at 10 A.M., and a "full-moon ski tour" at Mountain Lakes camp at 8 P.M. on Feb. 1. Other ski clinics will be held at the Lenoir Preserve, at 10:30 A.M. on Feb. 9 and at the Trailside Nature Museum at 11 A.M. on Feb. 10.
The county operates a weekday hot line for information on ski conditions at its sites. The number is 285-PARK.
The county ski clinics will be taught by representatives of two county sporting goods stores, Jaggers Camp and Trail Inc. in Bedford Hills and Eastern Mountain Sport in Ardsley.
 
'Anybody Can Learn'
 "Anybody who can walk can learn to ski. I've seen skiers in their 60's and 70's," said Irmgard Jagger, owner of Jaggers Camp and Trail. "You can't get in much trouble with this sport. The worst is you'll end up sitting coming down a hill. That's a very common sight in cross-country."
Chris Scheu, a manager of Eastern Mountain Sport, describes cross-country skiing, also known as Nordic skiing, as "paradise for nature lovers."
"You don't have to wait in line; you don't have to deal with tons of people," Mr. Scheu said. "It's a very quiet, relaxing sport."
"A golf course is a great place to begin," Mr. Scheu suggested. "And because they are so well-groomed, you don't need a heavy snowfall to go skiing."
Mr. Scheu noted that in the seven years he has been manager of Eastern Mountain Sport's Westchester store, interest in the sport has intensified, judging by the number of customers coming in to purchase cross-country ski equipment.
"We must sell 800 to 1,100 pairs of cross-country skiis a year," he said. "I am amazed at the number of newcomers who say they've decided to take up the sport."
He attributed the increased interest in the sport in part to the cardiovascular benefits of cross-country skiing. "If you get skiing at a good clip, it's right up there with jogging and swimming," Mr. Scheu said.
Many former downhill skiers, tired of paying to wait on lift lines and looking for more economical, wintertime pursuits, have turned to cross-country skiing, Ms. Jagger said. Except for parking fees at some sites, the state and county areas are free.
 
To Buy or To Rent
 For $200, a customer can purchase poles, boots, bindings and skiis. "And that's good equipment I'm talking about," Ms. Jagger said. More expensive packages can cost as much as $350 to $400.
Ski equipment can also be rented for the weekend for about $20, Mr. Scheu said.
Both retailers recommended waxless skis because conditions in the county in the course of day can vary dramatically. "It's better to hop on the skis and get going than to stop and pick which wax to use," Ms. Jagger said. "Otherwise you could be changing wax 10 to 12 times a day."
As for clothing, Ms. Jagger said, "You don't have to have the latest item in cross-country fashion. Just improvise." Both Mr. Scheu and Ms. Jagger stressed the importance of dressing with light layers -- polypropylene underwear, a fleece jacket, hat, gloves and wind pants and wind jacket.
 
Working Up Some Steam
 "The only time you're cold," Mr. Scheu said, "is before you have skiied 100 yards. After that, you are creating your own heat. You can really work up a steam."
Many skiers go out for the entire day carrying lunch in a backpack.
"When my children were young, I took along a pot, packaged dried soup, hot dogs, apples and a fire starter," Ms. Jagger said. "We would melt snow for the soup and cook hot dogs on a stick. This is a sport the whole family can do together."

THE LAST FINE TIME
By Verlyn Klinkenborg.
209 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $19.95. 
 Outsiders know Buffalo as a city of broad shoulders and of a population we now call ethnic -- Croats and Poles and Czechs -- and also as a city whose name is synonymous with bad weather. One doesn't hear much about its black population, say, or its poets, or its university classrooms. Verlyn Klinkenborg, who grew up in a small Iowa town (and who wrote about Midwestern farmers in his first book, "Making Hay"), comes into Buffalo with eyes wide and affections available. He writes, beginning of course with snow, about a neighborhood bar, once the Thomas Wenzek Restaurant, then George & Eddie's, and about the several generations of the Wenzek family who owned and operated it. Buffalo is changed forever, and the bar is gone.
Buffalo is one of a number of northeastern cities that saw their heyday before World War II, and now are suffering in small what the region is suffering in general: a long, hard decline. These are cities on the downswing, where money is ebbing steadily out along with working-class jobs, and where the traditional sense of community is in the process of being redefined. Buffalo, to Mr. Klinkenborg, represents these cities on the wane, and by recollecting for us the bar, a neighborhood and a time, he celebrates both a collective feeling and an era in the history of cities now vanished.
The Wenzeks came to upstate New York in 1906 from Galicia, then a part of Austria-Hungary, now a part of Poland. Thomas Wenzek bought a saloon in 1922 at 722 Sycamore Street. During Prohibition he and his family sold near beer and flowers; after Prohibition they ran their bar full time, and they prospered. Their son, Eddie (the father of Mr. Klinkenborg's wife, Regina), worked for them, did his duty in World War II, and in 1947 took over the bar along with his brother-in-law, George Ditzel. America's sense of itself was never the same after World War II, and Eddie changed the bar in response to what he saw as the country's appetite for sophistication: he added a new 18-foot backbar, a menu featuring pork loin instead of the traditional whole pig, highballs and french-fried shrimp. Eddie wanted, Mr. Klinkenborg writes, "to keep a family atmosphere at lunch, dinner, and on Sundays, but to make it feel postwar, less an old-fashioned workingman's bar of the sort his father created and more a fashionable late-night spot." As Eddie changed, as the bar changed, Buffalo and the nation changed too.
In letters he sent home in 1842 to be saved for the composition of what would be his "American Notes," Charles Dickens, coming to Buffalo and looking about with wide eyes, meditated on Niagara Falls, "that tremendous ghost of spray and mist which is never laid, and has been haunting this place with the same dread solemnity -- perhaps from the creation of the world." You don't, really, get a lot in "American Notes" on Buffalo or the falls. But you get plenty of darker Dickens.
So too with Mr. Klinkenborg. He can write superbly, and he clearly has a great talent for evoking a place or time. Describing old plumbing from the bar's early days, he writes of the "furlongs of steamfit pipe elbowing, knuckling, nippling its way through every building in a city like Buffalo." He is wonderful about "geraniums -- knotted, arthritic plants with the musty scent of perfumed wool." And in a Buffalo neighborhood "there is a lull in the traffic, and for a moment you can hear the silence. It swells into the yard like an abrupt tide." Here is the city under snow: "Even indoors, you can hear the hush over Buffalo. You can feel the way the heavy snowfall changes a room, the way it redefines the interior, making the walls seem closer together, the roof heavier, the insulation thicker."
What reader can resist such gorgeous writing? People blessed with marvelous voices sometimes come to believe that their voices confer blessing, no matter about what their lovely sounds are enfolded. This is sometimes true of writers, and when it is, their readers do resist. Mr. Klinkenborg intones that "the present is the only campfire in the icy wastes of time." Speaking of families at a Buffalo graveyard, he must describe "the sostenuto of a sound digestion, vigorous seethings in a kettle of life." He discusses attitudes in men after World War II and speaks of a sucker as "the one who goes for the story" -- an apt definition of the word it's meant to catch. But then Mr. Klinkenborg defines further, insisting that the word "reflects a pearlescent beatitudinal quality," as if he must show us the writer at work and not the man or situation he at first had sought to describe.
Although the author clearly likes and is interested in the story of Thomas Wenzek, Eddie his son and the other men and women of the neighborhood, he seems to be driven beyond them by his own appreciation of his transforming prose. Like Dickens in Buffalo, he records, at last, the author, not his subject. Even the book's structure facilitates such a giving in to self. It is divided into sections, each ostensibly about an individual whose story will lead us to the larger story Mr. Klinkenborg would tell. So sections are each "about" the son Eddie, now in his 70's and retired, or "about" the patriarch Thomas. But each section leads Mr. Klinkenborg to write not about the person in question but about Galicia or Buffalo, the old country or the new, and about the changing times. There are wonderful lists of store signs and of products for sale, there are lists of wonderful names. But the names don't lead to people, they become considerations of population shifts, economic shifts, shifts in ways of living. A family atomized by the structure of the book becomes further dispersed into facts about American or urban or Buffalonian life.
Are people to be seen as wholly shaped by their city or town? While Mr. Klinkenborg satisfyingly evokes ways of life, especially when he chronicles the effects of World War II on Buffalo, he seems at last to be saying that you define a person primarily by talking of his place and time. But what of the inner life of the Wenzek family? Who fought with whom? Who betrayed what husband, wife or child? How did Thomas's wife really feel about cooking all day for the bar? How about Renee, Eddie's wife? What of their children? Is a life to be defined by a certain cut of skirt, a certain style of hat? And if these lives are not to be considered in their particularities, then what in this book is at stake? On behalf of learning what about whom are these sometimes wonderful words expended?
Since there is no intimacy with the Wenzeks or their neighbors, there can be little feeling for them. In the end, we don't know how Eddie feels as the old inhabitants of the neighborhood die and as the younger generations move to the suburbs -- to be replaced by new waves of immigrants, primarily blacks from the American South.
In 1970, Eddie sells the bar to a black proprietor. It is renamed the Scorpion, closes after a short time, is first boarded up and then torn down. Eddie, now living in the suburbs, comes back to watch its demolition. If the bar is a metaphor in the history of American cities, then its disappearance, as Mr. Klinkenborg shows us, is the end of a unique time.
Eddie says a few words at the beginning, and occasionally there is speech from other people in the book. But Mr. Klinkenborg doesn't let them say much. We never learn their rhythms or diction or patterns of breath. We know the author's, though. And when Eddie, placed behind his bar, begins to tell stories about people going over into Niagara Falls, Mr. Klinkenborg interrupts. Eddie says a total of a few sentences here, and the author says the rest. In another bravura turn, he imagines how it would feel to fall over: "You would be crushed from above, ground into the talus, held down, twisted, eddied. . . ."
Verlyn Klinkenborg isn't Eddied, though. He remains outside of him and of the others toward whom he has nevertheless tried to offer considerable respect. He seems driven by his voice, however, by his need to write rather than listen. Like Dickens at the falls he must write at last about him, not it. He has, surely, memorialized the bar, now leveled to rubble in part because of a city's great changes. But the people who lived in the apartment above 722 Sycamore, their customers and neighbors in a breathing Buffalo, are all gone, and this often brilliantly written book has not summoned them back.
 
AT HOME IN HIS WORK

Eddie has everything under control. . . . He takes Canadian money at par. He knows every pose his customers use to order a drink, every grace of condescension, every tiny hauteur that needs to be blunted. He knows how to explain that at George & Eddie's there is no book to drink on. He knows how to fend off the constant offers of "Have one on me" and when to lose the bar dice. He knows how to flatter a lonely woman without entanglement or offense. He knows how whiskey will curdle and how it will parch and how, when it neither curdles nor parches, it will warm a room full of tired strangers into friendship. . . .
When the jukebox takes over from the Bavarian trio and a more urbane music -- Dinah Shore, Frankie Laine, Perry Como -- slackens the tempo, when the crowd thins but the atmosphere thickens, when the line between sport and sucker gets hard to draw, when even his father, abandoned by the last of his old friends, sets the pinochle deck aside and trudges upstairs to Freda, then Eddie has time to be at home in his work, to allow a conversation to ripen, to light his pipe with the lion-shaped head and send its pleasant smoke curling into the air. -- From "The Last Fine Time."
 
A SON-IN-LAW LISTENS
 "At first," Verlyn Klinkenborg recollects, "my listening was simply the kind of thing a son-in-law does." Eddie Wenzek, his father-in-law, had a lifetime of salty tales about the bar and restaurant operated by the Wenzek family for 50 years in a blue-collar neighborhood of Buffalo. "Where I grew up, in the Middle West," Mr. Klinkenborg said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Massachusetts, "bars were not a place where you'd hang out. What startled me was that, clearly, this business had been at the heart of a community."
Mr. Klinkenborg, whose first book, "Making Hay," vividly described the rigors of modern farming, admits to a fascination "with the remembered life of work. Almost all of us share it, yet we don't often talk about it. And the most interesting characters, I've found, are often those who have held what might seem to be the most unremarkable jobs." The more he heard about the bar and the Wenzeks' lives in America, the clearer it became to him that their history offered a unique opportunity to "re-create the experience of working-class life in one city."
"The Last Fine Time" is written in a rich, intense, exact prose. Mr. Klinkenborg, who holds a Ph.D in English literature from Princeton University, explains: "I look for subjects that offer a sense of metaphorical possibility. It's probably clear from the book that I'm as interested in the character of language as in the story itself. As I believe Joyce Carol Oates has said, the subject is fully realized only by the grace of an author's language."
While some former residents of the neighborhood, which has been transformed yet again by new waves of immigrants, speak affectionately of its old communal pleasures, Mr. Klinkenborg notes that "many also understood the toll their past had exacted." Even Eddie, "who thinks often about losing the bar, believes that if he had held on to it he might have worked himself into a heart attack."
Mr. Klinkenborg, who is 38 years old, is currently the Briggs-Copeland lecturer at Harvard University, teaching nonfiction writing. And he has just begun research on his next book, about physicians working with native Americans in the Southwest. -- RICHARD E. NICHOLLS

In Ads, Simple Is Replacing Slick

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
There can be little doubt about the subject of a new advertising campaign splashed across the pages of Gourmet magazine and other publications aimed at the affluent. Beneath seemingly candid photographs of fashionable diners is a large banner that declares, "Remy Martin est l'eau de vie."
Jeff Weiss, the co-creative director of Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss, the advertising agency that declared Remy Martin cognac was the "water of life," said the campaign was typical of the direct, even obvious advertising that his youthful New York agency is doing these days. 
 He contrasts it to the subtle and occasionally mysterious advertisements that Margeotes fashioned in the late 1980's for Harper's Bazaar magazine, which also featured apparently impromptu photos but were devoid of text, barely showed the magazine and were designed, Mr. Weiss said, "to not seem like advertising."
 
Back-to-Basics Movement
 Like Margeotes, advertising agencies on and beyond Madison Avenue are being swept by a back-to-basics movement that is manifesting itself in ads that are starker and more plain-speaking. If the excesses of the booming 1980's were reflected in advertising that was opulent, slick and expensive, creative people at agencies say, the work they are producing in the constrained 1990's can be described by one word: simple.
Logos are growing larger, as in the Cutty Sark Scotch whisky ads introduced last fall that reintroduced, after a long absence, the brand's clipper-ship symbol.
Advertising that once emphasized people's life styles now showcases the benefits of products; Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, which once danced around the issue of what it did by depicting smiling middle-aged folks, now shows an unraveling roll of toilet tissue in its television ads.
"Simplicity and forthrightness are where the industry wants to be right now," said William J. Vernick, a vice president and copywriter at the giant Ayer agency in New York, whose clients include Procter & Gamble and DeBeers diamonds. "Creatives are being forced to think of more creative ways of being less creative."
 
'Simply Clever' Ads
 There are a variety of reasons being offered for advertising's new simplicity, with some affirming that basic direct ads better penetrate the clutter of loud or complex ads, and others pointing out that they are cheaper to produce than song-and-dance extravaganzas.
But whatever the cause, wild and weird ads -- exemplified by Chiat/ Day/Mojo's controversial "Reeboks let U.B.U." athletic shoes campaign of 1989 -- are being supplanted by advertising that John Nieman, the chief creative officer of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles/U.S.A., calls "simply clever."
Mr. Nieman cited a commercial his agency did in Britain. Against a plain, white background, one rock, then two rocks, then many rocks tumble back and forth. At the end appear the words "Rolling Stones U.K. tour. Sponsored by Budweiser."
The danger in identifying advertising trends is that many supposedly new developments have precedents. D.M.B.& B.'s Rolling Stones commercial, for example, appears derivative of Chiat/Day/Mojo's campaign for the Nynex Yellow Pages, which has used plain backgrounds and word-play punchlines since the mid-80's.
 
Conscious Simplicity
 What is important about advertising's new restraint is that many creative people say they are consciously trying to simplify their work, and they willingly concede that they are emulating a handful of ads from the late 80's, like the Nynex campaign and the zen-like Infiniti automobile campaign, that generated controversy because their reserve ran so counter to advertising's then-prevailing extravagance, as expressed in big-budget ads for companies like Pepsi-Cola.
Tom Thomas, the co-creative director of Angotti, Thomas, Hedge, said the new work reflected the demise of advertising that promoted products as badges of achievement, like the Scotch whisky ads that celebrated peoples' job promotions or terraced apartments and asked, "What are you saving the Chivas for?"
In its stead is rising advertising that Mr. Thomas deems "meritocratic," which, in a return to a decades-old advertising tradition, promotes real or perceived product advantages. "There are fewer yuppie-at-play commercials than we used to see," he said. "Products today have to earn their way onto your shopping list. That's in synch with the tenor of the times."
 
Several Hundred Words
 He held out as an example his agency's new ad for Saab automobiles, in which several hundred words of copy about Saab's engine, interior space, braking system and safety features are topped by the headline, "The End of the Selfish Car."
Perhaps the most direct and prevalent way that contemporary advertising is showcasing a product's strength is in television advertising that consists almost entirely of words printed on the screen.
A year ago, Ayer introduced a commercial for Phillips' Milk of Magnesia that forthrightly, but without sound, proclaimed the product's effectiveness. The spot shows a roll of toilet tissue that remains static as the words "Monday," "Tuesday" and "Wednesday" appear, sequentially, on the screen. There follows a shot of the product, then another shot of the paper twirling off the roll as the word "Thursday" comes on screen.
Many creative people say candidly, although privately, that advertising's new restraint is driven by fear. In an advertising industry mired in its slowest growth in two decades, copywriters and art directors are leery of seeming too avant-garde for clients, who have become increasingly cautious because of the recession.
 
Lower Production Costs
 Another obvious factor behind today's simple advertising is the desire among clients and agencies to reduce commercial production costs, which averaged $190,000 for a nationally broadcast spot in 1989, according to the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
But marketing psychology also underlies the move toward quieter, more elemental advertising, many creative people say. "We're in an era of trust," said Charlie Moss, the vice chairman and corporate creative director of Wells, Rich, Greene. "In film and TV, when things get complicated, consumers distrust it. You do it simply, give them proof of product reality, that will go over."

TV Guide Growth Plan: Bigger Pages

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Faced with increasing competition from television supplements in Sunday newspapers, TV Guide will begin testing a larger version of its digest-sized magazine in March.
"What we are testing here is essentially whether a bigger magazine at a higher price would be preferred by TV Guide's existing base of readers and whether it will attract a new set of buyers," said Joseph W. Cece, TV Guide's president and publisher. "I also think that the bigger page size could bring different kinds of advertisers for whom size is an issue." 
 The new version of TV Guide will be 7 1/2 by 10 inches, slightly smaller than magazines like People and Newsweek, and will cost 89 cents. In contrast, TV Guide is currently 5 by 7 3/4 inches and costs 75 cents.
 
Too Many Pages to Turn <HE
 The proliferation of cable channels has caused the little magazine to become somewhat unwieldy. In 1979, for instance, the average home received six or seven television channels. Today, it receives 36 or more, and that number is expected to grow to more than 50 by the end of the decade. As a result, readers of TV Guide have to keep turning pages instead of having a day's programming in one place.
Sunday television supplements also publish local, network and cable programming information. In addition, newspapers with their larger format are able to lay out a full day's programming in a grid, which is easier to read at a glance.
Moreover, the newspaper supplements present formidable competition for TV Guide because they are included in the Sunday paper at no additional cost. According to a 1990 survey of 574 Sunday papers by the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, which tracks trends in the industry, 521 of the newspapers had television supplements.
Newspapers publish Sunday programming guides as a reader service. Their value is not in advertising dollars -- indeed, many do not attract enough advertising to offset their production costs -- but in their potential to attract circulation.
 
'A Competitive Edge'
 "As newspaper markets get more competitive, like in Los Angeles, television supplements are a way of giving them a competitive edge," said Mary Berner, the associate publisher of TV Guide. "The supplements get better and better, and then as the heat goes off, the quality of the supplement often declines."
The 39-year-old TV Guide, which publishes 112 editions for different parts of the country each week, also includes articles about television, reviews, columns, a crossword puzzle and a horoscope.
The economic climate for magazines has changed significantly since 1988, when Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation acquired Triangle Publications, the publisher of TV Guide, for $3 billion. In the first nine months of 1990, TV Guide's advertising pages declined 9.4 percent, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. Mr. Cece said ad pages were off 6 percent for the year.
TV Guide's circulation is the third largest of any American magazine, surpassed only by Modern Maturity and Reader's Digest. The magazine had a circulation of 15.8 million for the first six months of 1990, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
In 1989 TV Guide reduced its advertising rate base to 15.8 million from 16.4 million. Mr. Cece said those 600,000 subscriptions represented a marginal readership that should not have been acquired in the first place and that cost money to keep.
 
20,000 Hours of Programming
 If TV Guide converts to a larger size, it will be the second television guide to do so recently. In October, The Cable Guide, a monthly magazine with a circulation of 9.5 million, converted to approximately the same size as the proposed TV Guide.
"We did it because of the extraordinary amount of programming that exists on cable," said Alan T. Wragg, publisher of The Cable Guide. "You can have as much as 20,000 hours a month in one household."
The Cable Guide differs in part from TV Guide in that it sells its magazine only to households that subscribe to cable systems. It is currently trying to interest cable operators in investing in TVSM Inc., its parent company.
As TV Guide did, The Cable Guide saw its advertising pages plummet last year. They were down 22 percent, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
 
Second Guide to Cable
 Last year TVSM introduced TV Time, a weekly guide to cable programming. TV Time currently has a circulation of about 250,000 in some cable markets in San Diego, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Huntington Beach, Calif. The magazine is "system specific," meaning that it only offers readers information about the channels they have and it tells them how to find them on their television dials.
Jay Gissen, editor of TV Time, said the magazine would not expand into new markets until TVSM had found new investors.
At TV Guide, Mr. Cese said any conversion to a larger size would not take place for at least 18 months. He declined to say how much such a change would cost, but characterized it as "potentially a big deal" because the transformation would involve an investment in new newsracks at supermarkets and other stores across the country.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Gulf War Is Creating Havoc for Networks

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
The war in the Persian Gulf has cost the broadcast networks millions of dollars, scuttled program schedules and thrown the seasonlong battle for ratings into turmoil.
After three days of chaotic and extremely costly coverage, the networks began to try to restore some normality -- and some revenue potential -- to their program schedules this weekend. 
 Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said that as the war continued, the networks were trying to be more selective about interrupting regular programming, both for economic reasons and because the constant high-alert coverage might be giving a distorted view of how long the war would last. That view was echoed by executives of ABC and NBC, who also said they were trying to shorten the length of interruptions for news.
 
'More Normal Schedule'
 "At some point, we have to get down to a more normal schedule," Mr. Stringer said. "Of course, the assumption will be that it's an economic decision, and that's true. But if we keep covering every bullet that's fired, we can help create the hysterical impression that this war is going to be over in a week."
The decisions to run entertainment programs have been influenced by the need to reduce what several network executives called the "economic hit" they were taking on the expensive coverage.
The additional costs include all communications, including satellite time, overtime for employees and travel expenses. Joseph Rutledge, a vice president of communications for NBC, said his network was spending about $1.5 million a week on the coverage. Those costs were not anticipated in the network's normal news budget of $300 million a year.
Another NBC executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the gross lost advertising revenue for Wednesday's prime-time hours was $3.5 million to $4 million.
 
'Best Revenue Opportunities'
 The networks have so far tried to resume normal programming on the basis of what Mr. Rutledge called "the best revenue opportunities." For example, NBC tried to go back to its regular programming on Thursday, its strongest night of prime time.
But the news of the first missile attack against Israel made that impossible. So NBC shifted its lineup of four hit comedies to Friday -- though it decided to run repeat episodes that night.
The NBC hit programs, however, performed much below expectations Friday night. According to the overnight ratings for the 25 largest television markets, NBC's usually high-rated "Cosby Show" finished third behind an ABC comedy, "Full House" which normally dominates that time period, and a news special on CBS.
David Poltrack, the senior vice president of research for CBS, said Friday's results proved that viewers simply could not keep up with the chaos in the program schedules and tended to watch what they normally watch on Friday night.
 
Closest Race in History
 The early ratings have possible implications for the overall television ratings race, which is already the closest in television history.
The results so far indicate that ABC may gain some long-term advantages from the war coverage. For the first three days, ABC enjoyed a significant ratings edge over the other networks, reflecting ABC's now clearly established leadership in broadcast news.
On Thursday night, ABC had a 14.1 national rating, beating NBC, with a 12.8, and CBS, with an 11.6. (Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.) NBC normally wins Thursday night by an enormous margin.
CNN had another strong night Thursday, with a national rating of 10, after picking up a remarkable 11.7 national rating Wednesday night. Both numbers are huge increases over the rating of less than 1 that CNN usually averages.
 
Benefits of Commercials
 ABC was the only network to run commercials Wednesday night, a move that could also help in the overall ratings race. Because NBC and CBS did not run commercials, their ratings that night will not count in the season's average, but ABC's will.
ABC gained another big advantage on Friday, when it ran its normal schedule. According to the overnight ratings, ABC had a 15.1 rating, to a 10.8 for NBC and 9.4 for CBS.
Chaos continued on Friday night as commercials interrupted other commercials and the late-breaking news that Israel had been hit again was covered in full on the West Coast, pre-empting entertainment shows that were to have played at 10 P.M.
The second act of the "Cheers" episode started up in the middle of a commercial, played for about 20 seconds and then stopped and started all over again.
ABC News broadcast videotape it labeled "exclusive" even though the same tape was playing on CBS.
Twice, CBS News ran tape that ended with the face of an ABC correspondent, Chris Wallace.
 
Interrupting 'Ninja Turtles'
 On Saturday, all three networks interrupted their morning cartoons for a military briefing. CBS stayed with the report only a short time -- because it came in the middle of the most popular and lucrative program on Saturday morning: "Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles."
One CBS executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, "You have to start to ask yourself, does the public right to know extend to 5-year-olds?"
Yesterday, to protect their investments in football, NBC and CBS kept their interruptions for news to a minimum during the National Football League's playoff games.
The concern about programming schedules will spill over into the current week, especially at CBS, which faces potential "disaster," as Mr. Stringer put it, if its repeat of the highly popular "Lonesome Dove" mini-series winds up being pre-empted repeatedly.
 
Fears About the Super Bowl
 The N.F.L. says it intends to play the Super Bowl as scheduled next Sunday, but fears persist that breaking news will interfere with television's biggest yearly event.
ABC, which will broadcast the game, fears it will be interrupted in mid-play, which would wreak havoc on its commercial agreements.
And NBC and CBS fear the game will be delayed by a week. That would put the Super Bowl into February -- a ratings sweep month, one of television's most important rating periods because it sets advertising rates for the next quarter.
ABC would then be all but guaranteed a sweep month win.

HEADLINE: New Tax to Aid Canada in Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
As Canadians grouse about a new tax that adds 7 percent to the price of newspapers, haircuts, clothing and just about everything else they buy, businesses on the American side of the border are fretting about the implications of the tax on their trade with Canada.
Each country is the other's biggest customer, and they have a two-year-old free-trade pact that is progressively lowering tariffs to stimulate trade and economic growth. But Canada's Goods and Services Tax, which went into effect on Jan. 1, alters the terms of trade in Canada's favor. 
 The new tax is a value-added tax, which is a type of broad-based sales tax. Canadian exporters get a rebate equal to the amount of the tax they have paid on purchases related to their foreign sales, so they are able to sell their goods abroad for less than previously.
Because the new tax substitutes for a manufacturers excise tax that was not refundable and had reached as high as 13.5 percent, Canadian manufacturers are now expected to become more competitive.
"Generally speaking, it gives Canadians an edge in their trade with us," said Paul R. Huard, vice president for taxes at the 13,500-member National Association of Manufacturers.
 
Effect on Trade
 The Canadian Manufacturers Association projected that the value-added tax would increase Canadian exports by $1.25 billion to $2 billion in American dollars annually over the next two years. The Conference Board of Canada, another business group, estimated the tax would cut imports by at least $2.5 billion in both years.
About 70 to 80 percent of Canada's trade is with the United States, so the tax is likely to increase Canada's trade surplus with the United States.
Mr. Huard and other United States tax experts said they expected the Canadian experience with the tax to become a matter of debate in the United States, where a value-added tax has been discussed for at least a decade.
"I can tell you that this thing is attracting increasing attention from staff members and from business -- from people concerned about trade and from people who have big ideas that require funding, such as national health care," said David A. Rudd, legislative director for Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina.
 
Consideration Urged
 Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International said, "If it works in Canada in reducing consumption, boosting investment and improving the trade balance, then we must consider whether it would be useful here."
Cliff Massa 3d, a partner in the law and lobbying firm of Patton, Boggs & Blow, said the United States was the only major industrial democracy without a value-added tax.
The tax is controversial in Washington, where opponents say it is regressive because in paying taxes on, say, shirts, the tax would take a larger share of of a poor person's income than that of a wealthy person. Critics also say a value-added tax is inflationary.
Canada considered the tax for five years. The Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney finally pushed it through Parliament last month after revisions to meet some objections.
 
Some Exemptions
 Basic groceries, residential rents, health and education expenses and some other necessities are exempt. The Government also agreed to make cash payments at the start of every quarter to people with lower incomes to help them offset the tax. The first checks have just gone out.
Yet some of the new rules confounded consumers. The tax applies to salted nuts but not unsalted nuts, for example, presumably because the latter are counted as basic food and not cocktail fare.
The Europeans adopted value-added taxes 20 years ago and Japan introduced one last year. New Zealand and South Korea also added such a tax recently.
"The point is that at a time when the U.S. trade balance is still negative, it doesn't make any sense for us not to think about raising revenues in this way," Mr. Massa added.
 In 1989, the United States trade deficit with Canada was $9.1 billion. Last year, in the latest figures, it was running at an annual rate of $5 billion.
 
Some U.S. Beneficiaries
 American companies with production in Canada could be among the beneficiaries of the tax.
James Hutchison, director of taxes at the International Business Machines Corporation's Canadian headquarters in Toronto, said that because of the replacement of the manufacturers' excise tax with the value-added tax, the cost of data-processing equipment had effectively fallen by 5 percent.
"This helps I.B.M. become more competitive in Canada," he said. "Over time, we should see a positive impact on our exports from Canada."
David G. Rehor, vice president and controller of Ford of Canada, said, "We get some advantage to the extent that all our suppliers enjoy lower costs and their prices reflect that cost advantage."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Figuring the Cost if War Is Long

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Some financial analysts are beginning to calculate the consequences of a long Middle Eastern war for the Federal budget deficit and the bond markets.
The first official estimates of the cost will not be available until Feb. 4, the publication date for the 1991 budget. 
 David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said the budget would project American costs for the operation at about $30 billion. That includes the costs of deploying the troops in the Persian Gulf and maintaining them until Jan. 16, he said, but not the additional $1 billion to $2 billion that military experts say is being spent daily to conduct the war.
"There really isn't much of a problem if the war is a short one," he said. "But if it drags on, the budget deficit this year could amount to $400 billion. At some point the market may have to cope with what will be a very large deficit. I think it is time to have a discussion on the issue."
Credit market participants have long expected the Federal deficit to climb in the current fiscal year, possibly above $300 billion, because of the savings and loan bailout, the commercial banking setbacks and the recession, which could cut deeply into tax revenues.
 
Limited Impact Seen
 A protracted war would clearly have budgetary consequences, but they need not be reflected in the budget of the current fiscal year, said Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
"The damage to the 1991 budget deficit may be more contained than feared," Ms. Hering said, "and the deficit may not break above the $300 billion to $325 billion range."
Limiting the impact on the 1991 budget will be the fact that incremental costs, like replacing aircraft and other sophisticated weaponry, can be stretched over several years. Moreover, still-binding budget constraints will also tend to delay, if not impede, the rebuilding process.
"The longer the war goes on and the more equipment we lose, the more expensive it is," Ms. Hering said. "But with a recession and the thrift bailout going on, this war is a small element in the deficit."
Yet, many analysts say the risk of a protracted war may force up interest rates on $21.5 billion worth of new two-year and five-year Treasury notes that will be sold at auction this week.
 
Greenspan's Concern
 Recent statements by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, may force analysts and credit market participants to refocus some attention on the weekly money supply figures the Fed releases each Thursday afternoon.
In an interview published in The Wall Street Journal on Friday, Mr. Greenspan made it clear that the Fed was concerned about the money supply figures, which have shown no growth in three months, in large part because of a slowdown in bank lending.
The fact that Mr. Greenspan chose to single out the recent slowdown in money growth puzzled some analysts. The Fed, which a decade ago placed great policy importance on the money figures, has largely ignored the numbers in recent years, they said. Moreover, although more acute of late, the slowdown in money growth began about four years ago.
The real reason Mr. Greenspan raised the issue, some analysts contend, has more to do with divisions on the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee than with a sudden re-discovery of the importance of the money figures.
Mr. Greenspan's comments "send a message to the more hawkish members of the F.O.M.C., who continue to fear inflation, that weak money growth is another manifestation of the general problem, which is weak economic growth," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "Talk about money growth is a smoke screen to justify another easing in Fed policy."
 
Commerce Data Due
 A sudden drop in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market on Friday, to well below the 6.75 percent rate that is seen as the Fed's target, prompted some analysts to wonder if the Fed had not sent a signal that it had eased policy again.
But Mr. Fine and other analysts said that with a war raging and the impact of its recent cuts in the funds rate not yet visible in the economy, the Fed was more likely to pause before moving again.
"I don't think the Fed has finished easing monetary policy, but I think they are getting pretty close," said Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and money market economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
The only economic data of any real interest this week is due Friday, when the Commerce Department will provide its first estimate of how the economy fared in the fourth quarter.
The only real element of surprise in the report, analysts said, will be how much the economy contracted during the last three months of 1990.
At the moment, estimates range from a decline of as little as 2.5 percent to as much as 4 percent. Whatever the number actually is, it will remove any doubt that the fourth quarter marked the onset of recession, the analysts said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Some Progress in Japanese Trade Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Japanese and American trade negotiators resume their talks this week after an initial round that the American side characterized as showing "steady incremental progress" on some issues but little forward movement on many others.
After two days of talks on so-called structural impediments to trade between the United States and Japan, officials on both sides said Friday that the atmosphere was troubled and occasionally overshadowed by news of the war in the Persian Gulf. 
 Richard T. McCormack, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said that while the American trade deficit with Japan had dropped from $51 billion in 1988 to $40 billion last year, Washington was concerned about the durability of the trend.
 
Barriers to Trade
 The talks do not focus on any specific products, but rather on business and financial practices that analysts say serve as barriers to trade. Tokyo and Washington agreed last summer to make many changes and are now negotiating the mechanisms by which to carry out their promises.
"It is vital that this structural initiative succeed," Mr. McCormack said, adding that the American goal of eliminating its trade deficit with Japan by the end of the 1990's was largely dependent on it.
Mr. McCormack said Japan had made progress on keeping its promises to increase spending on public works and to clear the way for the opening of more large retail stores, which would make it easier for consumers to buy imported goods.
But he and others said Japan had made little progress on American demands to ease the powerful grip of Japan's interlocking business cartels, which critics say engage in collusive anti-competitive practices and price fixing.
The Japanese say their anti-competitive practices are being curbed by newly aggressive Government regulators.
 
Corporate Fines
 The United States came to the talks with reams of material showing that in contrast to other major industrial countries, Japan does little to levy corporate fines for price fixing or antitrust behavior. The Americans say the steps Japan has taken so far will not be very effective.
Japanese officials said the session involved repeated offers by Japan of"clarified explanations" of its positions, mostly on why it could not do what the Americans demanded.
At the same time, Japan expressed disappointment at the slow pace of Washington in eliminating American structural impediments.
 
The Japanese View
 Japan takes the view, shared by many American economists, that the huge American budget deficit soaks up capital that might go into making businesses more competitive. Therefore, Japan seeks a commitment to eliminate the budget deficit, even if that involves raising taxes.
As they have in the past, Japanese negotiators declared themselves somewhat unimpressed with President Bush's budget-deficit package of last year that caused him to renege on his "no new taxes" pledge.
Kenichiro Sasae, director of the economic division of American-Japanese relations at the Foreign Ministry, said Americans had told him that officials in Washington would "redouble their efforts" to reduce the deficit this year, a promise other Japanese say privately they do not take too seriously.

HEADLINE: Varied Polish Reaction To a Rebuke Over Jews

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTWOCK, Poland, Jan. 20

 BODY:
To Przemyslaw Kociewski, the reading from the pulpit of an official Roman Catholic Church statement condemning anti-Semitism was long overdue. But Helena Michalczyk left the white brick church in this small parish church on the outskirts of Warsaw with her suspicions of Jews intact.
Reactions here to the letter by Polish church leaders ran the gamut of this country's complex, often troubled relationship between Christian Poles and Jews. 
 The document represents the most unequivocal stand on the issue ever taken by the Polish church. It argues that anti-Semitism is contrary to the Gospel and acknowledges that some Poles were "indifferent" to the plight of Jews who died in Nazi death camps in this country.
Recited at every Catholic Mass celebrated in Poland, the letter was issued in response to the increasingly visible expressions of anti-Semitism in this country, which once had a Jewish minority of around three million but is now home to just a handful of Jews.
 
'It Has Come So Late'
 Mr. Kociewski, a musician who returned to Poland this fall after living in the United States for 10 months, said he was shocked by the open assertions of anti-Semitism that characterized the recent presidential election campaign. "This is something very loud, very dangerous, and I think this pastoral letter is very important," he said. "I'm only sorry it has come so late."
Mrs. Michalczyk, a 60-year old pensioner, remembers well the years before the war when Jews were a visible presence in this village, about 15 miles southeast of Warsaw. They had a synagogue and a tight-knit neighborhood, and they operated local shops. Today, all that remains of the Jews is a small monument, and Mrs. Michalczyk said she has heard rumors that some of the Jews might be returning to reclaim their property.
Would that be a good development, she was asked.
"No, I wouldn't say that," she replied. "They haven't done anything good for Poland."
 
'Poles Can Be Prejudiced'
 Nonetheless, Mrs. Michalczyk said the letter she heard in church today was useful to remind both young and old of the values of toleration. "Poles can be rather prejudiced," she said.
The letter was read here by the Rev. Tadeusz Polak, a 33-year-old priest who has served in this parish for two years.
He said the text was significant, but predicted that it would take more than one statement, however vehement, to reverse a trend that has become increasingly public since the fall of Communism.
"To me, this is a kind of road sign," he said. "Maybe people today weren't able to receive it properly. It must be followed up in pastoral work and in religious instruction in the schools."
Father Polak was a teen-ager when the Communists announced the 1968 campaign to remove Jews from positions in Government. He remembers a few derogatory comments about Jews by fellow students on the playgrounds. But to Father Polak, Mr. Kociewski and others, that incident made anti-Semitism the province of the Communists.
With the advent of free press and free speech in 1989, Poland became engaged in a national debate about anti-Semitism. Anti-Jewish feelings, from graffiti to occasional violence, became visible. The trend seemed to be accentuated by the hard times endured by many as a consequence of this nation's program for fostering development of a market economy.
 
Walesa Disavows His Words
 The feelings were more noticable in last year's presidential election campaign. A frequent charge made against former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a politically unpopular leader who is a devout Catholic, is that he was secretly a Jew. Lech Walesa, who won the election, heightened tensions with his ambiguous statement that Jews in politics should "identify themselves." He later acknowledged those words were ill-chosen and issued an unequivocal disavowal of anti-Semitism.
Father Polak said he rejected the stereotype of Poles as anti-Semites. But he said that in making his rounds among parisioners, and even in talking to his colleagues who are priests, he hears many who are frustrated and seek easy explanations.
"You might call it the taming of reality," he said. "Some people need to create from irrational events something rational. So they say, 'It is the Jews.' "

HEADLINE: Haiti Turnout Is Sparse In Legislative Elections

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Voter turnout was sparse across much of the countryside today in legislative and local government contests that concluded Haiti's first fully free national elections.
Throughout the country, Haitians dressed in bright Sunday finery for morning church services, or selling goods at dusty rural roadside markets, showed little interest in the elections, and voters, when they turned up at polling places, faced none of the long, boisterous lines seen in last month's presidential race. 
 Sensing the lack of interest in the second round of voting, last week, election officials, party leaders and the president-elect, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, made last-minute appeals to Haitians to fulfill their "civic duty" and take part in the legislative elections. Today's vote will determine whether Father Aristide, a leftist Roman Catholic priest and political novice, will have a clear majority in the National Assembly or will have to negotiate with opposition parties over the choice of a prime minister and other policy matters. Results will not be known before midweek.
With Father Aristide's landslide win last Dec. 16, after a tense period of politically related violence, many Haitians say they have turned their attention away from politics until after the inauguration of a new government on Feb. 7. At that time, Father Aristide's grass-roots supporters say, they hope to see the president reign in inflation and bring to justice perceived criminals from the deposed Duvalier-family dictatorship and successive governments.

 Jacques Gerard, a Canadian expert on elections who has led an observation team from the Organization of American States, estimated that no more than 20 to 25 percent of the eligible voters took part today. Last month voter participation was as high as 65 percent.
"For a lot of people it is all over once the president is chosen," said Desir Demeza, an election observer for a political party who manned a polling station at a church in Montrouis, a small coastal town 40 miles northwest of the capital. "Most people are just not concerned about deputies and senators."
By midmorning, several hours after the polling stations opened, election officials in Montrouis said only 25 people had voted in one station. At Carrefour Medard, another small town on Haiti's coastal highway, only six people had voted more than three hours after the start of the election.
"People say the deputies are there to protect the interests of people from their regions," said one of those voters, Andre Elizaire Poteau, a 68-year-old pensioner and former farmer, explaining his interest in the elections. "I don't know if it is true. Once upon a time being a legislator was a sinecure. We'll see if things change."
 
Aristide Rivals Assailed
 Haitian commentators have criticized leaders of several rival parties to Father Aristide's National Front for Democracy and Change, saying they failed to campaign strenuously for the legislative races out of discouragement over the president-elect's overwhelming popular support.
After hastily assembling an incomplete slate of candidates to run on his ticket, Father Aristide, a last-minute entry into the presidential race, succeeded in having 15 deputies and 5 senators elected outright in the first round of voting last month, avoiding runoffs this week for those candidates. The National Assembly includes a total of 27 senate seats and 83 deputies.
Francois Benoit, referring to the crushing defeat of his party, the National Alliance for Democracy and Progress, by Father Aristide and his allies last month, said, "Everyone was shocked, the A.N.D.P. included, not because we lost, but how we lost." Mr. Benoit suggested that there had been widespread irregularities, but international observers have described that vote as largely honest and fair.
The National Alliance, an alliance of center-right and socialist politicians, whose conservative presidential candidate, Marc Bazin, was widely considered the favorite until Father Aristide's entry into the race, fielded a full slate of legislative candidates. It won 14 deputy seats outright, but no senatorial posts.
Mr. Benoit, who is vice president of the alliance, said no party would emerge from today's elections with a clear majority and predicted an intense period of coalition building before Father Aristide is able to form a government.

Abortion Fight Goes On, State by State by State

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
In what has become an annual ritual, anti abortion demonstrators will march on the nation's capital on Tuesday to mark the 18th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision recognizing a constitutional right to abortion.
But perhaps a better symbol of the current state of abortion politics was the briefing last week by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities. 
 It was coordinated by the public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton and revolved around polling done by the Wirthlin Group, the well-connected firm that polled for President Ronald Reagan. And the person speaking for the bishops was Helen Alvare, an attractive young lawyer who spoke of a long-term struggle for "hearts and minds," an outright ban on abortions and, in the interim, a drive in state legislatures for new restrictions.
Supporters of abortion rights, of course, have their own poll takers, media consultants, long-term and short-term strategies and attractive spokeswomen, from Kate Michelman of the National Abortion Rights Action League to Faye Wattleton of Planned Parenthood. That is exactly the point. Eighteen years after Roe, and 18 months after the Supreme Court reopened the political struggle over abortion with Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, what is striking is how institutionalized, and incremental, the battle over abortion has become.
It is no longer the front-burner issue it seemed in 1989, right after the Webster decision gave states new latitude to restrict abortion. The 1990 elections were dominated by issues like taxes, the state of the economy and the prospect of war in the Persian Gulf.
But then and now, advocates on both sides of the abortion issue have kept struggling, fighting their own form of trench warfare -- state by state, election by election. "While everyone else in the world is thinking of war in the Persian Gulf, there are probably 20,000 people out there working every day trying to get ready for 1992 on a different issue," said Harrison Hickman, a poll taker who advises the National Abortion Rights Action League.
Gary Bauer, an abortion opponent who was Mr. Reagan's domestic policy adviser, said: "I think it's fairly clear at this point that neither side can expect some fateful day where a Supreme Court decision will once again resolve the whole matter. It's going to be, I assume, a long, grind-out struggle by both sides."
Right now, for example, there is organizing under way for the battle over the Republican platform in 1992. The current platform commits the party to a constitutional amendment overturning Roe; many Republican supporters of abortion rights, galvanized by the Webster decision, hope to soften that language in 1992. "I don't see how that fight can be avoided," said Roger Stone, a Republican adviser who has argued that his party must ease its stance.
At the same time, new skirmishes are beginning in state legislatures. The National Abortion Rights Action League said that at least 30 bills it views as restrictive had been introduced in the states by the end of last week and that many more were expected.
"It's gotten to such a sophisticated and tactical level in the states," said Loretta Ucelli, spokeswoman for the league. Most of these struggles are not over outright bans on abortion, but over whether and how it should be restricted, like bills requiring parental consent for teen-agers seeking abortions.
It is a logical outgrowth of turning the abortion issue back to the states, back to the political process.
Politicians instinctively search for a middle ground, and that is particularly true on an issue like abortion, since The New York Times/CBS News Poll has consistently found Americans about evenly divided between wanting abortion to be generally available and wanting more restrictions on it.
This might suggest that, at some point, a rough consensus would be reached and the struggle over abortion would gradually wane. But this is not a struggle over a highway or a dam. On both sides of the issue, there is a core of advocates with radically differing beliefs. One side was mobilized by Roe, the other by Webster. They are dug in. In their presence, the struggle over abortion seems unending.

The Home Front: A People Divided Knows No Peace

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
"What are we fighting for?" the Rev. Charles L. Norris, pastor of Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church in Jamaica, Queens, and a member of New York City's Human Rights Commission, demanded last week.
"So Israel can have a state? That's fine. But when the war is over, can I come back and move into Jamaica Estates or Great Neck or Richmond Hill? If I'm going to fight for something, I should be able to get equal justice under the law." 
 Today, many Americans will mark the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by barely pausing in their understandable preoccupation with a faraway war. The questions raised by Mr. Norris, though, recall that a crisis over another gulf simmers closer to home.
The gap between blacks and whites is difficult to quantify. So are its manifestations -- including practices that, coupled with economic and social factors, may keep blacks like Mr. Norris from living or feeling welcome in some neighborhoods and from even venturing into others.
Apparent gains are sometimes illusory. New York inaugurated a black man as Mayor last year. Yet his wife had trouble hailing cabs not many years ago because some drivers -- responding reflexively to concerns over economics and fears about crime and race -- presumably figured that she was heading for Harlem, which, indeed, she was.
Mayor David N. Dinkins and his white detractors concur that he has sometimes been measured by a different standard: a harsher or a more lenient one, depending on whom you ask. That Mr. Dinkins might himself be guilty of applying a double standard was suggested to some people by his seemingly too evenhanded early responses to the boycott by a group of blacks of a Brooklyn grocery story owned by Korean immigrants.
Mr. Dinkins's sensitivity to his special status is indicated by his private response -- which he said he doesn't remember, but which a businessman vividly recalls -- to reports that the State Financial Control Board might usurp the powers of the city's first black Mayor. "If the F.C.B. tries to take over," Mr. Din kins was quoted as saying, "the Korean boycott would be nothing compared to that." It was not a threat, but a safe bet.
 The boycott drama tized the emergence of new targets and al liances in New York's changing mosaic. It further strained ties between blacks and liberal whites who had become "the closest of strangers," as the author Jim Sleeper called them in the title of his recent book.
That strain is reflected in a reluctance to go beyond finger-pointing. Some blacks may prefer feeling victimized to facing unvarnished verities about street crime's predominant perpetrators, as well as its victims. Some whites refuse to remember that even "the fallen have stories" or to acknowledge the appeal to many blacks of the Rev. Al Sharpton's broad message about racial injustice, if not his audacious delivery of circumstantial evidence. Other whites are more tolerant of racist remarks by blacks than by fellow whites.
Debate rages in the magazine The Nation. Mr. Sleeper, responding to a critical review of his book, declared that "a politics based on dramatizing racial grievances hasn't the ghost of a chance in America." To which the reviewer, Dean Haywood Burns of the City University of New York Law School, replied that the civil rights movement changed an entire society and that "if it now refuses to change even more, this may be more a commentary on the society than on its critics."
Mark Naison, a white professor who teaches Afro-American studies at Fordham University, agreed with Mr. Sleeper that, given the influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America, "the politics of black rage and white guilt no longer serves the cause of justice in a multi-ethnic New York." Brian Boyle, an owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers Bar (whose name evokes a newly integrated team in a segregated borough) wrote that racism today may be harder to identify and "perhaps that's why many blacks see racism everywhere."
One measure of the lingering gulf in perceptions is the mail this column regularly elicits when racial shibboleths are questioned. Readers, invariably citing what they perceive to be the bias or the sensitivity of the very same column, routinely assume that this columnist is black. People believe what they want to.
Years ago, when Dr. King was stabbed in a Harlem bookstore owned by a white man, police officials contacted Mayor Robert F. Wagner's Commission on Intergroup Relations, which spread the word that the assailant was, in fact, a demented black woman. Further violence was averted because the commission had credibility. Today, though, one definition of equality may be that both sides seem reluctant to give anybody the benefit of the doubt.

HEADLINE: Group of 7 Opens Talks On Outlook

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
Against the backdrop of war, the top economic policy makers from the United States and its six main industrial allies gathered in New York yesterday for a two-day assessment of the world economy.
The date of the meeting was set weeks ago to give the finance ministers and chief central bankers from the Group of Seven countries a chance at the start of the year to review a variety of financial and monetary issues. But the ministers agreed that those matters would now be overshadowed by the war.
 
'Not an Emergency Meeting'
 "This is not an emergency meeting," a Bush Administration official emphasized. But he added, "The events in the gulf are of course going to be a very important part of the discussions."
Michael H. Wilson, the Finance Minister of Canada, said, "Expectations for various economies, particularly with regard to the impact of the hostilities in the gulf -- that's the key." 
 Officials from the United States and some other countries said they did not expect concrete action to come out of the meetings. But they said the finance officials and central bankers could be expected to promise to intervene in the currency markets if damaging fluctuations resulted from the war.
In addition to the United States, the countries in the Group of Seven are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
"The whole purpose of the Group of Seven is to stabilize the world economy," a European official said, "and I think it is fair to say that they are concerned about market volatility with a war going on.".
The dollar, already considered undervalued, fell sharply after war broke out last week, but an American official said no intervention was needed now to bolster the dollar. A weak dollar makes American exports cheaper overseas and could be beneficial for the American economy as it struggles against recession.
The price of oil has plunged to less than $20 a barrel on the war news, an encouraging development for the seven industrial countries.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady met yesterday afternoon with several of his counterparts, including Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese Finance Minister.
A Tokyo newspaper reported over the weekend that Japan was prepared to pledge an additional $5 billion to the war effort, but neither American nor Japanese officials would confirm the figure yesterday.
"They said they'd do their share," Mr. Brady said.
Mr. Brady planned to have breakfast this morning with the German Finance Minsister, Theo Waigel, and was said to be prepared to ask the Germans for a larger contribution to the war effort.
 
Japan's Pledge
 Last year, Japan pledged $2 billion to the American-led military effort in the Persian Gulf and another $2 billion to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, whose economies have been especially damaged by the gulf crisis.
Although the Bush Administration has not complained, many American lawmakers vigorously objected during the recent Congressional debate on the war that the Japanese contribution was too small given the wealth of Japan, its failure to make a military commitment and its dependence on Middle Eastern oil.
A Canadian official here said that while he knew nothing of the Brady-Hashimoto meeting, he was sure that "burden sharing" would be a main topic in the Group of Seven discussions.
The entire group met for dinner last night at a midtown restaurant, and a daylong meeting is planned today at the Stanhope hotel on Fifth Avenue at 81st Street. Normally, a communique is issued at the end of the final meeting outlining whatever agreements were reached.
 
Third Word Debt
 Other issues the policy makers can be expected to discuss are the state of the Soviet economy, third world debt and the future of trade liberalization talks.
Until recently, the United States was promoting measures to bring the Soviet Union into the world economy, including a partial membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, but those measures are likely to be put off in light of the violence in Lithuania and Latvia this month.
In any event, those issues are sure to take a backseat to the overriding question of the effect of the war on the various countries' economies.
This is the first time a large-scale war involving the industrialized countries has broken out since international exchange rates were allowed to fluctuate beginning in the early 1970's, and economists are uncertain what that could mean.
 
Testing Old Assumptions
 The assumption used to be that the dollar would be viewed as a safe holding in a military crisis and would rise in value. But many economists believe that assumption is no longer valid, and their view seems to have been supported by the dollar's drop late last week.

HEADLINE: War News Captivates, And Commerce Slows

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
As the nation followed the war news from the Persian Gulf last week, the pace of business in America slowed.
Department stores, already reeling from a poor Christmas season, were mostly deserted late last week. In supermarkets, there were scattered incidents of customers stocking up on canned goods. 
 Pocket televisions sat on the desks at many offices, and in Minneapolis, Honeywell Inc,, the big military contractor, told employees they could watch the news, as their handiwork received its trial in battle.
At Wong's Market in Norwalk, Calif., grocery clerks shuttled in and out of an office to watch a television while shoppers paused in the aisles during radio news broadcasts played over the public address system.
"When the President was on the radio, everybody just stopped and listened," said Beverly White, a manager at Wong's.
 
Glued to Their Sets <HE
 Some retailers had few customers even to listen to the radio. "There's no question but that the national interest in following the Mideast war has had national impact in reducing store traffic," said Arthur Martinez, vice chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, which operates 47 stores across the country. "The stores are mostly empty because people are glued to the TV sets. It's not a matter of shoppers coming in and deciding not to buy."
Many businesses have also braced for terrorist attacks. The McDonald's Corporation encouraged its franchise restaurants to be prepared to search their garbage dumpsters on short notice for suspicious objects, to empty waste baskets more often and to stay alert for unattended packages.
"A lot of these things we do already," said a company executive who insisted on anonymity. "The difference would be in the degree of diligence."
 
Closing and Moving
 The New York Stock Exchange closed its trading floor and visitors gallery to outsiders.
A home furnishings convention, scheduled to open next month in Munich, Germany, was abruptly moved to Dallas. "We want to avoid any problems that we might face in international travel," said Lee Abraham, the chairman and chief executive of the New York-based Associated Merchanidising Corporation, which organizes the annual event.
Employees at some companies insisted they were able to work while listening and occasionally glancing at a television. "It's sort of similar to being in high school or college and doing my homework with the TV on," said David Rothenberg, a 26-year-old real estate developer who brought a small television to his New York office. "After years of experience, I'm pretty good at it."
Lewis A. Kaplan, a partner at the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York, said 10 people crowded around a radio in his office to hear the President's speech. "We chewed up about half an hour listening," he said.
 
Tired and Less Efficient
 A senior Federal Government economist who insisted on anonymity said he knew of no research on whether the distraction of a national crisis had any measurable impact on productivity. But he said he was tired and less efficient from staying up late to follow news accounts.
"These things key you up, and you find it hard to get to sleep," he said. "And I took some work home last night and didn't get it done because I watched the television."
Many companies, including General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Morgan Stanley and I.B.M., have limited or banned international travel for their employees.
Mr. Rothenberg, the real estate agent who works for the Tishman Realty and Construction Company, said he had been looking forward to flying to Japan over the weekend, but was forced to cancel the trip on Thursday because of safety concerns.

HEADLINE: Personal Bankruptcies Mounting With the Trepidation Lessening

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW CANAAN, Conn., Jan. 20

 BODY:
Throughout most of the 1980's, Paul Bernier, like many people here, prospered. He owned a 20-year-old contracting business. He also owned a fairly modest $300,000 home in this wealthy Fairfield County town.
In the last 18 months, though, Mr. Bernier's company has collapsed under the Northeast's falling real-estate market. His debts run into the millions. His home, which was used to guarantee several business loans, will probably be sold. And last November he filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 7 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. 
 "I really didn't have much of a choice," he said.
Mr. Bernier, who is 39 years old, is one of a record number of people who have filed forpersonal bankruptcy in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in the last year as the Northeast has led the country in the growth of bankruptcies.
 
Dramatic Increases
 They have filed for various reasons: loss of a job, a business failure, mounting household debts, overwhelming medical bills, lost lawsuits, declining home equity. They also appear to have filed with less trepidation about the ramifications of bankruptcy.
"Nowadays, people who have good credit can't get credit, so what does it matter," Mr. Bernier said.
In the last year, the number of personal bankruptcies has risen dramatically in the New York metropolitan region, soaring to its highest level in history, according to the American Financial Services Association, a Washington trade organization that tracks bankruptcy filings.
In Connecticut, there was a 52 percent increase in nonbusiness bankruptcy filings, to 4,521 from 2,973 for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, 1990. In New Jersey, there was a 47 percent rise to 12,748 filings from 8,645.
In the Federal Bankruptcy Court's Eastern District of New York, which covers Long Island, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, filings rose 39 percent to 10,094 from 7,260. In the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester County, filings rose 28 percent to 5,606 from 4,363.
 
Above National Average
 The increases for the three states compare with a 15 percent rise nationally. Only Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island recorded percentage increases larger than Connecticut did for the period.
"Every month it seems to go up," said Thomas H. Abraham, the clerk of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Hartford, who predicted that bankruptcies in Connecticut would increase by an even larger margin when figures for the final quarter of 1990 were computed within the next few weeks.
The current wave of bankruptcies, which outnumber those filed during the 1981-82 recession, began in late 1985 after a three-year period in which filings were on the decline, said Judy Kent, a spokeswoman for the American Financial Services Association. "Since then, the rise has been continuous," she said.
Ira B. Charmoy, a Bridgeport bankruptcy lawyer, said the number of filings stemmed from the region's ailing economy. He added, though, that no single factor like rising unemployment has caused the surge in bankruptcies in the Northeast.
No significant law changes have been adopted in the last 12 years that would make filing for bankruptcy more desirable today. In fact, the type of debts that cannot be written off through bankruptcy has been expanded to include debts like judgments incurred because of a drunken-driving offense.
 
Borrowing on Homes
 Even so, in the New York metropolitan region several bankruptcy trends are discernible. Dr. Robert W. Johnson, a senior research associate at the Credit Research Center at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., said many filings in the Northeast appeared to be by individuals in construction or real estate.
He also said many of the bankruptcies appear to be connected to the deflation in the housing market. "People have been borrowing on their home, and, in some cases, the dollar value of the loan has become greater than the value of the house," he said.
Mr. Abraham, the bankruptcy court clerk, said there has also been a marked increase in Chapter 13 filings, which enable debtors to keep their homes if they continue making mortgage payments and partial payments on their other debts, sometimes as little as 10 percent, over a period generally no longer than five years.
Chapter 7 filings, which are more common, erase all debts in exchange for liquidating all assets, with exemptions generally totaling no more than about $10,000 in cash and home equity. Assets like automobiles, as well as other loans or lines of credit, can be retained if the individual loan is reaffirmed in full with the lender. Chapter 11 bankruptcies, generally restricted to corporate bankruptcies, are also used in rare instances by individuals with small businesses.
"There have been an awful lot of foreclosures, which bring the Chapter 13's up," Mr. Abraham said.
 
'Facing the Reality'
 Vincent J. Freccia, a Stamford bankruptcy lawyer, said debtors were deciding more quickly to file for bankruptcy than they had in the past. "They are facing the reality a lot more quickly," he said.
Creditors have noted this trend, too. Through higher prices, they pass on to consumers about $10 billion a year in bankruptcy-related losses. "We are very concerned that bankruptcy is being looked at as the first alternative rather than the last resort," said Kenneth R. Crone, vice president and director of the bankruptcy recovery program at Visa USA in San Francisco.
The bankruptcy boom is also being felt in the regional consumer counseling offices operated by the National Foundation for Consumer Credit, a nonprofit group based in Silver Spring, Md.
 
More Viable Option
 At the foundation's New Haven office, the branch manager, Will L. Parkerton, said more people were seeking help managing their debts than ever before. "We are seeing 350 to 400 people a month, double the number a year ago," he said. "We can't see someone coming in today until early February."
Mr. Parkerton added that bankruptcy seemed to become a more viable option during economic downturns because debtors often could not work second jobs, collect overtime or maintain a two-paycheck family to cover household debts.
A typical client, he said, earns $26,000 a year and owes about two-thirds of a year's salary in installment debt, excluding mortgages. Those who opt for bankruptcy usually have a similar level of income but owe about a full year's salary.
He also said about 15 percent of his current clients had debts so large that they were urged to consider bankruptcy. "The degree of encouragement we can offer people these days is less," he said.
 
A 'Badge' of the Recession
 Mark S. Carron, a bankruptcy lawyer in Westport, said clients were often less concerned with the social stigma of bankruptcy than the practical difficulty of re-establishing credit. "As more and more people use it, it becomes a badge of the 1990 recession," he said.
Paul A. Dingwall, 30, of Bridgeport, who filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1988 after losing a $250,000 lawsuit filed in connection with several small businesses he owned, said the limitations on credit that follow bankruptcy made it difficult, if not impossible, to start a business, buy a home or rent an apartment. "I wouldn't recommend it unless it was absolutely necessary," he said.
Others are more skeptical about assertions they have heard about not being able to obtain credit for up to 6, 7 or 10 years. "There is no magic number for how long your credit is shot," said Francis J. Browne, a Stamford bankruptcy lawyer.
Dr. Johnson of the Credit Research Center said bankruptcies might influence potential hirings, promotions or security clearances. He also said many people who filed for bankruptcy often had trouble renting apartments and generally found it impossible to obtain a mortgage.
 
Re-establishing Credit
 He cited a study by the center, however, that showed that of 25,000 people who had filed for bankruptcy, many received credit within a fairly brief period. He said 9 percent had some new credit within six months after filing bankruptcy, 17 percent within one year, 33 percent within three years and 50 percent within five years.
Bankruptcy lawyers have also noted a growing astuteness about re-establishing credit. They said some who filed for bankruptcy obtained credit later by keeping open at least one old line of credit, generally by reaffirming a debt or erasing the balance on a credit card and not reporting it during the bankruptcy proceedings.
They also often re-establish credit by using credit cards that require a cash deposit equal to the line of credit.
"Bankruptcy has a bad name," Mr. Carron, the Westport lawyer, said. "What it really is is the Federal Fresh Start program."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: HIGH TECH;
War Hero Status Possible for the Computer Chip

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
If the Pentagon's claims of success in the Persian Gulf war bear up, a hero of the conflict will be the ubiquitous computer chip, no larger than a fingernail and usually made of silicon, which processes reams of information in an instant for planes, bombs, sensors and cruise missiles.
"It's the triumph of silicon over steel," said John E. Pike, a senior analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. 
 Yesterday, the chip's prowess was evident as highly computerized Patriot anti-missile missiles flashed from their launchers in Saudia Arabia, streaked skyward and destroyed Scud missiles in a ball of thunder and flame.
Military experts say the computerized weapons of the international force in the Persian Gulf war seem to be working much better than expected. While cautioning that the overall performance of the new weaponry is not yet known, experts say computers big and small have clearly endowed the equipment with vast new powers of precision and coordination.
Large computers are now synchronizing the forces arrayed against Iraq and churning out detailed battle plans. Computerized jammers are snarling Iraqi defenses. And smart weapons with tiny computer "brains" are zeroing in on targets with deadly precision.
 
Information vs. Volume
 "What's making all this work is weapons based on information instead of the volume of fire power," said James F. Digby, a Rand Corporation analyst who wrote an influential paper in 1976 on precision-guided munitions. "It reduces greatly the tonnage of explosives you have to ship over."
Experts stress that the computerized arms are anything but invincible, as driven home by the difficulty in locating mobile Scud missiles experienced by planes and satellites carrying computerized sensors.
Even so, many experts say the gulf war appears to mark the coming of age of computerized weaponry, a goal that has been much heralded and criticized for 15 years as the emerging systems acquired a mixed record of success and failure.
"I'm impressed," said Herbert F. York, a former head of Pentagon research and development who teaches at the University of California. "It took such a long time. And it's still extremely expensive. But some of the disappointments I've felt over the years are being washed away."
 
Censorship May Hide Failures
 Among the highly computerized systems in the war are Navy Tomahawk cruise missiles, Pave Tack laser-guided bombs, Air Force F-117A Stealth fighters and the Army Patriot anti-missile systems whose interceptions of Iraqi Scud missiles in flight is a wartime first.
Many experts cautioned that the public's view of the war is limited by Pentagon censorship and selective presentation of facts so that computerized failures are generally not known.
"Everything is looking pretty good and I must say I'm impressed," said Eugene J. Carroll, a retired rear admiral and deputy director of the Center for Defense Information, a private group in Washington. "But all the news is coming through a filter. We see the hits but not the misses. Management of the news has put an emphasis on the success of our new weapons."
Pierre Sprey, a Washington-based defense consultant and longtime advocate of simpler military systems that rely less heavily on computer chips, dismissed much of upbeat news as disinformation.
 
Effectiveness Questioned
 "They're retargeting a lot of the places where they already claimed great success," he said. "The bombing just isn't that accurate. In the future, the ineffectiveness is going to become painfully obvious."
The promise of computerized weaponry was first demonstrated in the Vietnam War. The Air Force, for example, flew several hundred unsuccessful sorties to knock out the Thanh Hoa bridge, with 10 planes being shot down. Finally, four Phantom jets armed with Paveway I laser-guided bombs destroyed it in a single run.
But as new, more advanced generations of smart weapons emerged in the 1970's and 80's, they engendered fierce debate as field trails revealed shortcomings and failures. The computerized arms were widely faulted as too costly, ambitious and unreliable to be suitable for war.
The criticism was bolstered when technical glitches hit some military actions, including the 1983 invasion of Grenada, the 1986 raid on Libya and 1989 invasion of Panama. The height of high-tech failings occurred in 1988 when the Navy cruiser Vincennes, equipped with the highly computerized Aegis radar, the world's most advanced naval air defense system, mistakenly shot down an Iranian commercial airliner, killing all on board.
 
Chips to the Rescue
 Given this history, private military analysts were openly apprehensive this fall and winter about a possible war in the Persian Gulf, especially because of the challenge of coordinating the vast multinational force. Predictions of chaos abounded, with experts saying the majority of the first casualties would be self-inflicted.
Instead, the omnipresent computer chip appears to have come to the rescue. At American military headquarters for the war in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a bevy of large computers has generated the overall battle plan and every day churns out hundreds of pages of detailed action orders.
"We have a lot of computers," Lieut. Gen. Charles A. Horner, commander of the American Air Force in the gulf, told reporters last week. "You can bring together the tens of thousands of minor details, radio frequencies, altitudes, tanker rendezvous, bomb configurations, who supports who, who's flying escort, who's -- there are just thousands and thousands of details, and we work them together as one group, put them together in what we call a common air-tasking order, and it provides a sheet of music that everybody sings the same song off."
Another quiet aspect of the chip revolution is tiny, computerized radio receivers that pick up signals from the American military's orbiting Navstar satellites, allowing tanks, ships and plane to pinpoint their positions, reportedly down to an accuracy of less than 100 feet. That navigational data, in turn, is often fed into smart weapons before they speed toward targets.
 
Computers Read 'Maps'
 "The more precise their initial position, the more precise their journey will be," said Ron Hertenstein, vice president for research at Forecast International, Inc., a Newtown, Conn. firm that markets defense and aerospace information.
For instance, the aerial assault against Iraq was kicked off by waves of 18-foot Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from Navy warships in the gulf and the Red Sea. Flying low and largely undetected, the smart missiles hit key targets such as Iraqi command centers.
The Tomahawks, never before used in combat, have tiny on-board computers that read internal "maps" and process information from sensors to perform course corrections in flight.
Mr. Hertenstein of Forecast International noted that accuracy also cuts down on civilian causalities.
 
Jammers Disorient Radar
 "We can attack a target in the middle of Baghdad and keep the damage to innocent people to a minimum," he said. "That certainly does make the situation more acceptable if not palatable."
Another highly computerized system is electronic warfare planes, including the Navy's EA-6B Prowler and the Air Force's EF-111A Raven. These aircraft have electronic jammers that send out high-energy pulses to disarm or disorient enemy radar and other communications.
The jamming devices are directed by powerful computers that first sense an enemy's frequencies and then tailor false signals to fog an enemy's radar display with bright spots, making it impossible to find real information.
Admiral Carroll of the Center for Defense Information laid the "pronounced ineffectiveness" of the Iraqi armed forces to such computerized impediments.
 
Patriot Modified for Missiles
 "We've penetrated their system so severely with our jammers and spookers that they can't see us coming and their antiaircraft batteries are absolutely blind," he said.
Also impressing many experts has been the active defense of the alliance by the Patriot system, which uses a phased-array radar to track enemy targets and a powerful bank of computers to actively guide anti-missile missiles toward their targets.
The Patriot initially was developed to shoot down enemy aircraft, not high-speed missiles. But in recent years it has been modified, mainly through the use of enhanced computers, to defend against limited missile attacks.

HEADLINE: Dr. King's Widow Asks End to War in the Gulf

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 20

 BODY:
On the eve of a Federal holiday honoring her husband, Coretta Scott King called today for an immediate cease-fire in the Persian Gulf and an end to what she described as a system that puts militarism ahead of education.
"Our most urgent short-term priority at the international level is a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf," Mrs. King said in her annual "State of the Dream" speech. She spoke at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. 
 Mrs. King urged her audience "to become involved in working to stop this war" and to put pressure on elected representatives to "call for a cease-fire."
"In 1991 we have to work closer together, to protest and march and speak out more often until preparing for education is a greater priority in every nation than preparing for war," she said.
Dr. King, whose birthday will be recognized by a Federal holiday on Monday, would have been 62 years old on Jan. 15.
In Blacksburg, Va., today, about 30 Ku Klux Klan members marched to protest the holiday. A handful of Klan members were pelted with eggs and snowballs when they rallied at the State Capitol in Albany.
In her speech, Mrs. King commended the Israeli Government and people "for not retaliating against Iraq."
"It takes courage and wisdom to refuse to be sucked into the cycle of retaliation," she said, "and I hope and pray that Israel will be able to continue to exercise restraint."
She stressed that her opposition was "against the war, not the warriors."
Mrs. King also called for more spending on education, saying it must become a higher priority.
If self-financing programs like Social Security are subtracted from the Federal budget, she said, "the U.S. is spending 55 cents out of every taxpayer dollar on the military, compared to just 2 cents for education."
The real hostages today, she said, "are American school children, the nation's 3 million homeless people, the 20 million Americans who experience hunger every day and the 37 million Americans who have no health insurance."
She said that one-fourth of all black men from the ages of 18 to 29 are in jail or in some other phase of the criminal justice process and that one-quarter of black males under 25 have never held a job.
"African-American communities across the nation are experiencing Depression-level unemployment," he said.
She said the Federal Government should begin to substantially increase financing of education and job training programs, and she called for a Congressional commission to study the plight of black males.
Education and job training are needed so young people "can become productive, taxpaying citizens who can help support their families."
"We cannot eradicate illiteracy and other social problems," she went on, "until we eradicate the scourges of militarism from the face of the earth."

HEADLINE: Unions at Javits Center Are Accused of Abuses

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
When the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center opened in 1986, the center's officials pledged to keep exhibition costs low and mobsters out.
Five years later, exhibitors complain of high labor costs and featherbedding, and law-enforcement officials say that Mafia racketeering raises operating costs for exhibitors. 
 The most frequent complaint from show managers and exhibitors is the high cost of setting up a trade show -- more than in any other American city. "Even if takes two seconds to get something done, you have to pay for a minimum of one hour and you might have to use three people," said Dr. Howard B. Menell, who was in charge of a dental trade show in November. "Most of our exhibitors complain that it's too expensive."
Dr. Menell said cleaning bills for his group, the Greater New York Dental Meeting, rose last year to $6,300 from $3,300 in 1989. And exhibitors in other trade shows flinch when describing routine charges of $80 for an electrician to plug in a lamp.
 
Chronic Theft Problems
 Another chronic problem cited by Police Department officials is the systemic theft of supplies and equipment, with reported losses ranging from $500,000 to $1 million annually.
Recalling the theft of a carton of 525 artificial eyes at the International Vision Exhibition last April, Sgt. Michael W. Gerhold, commander of detectives in the 10th Precinct, said the booty, valued at $16,115, was probably worthless to the thief.
"Everything walks out of that place, glass eyes, computers, jewelry, furs, stuffed animals -- whatever is on display," Sergeant Gerhold said.
But many exhibitors feel they have no choice but to put up with costs and the problems with union labor, because the Javits Center, in the nation's largest and most affluent marketplace, is an essential part of doing business. Last year, about 3 million people attended 90 events in the vast building between West 35th and West 39th Streets and 11th and 12th Avenues.
In an effort to reduce operating costs, the New York State corporation that runs the center established binding arbitration for resolving disputes over work rules and the number of employees needed for shows. Officials also obtained a no-strike pledge from four major unions. But many exhibitors say these measures have failed to cut costs significantly.
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, said his office and state police detectives were jointly investigating "allegations of corruption" at the center. He declined to provide details.
Investigators familiar with the inquiry said they were focusing on the carpenter and teamster locals and on possible charges involving extortion, larceny and "no-show" jobs.
And in a civil suit filed last September, Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged that the carpenters' union in the city was controlled by the Genovese organized-crime family and that the center was a hiring hall for mobsters and former convicts.
"Convention Center jobs are very desirable because they offer easy work at overtime rates, together with the opportunity to make even more money by shaking down exhibitors, thefts and other rackets," a former carpenters' union official, Marcello Svedese, said in a court affidavit.
Vincent (Fish) Cafaro, who admits being a former member of the Genovese family, claimed in an affidavit that Mafia leaders "had considerable influence" in the hiring of center carpenters.
In the suit, brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, prosecutors asked the Federal court to appoint trustees to oversee the New York District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners. The council appoints the shop stewards who largely select carpenters hired at the center.
The council's president, Paschal McGuinness, who is a defendant in the RICO case, said in a recent statement that "there is no basis, in fact or in law" for the charges.
Prosecutors identified the carpenters' chief steward at the center, Ralph Coppola, as "a Genovese family associate." The suit contended that Mr. Coppola reports to Liborio (Barney) Bellomo, whom prosecutors identified as a capo in the Genovese family.
Anthony Fiorini, who is the carpenters' assistant chief steward in the center, is Mr. Bellomo's brother-in-law, the suit said. Prosecutors cited another assistant to Mr. Coppola, Nicholas Cirillo, the president of the carpenters' Local 17, as having ties to organized crime. Mr. Coppola, Mr. Fiorini and Mr. Cirillo did not return telephone calls.
 
Union Denies Abuses
 In its separate investigation, the Manhattan District Attorney's office is looking into the activities of the carpenters' union and three other major unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 807, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 3, and the Exhibition Employees Union, Local 829.
"All I can tell you is that none of the officials in this union are involved in shakedowns," said John G. Hohmann, secretary-treasurer of Local 807. He also denied that the union created "ghost" or no-show jobs.
Allegations of irregularities at the center were turned over to Mr. Morgenthau's office three years ago by Alair A. Townsend, who was then the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. Ms. Townsend, in an interview, said there had been numerous complaints from exhibitors about abuses, and that former Mayor Edward I. Koch directed her to give the information to Mr. Morgenthau after center officials had failed to move promptly to deal with the problems.
 
Union Workers Required
 A 13-member public-benefit corporation, the Convention Center Operating Corporation, establishes policies for the center. It has a contract with the Ogden Allied Services Corporation to provide cleaning and maintenance services and to book shows and fairs with trade-show organizers.
The organizers rent space to exhibitors and hire a service or decorating company that employs workers to load and unload equipment and install the booths and electricity. The service companies have contracts requiring them to use only union workers.
Labor costs at the center are as much as 50 percent higher than at convention halls in other big cities. General rates in the center for electricians, for example, are $78.50 an hour, and $108 an hour for overtime.
Some 125 to 400 carpenters, electricians, teamsters and laborers work daily, depending on the number of shows and meetings.
Common complaints by show managers and exhibitors include a rule requiring three electricians instead of one for relatively simple tasks and demands by workers for payoffs to expedite loading and unloading of materials.
But many show managers said the added costs in New York were offset by larger audiences and better sales opportunities. "The labor problems are not nightmares," said Susan Werlinich, the marketing manager for Expoconsul International, a Princeton, N.J., company that organizes trade shows.
Benjamin C. LaRosa, the center's vice president for operations and labor management, also said complaints were exaggerated. But he noted that the corporation had no control over the hiring of union employees.
Asked if the corporation should do more to supervise employees and stop corruption, he said: "That's something we are looking into. But we're waiting for the investigations to finish, to see what they find."

HEADLINE: REBELS ARE POSING THREAT IN PANAMA

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The leaders of a military revolt last month have eluded capture with the aid of active-duty officers and constitute a terrorist threat to the United States-installed Government, American and Panamanian officials say.
Eduardo Herrera Hassan, a retired colonel who was seized by the United States forces that were called in to stop a coup attempt on Dec. 4, was originally identified as the leader of the rebellion. But Panamanian and American officials said he was a front man for a retired captain who escaped with at least 50 heavily armed rebels. 
 Several officials said members of Panama's security forces know where the rebels are hiding but are unwilling to tell loyal police, putting into question American-supported efforts to reform the military after of the December 1989 invasion by the United States.
 
Pledge From U.S.
 The rebels were members of the army under the former Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. That army was defeated in the American invasion, and the rebels are not thought to have a coherent ideology aside from restoring the military as Panama's dominant institution. Deane Hinton, the United States Ambassador to Panama, has pledged Washington would deploy the 10,000 troops still stationed in Panama if they are needed to stop another coup attempt.
A ranking United States military officer said the rebels "are capable of assassinations and acts of terrorism. There is no doubt about that. They certainly have the weapons and the training to do this kind of thing."
The Panamanian police said the rebels were responsible for several armed robberies and the slaying of at least one Panama City policeman in recent weeks, suggesting that they are attempting hit-and-run attacks to confuse and demoralize the Government's reconstituted 10,000-man Public Force police.
While the rebels are thought to have too little popular support to engage in a prolonged offensive, officials fear they can cause enough damage to slow the private investment needed to rebuild the economy, which was shattered by two years of economic sanctions and the invasion.
They are particularly concerned that the renewed attacks could complicate efforts to build a professional police force, a central element of United States policy here.
Members of the Public Force, almost all of whom were once colleagues of the rebels, remain suspicious of President Guillermo Endara's Government because it has taken away many of their traditional perks, like free food and transportation. The Government has fired 100 members of the Public Force who were suspected of supporting the revolt.
 
'Divided Loyalties'
 The Public Force police have gone through months of American training and patrols with United States troops. Washington has provided patrol cars, radios and other police equipment. With help from the United States Justice Department, the Government has established a police academy that is designed to infuse the force with new blood as the old Noriega soldiers are phased out.
But a United States official said the police had still displayed "divided loyalties."
The official said the security problem is compounded because the rebels are better equipped than the Public Force. He said the rebels had used Uzi and M-60 machine guns, M-16 and AK-47 assault rifles, gas masks and bulletproof vests in their attacks and could easily buy RPG rocket launchers on the Panamanian black market.
Such weapons are in abundance from the Noriega era, when the regime created weapons caches in preparation for an invasion. Many of the caches remain undetected.
"There are no Panamanian forces who have the capability to stop these guys," the American official said.
United States officials believe there are at least two organizations of former Noriega troops, both with ties to members of the current security force.
The most threatening band is thought to consist of former captains and lieutenants operating around Panama City. This group is led by retired Capt. Jorge Bernal, a high-strung but charismatic officer who engineered the December helicopter rescue of Mr. Herrera and the taking of the Public Force headquarters.
Mr. Bernal's band of 50 to 100 men might have sparked a revolt by the Public Force if not for the United States troops. The rebels, realizing they could not defeat the Americans, escaped by crashing through a barricade of pickup trucks. A handful of them later appeared at foreign embassies to seek asylum; the rest remain at large.
In an open letter that was photocopied and passed around the Panama City last September, Mr. Bernal declared himself to be a follower of the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, the left-leaning populist dictator.
"Bernal is supposed to be a very dangerous individual," commented Vice President Guillermo Ford. He said Mr. Bernal's group consisted of "the best trained men of the old regime." "Security is one of the biggest problems we have," Mr. Ford added.
The other rebel band, consisting of former soldiers, pro-Noriega militia and criminals, operates in the highlands of Chiriqui province in western Panama.
Officials say they are not sure whether a group calling itself M-20 is a seperate organization or whether the name is used by the two bands.
The M-20 has claimed responsibility for a series of minor attacks in the last 11 months, including a grenade attack on the United States Embassy on Jan. 15. One grenade exploded, causing minor damage but no casualties.
 
'Keeping the Flame Alive'
 Ignacio Occhi, a pro-Noriega newspaper editor, said the rebels were no longer connected to the imprisoned dictator who is awaiting trial in Miami. He said "they haven't gotten popular support yet because people haven't reached their limit of tolerance" with the Endara Government. "But the men are keeping the flame alive."
Mr. Occhi said the man who represents the greatest threat to the Government is retired Capt. Eliecer Asuncion Gaitan, who was General Noriega's top security aide. Mr. Gaitan, who is considered highly violent, took refuge with General Noriega in the Vatican Embassy during the invasion.
Mr. Gaitan escaped from the Nunciatora in September, some foreign diplomats suggest with the assistance of Mr. Bernal, and has reportedly been seen in Colombia and Argentina. Mr. Occhi said Mr. Gaitan "will make his move when he is sure he can win."

HEADLINE: More Banks Turn to Wall St. to Sell C.D.'s.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
American banks are turning to Wall Street brokerages with increased frequency to help them attract new depositors by selling the banks' Federally insured certificates of deposit.
At a time of weak earnings and growing problems with bad loans, the bankers have been having difficulty raising money from large institutions, and are now trying to increase deposits from individuals, reaching them through brokerage firms with large networks of branch offices. 
 And the banks are taking such action with the knowledge and blessing of the very bank regulators who harshly criticized some savings and loan institutions in the 1980's for doing much the same thing.
The current situation, though, has this difference: The savings and loans sold the certificates of deposit through brokerage firms at a time when they were nearly insolvent, as a way of continuing rapid growth and unsound lending; the banks are using the technique not to finance rapid growth, but to augment their sources of money.
"Selling C.D.'s through the brokers provides us with nationwide distribution and a stable source of funding," said Kenneth Krolczyk, vice president at First National Bank of Chicago. "Most of the buyers are individuals, and the cost tends to be low."
A New York banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted that large institutions that buy multimillion-dollar C.D.'s "are not there in the volume we have seen in the past, and brokered C.D.'s have helped fill that gap." In 1990, C.D.s issued in amounts of more than $100,000 by large banks fell by $17.6 billion, to $211.8 billion, according to Federal Reserve data.
The C.D.'s sold through brokers are also a low-cost replacement for commercial paper and the medium-term note, which have become more difficult and costly to sell. For example, many of the nation's largest banking companies must pay investors more than 10 percent to sell them notes due in two years, but they can issue Federally insured C.D.'s through brokers at rates of 7.5 percent or less.
For the bankers, the sales of insured certificates of deposit through brokerage firms are a way of collecting more money from consumers without increasing the rates offered to all local depositors. For banks in areas where competition keeps interest rates high, like New York City, selling C.D.'s through brokers allows them to collect money in other parts of the country, like Detroit, where interest rates are lower.
According to securities dealers, 9 of the nation's 10 largest banks -- all but J. P. Morgan & Company -- as well as dozens of smaller institutions have been using brokerage firms to sell insured certificates of deposit.
 
Popular With Investors
 Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch & Company and Shearson Lehman Brothers are finding that the insured bank C.D.'s are popular with customers worried about the lack of insurance on other kinds of investments, like money market mutual funds. Merrill Lynch said bank C.D.'s of less than $100,000 sold through all brokers rose $7 billion, to $39 billion, or by about 22 percent in the year ended June 30, 1990. More recent data are not available, but Merrill Lynch officials estimated that activity has continued to grow rapidly.
"The Federal deposit insurance coverage on the C.D.'s is a very attractive feature to our customers," said Richard M. Fuscone, chairman of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc. But he added that Merrill Lynch did not handle C.D.'s of the weakest banks, noting that "we cooperate fully with the regulators to be sure that we are not undermining the safety of the banking system."
Mr. Fuscone noted that half the banks that ask Merrill Lynch to sell their C.D.'s are turned down. Merrill Lynch routinely holds millions of dollars of bank C.D.'s in its inventory -- far above the $100,000 insurance limit. So it is keenly interested in avoiding banks that are likely to fail or to encounter difficulties and unfavorable publicity that would reduce the value of their C.D.'s.
 
Sales by Weaker Banks
 Even if Merrill Lynch decides not to deal with a weak bank, other firms may do so. In the last year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's regional offices have given temporary approval to 101 undercapitalized banks to sell C.D.'s through brokers. Of those banks, 65 have obtained approval in Washington to continue beyond the 90-day temporary limit. Banks that meet regulatory standards for capital do not need prior approval to sell C.D.'s through brokers.
"We will squeeze banks which are near failure and want to rely on brokered C.D.'s," said Jesse G. Snyder, an assistant director at the F.D.I.C. But "by and large we recognize the benefits of the practice" for banks that use brokered C.D.'s as a lower-cost, more stable source of money.
The importance of brokered C.D.'s is illustrated by two large regional banking companies whose recent troubles have made it more difficult for them to rely on large investors.
The Midlantic Corporation in Edison N.J., a banking company which owns the second-largest bank in New Jersey, began selling one-year and two-year C.D.'s through brokers in the second quarter of 1990. By Sept. 30 of last year, a report to the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that it had $870 million in brokered C.D.'s outstanding, or more than 10 percent of its outstanding certificates of deposit issued in amounts of less than $100,000. For the banking industry as a whole, less than 1.4 percent of deposits are brokered C.D.'s.
 
Losing Other Sources of Funds
 While brokered C.D.'s and other kinds of consumer deposits were increasing, Midlantic was losing other sources of money. From the end of 1989 to Sept. 30, 1990, C.D.'s of more than $100,000 fell by $606.3 million, or about 22 percent, to $2.13 billion. And other short-term borrowings at the New Jersey banking company fell by 32 percent.
At MNC Financial Inc., a Baltimore banking company that owns Maryland National Bank and American Security Bank in Washington, brokered deposits totaled $2.7 billion as of Sept. 30, or 32 percent of its $8.43 billion portfolio of C.D.'s of less than $100,000. Because of its weakened financial condition and a rapid increase in problems with bad loans, the company was required to obtain regulators' approval to continue selling C.D.'s through brokers.
A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that 19 of the 43 banks with assets of more than $10 billion at the end of 1989 used brokerages to sell C.D.'s in amounts of less than $100,000. At those large banks, the brokered C.D.'s accounted for about 2.9 percent of domestic deposits. But among all banks, there were 80 that used brokerage firms for at least 10 percent of deposits and 31 that raised more than 20 percent of deposits from brokered C.D.'s.
While demand for broker-placed C.D.'s is growing among banks, there is a cloud on the horizon. One suggestion for changing the Federal deposit insurance program would do away with the practice of allowing up to $100,000 of Federal deposit insurance to pass through to individual beneficiaries of pension funds that have bought "bank investment contracts." One concern is that the change would also apply to the brokered C.D.'s.

HEADLINE: Eastern's Rivals Stand to Benefit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The shutting of Eastern Airlines on Friday night is likely to benefit Delta Air Lines and Pan American World Airways in particular, because they have competed directly with Eastern's largest business, carrying passengers from the Northeast to Atlanta and Florida.
Other airlines will gain fewer passengers but will have the opportunity to expand operations in Florida, Georgia and New York by buying Eastern's gates and landing rights. 
 But for the public, the demise of Eastern is likely to make it more expensive to take winter vacations in Florida. The airline had been a leader in discounting fares, as it tried to overcome public concerns about its safety and labor strife.
Unless all of Eastern's planes are bought by other carriers and put in service, which seems unlikely because the industry is furloughing thousands of workers as traffic stagnates, then the overall supply of airline seats will fall and prices will tend to rise.
 
Rivals May Move Quickly
 "The fares themselves won't move up that much, but there will be adjustments to capacity" as airlines set aside fewer seats for discount fares, said Daniel M. Kasper, the director of the transportation practice at Harbridge House, a Boston consulting firm.
William D. Berry, a Delta spokesman, said competition from other airlines would insure that fares to all of Eastern's destinations would closely reflect the cost of serving them.
Rival carriers are free to move quickly to offer new or expanded service on Eastern's domestic routes because of the Federal Government's deregulation of the industry in 1978, said Richard P. Magurno, a former attorney for Eastern who now specializes in airline litigation as a partner at Lord, Day & Lord, Barrett Smith in New York. Eastern sold its Latin American routes to American Airlines last summer and is now almost entirely a domestic carrer.
USAir, American, Continental and Trans World Airlines competed less directly with Eastern in serving Florida. United and Northwest Airlines, which are strongest in the Midwest, shared few routes with Eastern.
Eastern's experience in bankruptcy, for which it filed in March 1989, is likely to make the recently begun bankruptcy proceedings of Pan Am and Continental more difficult.
Both carriers want their creditors to allow them to continue flying. They also want travelers to continue buying tickets.
When Eastern filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, its assets exceeded its liabilities to unsecured creditors, like aircraft and engine makers. The creditors gave Eastern permission to continue operating. But the carrier lost so much money that the unsecured creditors are likely to receive little money, if any.
 
Testing Creditors' Patience
 Mr. Kasper said the Eastern experience could mean that Pan Am and Continental creditors would be less patient. And both airlines' customers may be alarmed by the spectacle of Eastern's ticket holders crowding airports and beseeching other carriers for seats after Eastern suspended service.
"Ticket holders and the potential ticket holders are going to remember the pictures on the television and the articles in the newspaper," he said.
Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman, said the carrier had obtained a $100 million financial guarantee of its tickets from United Airlines and was preparing a reorganization plan for its creditors.
Continental has good relations with its creditors and does not have the labor problems that disrupted Eastern, said Arthur Kent, a spokesman for the carrier.
Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the trustee appointed by the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan nine months ago to try to guide Eastern out of bankruptcy, said on Saturday that he would seek investors to return the carrier to the skies. He said he would not begin liquidating the carrier immediately and would explore the possibility of leasing planes to the military for use in ferrying troops to the Persian Gulf.
But Karen M. Ceremsak, an Eastern spokeswoman, acknowledged yesterday that "the revival of the airline is at best a long shot." Management does not want to raise any false hopes among the company's 18,000 full-time employees that a resumption of service is likely, she said.
 
Leases Become Valuable
 Eastern has been looking for investors for many months without success, and Ms. Ceremsak said that after further study over the weekend, Eastern had decided it would not be able to lease planes to the military because it could not afford the crews to fly them.
If Eastern is liquidated, as seems very likely, rival carriers would bid for Eastern's leases of airport gates, as well as its landing rights at LaGuardia Airport in New York, where congestion aloft has made these rights valuable.
Delta Air Lines Inc., which is based in Atlanta, says it wants to buy some Eastern gates at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta. The plan is expected to arouse the interest of the Justice Department's antitrust division, because Delta already has a large hub there, said Mr. Magurno, the airline litigation specialist.
Delta fills all of one terminal at Hartsfield, shares another with Eastern and still another with other carriers, Mr. Berry said. Delta would like to take over the Eastern gates in the terminal it shares with the carrier, so it could consolidate its operations in two terminals, he said.
Mr. Berry said that Eastern had gates in still another terminal that did not interest Delta, and that even with Eastern's suspension of service, more than 80 percent of the passengers flying out of the airport could choose among two or more airlines.
"We definitely will make Justice familiar with anything we might announce with Eastern," he said.
 
Low Fares Draw Complaints
 United Airlines has been widely mentioned as another potential buyer of Eastern assets. Anthony T. Molinaro, an airline spokesman, declined to comment yesterday on whether the carrier was interested. Northwest and T.W.A. are also viewed as possible bidders.
Some experts contended in the weeks leading up to Eastern's collapse that its fares were unsustainably low, and that the carrier's continued operation for nearly two years under Chapter 11 protection had become unhealthy for the industry.
The bankruptcy code "allows a carrier to operate in the marketplace which, under normal economic circumstances, wouldn't be there," said Russell Thayer, a former president of Braniff Airways who now is a vice president of Airline Economics, a Washington consulting firm. "A number of carriers have complained about Eastern being able to charge so little money."
 
Last Remaining Strength
 Eastern's last remaining strength, after the sale of its Latin American routes last summer to American Airlines, lay in flights between the Northeast and Florida. Low rates on these routes this winter have been one result of Eastern's presence.
Discounted tickets from the Northeast to Florida used to sell for half the price of discounted transcontinental tickets, but have sold for a third of the price in recent weeks. At least part of this change, though, reflects the increasing cost of operating longer flights, as jet-fuel prices have risen during the Persian Gulf crisis.
Delta in particular responded to Eastern's low prices by cutting its fares. Yesterday, Delta continued to advertise $158 round-trip tickets to Florida from New York.
 
T.W.A. Plans Layoffs
 KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan 20 (AP) -- Trans World Arilines has announced plans to begin laying off more than 1,400 flight attendants Monday, citing "the situation in the Middle East," the airline's flight attendants' union said yesterday.
 A union official, Mary Ellen Miller, said the union was "vehemently protesting" and was exploring its legal options on grounds that T.W.A. was stopping pay without proper notice.
 A recorded telephone message to members of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants said the T.W.A. layoff schedule called for 800 furloughs in New York, 394 in Los Angeles and 229 in St. Louis.
 American Airlines had said on Friday that layoff notices were issued to an unspecified number of ground-service employees because of reduced flight schedules. A company spokesman, John Hotard, would neither confirm nor deny a report, published on Friday in The Dallas Times Herald, that 240 employees would be laid off. American said it was cutting its flights because unionized pilots were clling in sick during an extended contract dispute.

HEADLINE: Subway Plan On Homeless Is Abandoned

 BODY:
The Transit Authority's ambitious plans for mass sweeps to clear the subway system of homeless people have largely been abandoned, undermined by winter weather and the reluctance of transit officers, officials say.
While the rules adopted last fall against loitering and panhandling are not being dropped, their enforcement has returned to an ad hoc, rather than concerted, effort by the transit police. 
 The subway agency has instead turned to new approaches, primarily the stepping up of outreach efforts to lure the homeless out of tunnels and stations and into hospitals or shelters, said Debra Perry, associate director of government relations for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency.
"We realized that the plan was too broad," Ms. Perry said. "It couldn't be enforced."
 
A New Code of Conduct
 Last October, the M.T.A. announced "Operation Enforcement," a sweeping plan to counteract declining ridership by driving vagrants and beggars out of the subway system. The plan called for strict enforcement of a new code of conduct, which prohibited panhandling, littering and lying down on subway seats and benches.
The plan was criticized by advocates for the homeless, and met with skepticism among the rank and file of the transit police, although it had the strong backing of William J. Bratton, the Transit Police Chief.
The plan was quietly dropped in recent weeks in the face of the criticism, the ineffectiveness of initial efforts and the waves of cold weather that drew homeless people into the system far faster than the police could remove them, said a spokesman for the transit police, Albert W. O'Leary.
Chief Bratton is not abandoning any of the new rules, but is leaving their enforcement to the discretion of individual officers, the transit police said.
And many transit officers have said that there was little they could do to stop the thousands of homeless people from loitering in stations. "We have always said we're not social workers, we're police," Mr. O'Leary said. "Unfortunately, we really have no ability to control the homeless."
"It always feels like we're just moving them around," said a transit officer at the 175th Street IND station who refused to be identified. "If the homeless aren't breaking the rules, if they're just riding the trains and minding their own business, we leave them alone."
So a special operations unit, the Homeless Outreach Program, which began as a volunteer group nine years ago, now conducts most of the Transit Authority's outreach efforts for the homeless. It recently was increased to 20 officers, from six two years ago.
In November, the unit began operating two buses to transport homeless people from subway stations to city shelters. When the temperature drops below 32 degrees, four vans operate from midnight to 8 A.M. About 437 homeless people have been taken to city shelters since November, said Lieut. John Romero, executive officer of the outreach program.
 
Outreach Services at Stations
 The M.T.A. has also recently approved $450,000 for an outreach, referral and data-collection program in Grand Central and Penn Stations, Ms. Perry said. And it is contracting with community-based organizations to provide outreach services at 29 subway stations on the A and E lines. Financing for that program is $50,000.
But the two railroad stations remain closed to the homeless overnight.
Advocates for the homeless, while applauding the Transit Authority's decision to abandon the plan for large-scale rousts, say the new efforts are not enough.
"The Transit Authority is doing as little as possible," said Joseph G. Rappaport, coordinator of the Straphangers Campaign, a nonprofit group. "The patience of people who ride the subways is wearing thin.
 
'Critical Economic Times'
 Advocates for the homeless have been lobbying the transit agency for years to finance more social-service programs, and they complain that money for them is a low priority.
"It's inexcusable at this late date that the M.T.A. is holding back on funding for the homeless," said Peter P. Smith, president of the Partnership for the Homeless.
But the M.T.A. says there are limits to what it can do, particularly at a time when service reductions are being considered to close a $272 million deficit. "We're all operating under critical economic times," said Ms. Perry.
Homeless people can be found in hundreds of spots within the 700 miles of tunnel and 468 stations that make up the subway system. Four stations in which the problems are most acute are the Second Avenue and Broadway-Lafayette stations on the IND, and the 103d Street and 168th Street stations on the West Side IRT. The transit police said the two downtown stations have become havens for the homeless because of their proximity to the Bowery.
A human howl echoed from the tunnel north of the Second Avenue F train station one night last week, just as a special unit of the transit police had begun a routine search to evict the homeless.
On the concrete platform, a homeless man lay shaking from convulsions and foaming at the mouth. An open crack vial was nearby.
Within 10 minutes, Emergency Medical Service paramedics had arrived with a stretcher, carefully making their way across the 600-volt third rail. They carried the man about a quarter of a mile along the tracks to the subway platform and into a waiting ambulance.
"We were lucky we went in tonight," said Lieutenant Romero. "For every one that we save, there are hundreds more in there."
 
'I Just Read My Newsaper'
 The unidentified homeless man was released from a hospital hours later.
The transit police said the homeless continue to find ways to skirt the illegality of panhandling and loitering in the subways.
"I just read my newspaper and no one bothers me," said a homeless man who calls himself Street, as he begged for money on a northbound A train. "It's not that the transit police are overlooking their duty, it's just that they have a heart."
Conrad Cook is another homeless man who prefers the subways to city shelters and has resisted the Transit Authority's efforts to change his mind. The 32-year-old native of Jamaica was roused during a recent sweep from a mattress where he was sleeping next to the tracks in the Second Avenue tunnel.
"This tunnel is where I like to be," said Mr. Cook, who has been taken to two city shelters by the transit police but has returned to the subway. "It's quiet and no one's going to rob me."

HEADLINE: More Mexicans Come to U.S. to Stay

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
In a marked shift in immigration trends, increasing numbers of Mexicans are coming to the United States to stay rather than to work for a few months as seasonal farm laborers, new studies show.
Since many of the illegal aliens are bringing their families to join them, the shift is expected to produce a greater demand for social services like schooling and health care. In addition, experts say, the trend is likely to reinforce the increasing dependence on low-cost immigrant labor by some urban enterprises and to add to social frictions that are already being felt in some communities. 
 Those who are staying include people like Leonardo Vilchis, a 28-year-old church social worker who emigrated from Mexico City. "The longer you stay here," he said, "the easier it becomes for you to blend in with the whole society and the more comfortable you become."
He said his parents, both architects in Mexico, had found work in San Diego 10 years ago washing dishes and now own a small restaurant.
"We were thinking we would make some money and then go back," he said. "Afterwards, with time, we adapted. Everyone started enrolling in school and getting more stable jobs, and we decided to stay."
 
Drop in Seasonal Changes
 In one sign of the shift from seasonal labor, recent figures on apprehensions of illegal aliens by the United States Border Patrol show a reduction in seasonal fluctuations. Until recently, monthly figures showed a consistent dip by as much as 50 percent or more in winter, when agricultural workers have typically returned to Mexico.
But last year, Border Patrol officials said, there was little seasonal variation. In both November and December, the Border Patrol said, it apprehended about 33,000 illegal aliens, an increase of more than 20 percent over the previous year.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service figures also show an increase in the number of women and children stopped as they tried to enter the United States.
"We have seen a changing trend for the past five or six years," said Ted Swofford, a supervisory agent with the Border Patrol, "but it has just become more pronounced in the last year."
The number of apprehensions represents only a fraction of those who entered the United States, but precise numbers of illegal aliens working either in seasonal or year-round jobs are not available.
 
More Work in Cities
 More and more migrants seem to be coming from Mexican cities and finding work not in the fields and orchards of America but in cities, where they are increasingly filling the need for low-paid workers.
"People start getting to understand the system, getting to know the language," Mr. Vilchis said. "They develop networks of friends who know where to go to school, how to find jobs. If there's papers you need, they know where to find the papers. As we develop confidence in the country, we see the possibility for bringing the family."
At the same time, returning home becomes a less attractive option. "There's no way you can leave your stable job when everything is so unstable in Mexico," Mr. Vilchis said.
Although some experts dispute the figures, Wayne A. Cornelius, the director of the Center for United States-Mexico Studies at the University of California in San Diego, said: "The I.N.S. statistics are just another indicator of the general process. Mexican migration to the United States has become much less tied to seasonal agriculture in this country. That's a permanent shift, and nothing's going to reverse it."
 
Signs of a New Approach
 He quoted recent studies by immigration experts that estimated that no more than 10 percent to 15 percent of Mexicans in California, Texas and Arizona now work in agriculture.
Mr. Cornelius said the greater numbers of women and children crossing the border also appear to be signs of a more long-term approach to migration, reflecting the resettlement of entire families in the United States.
In 1986 the Border Patrol in California apprehended and expelled an average of three to five unaccompanied children, ages 5 to 17, each day, according to figures compiled by Jorge Bustamante, the director of the Center for Border Studies in Tijuana, Mexico. In the first quarter of last year, the daily average had risen to 15.
Poverty has driven more Mexican women and children into the work force, where they are subject to the same pressures as men to migrate in search of employment, Mr. Cornelius said.
In the San Diego area, women now go door to door seeking housecleaning work, as men seeking work as gardeners have done for many years. Here and in other border cities, domestic work has become almost institutionalized as an occupation performed almost exclusively by female illegal aliens.
Mr. Cornelius, who is publishing a study on the shift by illegal aliens toward permanent residence in the United States, said the increasing number of poor immigrant families settling in American cities would place more demands on such social services as schooling and public health.
 
Growing Reliance on Migrants
 He said that urban employers, much like American farmers who have long been dependent on Mexican labor, may increasingly find themselves relying on recent immigrants to work in enterprises like car washes, restaurants, hotels, laundries, hospitals and factories.
He also forecast a rise in hostility toward the illegal aliens where they are highly visible, as American society struggles to accommodate itself to their presence. Such hostility is already evident in some communities in San Diego County, where immigrants camp in shantytowns and stand on street corners seeking work for the day.
Mr. Cornelius said the increasing demand in the United States for cheap immigrant labor was the primary reason for the shift from seasonal migration.
The continuing economic crisis in Mexico that has driven increasing numbers of rural people to Mexico City is another factor, he said. The Mexican capital is becoming something of a way station as migrants who cannot find work there continue on to the United States.
In addition, he said, the amnesty provisions of the 1986 immigration law allowed many illegal aliens to acquire stable, year-round jobs. Many are now sending for their families and becoming anchored in the United States.
Finally, he said, a "chain of migrants" has become established in which those already in the United States help the new arrivals find jobs and housing.
"The shift from a Mexican immigrant population dominated by transient, 'lone male' agricultural workers to a much more socially heterogeneous, year-round, urban-dwelling immigrant community is unlikely to be reversed," Mr. Cornelius wrote in his study.
"High emigration communities in central Mexico are being transformed increasingly into rest and recreation centers for families whose principal base is now in the United States."

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts Jar University of California

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The University of California, regarded by many as the nation's leading state university system, faces its deepest crisis since Gov. Ronald Reagan fired its president and slashed its budget nearly a quarter of a century ago.
The cause this time is not a Governor's angry determination to punish the campuses for student unrest, but California's deepening budget crisis. Still, the results are expected to be much the same: cuts in enrollment, faculty and staff, postponement in building new campuses to serve this fast-growing state and loss of its envied academic prowess. 
 Meeting with the Board of Regents at the Riverside campus on Friday, President David P. Gardner said "unprecedented steps" would be needed to maintain the quality of the 122-year-old system.
He said the budget drawn by the state's new Governor, Pete Wilson, fell "so far short of funding U.C.'s essential needs that our programs of teaching, research and public service, accessibility to eligible students and our historic policy of charging only modest student fees cannot be sustained."
 
Other Troubled Campuses
 Mr. Wilson's 1991-92 budget, released Jan. 10, raises tuition and fees by 20 percent and does not provide money for salary increases for the university's faculty and staff. William B. Baker, vice president for budget and university relations, said the system's operating budget faces an absolute cut of $2.2 million, to $2.191 billion, in the next fiscal year; that is $295.5 million less than the regents had requested.
The troubles here find an echo on campuses across the country as public universities cope with shrinking budgets by putting off repairs, reducing administrative staffs and leaving teaching positions vacant. In states like Massachusetts, where recession has hit hardest, officials are laying off faculty members and eliminating programs.
"Lights are dimmer, library hours are shorter and the library often doesn't have the books that students ask for," said Terry Zoulas, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Board of Regents.
And everywhere, decisions about what to jettison have created dissension among the administrative staff, faculty and students. "The easy cuts have all been made," said Chancellor D. Bruce Johnstone of the 64-campus State University of New York, who must trim $40 million from the budget this year. "There are no pockets of fat left."
 
California's Golden Age
 No state has invested more in the idea of public higher education than California. The University of California system, with its flagship campus at Berkeley, has 7,400 faculty members and 166,500 students on nine campuses. The separate California State University system has 368,000 students and 21,000 faculty members on its 20 campuses.
The University of California system reached what might be called its golden age under President Clark Kerr from 1958 to 1967. He oversaw the opening of three campuses and the decentralization of the system. Berkeley, in many eyes, surpassed Harvard as the nation's leading research university.
But when the campuses, particularly Berkeley, were swept with the Free Speech Movement, student sit-ins and antiwar demonstrations, Mr. Reagan made it a campaign pledge to clamp down on demonstrators. A few days after taking office in January 1967, he imposed sharp cuts on the system's budget and organized a majority of the regents to oust Mr. Kerr.
Under Mr. Reagan and his successor, Edmund G. Brown Jr., a Democrat, the system lost much of its academic competitiveness.
 
Deukmejian's Support
 But the election of George Deukmejian in 1982 brought a new flowering. Though a fiscally conservative Republican who fought to contain increases in spending for most other programs, Mr. Deukmejian protected the university system. Its budget grew by 15 percent a year in the economic boom of his first term, and by 3.5 percent a year in the last few years.
Now, higher education can no longer be shielded from budget cuts, said a spokesman for Governor Wilson, Bill Livingstone. Many other state programs are legally protected, he said, adding, "The U.C. system is a bargain at the prices it charges."
Despite the cuts, Mr. Kerr, now 79 years old and president emeritus of the university, said he saw no similarity to the days when he was fired.
"It's really a totally different situation from when Reagan came in," he said by telephone from his office on the Berkeley campus. "Reagan did not know anything about the university. Governor Wilson is very well informed. But he faces a much tougher budget situation than Reagan. His budget is very tough on the university, but my impression is the university has been teated equally."
 
Outgrowing the Campuses
 What makes the cuts particularly difficult is the timing. The state's population increased by about 20 percent in the last decade, according to the 1990 census, and enrollment in the University of California system set a record last fall. Officials had planned to add up to three more campuses over the next quarter-century.
All that has been thrown into doubt now. "We've got a major problem," Mr. Baker said. "It can only be dealt with by increasing fees, cutting back enrollment and laying people off." He said the system would have to cut 4,000 jobs, through early retirement, attrition and layoffs.
President Gardner said Friday that a delay in building the 10th campus, planned for the fast-growing Central Valley, would probably be announced at the regents' February meeting. A delay could result in new restrictions on enrollment, he said. The last new campus was opened in 1965 in Santa Cruz, and nearly all campuses have reached their capacity.
Fears are growing that California's commitment to providing a high-quality higher education to all academically qualified residents may be ebbing. The university's master plan requires the system to admit the top 12.5 percent of high school seniors.
The university charges no tuition to California residents, only "registration" and "educational" fees; non-residents pay tuition. The 20 percent increase means that fees paid by residents would rise to $1,949 next year from $1,624 this year, and tuition and fees for out-of-state students to $7,699 from $6,416. Similar cuts and fee increases would also be imposed on the California State University System.
The increase in fees has stirred deep unease among professors and students. "It's wrong-headed," said Francis Carney, a political scientist at Riverside. "The greatness of the university is that it is the people's university."
Aaron Walden, a graduate student in English who is a leader of the Graduate Student Association on Riverside, said, "The crucial problem with such an increase has to do with maintaining access to university education in California, particularly for lower- and middle-income groups."
The most sobering fact facing the university is that the Governor's budget cuts were based on the optimistic assumption that the economy would remain flat for the first half of this year and rebound by mid-year. Should that assumption prove wrong, all state agencies and schools could face still deeper cuts.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: ISRAEL;
Israeli Tension Eases a Bit, as New U.S. Help Arrives

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 20

 BODY:
After a welcome quiet night, the Israeli Government began trying today to move the nation out of its state of siege, while warning that more Iraqi missile attacks probably still lie ahead.
The Government also worked at another difficult task. It tried to reconcile the conflicting goals of deferring any retaliation against Iraq in deference to American concerns while also projecting the nation's strong, brash image to its enemies abroad. 
 Behind all this, and apparently helping at both tasks, Israel found itself increasingly falling under the political and military protection of the United States.
The Government and news reports made a great show out of the largescale United States emergency airlift overnight that delivered two Patriot missile batteries complete with American military crews, for defense against Iraqi missiles.
Forty C-5A Galaxy transport planes landed at Ben-Gurion International Airport, complete with American crews, and Israeli television showed extensive footage of American soldiers, in helmets and uniforms, unloading the equipment.
"The Patriot missile systems have arrived, they have been deployed and they are operational," Col. Raanan Gissen declared at a news briefing. Several officials said the missiles would be helpful against a future missile attack, though no one here thinks they will solve the problem.
President Bush called Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir twice, on Friday and Saturday; during most of last year the two men did not speak to each other at all. And tonight Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger arrived in Jerusalem for consultations with Mr. Shamir and other officials.
"The arrival of the Patriots and the special American delegation coming to coordinate with us, all these things demonstrate a very big improvement in relations with the United States," said Avi Pazner, a senior aide to Mr. Shamir.
The state of emergency that has been in place since Thursday was lifted this morning for the southern third of the country, which has not been a target for any of the 12 Iraqi Scud missiles that fell here on Friday and Saturday mornings.
 
Still Advised to Stay Home
 And even in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the rest of the country, where people were still advised to stay at home, near their gas masks and safe rooms, many people at least stuck their heads out of doors for the first time in five days.
As he stepped out of a Cabinet meeting this morning, the first since the nation came under attack, Health Minister Ehud Olmert said: "We're trying to quickly resume a normal life style again. The Government has decided that this is the purpose."
But at the same time, all the ministers arrived for the Cabinet meeting with gas masks in hand, and Mr. Olmert added: "The threat of missiles fired at Israel has not been eliminated. It's still liable to happen." Other officials said they would not be surprised if another attack came tonight.
Schools remain closed nationwide today, and most workers and businessmen stayed home too.
While President Saddam Hussein's attacks have been no threat to the security of the state, they have shaken its people to the core.
Even with no alerts Saturday night, people everywhere said they lay awake, waiting for the sirens to go off again. One senior Government official said, "Every time someone started his car, I was sure it was another alarm."
A Jerusalem mother said she'd been afraid to take a shower until today, worried that the sirens would sound. And everywhere today, Israelis continued to carry their gas masks with them, even for walks to the corner grocery.
 
'Have to Live Normal Lives"
 "We have to live normal lives so that our enemies won't think that by attacking us they are defeating us," Mr. Shamir insisted in an interview, broadcast nationwide tonight. The atmosphere of fear is destroying the economy, he added, and then he pointed to the British performance during the Nazi bombing in World War II as an example "where people lived with situations like this."
The Israeli Government has decided not to strike back at Iraq, at least for now, despite a longstanding policy of swift, lethal retaliation for any attack. Privately, officials said the debate had turned on the question: What does Saddam Hussein want us to do?
"And the answer seemed to be: He wants us to retaliate and break up the coalition," a senior official said, referring to the American-led forces facing Iraq.
As Yossi Ben Aharon, the Prime Minister's chief of staff, explained it: "Restraint is not always negative. It all depends on your capacity, your intentions and your potential for achieving your goals in a confrontation. At this time, the United States and its coalition partners are pouring hundreds, if not thousands, of tons of bombs and missiles on Iraq."
At the same time, the Defense Ministry issued a statement declaring: "The position of the Israeli Government has not changed. Israel reserves its right to decide how and when to respond to the Iraqi attacks."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: IRAQ;
IRAQI SAYS ALLIES FACE HARDER WAR

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 20

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq sought to rally Arab supporters and embattled Iraqis today, saying his forces had used only a fraction of their weaponry to fight and win what he again called "the mother of all battles."
News reports from Baghdad depicted Iraqis scavenging for food, lining up for gasoline and drawing water from the Tigris river. But travelers from the besieged Iraqi capital reported no sign of public readiness to challenge the Iraqi leader's stewardship of the war, despite disillusion and disquiet. 
 In a seven-minute address on the Baghdad Radio -- his second since the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war -- the Iraqi leader forecast a long battle and renewed calls for a holy war around the world against forces "of evil, treason and corruption everywhere."
 
Barrages of Missiles
 Not long after the address, the Iraqis launched repeated barrages of Scud missiles toward Saudi Arabia.
And a Cable News Network reporter in Baghdad, Peter Arnett, said the Iraqi television carried a live broadcast showing seven men indentified as captured allied pilots. Mr. Arnett said that the men -- three Americans, two Britons, an Italian and a Kuwaiti -- were interviewed and that some of them criticized the allied air strikes on Iraq. It was not known whether the statements were coerced.
Mr. Hussein's military speech, his missile strikes at Saudi Arabia and the broadcast of the prisoners' interrogation contributed to his effort to keep morale from flagging in the face of the intense and ceaseless allied bombardment.
 
Holding Aircraft in Reserve
 And the Iraqi leader's military assessment came at around the same time that Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" and said President Hussein may be seeking to husband his air power for use later in the war.
The Iraqi leader, seeking support both within his own country and among Palestinians and other Arabs who call him their champion, said Iraq's "ground forces have not entered the battle so far, and only a small part of our air force has been used." Western assessments, too, say that only a small proportion of Iraq's estimated 700 combat aircraft have been destroyed, and that the rest are being hidden in bunkers.
"The army's air force has not been used, nor has the navy," the Iraqi leader said.
 
'The Scale of Death'
 "When the war is fought in a comprehensive manner, using all resources and weapons, the scale of death and the number of dead will, God willing, rise among the ranks of atheism, injustice, and tyranny," he added.
"When they begin to die and when the message of the Iraqi soldiers reaches the farthest corner of the world, the unjust will die and the 'God is Great' banner will flutter with great victory in the mother of all battles," he declared. "God is Great," is Islam's central incantation and rallying cry. President Hussein has ordered it inscribed on the Iraq national flag.
His comments seemed intended specifically to respond to questioning among Iraqis about the absence of strong defenses against waves of allied bombing and missile attacks.
The question of the morale of those Iraqis remaining in the city, has become more pressing since the allied onslaught seems partly intended to convince the country's 17 million people that their leader is powerless to defend them.
 
Party Headquarters a Target
 According to Western news reports, one target of the United States and other Western attacks has been the headquarters of the Baath Party, the ubiquitous organ of state power that President Hussein and his associates have molded from a clandestine, secretive body to a powerful and feared sinew of control.
Baghdad Radio reported today that an allied missile had struck the town of Tikrit, President Hussein's birthplace north of Baghdad, suggesting that part of the allied intention was a psychological campaign to crack the military's will to fight on. The Radio listed a total of 10 allied air and missile attacks in places ranging from Baghdad to the far north of the country.
Such efforts have drawn sharp responses from Iraqi officials. "We are confident of victory," Information Minister Latif Nasif al-Jassem told a British television interviewer before most Western journalists were ordered out of Iraq yesterday. "We can say with all confidence and all faith and all belief in God and in our great leader Saddam Hussein that the battle was settled in our favor with the help of God."
 
Tomahawk Shot Down
 The only non-Iraqi correspondent of a major new network known to be still sending reports from Baghdad, Mr. Arnett of CNN, stayed on despite yesterday's order and is working under Iraqi censorship. In a voice report today, he gave a vivid account of the Iraqi downing of a Tomahawk cruise missile -- the first confirmed destruction of one of the weapons that has played a decisive role in the allied war effort.
Mr. Arnett said parts of the exploded missile landed in the grounds of the Rashid hotel, across the Tigris from central Baghdad, sending a blast through the hotel and blowing in windows.
The downing of the missile followed a Baghdad Radio commentary belittling the cruise missiles. The allies, the commentary said, had "found out that the cruise missiles, with which they have terrified the world, are more cowardly than all their cowards and their treacherous cowardly weapons."
The commentary praised as "clever hunters" Iraq's anti-aircraft gunners who, according to the Iraqi Radio, have down over 150 allied aircraft. The United States and other allied air forces say they have lost 15 planes.
Iraq, too, has focussed in recent days on assertions that Israel had become embroiled in the war -- despite allied assertions to the contrary -- by firing missiles at an Iraqi base and by deploying aircraft, disguised as allied warplanes, from Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
 
'The Zionist Enemy'
 "We have proof that the Zionist enemy has used its aircraft from the lands which American and its allies have used against our people, including Saudi territory," Baghdad Radio said.
The target of such assertions is not only the people of Iraq. As Baghdad has sought to drawn Israel into the hostilities through missile strikes on Tel Aviv, it has also sought to cement a constituency among Palestinians exhilarated by the first Arab missile attacks on an Israeli city.
More than one half of Jordan's population is of Palestinian descent, so passions here vacillated dramatically between initial anger and gloom at the start of the war to exuberance at the missile strikes on Tel Aviv.
Random conversations in stores and on the streets here today indicated that many Palestinians and some Jordanians believed that the Iraqi version far more than the Western version of events. "There was some disappointment that Iraq did not send missiles into Israel for a third night running," said Jalal Ayub, a 55-year-old store-keeper. "But we know that Iraq is just holding its forces in reserve. We know Israel is in the war."
 
Smoke and Fire Over City
 Sentiment within Baghdad is more difficult to gauge. A Reuter despatch today by Maamoun Youssef, an Iraqi correspondent, said a huge fire lit up large areas of the city overnight and heavy column of smoke hung over the capital at dawn.
The report said meat and other food had rotted in freezers because of power-outs and cats and dogs were feeding on the resultant piles of garbage. Bread and water were both scarce, the report said, but quoted an official as saying morale was high.
It said Baghdad residents near the Tigris that flows through the city had been seen scooping water in plastic containers, while Government offices, shops, bakeries and restaurants were closed.
The report said hundreds of motorists were lining up for gasoline at the few remaining filling stations able to operate without electric power, presumably from hand-pumps. Another despatch, however, suggested that some of the controls of the rigidly policed land were beginning to slip.
It noted that Iraqis -- long fearful of even the traffic police -- had taken to running red lights and driving the wrong way on one-way streets, offenses that once carried heavy punishment. A currency black market is flourishing openly, despite the long prison terms associated with economic crimes.

HEADLINE: After 303 Years, Sunday Is a Workday at Lloyd's

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
David Peachey, an aviation underwriter, did not seem to care much that he was helping to make history at the Lloyd's of London insurance market today, which was open for the first Sunday in its 303 years.
What he did care about were reports that Iraq might fire missiles at Turkey in retaliation for Turkey's allowing coalition warplanes to launch attacks from its air bases. The disclosure about the bases has caused insurance rates for commercial planes flying to Turkish regions near Iraq to double since late last week; for each landing, the carrier must pay about a quarter of a percent of the plane's value. In normal times, the rate for commercial planes is five-hundredths of a percent of the plane's value a year. 
 Nor was Christopher W. Rome, a marine underwriter at Lloyd's, preoccupied with the break from Lloyd's tradition. He seemed to be jolted by pictures of coalition minesweepers dealing with a mine in the Persian Gulf. "The greatest threat I see are floating mines," he said, adding, "It's absolutely inevitable that ships will be blown up by mines before long."
Mr. Rome had just agreed to provide $50 million in excess liability insurance for an American oil tanker en route to Ras Tanura, a Saudi Arabian port in the gulf about 160 miles south of Kuwait. His charge for seven days of coverage was $156,250. "That is three times what it would have been 10 days ago, but there was no fighting 10 days ago," he said.
 
Saturday Work, Too
 That policy covers liability for harm to the ship's crew and cargo, the pollution that might occur if the ship were hit and the cost of removing the wreck.
Rates for other coverage have been soaring, too. Hull rates -- or insurance for the ship itself -- have gone up to as much as 5 percent of the ship's value for vessels bound for ports like Ras Tanura. Mr. Rome was charging 3 percent on Jan. 15, shortly before the outbreak of war, which began in the early hours of Thursday.
Excluding the reporters who flocked to Lloyd's building on Lime Street to record a bit of history, there were about 150 people, including about 100 underwriters, working today. About the same number put in a busier day Saturday, the first Saturday Lloyd's has been open since 1965, after Hurricane Betsy struck the New Orleans area. There are as many as 4,000 people at Lloyd's on weekdays.
With the war zone widening, fears of terrorism rising and information about the coalition's progress in blunting Iraq's military capability still sketchy, many underwriters are quoting rates only 24 hours in advance -- explaining why they were working during the weekend.
"I'm surprised how many ships, particularly tankers, have continued to go into the gulf to Saudi oil ports," said Stephen Merrett, an underwriter and chairman of the Lloyd's marine underwriters association. He said there were "several hundred" ships in the gulf, including merchant ships carrying supplies for the coalition forces.
 
Saudi Port Traffic
 Not all of those ships are privately insured. In a war, some governments typically offer war-risk coverage for most or all of the value of their flag ships.
The United States insures at its own expense merchant ships of any flag that are have been contracted by the Defense Department to carry military cargo. The Government can also offer war-risk insurance at a rate below that available from the commercial market for merchant ships of any flag that are serving the economic or defensive interests of the United States. On Saturday, the Maritime Administration decided to offer such coverage, and so far has had requests from owners of more than half a dozen ships.
As an indicator of shipping activity in the gulf, Lloyd's offered some information on the number of merchant ships calling at two main Saudi ports: Ras Tanura and Jubail, which is about 130 miles from Kuwait. There were 42 ships bound for Jubail and 7 ships docked or about to dock, a slight drop from the respective figures of 43 and 12 on Jan. 15.
There were 38 vessels bound for Ras Tanura and 9 at the port, compared with 31 and 13 respectively on Jan. 15, Lloyd's said.
 
Queries on Offshore Platforms
 Several underwriters said there was a surge of interest in coverage against terrorist attacks. Mr. Rome said he had received a number of inquiries over the weekend from oil companies that had not previously had terrorism coverage for offshore platforms outside the gulf. He also had a similar query from a utility in California.
Despite terrorist threats to attack airports at Western cities and a warning that a terrorist attack might be imminent in Bangkok, Thailand, several Lloyd's underwriters said they had not raised their rates for planes flying to those places. But Mr. Peachey made it clear that rates could soar at the first sign that the threats might be realized.
"We haven't panicked," he said. "Rates are carrying on as they were. But they are being constantly reviewed."
Alan Lord, deputy chairman of Lloyd's, said that, depending on demand, Lloyd's might be open next weekend, too. He pointed out that one person who would be horrified at the notion of conducting business on Sunday was Edward Lloyd, the proprietor of the coffee shop where ship owners and individuals willing to insure their ships and cargoes met three centuries ago. "He was a church warden," Mr. Lord said.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN: LATVIA;
SOVIET COMMANDOS STAGE LATVIA RAID; AT LEAST 5 KILLED

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Monday, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Soldiers from a special unit of the Soviet Interior Ministry gunned their way into a Latvian government ministry building on Sunday night, then left early this morning, according to reports from Riga, the Latvian capital. At least five people were reported to have been killed.
Officials and witnesses said 50 to 100 soldiers of the O.M.O.N., a special forces unit known as the black berets, had attacked the lightly guarded and nearly vacant Latvian Interior Ministry at about 9 P.M. They fired a fusillade of tracer bullets and after a 90-minute gun battle occupied the five-story building. 
 The building was then surrounded by police loyal to the Latvian government, which is seeking independence from Moscow. The black berets, who oppose independence, left at about 3 A.M. today.
 
Five Are Reported Killed
 Spokesmen for the republic's Parliament said five people had been killed, one of them a Latvian journalist, and nine had been wounded. Reports from Riga said crowds of angry Latvians had gathered along Freedom Street after the shootout, but there were no reports of further clashes.
The raid came a week after an attack by Soviet Army troops against the nationalist government of Lithuania, in which 15 people were killed. More than 100,000 people marched to the Kremlin on Sunday to denounce that bloodshed and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's increasingly hard line. [Page A13.]
Reuters quoted the Latvian Deputy Interior Minister, Zenon Indrikov, as saying that only about 15 people had been on duty in his ministry's building, and that resistance had proved useless. The black berets were reportedly armed with automatic weapons.
The Interior Ministry, which is responsible for the republic's police, reportedly had not been barricaded by supporters of the government, as the Parliament and the Council of Ministers had been after the attack by the Soviet Army a week ago on the communications center in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. The army was not engaged in the action today in Riga, where neither the communications nor Parliament building was attacked.
Officials in Moscow made no immediate comment on the incident. The Latvian radio said the republic's Prime Minister, Ivars Godmanis, who led the Popular Front that ousted the Communist government in elections last year, had called to demand an explanation from Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, but that Mr. Yazov had denied any knowledge of the attack.
After the attack in Vilnius, President Gorbachev denied any advance knowledge of the assault, but he endorsed the action of the troops. Mr. Gorbachev has also left no doubt of his impatience with the drive to independence in the three Baltic republics, which he has assailed recently in sharp statements.
 
Kremlin's Role Is Unclear
 The latest assault raised initial fears that Soviet Army troops had decided to move against the separatist Latvian government as they did a week ago when tanks were used in Lithuania. But Latvian officials said Sunday's attack seemed to be limited to the black berets and was not the feared assault by by the regular army.
The degree of Moscow's complicity in the Riga attack is unclear. The black berets, an elite unit of about 150 men, have refused to acknowledge the authority of the elected, separatist Latvian government. Earlier this month, in an operation sanctioned by Moscow, the government printing plant was seized by the black berets. They have also gone on shooting sprees in Riga, and on Jan. 16 they were accused of killing a government driver who was shot through the head in his car.
Such incidents have fueled the Soviet Government's assertions that the situation in Latvia is explosive, but there is no direct evidence that the latest attack by the black berets was guided or sanctioned by Soviet authorities in Riga or in Moscow. So far neither the Latvian nor the Soviet Government has made evident efforts to curb the unit. The new Interior Minister in Moscow, Boris K. Pugo, is the former first secretary of the Latvian Communist Party.
 
Pro-Moscow Group's Declaration
 The incident came the day after Tass published a statement by the "All-Latvian Committee of National Salvation," an anonymous, self-appointed body opposed to the independence sought by the elected government. The committee declared that it was taking over all state powers and dissolving the government.
The Latvian government rejected the statement and declared it invalid, but its publication raised fears that the Soviet authorities might be laying the groundwork for a crackdown. A similar declaration had served as the pretext for the military action in Vilnius.
Latvian officials noted that the Tass report of the Salvation Committee's declaration had been issued three days after it had been adopted in Riga. The delay was not explained, but the coincidence with the attack by the black berets added to the sense of menace.
The statement said that "ruling circles had brought Latvia to the brink of national catastrophe" and were leading the republic to a "bourgeois dictatorship" and "economic collapse." The committee said it was taking charge "for the time it takes to stabilize the situation." It concluded that "Soviet Latvia must remain in a renewed U.S.S.R."

History
 
Since the 13th century, Latvia has been ruled by Germans, Poles, Swedes and the Russian czars. Latvians proclaimed their independence in April 1918 after the October Revolution, winning recognition from the Soviet Union in 1920.
The republic was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 after a secret agreement between Stalin and Hitler. The annexation is not recognized by the United States.
Independent political organizations developed under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, and the Communist Party split into pro-Moscow and pro-autonomy factions. Last May 4, the Latvian Parliament, elected in the first free balloting in the republic since it was annexed declared independence from Soviet rule. Mr. Gorbachev declared Latvia's independence moves illegal.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE ANTIWAR MOVEMENT;
NEWS FROM FRONT BLUNTS PROTESTS

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Before the bombs began falling over Baghdad, David Pierce was a staunch opponent of military action in the Middle East. Now he feels that the United States has no choice but to keep fighting.
"A lot of people who were against fighting the war have switched sides," said Mr. Pierce, a 40-year-old carpenter from Takoma Park, Md. Despite his doubts, he came with his wife and two children to Saturday's antiwar demonstration near the White House. 
 Mr. Pierce said he went to clarify his own thinking and to show moral concern. "Things aren't as clear-cut to me anymore," he said, "but I just think now that we've started fighting, we have to stay the course."
Mr. Pierce's change of heart reflects a big obstacle facing the nation's budding antiwar movement. After picking up enormous momentum before the American attack on Iraq, the movement has been slowed by a number of forces, including the rally-round-the-flag spirit of a nation beginning a war.
 
Not a Video Game
 "It's a very difficult time," said Bonnie Garvin, spokeswoman for the National Campaign for Peace in the Middle East. Her organization is planning a demonstration here for next Saturday, which organizers hope will attract more than the 25,000 who showed up for the march on Saturday.
"When bombs are falling, there's a natural inclination of people to rally round the flag and not seem unpatriotic," she said. "And what we're seeing on television is just this Pac-Man game, as if it's just a clean little video game and there are no bodies being torn apart, no people dying."
If the antiwar movement is to catch hold, it will be because of people like Roger Quillen and his wife, Lynn. "We own our property, our own business and our home, but I'd give all my material possessions up in a minute if it would bring peace," said Mr. Quillen, a 48-year-old lobsterman and fish market owner from Charlestown, R.I., who joined the march on Saturday.
 
Seeking a 'Smarter Way'
 People like Paul Foley, a 35-year-old department store worker from Boston, Emile Gourieux, a 19-year-old student from Bowling Green, Ky., and Patience O'Connor a 43-year-old planner and real estate developer from Washington, came to the protest with a deep fear that the war is a moral calamity.
"I just think there's a smarter way to do this; we're looking at so much blood being shed," Ms. O'Connor said. "What we're doing is deflecting all our energy away from problems at home."
Such concerns are widespread. Before the conflict, polls showed the nation deeply divided on whether to fight and confused about the reason for war. But the beginning of fighting has produced a strong surge of support for the war and for President Bush.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll of 908 adults interviewed Saturday found that 74 percent of the respondents approved of the war effort and 82 percent approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
If the War Drags On?
 Antiwar organizers say such a pro-war surge is common and will dissipate if the war drags on, and if the high-tech air war is replaced by a bloody ground war with higher casualties.
Already the movement is split, with the coalition that sponsored Saturday's march representing the more radical edge. Its organizers call for an immediate withdrawal of American troops from the Middle East, the removal of American bases from the region and an Arab solution to Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
The National Campaign for Peace in the Middle East was formed in response to fears that the coalition leaned too far to the left.
There was no ideological uniformity at Saturday's rally, and no consensus. Some protesters called for an immediate withdrawal of American troops. More common were calls for a cease-fire, and negotiations or renewed reliance on economic sanctions.
 
United on Fundamentals?
 Opponents of the war say that their differences reflect diversity rather than fundamental division and that the peace movement has a far more broad-based grounding than the protests against the Vietnam War in the 60's and 70's.
In fact, the movement has already seen local protests, participation from veterans and families of servicemen and mainstream support in a way rarely seen in the Vietnam protests.
An example is the Piedmont Peace Project in Kannapolis, N.C., made up of about 500 cotton mill workers, farmers, truck drivers and other workers. Some, like Oneil Russ, a 55-year-old meat inspector and veteran, have children in the gulf.
Members say the war offers nothing for working-class people. Linda Stout, the group's director, said: "We constantly remind people we're proud of our folks in the military. But at the same time, they didn't join to fight a war for oil profits."
Antiwar protests have cropped up not just at universities with a history of protest activity but also at places like the University of Montana, where 20 protesters disrupted a nationally broadcast basketball game Thursday night by lying on the court.
But Ms. Stout and Ms. Garvin agree that even among working people skeptical of the war there is a deep cultural divide with the most prominent elements of the antiwar movement.
 
Disgust With Flag Burning
 And a groundswell of pro-war rallies and angry comments on radio talk shows and in letters to newspapers indicate that the harsh views toward antiwar protest that marked the Vietnam era may be as strong now.
Still, antiwar activists say their movement has reached a level that took years to develop in the Vietnam era. Supporters say that, once the costs at home and abroad become clear, deep doubts will resurface. "My brother is on his way over there, and he completely supports what I'm doing," said Jeanne K. Whalen, who was carrying a sign reading "Love Our Troops -- Hate the War."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
High Tech and Spirits at Rio Rock Festival

BYLINE: By JON PARELES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Rock festivals have entered the computer age with Rock in Rio II, the 10-day, nine-concert series that opened on Friday night here at Maracana Stadium.
An enthusiastic audience of 100,000 people ready to dance, sing, shout, wave their arms or light matches on cue was dazzled by patterns of green laser light and bathed in computer-controlled spotlighting. Giant video images of the stage show appeared as the performers stage blasted songs to a sound system with remarkable punch and sonic detail. When performers spoke from the stage in English, subtitles in Portuguese appeared on the video screens; Prince would shout, "All night long!" and a few moments later "Anoite toda!" would appear on screen. For electronic excellence, Rock in Rio II may be unsurpassed. 
 In the record books, Rock in Rio II will fall just short of its predecessor, which in 10 days in 1985 built up the largest attendance ever at a rock festival. About 100,000 people attended opening night of Rock in Rio II on Friday, 50,000 short of the sellout that would have helped break the record. Yet it was hard to imagine how more people could have been squeezed onto the soccer field and into the stands. (Tonight's show, with Guns 'n' Roses headlining, was sold out in advance.)
Brazil is experiencing a recession, and ticket prices that are relatively low by United States standards -- about $10 to $30 for eight-hour shows -- seem expensive here. Since the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf, filling stations here in Rio have been closing at 8 P.M. each day and all day Sunday to reduce consumption, limiting car travel. (Brazilians may find it more convenient to watch the festival on Globo TV, which is broadcasting it live; in the United States, MTV will have excerpts on Feb. 9.)
The festival has noted but not dwelled upon the war. At Saturday's concert, two audience members carried a sign that said, in English, "Make Love Not War -- Rock in Rio II," while antiwar leaflets were distributed outside the stadium.
Performers have expressed hopes for peace with little further comment, drawing cheers before the next love song or dance tune. "There's a war going on," Prince said onstage in Saturday's wee hours. "I don't know what's up, but I think we'd all be better off living for love." The reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, who opened the festival on Friday night, drew a roar of applause when he called on President Bush and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein not to create another Vietnam War as a convenient lead-in to his song "(No More) Vietnam."
On Saturday night, the Engineers From Hawaii, a band from Porto Alegre, Brazil, sang its biggest hit, about a young man who liked to sing Beatles and Rolling Stones songs and then died in Vietnam. A few songs earlier, the Engineers prefaced one song by saying that rains and mud slides in Rio de Janeiro in the few days before the concert had killed more people than the Gulf war.
Most concertgoers -- among them two sons of Brazil's president, Fernando Collor de Mello, and actors from Brazil's hugely popular television soap operas -- came to dance. Whenever a band picked up the tempo, whether it was Joe Cocker's version of "Unchain My Heart" or the Engineers' earnest folk-rock in Portuguese, tens of thousands of hands waved in the air, and bodies shimmied. Every chorus of a hit drew hearty sing-alongs. The enthusiasm has helped lackluster performers like Colin Hay, the former leader of Men at Work, and ignited better ones, like Santana, whose Latin rock moved to peak after peak.
Local touches make Rock in Rio II different from festivals in North America. Only in Brazil would intermission entertainment include scantily clad samba dancers performing alongside inflatable animals, the women's images blown up three stories high on the video screens, or a batucada band playing carnival music between sets to send the entire audience into motion. Vendors circulate with hot coffee and cold soft drinks , dancing as they hold their insulated carriers aloft.
Concertgoers received booklets of lyrics by the English-speaking performers, a promotional effort by a language school. Among the 60 concession stands built within the stadium for the festival are not only typical T-shirt and hot dog vendors, but a bookstore dedicated to rock biographies and a computer software outlet.
The festival has offered some glimpses of the younger generation of Brazilian rock bands, who have clearly grown up on American and British rock and MTV. Yet there are surprises. Supla, a bleached-blond Billy Idol imitator, at one point leaped and spun like a Brazilian capoeira dancer. And the Engineers From Hawaii, whose appearance recalls Loggins and Messina, mix echoes of Sting, the Who, Elton John and John Cougar Mellencamp in trimly crafted songs that clearly mean a lot to their audience, which sang along on nearly every one. The Engineers and Lazzo, a Brazilian reggae singer who joined Jimmy Cliff for one song, drew as much applause as the imported acts.
Prince, who has not toured the United States with his current band, played a set that was alternately explosive and self-indulgent as he worked to be ever more encyclopedic. Challenged, perhaps, by the success of M.C. Hammer, Prince's new band includes three dancers, one of whom raps (far more skillfully than M.C. Hammer); Prince also built a song on a tape-loop of James Brown, as rappers do.
His 90-minute set opened with a funk workout -- part Bo Diddley, part Parliament-Funkadelic, part James Brown -- that had Prince spinning and hip-swiveling in what he introduced as the latest dance craze, "the Horny Pony." But he broke the momentum with slow arena rock, heavy metal, pop and ballads ("Nothing Compares 2 U," sung by Rosie Jane Gaines with Prince on piano, losing parts of the crowd as 3 A.M. came and went. He also had a problem with the language barrier; the kind of exhortations that help turn Prince's North American concerts into call-and-response parties were lost on much of the audience, with subtitles arriving two beats too late.
In many ways, Rock in Rio II embraces current rock's least endearing trends. The sponsorship of multi-national corporations -- from Coca-Cola (which paid $3 million to place its logo everywhere), to the record companies that have postered Rio de Janeiro with advertisements, to MTV, which recently opened MTV Brazil -- threatens a worldwide homogenization of popular music. But when heavily promoted performers arrive at Rock in Rio II, they're likely to discover that the local audience is the festival's true star.

National Dairy Board Drops DDB Needham

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
The National Dairy Board has dropped DDB Needham, Chicago, as the agency for its cheese account. The board decided to consolidate the $20 million account, which had been handled by DDB Needham for more than three years, with other business handled by Grey Advertising, New York.
Grey has handled the $15 million ice cream and $11 million butter accounts since 1987. McCann Erickson, San Francisco, will continue to handle the client's milk and dairy food accounts, which have about $59 miilion in combined billings.
"After a review, we decided to make this move to increase efficiency," said Yvonne Dock, manager of public relations of organization, which is based in Arlington, Va. "While the comparison was close, Grey came out as more economical for us in terms of staff."
Executives from DDB Needham and Grey declined to comment on the switch.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush Pours Oil on Troubled Traders

 BODY:
Mideast war is supposed to send oil prices skyward and oil-importing economies downward. But that's not what happened last week. Allied forces bombed Iraq and Kuwait -- and oil prices nosedived more than 30 percent, the biggest one-day drop in history. That caught oil companies flat-footed. Indeed, expecting prices to rise, they were promising to freeze prices as a gesture of good will against charges of profiteering.
The price drops were due in part to the stunning success of the early bombing raids, which convinced traders that Saudi oil fields would be safe. But another key factor was shrewd planning by the Bush Administration. A week earlier, it and other Western nations announced that, at the outbreak of war, they would jointly release two million barrels of oil a day from government stockpiles. Mr. Bush backed that pledge to the hilt by announcing as soon as the shooting started that the United States would release more than a million barrels a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which contains 600 million barrels stored in underground salt caverns. 
 Oil prices respond to fear every bit as much as to supply cutbacks. Hoarding, not an OPEC embargo, created most of the gas lines during the 1970's. And hoarding, not insufficient supply, was driving oil prices higher as traders nervously approached the Jan. 15 deadline for Saddam Hussein's withdrawal from Kuwait. The fear dissolved only after the allies knocked out Iraq's capacity to cripple Saudi oil production and the U.S. pledged to release reserve oil.
Some energy brokers are now claiming foul. They say the Energy Department battered the oil market by promising to release oil from the reserve needlessly. But the facts show otherwise. Oil prices have merely returned to levels of two weeks earlier -- before panic gripped the market.
The Bush Administration suffered, and deserved, criticism for refusing to release reserve oil last summer, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. But now officials have finally put the reserve to good use.
The combination of encouraging war news and enlightened reserve policy has stripped oil prices of the fear factor, returning them to pre-August levels. That's not likely to please the oil companies, but it is wonderful news for the economy.

HEADLINE: Put Moscow in a Deep Freeze

BYLINE: By Orrin G. Hatch; Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Since U.S. economic aid and other manifestations of improving U.S.-Soviet relations have been based on continuing Soviet reform, President Bush needs to do more than reproach Mikhail Gorbachev.
After the Soviet use of force in Lithuania and, yesterday, Latvia, the U.S. should call off the planned summit meeting, and should terminate the $1 billion in agricultural credits and cancel the planned waiver of the Jackson-Vanik restrictions on most-favored-nation trade status. Mr. Bush should also foster direct ties with Soviet republics that hold genuinely free elections and adopt far-reaching market reforms. 
 While President Gorbachev and some Western leaders may reject explicit linkage of the Baltic question to other East-West issues, linkage exists as a political reality. Western public opinion, particularly U.S. Congressional opinion, will turn cold so long as Moscow tries to keep the Baltic states on a short leash.
Too often in debate about U.S. policy toward Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, the issue has been framed as a choice between granting full diplomatic recognition to democratic governments or doing nothing -- a false dilemma. The U.S. should undertake diplomatic steps short of full recognition that would advance Baltic independence and increase in Moscow's calculus the international political costs of coercive policies.
First, the U.S. should adopt a Baltic relations act basically similar to the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which governs relations with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations. The primary objective of the act would be to establish with each Baltic state unofficial diplomatic liaisons similar to the American Institute of Taiwan and its Taiwan counterpart in the U.S.
These institutes, nominally independent of the U.S. Government, would upgrade U.S.-Baltic relations and serve as the point of contact between the U.S. and Baltic leaders. They would facilitate the kinds of normal international transactions, such as political communication and cultural exchanges, that routinely take place with Taiwan. And they would seek to encourage economic investment in the Baltic states, particularly through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, as market reform is adopted.
Second, the U.S. should sponsor the Baltic states as members of international economic groups, like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. After all, GATT has juggled the competing claims of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and its charter accommodates membership by governments with less than full sovereignty.
The key GATT membership requirement is that a government control its economy. The Baltic states have that power under Moscow's Declaration of Baltic Economic Autonomy in 1989, and have taken substantial steps in wresting control of enterprises from Soviet ministries, as well as negotiating independent trade pacts with other Soviet republics.
In any forthcoming U.S.-Soviet economic pacts, the U.S. should insist on provisions that recognize the international legal standing of the Soviet republics and permit more liberal economic relations for reformist republics like the Baltic states than for the rest of the Soviet Union, particularly in the areas of technical assistance and foreign investment.
While Mr. Gorbachev and his central Government hesitate in adopting even half-baked market reforms, the Baltic countries have expressed unequivocally the intention of adopting full-fledged market reforms, including the restoration of private property and free-market prices.
He understands that the old system, based on coercion, stifles economic progress. A new system based on consent requires transformation of the country into a loose confederation, and acceptance of the inevitability that some republics, particularly the Baltic states, will choose to secede, even if they keep close economic and political ties with Moscow.
President Bush is now obliged to pursue policies that make Mr. Gorbachev understand that he faces a choice between an isolated Soviet Union mired in poverty and paralyzed by national hatreds and a new Soviet confederation that can join the community of nations and achieve prosperity commensurate with its great natural wealth.

HEADLINE: Ba Liep Journal;
Family Braves a Cruel Sea and Just 2 Come Back

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BA LIEP, Vietnam, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Dang Chi Cuong came home today to his father's house in this little village in the Mekong Delta, eight months after he left by boat with his wife and two children.
"We met disaster on the sea," Mr. Cuong said simply as his 9-year-old son clung mournful and bewildered to his leg. Thai pirates intercepted their boat of 77 people, he said. They raped the women, including Mr. Cuong's wife, Le Thi Han, then tried to kill all witnesses. 
 Mr. Cuong's wife, 30, and their 6-year-old daughter, Dang Thi Bich Tuyen, were killed. Mr. Cuong and his son, Dang Ngoc Phuoc, jumped into the ocean and floated on bits of driftwood for four days until Thai fishermen rescued them. Of the 77 people on the boat that day, May 13, 1990, only 7 survived.
The fishermen, who were as kind as the pirates were barbarous, took the survivors to a Thai holding camp for Vietnamese boat people. Representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees heard their story, Mr. Cuong said. As for Thai officials, "they were not interested."
Asked about his destiny, Mr. Cuong stared into the distance, holding his son's head to his hip. "I could not know what would happen," he said at last. "There was no way to know."
 
In the Wrong Army
 Mr. Cuong was wearing one of the nonsense-English T-shirts popular all over Asia. He bought his in Bangkok with some of the $50 bonus the United Nations High Commissioner provides each Vietnamese adult who agrees to return home. His shirt displays the British, French and American flags and reads: "Do! Family. Fun for every day in the year."
His father, Dang Van Mai, 56, fluttered his hands, upset by the commotion this homecoming had caused -- the official visitors, a foreigner, the gawking neighbors. Mr. Mai was a soldier for the wrong army, the South Vietnamese Army, and he gets no pension. "I knew what happened to him and his family," Mr. Mai said. "I was very sad to hear it."
Mr. Mai lives with his wife and three other children in a wretched, smoky hut of thatch in this poor village in Cuu Long Province, without electricity, down a long dirt road lined with rice paddies and cut by canals. Now, seven will live there.
Mr. Mai has no work; his wife, Nguyen Thi Sau, 53, does odd jobs, either in the rice paddies or in the houses of others, and is paid about 3,000 dong a day -- 44 cents at the official rate of exchange. "It was almost enough for us," Mr. Mai said. He did not know that his son would receive money from the United Nations for agreeing to return -- $30 a month for a year for himself, $15 a month for the boy. "He will need the money for his son," Mr. Mai said. "It's up to him to begin his life again."
Neighbors found Mrs. Sau to tell her that her son and grandson had returned home. Rice-stalk thin, she said next to nothing, and began to cry. Embarrassed, she wiped her tears away with the back of her hand and spoke softly to Phuoc, her grandson. He knelt in front of her, his face averted, picking at the knee of her black peasant trousers. She held his shoulders and whispered in his ear. "He misses his mother," she finally said.
Mr. Cuong said he had been working at his father-in-law's sugar mill. "But there was not enough money and my wife was often sick," he said. She wanted to go to a third country, to the United States, to get a better life."
They paid about $1,000 each for the passage, borrowing money. Some of his wife's cousins also went along, and also perished. What will he tell his wife's family?
"I will go to them and tell them exactly what happened," he said. Will he feel embarrassed before them? "I did not know what would happen on the sea," he said again. "I could not know."
 
Failure Is Expensive
 Many Vietnamese who leave by boat bear the hopes of their families. If they succeed in resettling, they can take over their direct relatives. Failure, however, is expensive and embarrassing. Mr. Cuong said he knew of such cases, but refused to say if his was similar. Mr. Mai said he had not known his son was leaving. A United Nations official said, "It is illegal to leave by boat, so they are afraid to speak of it."
Mr. Cuong said he did not know that by leaving in May 1990 he had missed a cutoff for Vietnamese boat people imposed by Southeast Asian countries in March 1989. Previously, all Vietnamese boat people were regarded as refugees and guaranteed resettlement; those arriving afterward are screened, and only those with a "well-founded fear of persecution" qualify as refugees. The others, economic migrants, who are making up about 85 to 90 percent of those screened, will have to return to Vietnam.
The United States has opposed involuntary repatriation, so the High Commissioner has tried to induce Vietnamese to agree to return. Mr. Cuong and his son are among 344 Vietnamese who have flown home from Thailand. So far, about 7,500 Vietnamese have returned voluntarily, 6,300 of them from Hong Kong. But more than 100,000 remain in the region's camps, and new arrivals are still running at about 2,500 a month.
Asked why he agreed to return, Mr. Cuong looked toward his son, still huddled with Mrs. Sau. "After my wife died, I didn't care any more," he said. "I wanted to come home."

HEADLINE: Careers;
Opportunities in Health Care Appear Good

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
RECESSION or not, health care is a growing industry offering good jobs.
James N. Heuerman, a partner of Korn/Ferry International, the management recruiting firm, stresses that the opportunities appear good even though health-care institutions are putting increased emphasis on holding down costs. His firm recently financed the latest in a series of studies called "Health Care Employment -- a Survey of Early Career Opportunities." It was done for the Association of University Programs in Health Administration, which has 1,500 university members.
"The studies come out every two years," he said. "If you look over the last three, you find a diversity of positions beginning to surface in health care." 
 Mr. Heuerman recalled that 20 years ago holders of master's degrees in health-care administration typically found jobs with 300-bed community hospitals. "It was one of the few industries where a relatively young person could walk into a vice presidency without starting as a number cruncher." he said.
Now, he said, many people with such degrees are joining health maintenance organizations, insurance companies, ambulatory-care organizations, consulting firms and long-term care facilities. "They start at $35,000 a year and work their way up," he said. "I think health care will continue to be a good opportunity."
Mr. Heuerman, who holds a master's in health-care administration from the University of Minnesota, said the industry should provide job stability despite the deepening recession.
Job opportunities are also expected to expand in health-related sidelines. For example, Joan Marks heads the graduate-level Health Advocacy Program at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y.
"It's a small program that began in 1980 but the only one of its type in the country," she said last week. "About 100 have completed it." Those who complete the 36 credit hours, plus an internship, receive a master of arts or master of professional studies degree. Their starting salaries are around $35,000.
"Health advocates serve as a liaison between patients and the institution," Ms. Marks said. "I think you could describe a health advocate as a neutral person to whom problems can be presented by the patient, whether it involves a doctor, nurse, social worker or hospital service. The health advocate provides a link to the appropriate service needed and is especially valuable at a time of nursing shortages."
Hospitals, always concerned about malpractice suits, want to know about patients' problems before they become unmanageable. As a result, she said, more and more hospitals are offering the service. "About 50 percent of the hospitals around the country have formal patient advocacy programs, with departments ranging from two persons to 13," Ms. Marks said. Among those with large staffs are Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York with 13, she said.
"It is an excellent career for the middle-aged," she added. "Some of our students are in their early 40's. The job requires maturity, perspective, ability to relate to people in distress, and all this comes more easily with age."
She has 22 students currently, and wants more.
At New York University's School of Continuing Education, Miriam Aaron is the coordinator of a new program that awards a Certificate in Worksite Wellness. Its graduates are trained to organize and manage fitness programs within companies; this might involve aerobics, sports, nutrition classes and advice on alcohol and drug abuse.
Explaining that the first class of 40 students started last fall, Ms. Aaron said that most wanted to enhance their skills in the health field. "Two women came to us from Consolidated Edison, where one is an occupational health nurse and the other in the training department," she said.
"Often companies underwrite the tuition," she added. "I think most of the students are exploring career changes. Some hospital nurses think about switching to jobs in industry."
As layoffs among New York City municipal workers increase, she expects more students who held city jobs to sign up for the next semester, which begins Feb. 4.
"Most students tend to be in their 30's and 40's," she said. "In the class of 20 that I teach there are 5 men."
Ms. Aaron said that many large companies, including Johnson & Johnson, had so-called wellness programs in place. "I think the growth will be in the increased recognition of the need for wellness programs by small employers," she said, explaining that small companies might hire outside companies to handle their programs.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN: Europe;
European Nations Prepare to Impose Sanctions on Moscow

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Angered by continued Soviet military actions in the Baltic states, European Community and NATO governments are preparing to apply economic and other sanctions against Moscow after Sunday's violence in the Latvian capital of Riga, European officials said today.
The officials recalled that Moscow was warned after last week's killings in Lithuania that further repression in the Baltics would damage its relations with the West. Now, they said, the 12 community governments had no choice but to follow up their words with action. 
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which joined the community in condemning the deaths of five people in Riga on Sunday, is also planning what American officials described as "a closely coordinated series of actions" to show disapproval of Moscow's hard-line policy in the Baltic states.
"We've tried using political persuasion and it hasn't worked," Denmark's Foreign Minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, said. "Now we must use economic means."
 
Threat to Stability
 Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, still formally allied with the Soviet Union through the now-moribund Warsaw Pact, also warned in a statement that Moscow's crackdown against the "legally elected governments" of the Baltic states could threaten stability throughout Central Europe.
So far, it is unclear what measures are to be adopted against Moscow. It is apparent, though, that Western governments are turning to sanctions reluctantly, not only because of the need to maintain Soviet support for the anti-Iraqi coalition, but also for fear of a return to the East-West tensions of cold war days.
Today, while condemning the killings in Riga, Germany and France made no reference to possible reprisals. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Germany was interested "in the democratization process of the Soviet Union continuing." France urged Moscow to negotiate its differences with the Baltic states.
In contrast, Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said Soviet repression could jeopardize European aid programs. "The Soviet Union cannot expect to have the kind of friendship and cooperation which has been building in the last three or four years with the West if in the Baltic states it goes back to Stalinist tactics," he said.
 
Options for Response
 In planning its response, the European Community, which until recently was strongly backing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to modernize the Soviet Union, has various options, the mildest of which might be suspension of a high-level meeting with Soviet trade officials scheduled for this week.
But it could also suspend a $550 million technical assistance agreement, a $680 million credit for Soviet food purchases and a 1989 trade and cooperation agreement aimed at stimulating Soviet trade and increasing scientific and technological exchanges.
Senior European officials said that, for humanitarian reasons, a separate $340 million emergency food aid program for the Soviet Union, which was approved by community leaders in Rome last month following appeals for help from Moscow, would not be affected.
United States officials said other sanctions could be announced by individual governments, but NATO itself may also adopt measures. These could include withdrawal of an invitation for President Gorbachev to visit NATO's Brussels headquarters this year and a reduction of military contacts with Moscow.

HEADLINE: Varian Net Climbs 63%

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 21

 BODY:
In the first sign that its turnaround efforts are paying off, Varian Associates Inc. today reported sharply higher first-quarter earnings. One of the pioneer Silicon Valley companies, Varian had been sluggish in recent years.
For the quarter that ended on Dec. 28, Varian had earnings of $12.4 million, or 64 cents a share, up 63 percent from $7.6 million, or 39 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Sales grew 10 percent, to $316.1 million, from $285.4 million in the first quarter of the 1990 fiscal year.
"The first-quarter earnings progress indicates that our drive to achieve better operating performance is now taking hold in all of our businesses," J. Tracy O'Rourke, Varian's chairman, said in a prepared statement. He said he was encouraged by continued strong orders, particularly in the current recession.
Three of Varian's four major businesses had double-digit gains in orders, led by semiconductor manufacturing equipment, at 26 percent.
Varian's stock jumped $2.375 a share today, to $35.75, a high for the year, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Drifts Lower As Focus Turns to Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower in quiet trading yesterday as traders turned their attention from the Persian Gulf war to the weak United States economy.
Traders said this was the first time since war erupted last Wednesday that the currency market focused on the dollar's economic fundamentals instead of the currency's appeal as a safe holding in times of turmoil. 
 Trading was thin and wound down by early afternoon because of snow in the New York area and observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Many banks were closed.
Currency analysts said it was difficult to single out factors behind the dollar's decline because relatively few traders could influence the direction of sparsely traded markets.
There were indications, though, that the market focused on the Government's expected release Friday of its report on the gross national product, a key economic indicator released every quarter.
"It's the first number we'll have really confirming the recession," said David Marshall, senior currency analyst for MMS International Inc.
Signs of economic weakness generally erode the dollar's value and prompt investors to seek currencies from countries with stronger economies.
Mr. Marshall said his firm was forecasting a 3.8 percent decline in the G.N.P. for the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. That drop would be substantial enough to indicate another decline in the first quarter of 1991, he said.
The G.N.P. is the nation's total output of goods and services and the broadest measure of economic health.
Yesterday, the British pound strengthened in New York to $1.9615 from late Friday's $1.9513. In London earlier, sterling rose to $1.9535, from $1.9420 late Friday.
In New York, the dollar closed at 131.95 yen, down from Friday's 132.50 yen. Earlier, in Toyko, the dollar fell 0.82 yen, to a closing 132.75 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 132 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.4875 German marks, down from 1.4975; 1.2465 Swiss francs, down from 1.2560; 5.0565 French francs, down from 5.0930; 1,118.00 Italian lire, down from 1,126.50, and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1590.

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Staff Stays Largely Intact and in Shadow

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Perhaps the surest measure of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's concern about the state's fiscal condition is that he has allowed so little turnover in his staff at the beginning of his third term.
While campaigning for re-election last fall, Mr. Cuomo predicted that there would be many fresh faces in his administration and suggested that a new term would provide a natural transition point. 
 "There are people who I couldn't ask to do another four years," he said in September, stressing the financial and physical sacrifices of his staff.
But with the state facing the most severe budget crisis of Mr. Cuomo's tenure, the Governor has chosen to make only minor alterations in a team that he values for its experience.
 
Budget Battle Delays Departures
 He has persuaded some aides, including Gerald C. Crotty, his chief of staff, to stay at least until the end of this spring's grueling budget battle. Several commissioners who were rumored to be job-hunting have yet to leave and only two top aides from the Governor's central staff have left.
The aides who have departed -- Evan A. Davis, the Governor's legal counsel, and Gary G. Fryer, who held the titles of press secretary and counselor -- have been replaced with loyal insiders who did not require on-the-job training while the state's budget gap was expanding.
Mr. Davis was succeeded by Elizabeth D. Moore, who had directed Mr. Cuomo's Office of Employee Relations. She is the first black adviser in the upper echelon of Mr. Cuomo's staff.
Mr. Fryer's responsibilities were divided between Andrew J. Zambelli, who was promoted from senior deputy secretary to counselor and director of communications, and Anne W. Crowley, who became press secretary after serving as Mr. Fryer's deputy.
 
Originally Thought Middleweight
 Mr. Cuomo's central staff was much maligned when he first took office eight years ago. Reviewers dismissed it as decidedly middleweight -- lacking in big names, overly dominated by white men, and top-heavy with holdovers from the administration of Mr. Cuomo's predecessor, Gov. Hugh L. Carey.
Although some of those traits persist, the staff is credited for fitting well with Mr. Cuomo's hands-on management and for running an efficient, if not always inspired, operation. And Ms. Moore's appointment has alleviated what Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine said was "concern that we would sit down at the table and it would just be white males."
Assembly Speaker Mel Miller said his opinion of the Cuomo staff had improved. "With the Governor, who is incredibly hands-on, the staff gets less prominence," he said. "But it doesn't mean the staff is dumber or less capable. Someone who needs more prominence isn't going to last."
Mr. Cuomo argues that his decision to not disrupt his staff at such a sensitive time will keep his administration focused on the state's budget problems.
 
Critics Cite Lack of Vision
 But some lobbyists and legislative aides, while praising the staff's competence and dedication, warn that the dearth of new blood could worsen what they see as the administration's major shortcoming -- its lack of inventiveness. Several cited Mr. Cuomo's State of the State speech, which they complained lacked priorities and focus, as a recent sign of staleness.
"I give them high marks for access," said one lobbyist. "I give them high marks for attentiveness. I give them high marks for good intentions. I don't know whether I'd always give them high marks for vision."
If conservatism sometimes prevents Mr. Cuomo from realizing his full political potential, his aides think it has protected the Governor from rash decisions and poorly considered strategy.
In his early days as Governor, Mr. Cuomo was fond of comparing his staff's organizational chart to "the spokes of a wheel." The Governor regularly reaches out to a central staff of 14 people, while frequently consulting with lower-ranking aides, the directors of state agencies and a broad array of informal advisers outside Albany.
 
The Hub of the Wheel
 With Mr. Crotty, whose title is secretary to the Governor, the central staff comprises Mr. Lundine; Henrik N. Dullea, the director of state operations; Ms. Moore; Mr. Zambelli; Ms. Crowley; Vincent Tese, the director of economic development; Fabian G. Palomino, the special counsel; Dall W. Forsythe, the budget director; Mary Ann Crotty, the deputy director of state operations; Michael J. Dowling, the deputy secretary for human services; Francis J. Murray Jr., the deputy secretary for energy and environmental affairs; John J. Poklemba, the director of criminal justice, and Brad C. Johnson, the director of the state's Washington office.
Their salaries range from $98,399 for Mr. Crotty to $76,444 for Ms. Crowley. Mr. Palomino has drawn no salary as special counsel since last week, when he was named president of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where his salary is $125,000.
The "spokes of the wheel" system contrasted with the more detached style of Mr. Carey, whose chief of staff, Robert J. Morgado, served as a strict gatekeeper to the Governor's office.
Because Mr. Cuomo reclaimed many of Mr. Morgado's responsibilities, and because the Governor does much of his own talking, Mr. Crotty and his colleagues rarely break into public view.
 
Underrated Chief of Staff
 That low visibility has made Mr. Crotty an underrated chief of staff, legislative negotiators and lobbyists say. By designating Mr. Crotty as his top trouble-shooter, Mr. Cuomo has placed increasing confidence in him, and Mr. Crotty's subordinates universally praise his calmness under pressure and his reasoned, nonideological approach to problem-solving.
But legislative leaders also point out that Mr. Crotty and his colleagues have not always had the authority that others have had in previous administrations. Mr. Cuomo's desire to do much of his own negotiating sometimes slows the wheels of government, they say.
"You don't always know if the staff sign-off is the real sign-off," said Mr. Miller, the Assembly Speaker. "And when a principal digs in and his position becomes public, it takes months to dig out."
If there has been a key to the staying power of the Cuomo staff, it has been the Governor's ability to minimize infighting by extending his reach past a small inner circle.
 
Access and Morale High
 "Because they are all so integrated into the process, there is less reason for their being suspicious of one another," Mr. Cuomo said. "You only get backbiting when you have fiefdoms and individuals who are isolated."
And by granting so much access to so many staff members, Mr. Cuomo has kept morale high. "There's no question that I work 20 hours a week more because of it," said Gene B. Sperling, a speechwriter and political aide who joined the staff last February.
Like Mr. Cuomo, whose only "vacation" in eight years was spent reading at the Executive Mansion, the Governor's staff works torturous hours. The average day often begins with a phone call from Mr. Cuomo at 6:30 A.M. and ends with one after midnight.
"The Governor has a tendency to overwhelm and overshadow everything around him," said Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and a frequent Cuomo adviser. "His staff suffers a bit because they're in the shadow of this very powerful light. But they have neither the desire nor the ability to compete with him."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Mixed in Light Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in thin trading yesterday in a session that would not have taken place but for the war in the Persian Gulf.
Before the fighting began in the gulf, participants in the Government securities market had planned to take the day off in observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday. 
 Even though the market was open, most investment houses had only skeleton crews at their trading desks. And the traders that did show up for work were informed around midday by the Public Securities Association, a trade group, that activity would stop at 1 P.M. because of a snowstorm in New York.
An article published yesterday in The Independent, a British daily, saying that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had proposed a coordinated reduction in global interest rates to representatives of the world's seven leading industrialized nations at a meeting in New York helped to push down short-term interest rates somewhat.
Meanwhile, developments over the weekend, including Iraqi missile attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia, made clearer the possibility that the war in the gulf could be a drawn-out affair, a realization that persuaded traders to sell bonds.
Analysts said the report in The Independent probably said more about the Fed's intentions over the near to medium term than about those of other central banks.
"It seems more likely that Greenspan was signifying that the United States has more easing to do over the next three to six months," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and economist at S.G. Warburg & Company.
"I don't see the Germans agreeing to lower their interest rates, and if the Germans can't do it, most of the European countries can't do it either."
Because of the holiday, the Fed was closed yesterday. So too were most major banks.
At the close of trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 106, down 15/32, to yield 8.20 percent, up from 8.17 percent late Friday.
 
Treasury Note Issues
 Among Treasury note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 1/8, down 1/8 point, to yield 8.03 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 9/ 32, up 2/32, to yield 7.08 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.03 percent, down four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 6.15 percent.
The weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, normally held on Mondays, was postponed until today because of the holiday.
In addition to the bill auctions, later this week traders will be asked to bid at auctions of more than $21 billion worth of new two-year and five-year notes.
"We will be a supply-dominated market for the next few days unless something happens in the Middle East," one government securities trader said. "Because there is so much uncertainty in the Persian Gulf, that will make this a difficult period for the market."
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was nearly nonexistent, traders said.
As a consequence, prices of most issues in both markets were essentially unchanged on the day.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN: Washington;
Bush Appeals to Kremlin Leaders To Refrain From Force in Baltics

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he was increasingly concerned about violent repression of nationalist independence movements in the Baltic republics by the Soviet authorities.
"I would again appeal to the Soviet Union leaders to resist using force," Mr. Bush said at an impromptu meeting with reporters on his return from a weekend at Camp David to the White House. He was referring to reports of killings on Sunday in Riga, the Latvian capital, by elite troops from a Soviet Interior Ministry unit. 
 Last week he appealed directly to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to put a stop to the use of force in the Baltic capitals after an attack by Soviet soldiers on the nationalist government of Lithuania that also caused deaths.
 
Sanctions Under Consideration
 At a White House briefing, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said the Administration, along with Western allied governments, was considering "sanctions and other kinds of measures" against the Soviet Union as a means of underscoring its concerns although he said that "no decisions have been made."
He was speaking of a meeting of 15 ambassadors of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization earlier in the day in Brussels, where punitive steps against Moscow were discussed.
Administration officials said the latest incidents added to their skepticism about holding to plans for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev to meet a little more than three weeks from now. Last week, Administration officials said the summit meeting was "up in the air."
This afternoon, a State Department official noted that the Administration had called the Soviet Embassy on Sunday to express "our great concern" about the shootings in Riga but had received no response. The official said, "We are seeking to maintain U.S. officials in all three capitals on a virtually continuous basis" to gather information and convey American concerns in the Baltic republics. He said the policy was to "promote a peaceful process to resolve the disputes."
These remarks were made against a background of mounting demands from Congress for concrete actions against Moscow, including stopping the planned extension of trade benefits and agricultural credits.
 
Personal Ties to Gorbachev
 The Bush Administration, like the Reagan Administration before it, has tended to base its overall relationship with the Soviet Union on the comfortable personal relationship developed first between President Gorbachev and President Reagan and then between Mr. Gorbachev and President Bush. That relationship has been strained by the killings in the Baltics, regardless of whether Mr. Gorbachev was directly responsible.
The Administration also intends to demonstrate its concern by having Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d receive government officials from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia on Tuesday.
Two of the officials, Deputy Prime Minister Dainis Ivans of Latvia and Vice President Bronius Kuzmickas of Lithuania, are also scheduled to address Congressional members of the United States Commission on Cooperation and Security in Europe. Mr. Baker is also to receive Endall Lippmaa, an Estonian government minister.
Last week, Republican and Democratic members of the so-called Helsinki commission -- named for the Finnish capital, where 35 countries signed an agreement in 1975 on mutual cooperation and security -- sharply criticized Mr. Gorbachev because of the violent crackdown in the Baltics.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, suggested today in an article on the op-ed page of The New York Times and in an interview on Cable News Network that Washington establish "unofficial diplomatic liaison" with the Baltic republics and sponsor their membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

HEADLINE: Mongolian President in U.S. to Sign Trade Agreement

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Mongolia, a fledgling democracy wedged between the Soviet Union and China and long isolated economically, will sign its first trade agreement with the United States on Wednesday as part of efforts to broaden exchanges, officials of both Governments said.
The signing, which could lead to lower tariffs and more joint ventures, is scheduled as a high point of a trip to the United States by the newly elected President, Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, the first Mongolian leader ever to visit here. He arrived in this country on Sunday night. 
 Long under Moscow's dominance but transformed last year from an authoritarian state to a multi-party democracy, Mongolia sees an expansion of economic ties with the United States as a means of reinforcing market-oriented reforms, said Dalhjavyn Sandag, a diplomat at the Mongolian Embassy here.
In addition to more trade, he said, his Government sought technical assistance and credits from the United States and membership in both the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, organizations that provide economic help to many third world countries.
International economic officials say they expect Mongolia to become the 155th member of the two Washington-based organizations later this year.
 
Hides and Wool Exported
 While Mongolia's main exports include products like hides, wool and metals, the country could become a market for American commercial aircraft, computers and oil-related equipment, Bush Administration trade officials say.
Several Mongolian joint ventures with American companies are getting started, American officials said, including a processing operation for camel's hair for coats and blankets and another for processing dairy products.
An investment law passed last year in the Mongolian legislature seeks to encourage ventures that will increase much-needed foreign exchange. Among the main provisions of the law are a three-year tax holiday and tax exemption for repatriated earnings.
The trade agreement, to be signed by the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, and Mongolia's Minister of Trade and Industry, Sedochiryn Bayarbaatar, is intended to provide a framework for improved commerce.
It removes obstacles to opening offices to advertise, meet with potential purchasers and otherwise promote commerce, and assures that each country's laws and regulations are made available to the other.
 
Dependent on Soviets
 Closer commercial relations with Washington are intended to reduce economic dependence on the Soviet Union, which has been Mongolia's main trading partner and dominant political influence for most of this century.
A land of only two million people whose forebears sent armies as far afield as central Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries, Mongolia was under Chinese suzerainty in the three centuries before it became an autonomous state under Soviet protection in the 1920's.
Mongolian officials are especially eager to reduce their total dependence on Soviet oil, which eats up proceeds from a third of its exports. Moscow has recently cut shipments of oil to Mongolia and raised prices, adding to the sense of urgency.
A number of oil companies, including Shell and Amoco, have expressed interest in starting explorations in Mongolia.
Prospects for finding at least enough oil to meet the country's needs are seen as good, according to a report by Exploration Associates International of Houston, which made a geological survey for the Government, in Ulan Bator.
Another source of concern is the country's crushing debt of 9 billion rubles to the Soviet Union. Government officials say it cannot be repaid, and have asked Moscow to write it off. Moscow has offered to postpone scheduled payments for 10 years on an interest-free basis.
As there is no internationally recognized value for the ruble, the two governments are arguing over what the debt is worth in hard currency. Moscow values the ruble for purposes of the debt at $1.75, making 9 billion rubles worth about $16 billion. Ulan Bator places the total debt closer to $1 billion.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Public Opinion;
Poll Finds Deep Backing While Optimism Fades

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
The American public's initial soaring optimism about the war against Iraq has flattened a little, but support for the war remains broad and President Bush's approval rating continues to stand at a record level, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
Last Thursday, the day after the bombing began with little apparent Iraqi response, 40 percent of the public said they thought the war would be over in a few weeks. By Sunday only half as many held that view. There was a smaller decline in the percentage who said the war was going "very well" for the United States. 
 But approval of how Mr. Bush is handling the Presidency stood at 86 percent in Thursday's polling, and on Sunday it was at a statistically equivalent 84 percent. The 79 percent who said Thursday that the United States was right to attack was about equal to the 76 percent who said so on Sunday. Before the war, the country was evenly split between attacking and waiting for the economic sanctions to have more impact. The margins of sampling error were plus or minus four percentage points for the 544 people interviewed Thursday and three percentage points for the 867 interviewed Sunday.
The four-day telephone survey of 3,002 adults nationwide began the night after the first attacks on Iraq, and was designed to measure day-to-day shifts in opinion. A companion survey of 550 adults examined the views of those who opposed warfare before it began and shifted to support it once the bombs started falling. Those switchers appeared to expect an easier war than they once had and to have started paying more attention to the issue once war began.
 
'Something Needed to Be Done'
Asked to explain why they shifted, the switchers also indicated that their patience, like Mr. Bush's, had been exhausted. Michelle Fabiano, a 23-year-old teacher in Glasco, N.Y., said: "I just thought it got to a point where something needed to be done. So much was invested -- our troops, other countries.' "
Wallace Anderson, a 71-year-old retired civil servant and World War II veteran from San Antonio, said: "If you're going to have a war, go ahead and have it. In World War II they didn't mess around."
While the poll found that support for war, rather than continued reliance on economic sanctions, had increased sharply in all population groups since the weekend before the attack, some major differences remained.
Only 47 percent of blacks said the United States was right to start military action, and 43 percent said it should have tried sanctions longer. Among whites, 80 percent favored war and 16 percent preferred sanctions. That gap was about as wide as the prewar gap, when 52 percent of whites and 23 percent of blacks favored military action if Iraq was not out of Kuwait by Jan. 15.
Differences between men and women narrowed. Before the war, 56 percent of men and 40 percent of women said they favored force after Jan. 15. Among the 3,002 surveyed after war began, 81 percent of men and 70 percent of women said the country was right to attack.
 
Record Approval
 Approval of Mr. Bush's handling of his job went from 66 percent the weekend before the war to 84 percent for the four-day survey, reaching the mark that the Gallup Poll recorded for President Franklin D. Roosevelt just after Pearl Harbor.
The phenomenon of Presidents gaining public approval when deeply involved in foreign crises has a long history, but Mr. Bush's gain was one of the two sharpest ever measured, comparable to the 16 percentage points that President Richard M. Nixon gained in 1973 when the Vietnam peace accords were signed.
President John F. Kennedy gained 13 points from the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. President Lyndon B. Johnson's approval rating went up 8 points after the bombing of Hanoi in 1966.
But other events have produced smaller changes. President Ronald Reagan's bombing of Libya in 1986 was popular, but his approval rating only went from 64 to 70 percent, and Mr. Bush's invasion of Panama in 1989 won him a gain of 9 percentage points.
Some of those previous gains dissipated quickly, while others lasted many months. The poll could not offer any clues about the durability of Mr. Bush's gains, but even if bad news from the front spurred a quick decline, the gain thus far is immense.
 
Good View of State of Nation
 The war has also produced a sharp rise in the general view of the state of the nation, as measured by one question that Republican poll takers favor. When those polled were asked if they thought things in this country were going in the "right direction" or were "off on the wrong track," 57 percent said "right direction" and 31 percent said "wrong track." The last time any poll found as big a majority saying the country was going in the right direction was in January 1985, when President Reagan's second term was beginning. A Washington Post/ ABC News Poll at the time found 59 percent taking that view.
Other major findings from the latest survey were that 77 percent of the public said they were "proud" of the United States role in the Persian Gulf and that 81 percent said the United States should not just force Iraq out of Kuwait, but also "see to it that Saddam Hussein is forced from power."
In a question that was asked only on Sunday, 47 percent said they thought the "United States military is holding back information about mistakes and setbacks in the Persian Gulf," while 45 percent said they believed that the military was providing an "accurate account."
 
How the Polls Were Taken
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 17 to 20 with 3,002 adults throughout the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The survey consisted of four independent dai8ly samples, with 544 interviews on Thursday, 683 on Friday, 908 onSaturday and 867 on Sunday.
 In a separate poll, The Times and CBS News also conducted re-interviews with a panel of 550 adults from Jan. 17 to 19. This group amounted to 82 percent of 674 people who had been interviewed Jan. 5-7, before the war in the Persian Gulf began.
 The margin of sampling error for the sample of 3,002 was plus or minus two percentage points. For each of the four daily samples and for the panel re-interviews it was plus or minus three to four percentage points.

HEADLINE: Statement of the Group of 7

 BODY:
Following is the statement issued yesterday by the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven after their meeting in New York:
 The finance ministers and central bank governors of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States met on Jan. 20 and 21, 1991, in New York City for an exchange of views on current international economic and financial issues. The managing director of the I.M.F. participated in the multilateral surveillance discussions.
The ministers and governors reviewed their economic policies and prospects and reaffirmed their support for economic policy coordination at this critical time.
They noted that although growth in all their economies had slowed, expansion of the world economy continues, and the pace of activity could be expected to pick up later this year.
They noted that growth remains particularly strong in Germany and Japan.
Implementation of sound fiscal policies, combined with stability oriented monetary policies, should create conditions favorable to lower global interest rates and a stronger world economy. They also stressed the importance of a timely and successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
The ministers and governors also discussed the situation in global financial markets in light of uncertainties arising from the gulf war and developments in the Soviet Union. They agreed to strengthen cooperation and to monitor developments in exchange markets.
The ministers and governors are prepared to respond as appropriate to maintain stability in international financial markets.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Linking a Bond's Quality and Yield

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IN the decline of long-term interest rates last week on the surge of optimism that followed initial successes in Iraq, lower-quality bonds did less well than higher-quality issues.
The result is wider spreads between yields on high- and lower-quality bonds, reflecting both nervousness over the Middle East and concern over recession at home. 
 The widening spreads are reflected in both the corporate and municipal markets, but some analysts say that considering the recession, the spreads remain narrow and could grow.
"The prevalent theme in the corporate-bond market seems to be that quality spreads have widened and there are good values," said Douglas Langley, a vice president of Stone & McCarthy, a Princeton, N.J., research firm. But he cautioned that it was still early to be looking for values in lower-rated corporates because of significant risk that spreads will widen further.
Mr. Longley pointed to the spread between the average yield on corporate industrial issues rated Aaa or Aa by Moody's, the highest ratings, compared with those rated A or BAA, the next levels down but still above "junk bond" status. On Jan. 14, before the bombing of Iraq, the average yield for the better-rated issues was 9.75 percent, compared with 9.98 percent for the slightly lower-rated bonds, a spread of 23 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
But by Friday, the better-quality issues had seen their yields decline to 9.48 percent while the yield on poorer-quality issues slipped to 9.85 percent, a spread of 38 basis points.
Rising spreads between high-quality and lower-quality corporate bonds generally imply a flight to safety, Mr. Langley noted, and such increases are typical in a recession.
Using a different set of monthly figures, he calculated the movements in rates in each of the last seven recessions, dating to 1953. In general, rates fell in the recessions, with Treasury rates performing better than corporates, and high-quality corporates doing better than lower-quality ones.
That has been the case this time as well. Assuming that the recession began in August, and using monthly average yields, Mr. Longley found that the spread between Aaa and Baa corporate bonds, as rated by Moody's, had risen 38 percent by December, compared with a rise of 46 percent in the 1981-82 recession.
Yield spreads have also started to widen in the tax-exempt municipal-bond market, but relatively modestly. David J. Madigan, a municipal bond strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the difference in yields between relatively low-rated state generalobligation bonds -- those rated BBB by Standard & Poor's -- and those with the top rating of AAA, was now 65 basis points, up from about 50 basis points at the end of last year.
While that spread is much larger than the narrow 15-point spread that prevailed last April, it is relatively low by historical standards, especially given the recession, and Mr. Madigan said he thought the spread could increase.
It appears that many investors still think that risk of default is something that affects only corporate junk bonds -- those rated less than Baa or BBB -- and is less likely to affect either investment-quality corporates or general-obligation municipal bonds.
A sign of that confidence is that general-obligation bonds issued by Philadelphia now are quoted at yields of 9 percent to 9.10 percent, down from around 10 percent at the peak of concern about the city's suspect financial condition.
"Nobody really believes that the State of Pennsylvania will let Philadelphia fail," said Mr. Madigan, pointing to the bailout of New York City 15 years ago as a precedent.
James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, said the failure of municipal spreads to widen much so far might reflect that many investors in the municipal market have not focused on questions of credit quality.
"People are quite single-minded in the municipal bond market," he said. "They want not to pay taxes, and I don't think they think about much else."
That, of course, could change if there is a default by Philadelphia or any other large issuer.

HEADLINE: Group of 7 Backs Action on Markets

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
The chief economic policy makers of the United States' six main industrial partners expressed support yesterday for the nation's war effort and promised to take steps to stabilize the international financial markets if the Persian Gulf war caused damaging fluctuations.
"From every single one of the other six ministers, there was appreciation of the job the allies have done in the gulf," said the United States Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady. He spoke after a daylong meeting in New York City of the finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven countries. 
 A communique issued after the meeting stated that the ministers and governors were "prepared to respond as appropriate to maintain stability in international financial markets."
 
Issue of Soviet Union
 The communique dealt with developments in the Soviet Union only in passing. But ministers said after the meeting that the discussions had involved what Norman Lamont, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, called in a news conference "very strong condemnation indeed" of Moscow's military intervention this month in Lithuania and Latvia.
In addition to the United States and Britain, the Group of Seven countries are Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
Outside the main meeting, held at the Stanhope Hotel on Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Americans continued one-on-one discussions with Japanese and German officials to persuade them to give more money to support the war. Last year, the Japanese pledged $4 billion and the Germans about $3 billion. The United States and Britain are insisting on larger sums this year.
Of the seven countries, only Japan and Germany do not have troops in the Persian Gulf region.
Mr. Brady said the Japanese would announce a substantial contribution soon. On Friday, Japan responded to the outbreak of the war with a new pledge of financial aid but did not give a precise figure.
The Associated Press yesterday morning quoted a senior Foreign Ministry official as saying that the Japanese intended to give $10 billion in additional assistance to the allied coalition in the gulf.
Negotiations with the Germans seemed to be going more slowly, officials said. The German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, told reporters after having breakfast with Mr. Brady that the Germans needed a fuller accounting from the Americans of how much money was needed before they made a commitment.
Further negotiation is expected between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German Foreign Minister.
The communique indicated that the ministers and central bankers also discussed fiscal and monetary policies and international trade. It stated that the officials expected "the pace of activity" in the world economy "to pick up later this year."
The United States, Britain and Canada are in recession; the economies of France and Italy are growing little if at all, but the economies of Japan and Germany are still strong.
Although the discussions involved a number of topics, the focus was clearly on the war and the economic issues growing out of it.
The basic message the officials hoped to leave, Mr. Brady said, was that "the telephones will remain open" and that the various governments stood ready to step in if action became necessary to tamp down market volatility, including a plunge in the value of the dollar.
He noted that the dollar had fallen somewhat since the war began but said it was not worrisome so far. "If it does take unusual jumps and turns, we're ready to do something about it," he added.
Asked whether measures were still in the cards to bring the Soviets into the world economy by giving them special status at the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Lamont said, "Any question of any relationship with the I.M.F. would have to be considered very cautiously and is not on the agenda at the moment."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Iraq;
CAPTURED AIRMEN MOVED TO TARGETS

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The Iraqi military announced today that it had dispersed captured allied airmen "among scientific and economic targets, as well as among other selected targets."
The Iraqi statement indicated that the captured pilots were being used as so-called human shields to deter allied air attacks. 
 It would not be the first time that Iraq had used such a strategy. After the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, thousands of foreigners were prevented from leaving Iraq. Some were held at military bases and strategic sites before the last were freed in December.
 
'Brutal Treatment' Angers Bush
 The announcement, a day after Iraqi television broadcast interviews with seven captured allied pilots, provoked a stinging response from President Bush. The President condemned the "brutal treatment" of the prisoners and said it would not alter American strategy in the war. [Page A10.]
In its announcement, the Iraqi military denounced the first five days of allied bombing as deadly to civilians and "devoid of the minimum human standards." It added, "Because of this rocketing, it was decided to disperse the more than 20 prisoners of war to civilian, economic, education and other targets."
Iraq's assertion that it now holds more than 20 prisoners of war is its higest yet. The Pentagon has so far listed 21 allied servicemen as missing in action, 12 of them Americans.
There is no indication yet that the captured pilots have been placed at military targets. If carried out, such a move would contravene Article 23 of the Third Geneva Convention on war prisoners, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.
The convention says prisoners may not "at any time be sent to, or detained in, areas where he may be exposed to the fire of the combat zone, nor may his presence be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations."
 
Captives Paraded in Baghdad
 On Sunday, the Iraqi television broadcast interviews with seven men identified as allied pilots, some of whom were bruised and cut. There was also footage of captives being paraded through Baghdad. Portions of that television footage were aired today in the West. President Bush's response came after he had seen the film.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had not been permitted to visit the prisoners. A spokesman said parading prisoners in public was also a violation of the Geneva conventions.
The Baghdad Radio quoted a military spokesman today as saying that the decision to disperse the prisoners took effect last night.
In a reference to the five-day aerial onslaught against Iraq and occupied Kuwait by the United States and its allies, the spokesman said: "Since the aggression has been devoted until now to bombarding civilians and economic and scientific targets within the cities, this has harmed civilians in terms of martyred and wounded.
"As one of the methods that should be adopted," the spokesman continued, "it has been decided to distribute the captured pilots, numbering more than 20 prisoners, among scientific and economic targets, as well as among other selected targets. This took effect as of the night of 20 and 21 January, 1991."
 
Iraq Announces Missile Damage
 As it gave its account of Sunday's Iraqi missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, which the allies say were thwarted by Patriot ground-to-air missiles, Iraq said in a communique that the strike "inflicted significant losses on enemy positions, men, weapons and equipment." The communique raised Baghdad's tally of downed allied aircraft to 160. The United States and its allies acknowledge losing 15 planes.
Baghdad's supporters say President Saddam Hussein's strategy has been to absorb the huge first strike by allied missiles and warplanes in preparation for an eventual land war. The Iraqi leader said on Sunday that he had deployed only a fraction of his forces.
A commentary on Baghdad Radio today claimed victory for President Hussein "in the first round of the great showdown of the mother of all battles" by denying President Bush a quick breakthrough.
 
A Statement on Defenses
 "Bush's evil dreams have been shattered and scattered in the air together with the wreck of his aircraft and missiles," the commentary said. "Bush's wager on a swift and decisive battle was shattered together with his black dreams."
Since allied commanders acknowledge that Iraq has survived the first five days of the war with its air force largely intact in underground bunkers and its occupying force in Kuwait dug in behind formidable defenses, the intent of such commentaries is apparently to persuade Iraqis and Iraq's Arab supporters that the country is not defenseless against the massive allied onslaught.
Moreover, some Arab diplomats say, the longer President Hussein holds out, the greater his stature will increase in the Arabic-speaking world. "Even in the Arab countries supporting America, like Egypt and Syria, you can hear people on the street saying, 'Hey, this guy's got something,' " a diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The few reports trickling out of Baghdad suggest that the allied bombardment has sent residents fleeing from the city.
 
Citizens Stay Put
 One of the latest accounts came from a Reuters news agency photographer, Patrick de Noirmont, who said he and two colleagues were beaten by Iraqi soldiers as they sought to flee the capital in a taxi. In an article written here after the photographers were freed and allowed to leave for Jordan, Mr. de Noirmont described Baghdad as "a ghost town of empty streets and shuttered shops."
Relief officials in Jordan anticipate a large influx of refugees from the war, but some say they believe that the intensity of the bombardment and the absence of communication from Baghdad may be persuading many to remain in basements and bomb shelters.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Bombers;
Giant B-52 Grows Old Virulently

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
More than 30 years after the lumbering aircraft first rolled off the production line and 18 years after they tramautized Hanoi in the Christmas raids of 1972, Air Force B-52 bombers are hammering targets throughout Iraq and Kuwait.
One of the oldest and by far the biggest combat plane flying against the Iraqis, the B-52 has been so extensively remodeled since its Vietnam days, to bolster its accuracy and make it safer from enemy attack, that little more than its airframe and hulking silhouette remain the same. 
 "It's like you took a 1959 Ford Fairlane with the original engine and stuff," said Maj. Dick Cole of the Air Force in a telephone interview from the Pentagon, "and you put in a new stereo and maybe a trip computer and some other electronic wizardry. And maybe you've done this two or three times."
Of the 744 B-52's that were built between 1955 and 1963, all but 247 have been retired, including the "D" models which were the most widely used in Vietnam. Those earlier versions of the bomber carried more than twice the bomb loads of the "G" models that are now attacking in the Persian Gulf. In the newest reconfiguration much of the space that was once used to hold bombs now accommodates banks of computers that have increased bombing precision.
 
A Terrifying Wallop
 Even with half their old bomb capacity, the surviving B-52's deliver the biggest and perhaps most terrifying wallop in the American air arsenal. They operate equally well during the day or night, the Air Force says, and are immune to most variations in weather.
Even the Vietnam era B-52's were renowned for the accuracy of their bomb attacks. Miles above the targets and barely able to distinguish the flash of their exploding bombs, the crews had no sensation of the havoc erupting on the ground. Modern computers, the Air Force says, have only reinforced the accuracy.
A B-52G can carry 51 bombs of either 500 or 750 pounds. Using the 500-pound bomb, the total payload is only 1,000 pounds more than the F15-E fighter-bomber.
But tactics play a big part in the effectiveness of the B-52. The F15-E and other fighter-bombers are designed to peel off one at a time and dive at their targets, while B-52's typically attack in formations of three, unleashing all their bombs at once from altitudes of six or seven miles and blasting a swath of up to a half mile wide and perhaps a mile long.
 
Enemy Can't See or Hear It
 "You turn the target into something that looks like a moonscape," said Major Cole, a former B-52 crew member.
Flying at high altitude, he said, the B-52's "can't be seen or heard until the bombs start falling and then it's like rolling thunder.
"It's a great psychological effect," Major Cole said. "You scare the hell out of them."
The B-52, "has got a mystique about it," said Maj. Gen. John L. Borling, deputy chief of operations at the United States Strategic Air Command Headquarters in Omaha. "Because of its destructive power it has an ethos, a sense of awesomeness."
 
Prehistoric-Looking Creature
 The plane carries a crew of six and is three or four times bigger than other American fighting aircraft. Its huge wings, spanning more than 60 yards, have wheels near the tips to prevent them from scraping the ground. They droop under the weight of eight jet engines and literally seem to flap slowly as the prehistoric-looking creature bounds down the runway, struggling to fly.
The B-52's operating in the current crisis are based several hours away from the combat zone, as they were during the Vietnam War, to protect them and their ground crews from hostile fire on the ground.
In the Christmas bombing of Hanoi, great sections of the city were demolished. At that time General Borling, whose fighter had been shot down, was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He recalls the earth shuddering as the B-52's delivered their bombs.
In South Vietnam, B-52's were often dispatched against concentrations of North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops. Survivors were sometimes found dazed, staggering and bloody. Many defectors said fear of the B-52's had caused them to give up.
 
The B-52 Bomber: Still Potent
 
HISTORY
 
The heavy bomber was initially planned as a turboprop plan in 1948, but was built as a turbo jet after improvements in jet engines' fuel economy. By 1951, the plane was being designed to carry up to four nuclear bombs at high altitudes for a range of 7,000 miles, or long enough to fly from the continental U.S. to the Soviet Union without refueling.
 The first B-52 was delivered on June 29, 1955, the last was delivered on Oct. 23, 1963; the U.S. never sold the plane to other nations.
 The 744 B-52's purchased from Boeing between 1955 and 1963 averaged a little more than $8 million per plane ($35.3 million in 1990 dollars).
 The price of improvement made since the 1960's has cost several times the original price of the planes.
 
PAYLOAD
 
The B-52G, themodel being used in the Gulf War, can carry up to 51 gravity (dumb) bombs of 500 or 750 pounds apiece internally and 12 smart missiles externally.
 
IMPROVEMENTS SINCE ORIGINAL DESIGN
 
Originally designed to fly 5,000 hours before structural fatigue, most B-52's are now expected to achieve at least 15,000 hours. It is estimated that the planes could be used in active duty until 2035, 80 years after the first delivery.
 In the mid 1960's the wings and fuselages were reinforced and corroding metals were replaced with new alloys. The reinforced plane can now fly at lower altitudes. The range of the B-52G was increased to 7,500 miles without refueling.
 The electronics on the B-52 have beenupdated numerous times. Recent improvement include equipment enabling the planes to communicate with Air Force satellites, electro-optical systems to provide quidance inlow-level flights at night or in bad weather and radar-jammers and lasers used to guide smart weapons to targets.

HEADLINE: Roadblocks to Equivalency Exam Deny Many a Chance for Success

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
For thousands of New York City residents with no high school degree, passing the equivalency test is the key to getting a job, getting off welfare or pursuing vocational or college studies. But educators who prepare people throughout the city for the test say the route is increasingly obstructed by delays and bureaucratic complications that put lives on hold for months or more.
Most commonly, the snag comes when people are ready to take the test, the General Educational Development, or G.E.D., exam, which is given nationally. After applying for seats at the exam they often must wait as long as six to eight months for reservations.
 
'An Absurd Situation'
 A state education official who is charged with administering the test contends that the concern is being overstated, since students unable to take the test at a site that is too crowded can find other places that offer availability. But local officials, students and others familiar with the test argue that the problem is more severe: an unresponsive bureaucracy that refuses to address a shortage of slots. 
 "It is an absurd situation," John Casey, director of the Mayor's Office of Adult Literacy, said recently. "We have thousands of people completing preparation programs with the expectation that they can sit for the test and then go on and do whatever they want, go to a university, get a job. Now they are being asked to wait for months."
Such complaints are heard from a number of groups. They range from Promesa, a drug-rehabilitation program in the Bronx, to the Henry Street Settlement House in lower Manhattan, from the St. John the Baptist Parish Center in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn to District 65 of the United Auto Workers and the city's Human Resources Administration.
To a lesser degree, the complaints expressed in New York City have been voiced elsewhere, said Douglas Whitney, director of the G.E.D. testing service of the American Council on Education, which prepares the test given in all states.
"It appears to be one of the more serious problem locations, but there are problems elsewhere," he said in a telephone interview last night.
Noting that about half the states have no pre-registration process but offer the test on a walk-in basis, he said, "There are complaints about how long it takes to register in states with registration, even in those where the waiting period is much shorter than in New York, say four to six weeks."
For an individual student, the consequences of waiting months for the test, while skills grow rusty and confidence ebbs, can be severe. Educators say that delay can diminish the chances of passing, and failure can mean continued dependence on welfare. What impact that has on a city hoping to reduce its welfare and unemployment rolls is incalculable, for no one knows how many people fall by the wayside.
One of those who waited for six months before getting notification of a test date was Julia Medina, a single mother of five from the Red Hook section of Brooklyn who is on public assistance. "I was ready to take it in June when everything was fresh in my mind," said Miss Medina, who attended school only through the seventh grade but studied for three years at the Carroll Gardens Neighborhood Women's Adult Literacy Center.
 
A Missed Opportunity
 An admission card for the exam arrived on Dec. 1. It told her to report to Sheepshead Bay High School on Dec. 5 for the seven-and-a-half-hour test, which is given over two days. "With so few days' notice, I just couldn't get anyone to stay with my children, so I didn't take it," she said. "I was very upset. I have been waiting so long."
Miss Medina, 37 years old, who dropped out of school 23 years ago after becoming pregnant through rape, is hoping to enroll in a nursing program at New York City Technical College in Brooklyn. She cannot do that without her equivalency diploma.
Shirley Frederick, 30, another welfare mother in the group, who hopes to become a nurse, is in similar straits. "It's hard to focus on paper, hard to do homework after all these years," she said. "I've had the idea to give up, but when I watch my three kids I say I must keep going even when the door is slammed in my face." Ms. Frederick finally got a test date -- with two days' notice -- this month after waiting since spring. She was turned away when she arrived five minutes late because of a baby-sitting problem.
Students and administrators of G.E.D. courses report other problems, including difficulty getting in touch with people who set up the test appointments and a wait of 8 to 10 weeks for test results. In addition, allegations have been made that preferential treatment in the distribution of test seats is given to the Board of Education and the City University of New York, the largest providers of preparation classes in the city, leaving smaller groups scrambling for what remains.
But the officials of both the board and CUNY, which are able to reserve blocks of seats for the tests, say they also encounter difficulties securing enough spaces.
The exams are offered at five schools in Manhattan, three in Queens, four in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn and one on Staten Island, and though some sites have been closed or relocated, there has been no overall decrease in the city in the last few years.
 
Backlog of Applications
 Esteban Colon, education manager for Promesa, has stopped sending applications for his students to the schools in the Bronx. "Waiting lists are too long," he said. "If you apply in October, you don't get in until April." Instead, he said he sends those willing to travel to the High School for the Humanities, at 351 West 18th Street in Manhattan, where he has had better luck.
But Joel Rubin, the chief examiner there, has a huge backlog of applications. "At this point, I should be filled till April and am actually booked till the second week of July," he said.
Mr. Rubin, who is a full-time school teacher -- he would not say where for fear of being deluged with phone calls about the test -- said 160 people can be accommodated at each test at his site. In most sites, the test is given about once a month. But at the High School for the Humanities it is offered every week and during the summer, making it the most popular place.
Mr. Rubin files applications and responds to them only as vacancies arise, a practice he agreed could lead people to think they were being ignored. "We don't send postcards until two to three weeks before people are actually tested," he said. "So there is no notification going to people now telling them they must wait till July."
 
Charges Are Denied
 Carolyn Byrne, director of the state Department of Education's division of testing, the agency responsible for the exam in New York, said there was no basis for any of the charges.
"We test 85,000 people a year statewide," she said. "Can you imagine any program that touches 85,000 people that doesn't have some malcontents? I think we are running the program extremely well. There is no problem."
But Mr. Casey of the Mayor's Office of Adult Literacy said the problem was largely caused by "a citywide shortage of testing slots."
Ms. Byrne countered that there were more than enough spaces and that they were offered often enough at 71 sites in schools and other places across the state. Her department has an annual budget of $800,000 for the test.
"I think that what we have here in terms of sites and schedules is very realistic," she said. "There is no evidence that people who want to take the test over a particular period of time are not able to. But as far as I can judge by talking to examiners in every borough, seats are going empty."
Each of those sites is supervised by a chief examiner, who is hired as an independent contractor through the city's Board of Education. The examiners, typically principals, teachers or guidance counselors, have a great deal of autonomy. They schedule the exams, subject to state approval, and mail out the admission cards. They determine which applicants take the test on which date. They also choose the proctors and other assistants.
 
Cultivating Test Administrators
 Directors of G.E.D. programs say they are forced to be manipulative, cultivating site administrators or Board of Education staff members assigned to procure and allocate the slots for the board.
"You need to develop a relationship with a testing center, so that your students can have some priority," said Virginia Kwarta, executive director of the Steps/Basic Skills Academy, a program in Harlem. "We have a part-time employee who proctors at G.E.D. exams, so she is able to make arrangements. We have never had to wait more than a month."
Ms. Byrne contended that if students were flexible about where they took the test, they would have few difficulties. She ticked off a list of schools that ordinarily have vacancies, among them Christopher Columbus High School in the Morris Park section of the Bronx, Harry Van Arsdale High School in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn and Adam Clayton Powell Junior High School in Harlem.
Since November 1989, Angela Surkis, coordinator of the Carroll Gardens Center's G.E.D. program, has kept a diary of the problems she says she has had trying to get test spaces. She and her colleague, Carmel Rosa, the center's executive director, say their students have been shut out of several sites. They attribute the problem to the number of seats allocated to the Board of Education and CUNY.
Ms. Rosa said they had no problems in the past, when a Board of Education instructor who taught unrelated classes at the center intervened.
"Then about a year and a half ago, the board said, 'You can't have your students tested through our program anymore,' " Ms. Rosa recalled, "probably because we were beginning to have more than one or two students who were ready, and that's when our nightmare began."
But officials of both the board and CUNY said that they, too, were experiencing delays.
"How many slots we reserve is negotiated with the site administrator," said Myra Baum, assistant coordinator in the Board of Education Office of Adult and Continuing Education. "We are the largest program in the city, but we only use a small portion of the slots, say 20 percent. So at any one test site, we might have from 25 to 50 seats."
For her students, Ms. Surkis said: "Waiting is terrible. We have to keep them prepared psychologically and keep their skills up for the next six months. But the people we teach have family situations and lives that are so chaotic it is impossible for us to predict where they will be in six months."
In the view of Toby Emmer, director of the education program of District 65 of the United Auto Workers, such hurdles convey a tough message. "People are told, 'Work hard, study hard and you'll get ahead,' " she said. "But the message has become 'You'll be lost in the morass of bureaucracy.' "

HEADLINE: Mexican Films Abroad

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 21

 BODY:
By the accounting of any major Hollywood production, the movie set built in an old electrical generating station here was scarcely worth a budgetary footnote. A creative paint job substitutes for expensive stage props, and a lump of smoking coal took the place of elaborate special effects.
But to the director Arturo Ripstein and his small team of skilled local film makers, the joint American-Mexican production of his moody new project, "Woman of the Port," now in final editing, is nevertheless a heartening step toward new commercial possibilities for Mexico's 50-year-old film industry. 
 In a country long dominated by official film tastes or by giant United States film companies seeking good locations and cheap labor, Mr. Ripstein's new film is the product of a rare pairing of independent American and Mexican production companies as equals.
Intended to grant unhindered artistic freedom to Mr. Ripstein, one of Mexico's best-known and most idiosyncratic directors, the production is the kind of sophisticated intellectual project that has traditionally characterized the small world of Mexican art films.
 
Seeking a Wider Audience
 But as the avowedly commercial project of private producers from each side of the border, the film is also geared to reach beyond Mexico's limited moviegoing public and win distribution to a broad international audience, from New York to Berlin.
"It is very difficult to make films here because once it is made, nothing happens to it; it is just put on a shelf," said Mr. Ripstein, whose earlier work was honored last month with a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. "But with this kind of production, you know that they will try to take care of your film -- and try to make it available to the largest possible audience."
Like other films by Mr. Ripstein, who began his career as an assistant and protege of the renowned Spanish director Luis Bunuel, "Woman of the Port" is an impressionistic emotional drama far removed from the fast, plot-oriented action films that dominate the box office in Mexico and much of the world.
Written by Mr. Ripstein's longtime film collaborator and wife, Paz Alicia Garciadiego, based on a short story by Guy de Maupassant, the screenplay centers on a case of unknowing incest between a sailor and a young port-town prostitute who turns out to be his daughter, conceived in another bordello encounter many years before.
 
Thriving but Isolated Industry
 That seamy story line and its sometimes surreal treatment are hardly the stuff of mainstream movies. But Mr. Ripstein's directorial skills, and the relative success of his earlier films, including "Love Lies," convinced executives of an independent American film company, Chariot 7 Productions , that "Woman of the Port" could be a path-breaking Mexican entrant into the international art-film market.
"We are not doing this to lose money," said Allen Persselin, one of two producers from Chariot 7 who are overseeing the film, which is to have a final budget of $5 million to $6 million. "There has yet to be a Mexican breakaway hit, and it's due."
The cross-border compact was then sealed when Chariot 7 reached an agreement to co-produce the film with a private Mexican production company, Dos Producciones , led by a successful local television and film producer, Hugo Scherer.
Mexico's diverse landscapes and cheap, skilled labor have long made the country a favorite setting for the production of American films ranging from "Under Fire" to "Total Recall." Extensive Government subsidies and involvement in the film industry here have also fostered a thriving, if poorly marketed, Mexican film making community.
But neither arrangement has created any lasting, creative cooperation between the two countries. Film projects here of United States and other companies are concluded as abruptly as they are begun, with little direct artistic impact or involvement from the Mexican side. And Mexico's film industry has remained isolated, without the effective distribution and technical quality that could give it true international reach.
 
2 Arts in Collaboration
 With the co-production arrangement, the producers of "Woman of the Port" hope to combine United States marketing and technical expertise with Mexico's artistic best to yield a strong hybrid capable of competing in the world art film market.
The film is being made entirely in Spanish, with an all-Mexican cast and crew, and will require subtitles for distribution in non-Spanish-speaking countries. But the film shot each day was sent to Los Angeles for high-quality processing, and all of the post-production and distribution of the film is being handled by laboratories and marketing companies in the United States.
None of that unusual effort has had much immediate impact on Mr. Ripstein's style of working, which has paired the art of making films with the art of stretching a small budget.
On a chilly day on the set last month, a few plastic buckets slowly dripping water from overhead, some smoke and a handful of glaring Christmas lights combined to create a vivid waterfront bordello scene that was high in atmosphere and low in cost. It is the kind of bare-bones film making that Mr. Ripstein and the film's producers say they hope will eventually be a matter of artistic choice rather than of economic necessity.
"Success means doing the film you want to do, the film you dream of," Mr. Ripstein said, relaxing in his director's chair with a cup of coffee during a lull on the set. "It means you have the small liberty of doing what you wish."

Conversations With a Clown
By Michael Welzenbach
210 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press . $19.95.
 Michael Welzenbach's first novel, "Conversations With a Clown," begins with a clever premise: In the year 1999, a jaded art critic named Corry Peters meets an elderly man who claims to be Pierrot, the famous white-face clown of commedia dell'arte. Pierrot takes the critic on a guided tour through the past, introducing him to painters like Picasso, Modigliani, Goya and Watteau. In the process, Peters receives a lesson in art history and esthetics, a lesson that will make him reconsider his pessimistic view of art at the end of the millennium. 
 As depicted by Mr. Welzenbach, who is an art critic himself, Pierrot emerges as a cranky, garrulous pedant. He is continually launching into long-winded speeches about the creative process and reminiscing about famous artists he has known. Like all Pierrots, he is locked in the famous eternal triangle, battling the brutish Harlequin for the affections of the beautiful but elusive Columbine, but he is not the shy, love-struck simpleton traditionally associated with commedia dell'arte. Rather, this Pierrot is a fiercely opinionated fellow with a quick temper and an even quicker tongue.
 He loves to gorge himself on junk food and he seems addicted to alcohol and cigars. He lives on Manhattan's Lower East Side in a grungy apartment crammed with portraits of himself done by well-known artists. He says he is approximately 500 years old.
 When he first meets Pierrot, Corry Peters is despairing about a piece he has to write for a newspaper about the state of modern art. Peters says he is sick of the politics and commercialism of the art scene, fed up with post-modernist high jinks and deconstructivist criticism, and dismayed by contemporary artists' self-indulgence and lack of craft.
 "I've thought for some time now," he says, "that certain values have gotten lost; the belief in art for it's own sake, for example. It's almost as if, since the last efforts of pure abstraction -- Minimalism -- in the 70's, there's been a purely cynical, purely political approach to making art. And I'm not sure I can honestly say why this has happened, but I can say that I don't particularly like it, and that I don't see much of a future for painting."
 In response to this gloomy assessment, Pierrot declares that "the urge to make art is as old as mankind" and "it will continue, no matter what the current state of affairs politically or economically." Things are cyclical, he argues, and barren periods will be followed by periods of rebirth and inspiration. He proceeds to regale Peters with some stories about his encounters with Goya and Modigliani, then takes him on a trip back in time to visit the Japanese painter Hokusai.
 When Mr. Welzenbach focuses on Pierrot's adventures in the art world and his continuing battles with Harlequin, the results are both entertaining and informative. He offers interesting, gossipy theories about the creation of several masterpieces, and he provides amusing asides about Pierrot's relationship with individual painters.
 Unfortunately, he never makes the most of his central premise. The pervasive influence that Pierrot and other commedia dell'arte characters have exerted on the modernist imagination (as delineated in a recent study by Martin Green and John Swan called "The Triumph of Pierrot") is completely neglected: the clown's effect on such painters as Georges Rouault and David Hockney is ignored, as is his effect on such masters of film as Chaplin, Keaton, Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman.
 In other respects as well, "Conversations With a Clown" manages to disappoint. Although the book is set in 1999 with the purpose of satirizing developments in the art world, Mr. Welzenbach's portrayal of that period lacks imagination and bite. The world he has created seems like a very tired extrapolation of the art world today, and his jokes about the likes of Jeff Koons and Andy Warhol also feel overly familiar.
 To make matters worse, Pierrot's statements about art are alternately as pompous as a graduate school paper and as trite as a greeting card message. He goes on and on about the importance of magic in creativity, the dialectic between reality and imagination, the connection between "the sublime and the absurd."
 "If you want to see the purest and most compelling form of magic," he tells Peters, "watch a bud develop on the twig of a tree in spring. Spend a few weeks just watching, until it unfolds completely into a bright new leaf, pulsing with life. Or watch a baby being born."
 "It takes courage," he adds, "to be an artist, my friend; to look at reality clearly; to form one's own opinions. To make magic."
 Elsewhere, he declares: "A painting, in terms of the many moments in which it can be beheld and contemplated, is not a fleeting thing. It is, for better or for worse, a dual entity: an image on the one hand and an object on the other. 'Art' occurs when a dialectic is provoked between what an object is and what it signifies."
 Such statements reveal that Mr. Welzenbach's Pierrot is neither a real clown nor an inspired scholar of art. In the end, he is simply a rank sentimentalist and a well-intentioned bore.

HEADLINE: Big Game Revealing a City's Changes

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla.

 BODY:
Henry Carley lives on the west side of town, only a couple of miles from Tampa Stadium. The last time the Super Bowl was played there, in 1984, he felt as distant from all the hoopla as if he were 1,000 miles away, he recalls. Carley, who is president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, had no interest in being inside the stadium. He says he only wished the black community could have shared in some of the considerable profits generated by one of America's greatest sports events.
"The Super Bowl is about money," Carley said last week. "And last time we were basically onlookers."
 
Several New Events
 Things are a lot different this time around. This year, Carley is the co-chairman of one of the featured events of Super Bowl week, the Bamboleo Parade, a Saturday extravaganza with marching bands, a street festival and floats. The grand marshal of the parade will be Lee Roy Selmon, the former Tampa Bay Buccaneer. Other events will include a salute to black sports legends, a Doug Williams golf tournament and a festival in Ybor City, the historical Cuban district. 
 The 1991 Super Bowl Task Force, a group headed by two of the city's most influential white businessmen, has named two black men to head a community-relations committee. But perhaps most important, Carley said, several minority-owned businesses have won lucrative contracts from the National Football League for the game.
"There's much more involvement this time, black and white," said Carley, who is the affirmative-action officer for Hillsborough Community College. "There's been a heightened awareness. In 1984, there was not even a thought given to a black man."
Some 100,000 visitors, many of them corporate and political movers and shakers, will arrive in Tampa this week for the festivities leading up to the game Sunday. The game itself, which is televised to 750 million people around the world, is only part of an event whose impact on a city has been compared to that of a national political convention. Hotels, restaurants and other businesses are anticipating an estimated $125 million in revenues, with a total economic impact of $200 million.
"The Super Bowl introduces you to the world in a big way," said Barbara Casey, the coordinator of the Super Bowl Task Force. "You don't have to say Tampa, Florida, anymore."
The Super Bowl can also highlight a community's problems, and bring the frustrations of many of its members to the surface.
"It's more than a window into a town," said Jim Steeg, director of special events for the N.F.L. "It's a bay window."
Last month, Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, said he would stand by his recommendation to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of Tempe, Ariz., because the state does not have a holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King.
A week before the Super Bowl in Miami two years ago, the fatal shooting of a black man on a motorcycle by a Hispanic police officer in the predominantly black Overtown neighborhood set off three days of looting and torchings of buildings and cars. While the disturbances were not caused by the Super Bowl, the N.F.L. was criticized at the time for not making enough of an effort to include minority-group members in the festivities.
"I think Miami was the awakening for a lot of people," Carley said.
 
Parade of Pirates
 Here in Tampa, Super Bowl XXV brought about the cancellation of what was the biggest annual event here for 86 years: the Gasparilla Parade, a winter extravaganza that featured 500 of the city's most powerful men swaggering through the streets dressed up as gun-toting pirates.
Tampa officials made the parade part of their pitch to the National Football League for the Super Bowl. But after Tampa was awarded the 1991 Super Bowl, a racial dispute erupted over the parade, which has always been sponsored and organized by an all-white, all-male private club, Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla.
The club's top officials refused the demands of a coalition of black residents, including Carley, that the club be integrated immediately. Instead, they canceled the parade.
The Super Bowl Task Force had to scramble to put together a new parade, and Carley became the co-chairman of that effort.
Tampa has 286,000 residents, 23 percent of whom are black. One black sits on the seven-member school board, one on the seven-member County Commission and one on the seven-member City Council. There are only a handful of black executives.
Carley said the publicity over the Super Bowl and the parade may have given blacks new standing. "The Super Bowl is a window of opportunity," he said. "We need to seize the time and take advantage of it."
 
Out of 'Virgin Territory'
 In addition to meeting increased sensitivity on the part of the N.F.L. as well as the Tampa power brokers, Carley said, the black community was better organized this year to take advantage of the Super Bowl.
"We were in virgin territory in 1984," he explained. "We didn't know what to expect. A number of Tampa people, white and black, didn't do too well. But it was much more devastating for the black community because we didn't have as many resources. We don't have any large hotels -- or small ones."
David Cornwell, the director of equal employment for the N.F.L., saidthis Super Bowl represents the greatest involvement yet between minority-group firms and the N.F.L. This year the league has set up the first Super Bowl Village -- a corporate hospitality tent complex around the stadium -- and minority-group firms will be supplying the audio visuals, security and clean-up as well as selling Super Bowl souvenirs like T-shirts, coffee mugs and key chains.
"Starting with Super Bowl XXIII in Miami, we started talking about the perception that we were not responsive enough to minorities," Cornwell said. "We wanted to make sure the minority community felt excited about the Super Bowl. Super Bowl Village was a perfect opportunity to give minorities more involvement."
Leonard Levy, the owner of a printing company, is the vice chairman of the 1991 Super Bowl Task Force, and was the chairman in 1984. He said that he went to the Super Bowl in Miami two years ago with his friend Walter Baldwin, an insurance company executive who is the chairman of the 1991 group.
"Mr. Baldwin was concerned," Levy said. "He said: 'We want peace in our community. We don't want any unrest.' We decided we had to make sure we involved the black community early on. The first time nobody had really thought that much about it."
The two men formed the community-relations committee two years ago. The co-chairman is Jesse Hill, a marketing representative for an insurance company. Hill said the committee planned events like the salute to black sports legends and the festival in Ybor City.
 
Working Through Barriers
 "The local task force has been very supportive," Hill said. "However, it was not always that way. We had to work through some barriers."
Last March, Drew Pittman, a black businessman, was awarded the contract to be the distributor of Super Bowl XXV souvenirs. "This is a stepping stone," he said. "I'm doing this to help Drew Pittman make it down the road."
Another black resident of Tampa, Michael Perch, is installing all the audio visual equipment for Super Bowl Village, including 110 television monitors in the corporate tents. Perch said the Super Bowl contract has given him access and credentials he never had before.
"We're not just another audio visual services company anymore," he said. "Now we're the company that did the Super Bowl. We've gotten calls from corporations in the area who are now interested in doing business with us. There's an old boy network operating here and in a lot of other cities. We want to get more involved, and the Super Bowl has helped the process along."
This year, for the first time, Henry Carley was offered a chance to buy Super Bowl tickets, at $150 apiece. He declined. He will be watching the game on television, just as he did in 1984.
"I have no false illusions about the Super Bowl curing the socioeconomic needs of the minority community in Tampa," he said. "It all depends on what we do with it. We have to take in stride and move on."

HEADLINE: New York City Shouldn't Set Up a Center to Buy Recyclables

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Facing the Recycling Facts" (editorial, Jan. 3) applauds Stephen Polan, the New York City Sanitation Commissioner, for going slowly on recycling programs. In light of Mr. Polan's concern for costs, it is surprising to see the department propose a buyback center for recyclables on the West Side of Manhattan. 
 If the department's plan is approved, the city will spend more than $175,000 to buy baling, compacting, crushing and other processing equipment; approximately $800,000 over two years to subsidize overall operation costs, and up to $92 a ton to be paid to the contractor, the Manhattan Bowery Corporation, for many recyclables that are now purchased on the open market for far less. (Manhattan Bowery Corporation has no experience setting up and operating a recycling facility.)
Why should the city spend money to equip a buyback center when the private sector handles the collection, processing and marketing of millions of tons of secondary materials annually at no direct cost to the taxpayer?
Moreover, by paying artificially high prices for recyclables, the Department of Sanitation will put small, private recyclers at a competitive disadvantage. Thus, rather than increasing the amount of recycling done, the net result will at best be a shift in recycling from the private to the public sector. At worst, a well-established network of private sector recycling will be undermined.
Especially during this period of fiscal crisis, it makes no sense to ask the public to support a buyback center that could be run more economically and efficiently in the private sector. Such buyback activity is already happening every day in New York City. On this particular proposal, rather than go slowly, Mr. Polan would do better to stop.

HEADLINE: Why Make Public Employees Pay for Deficits?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As state, city and Federal governments struggle to close budget gaps, the use of a pay lag has again appeared, soon to be imposed on New York State workers and possibly on others. In the New York version, all state workers would work five days without pay and receive an additional week's pay on leaving government. 
 For good reasons, meeting a payroll on time is a basic operating responsibility of private employers. However, governments often exempt themselves from niceties (compare civil rights, job safety, lie detectors), so why not defer the pay of public employees? Doing so allows a government to save money now but still receive the covered services and thus avoid the problems entailed in layoffs or furloughs. Elected officials, especially Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, seem to like the idea.
Arguments against it have been subdued, concentrating on its fiscal aspects. A pay lag allows the state to enjoy a long-term float on salaries owed. But much more deserves to be said against it.
Most fundamental is the violation of fair labor practices. Public employees are legally prohibited from using labor's most important weapon, the strike. Certain concessions are granted in return, such as requirements for negotiation and arbitration, and the continuation of contracts. Impounding the pay of workers violates these protections, regardless of enabling legislation passed to make it "legal." Even the deferred concept is not all it seems.
On WCBS radio recently, Governor Cuomo indicated that the state would keep the money when state employees died in service. Of much broader scope would be the effect on those who retire into state pension systems. Presumably, the pension payments would start only when the retiree goes off the payroll, in which case the pay lag would get converted to a smaller pension lag, which the state never pays. Would people voluntarily choose to work for such an employer?
Another way to look at the lag is as a very selective tax. The proposal of the unions to cover desired expenditures by small additional taxes has been generally derided. After all, voters have increasingly been turning down bond proposals and voting out politicians who dare to raise taxes. So instead of asking a little more from many through a tax increase, the state puts a big hit on a few. The only
conceivable justification is that state employees are especially responsible for the state's fiscal woes.
As a City University professor subject to increasing state funding and control since 1976, I can attest to increases in workload, to deteriorating support services and salaries frozen at 1989 levels. I have little doubt that most state workers have been making similar sacrifices and that more of the same lies ahead. If any group of state employees is to be held responsible, it would be elected officials at the state level, most being the very legislators who approved the pay lag but so far have exempted themselves.
Why should state workers in particular lend the state a week's salary? How about trying the same thing on all county and municipal workers subsidized by the state? Better yet, try asking all wage earners in the state to hand over a mere day's pay.
This leads to the related question of once started, where does it stop? State workers already deferred two weeks of pay in 1983 and now must give another week. Somewhere down the road, another week will seem reasonable, and who knows how much more after that? Imagine 21st-century retirees collecting deferred pay for months after they stop working. Besides lengthening the lag, it can also be broadened.
In addition to hitting more public employees or even all wage earners, the state could also try these ideas: a tax-refund lag (pay 1990 refunds a year later), a welfare-payments lag (give the last payment a month after the recipient leaves welfare, as an incentive), even a general-payment lag (add several months to the lag on everything the state pays for).
Naturally, these devices need not be limited to New York State. Other states can do the same thing. So can cities, counties and the Federal Government. The possibilities are almost limitless once governments step beyond equating employee payrolls with services rendered in the same fiscal period. The lag concept could become the voodoo economics of the 1990's, maybe even good enough to carry Governor Cuomo into the White House!

HEADLINE: 'Africa-Centered' Proposal Outlined for a Trial School

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
In considering a plan for a high school for black and Hispanic boys, the Board of Education appears to be embarking on a far-reaching experiment to promote racial and cultural pride and transform what some see as the European slant of traditional instruction.
A 21-page proposal circulating privately among board officials shows that the school, the Ujamaa Institute, is intended to be "Africa-centered" and would cultivate "Seven Principles" distilled from traditional African values, including unity, collective responsibility, economic cooperation, creativity and faith. 
 "To believe with all our heart in our parents, our teachers, our leaders, our people and the righteousness and victory of our struggle," is the way the proposal defines the principle of faith.
The school's American history course, the proposal says, would be taught "from an African-American frame of reference," and foreign-language study would include Swahili and Yoruba in addition to Spanish. A majority of teachers would be black men, a feature that has been frowned upon by the United Federation of Teachers.
 
A Separatist Outlook
 While some teachers have long woven black and African history and culture into the standard curriculum, there are few if any publicly financed schools that have have made such instruction the heart of their identity.
The proposed school could open as early as next fall, with 300 to 400 students, on the campus of Medgar Evers College in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.
Critics say the Ujamaa school would provide indoctrination, not education. They warn that it would foster a separatist outlook among young black males and hostility toward whites.
"They're trying to use our public schools to build and maintain racial unity, to foster so-called black self-determination and to expand the racial ghetto to develop cadres of politically correct thinking, ethnocentric, breast-beating racial braggarts," said Michael Meyers, a New Jersey state education official.
Mr. Meyers is director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, which includes the New York Civil Liberties Union and 21 other groups. He says the proposal is full of myths and half-truths and calls it "fashionable, rhetorical and racist."
 
'All People Will Be Welcome'
 Basir Mchawi, whom Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez hired specifically to plan the experimental school, rejects such charges. He contends that the Ujamaa Institute would be a high school "in which all people will be welcome" and "will look at many cultures but do so from the perspective of African-American people." He said that when he used the term "our struggle" to explain the principle of faith, he intended it to apply to all humanity.
The very idea for Ujamaa seems to have turned the 1950's and 1960's quarrels over segregation on their heads. Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, whose research undergirded the 1954 United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education rejecting "separate but equal" schools, says that even when segregation is sought by blacks it stigmatizes children and creates feelings of inferiority.
But Jawanza Kunjufu, a Chicago pioneer of the concept of schools for black boys, says urban schools are already segregated as a result of housing patterns, tracking practices and other factors. "So long as the class is already segregated, why not turn it into a class for winners?" he said.
The Ujamaa Institute would not exclude whites, Asians or females. But its raison d'etre is its concentration on young black and Hispanic males, though Hispanic boys seem to be mentioned only as an afterthought. Noting that black males are over represented in statistics on crime, drug abuse and dropout rates, the proposal says the school's strategy is to instill cultural pride in young men, create bonds among them, and inspire them with successful black adults.
"By emphasizing the special needs of the African-American male," the proposal says, "Ujamaa Institute acknowledges the fact that young African-American males have simultaneously become societal victims and victimizers."
The arguments over the school also offer a capsule version of the national debate over curriculum. Many critics attack social-studies instruction for concentrating on Western civilization. They can be broadly divided into two camps: multiculturalists, who think studies should be laced with contributions from many cultures, and Afrocentrists, who think that, for black students, the curriculum should stress the African and black American heritage.
The Mchawi proposal claims to be both Afrocentric and multicultural. Dr. Gwendolyn C. Baker, president of the Board of Education, who read the proposal, was flattering at a board meeting where Mr. Mchawi and Assemblyman Roger L. Green of Brooklyn presented the plan, but she insists on a school that is multicultural.
 
Seemed to Disown Proposal
 Complicating the debate is the role of Mr. Fernandez. He has often seemed to disown the proposal when reporters have inquired, yet he hired Mr. Mchawi to develop it. Before he came to work at the Board of Education, Mr. Mchawi, 41 years old, was a teacher and administrator at two independent schools in Brooklyn, Uhuru Sasa and Shule Ya Mapinduzi, both closed, that he says can serve as models for Ujamaa.
Mr. Fernandez, evidently hoping to minimize controversy, has never publicly released the Ujamaa proposal, but has issued his own memorandum that mentioned none of its Afrocentric features.
Yesterday, his press secretary, James S. Vlasto, said Mr. Mchawi was being asked to draft a new plan that he suggested might not contain some of the present elements.
Also at issue in the board's consideration of the proposal is Mr. Mchawi's long association with Robert (Sonny) Carson, a convicted kidnapper who helped organize the boycott of two Korean groceries and has said he is anti-white. Mr. Carson has also been a controversial figure in the Brooklyn public schools. Mr. Mchawi says they have never had a "working relationship."
 
Pythagorean Theorem?
 In his proposal, dated Dec. 14, Mr. Mchawi defines Africa-centered as meaning that "it is the African experience which forms the center of analysis."
"One of the problems with much existing curriculum is the perspective bias that is often imposed in texts that view European history and culture as the paradigm by which all human experience should be measured," it reads.
As an illustration, Mr. Mchawi said schools teach that the Pythagorean theorem was developed by the Greek mathematician Pythagoras. Mr. Mchawi asserted that knowledge of the theorem existed 1,000 years before Pythagoras, but that Alexander the Great sacked libraries in Egypt that might have attributed it to Africans.
The proposal has very little to say about conventional academic subjects. On biology, it says only that "attention will be given to great biological scientists from the African world such as Imhotep, Charles Drew and Daniel Hale Williams" and that students would focus on the effects of "certain behaviors on their bodies" such as smoking crack and surviving during pregnancy on "potato chips and Pepsi."
 
'The Quality of Life'
 "What you have before you is a concept," Mr. Mchawi said when asked why the plan was so skimpy on curricular details. He said the school would meet all state and city requirements for a diploma.
The Seven Principles, or Nguzo Saba, which also include self-determination and purpose, Mr. Mchawi said, were synthesized from traditional African values by a California professor, Dr. Maulana Karenga, in the 1960's. The proposal says they address "things that young people need to do to improve their personal lives and the quality of life in their community."
Mr. Mchawi denied that the Principles might make white, Hispanic or Asian pupils feel excluded. "We talk about the universality of the Ten Commandments," he said. "It doesn't mean that it wouldn't be applicable to other people."

HEADLINE: Washington Offers Mountain of Debt To Save Forests

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
COULD foreign debt be the lever that moves poor countries to save their rain forests? President Bush apparently thinks so. The White House is backing a bold program to channel billions of dollars that Latin American governments owe Washington into local conservation projects.
"Debt for nature" swaps are not new. Private groups are already busy raising cash to buy up foreign debt, trading the I.O.U.'s back to the financially troubled debtors in return for commitments to acquire parks and conserve environmental resources in eight countries. 
 What is new is the possible addition of vast quantities of Government money to the pot -- and the prospect of a systematic, well-financed defense of tropical forests that serve as a natural sink for greenhouse gases and shelter the lion's share of the world's plant and animal species.
William Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the program's most influential champion, believes that a successful reshuffling of some $12 billion in foreign aid loans by the United States would mobilize $100 million a year for conservation projects. The approach could also serve as a model for European and Japanese governments, which carry another $38 billion in Latin American debt.
No less important is that the plan requires the participation of local environmentalists, who have often been excluded from decision-making. John Sawhill, the head of the Nature Conservancy, an active promoter of debt-for-nature swaps, argues that the resulting public-private partnerships could tilt local interests in favor of environmental protection.
The big question now is whether Washington, preoccupied by war in the Persian Gulf and recession at home, is sufficiently committed to the swap idea to plow through the political and financial obstacles. Much depends on the Administration's flexibility in determining which Latin debtors are eligible. For its part, Congress will either have to allow some creative accounting on the debt shuffle or will have to add new foreign aid money to the budget.
Thomas Lovejoy, an ecologist now at the Smithsonian Institution, dreamed up the idea of linking foreign debt relief to the financing of environmental projects in debtor nations in 1984. At the time, crushing foreign debts had led most poor countries to cut back on environmental protection. Why not wipe out part of the debts denominated in dollars and yen for commitments to spend cruzeiros and pesos on conservation?
But it was private organizations, not governments or commercial banks, that turned theory into practice. In the very first swap in 1987, Conservation International, an American group, paid $100,000 for an uncollectible $650,000 that Bolivia owed to Citicorp . The group then agreed to wipe out Bolivia's $650,000 debt in return for its promise to protect a 3.7-million-acre buffer around the Beni Biosphere Reserve and to spend the equivalent of $250,000 in local currency to manage the reserve. Since then, 14 other debt-for-nature swaps have been carried out, reducing external debts and protecting forests in Ecuador, Costa Rica, the Philippines, Madagascar, Zambia, the Dominican Republic and Poland.
Clever financing arrangements, along with the enthusiastic cooperation of environmentally sensitive governments, have magnified the effects of the $16 million investment far beyond initial expectations. But as Mr. Sawhill of the Nature Conservancy points out, dependence on charitable donations has limited the overall impact on the global environment to "peanuts." That is why environmental groups, led by the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, worked hard to make a case for Federal intervention.
They struck pay dirt last June when Mr. Bush included debt-for-nature swaps in his "Enterprise for the Americas" initiative, a broad effort to pare debt, liberalize trade and stimulate investment in Latin America and the Caribbean. In October, Congress authorized swaps for some $1.7 billion in debts incurred in the sales of subsidized food. The President is expected to ask that the swaps be extended to loans made by the United States Agency for International Development, as well as Export-Import Bank and Commodity Credit Corporation loans originally used to subsidize United States exports.
To be eligible, debtor countries will have to pass muster on a number of criteria -- what one environmental lobbyist calls the "flaming hoops." They must be actively working to make deals with their other big creditors, in particular the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the commercial banks. And they must open their borders to foreign investors on reasonable terms.
The carrot is substantial debt relief. The Administration is targeting a 50 percent write-off. Payments forgiven by the United States Treasury would be converted to local currencies and deposited in a national environmental funds.
The money could be used for anything from conservation training to restoration of the world's oceans and atmosphere. But outlays would be planned and supervised by boards that included private citizens nominated by the United States Government.
Many a slip is still possible. While environmental interests played a major role in passing the legislation, "different people in the Administration have different priorities," Mr. Sawhill noted.
Jamaica, Chile, Bolivia and Costa Rica all reportedly have advocates in the Administration, and will probably be the first to cut Enterprise for the Americas deals. But if the United States takes a hard line on debt arrears or foreign investment rules, environmentally critical countries like Brazil and Peru will not qualify anytime soon.
 
Possible Inflationary Effects
 Another worry is the host nations' receptivity. Debt-for-nature swaps on a large scale will require countries to reorder economic priorities. Unless governments cut back on other spending when they agree to spend more on the environment, the arrangement will be inflationary.
Outright rejection of swaps as an impingement on sovereignty, the position taken by Brazil's former President, Jose Sarney, is no longer fashionable in Latin America. Indeed, Latin American politicians seem more inclined to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which has touted debt-for-nature as a way to sustain jobs in tourism and develop agricultural techniques that will allow sustainable development.
It is still not clear, though, whether elected officials will buy the idea of independent boards, which could compete with established interests. "Will they really allow anybody outside the government to have guaranteed funding?" asked Lamond Godwin, a vice president at the American Express Bank who has served as an adviser on a number of private debt swaps.
Perhaps the most serious obstacle to swaps is the issue of how they will be treated in the Federal budget. The Administration expects to to arrange deals that maintain the level of payments to Washington that would otherwise be expected.
 
Issue of Budget Accounting
 Debtor countries would come out ahead, since they would no longer need to reschedule unpaid debts each year and would be able to liquidate their debts in a reasonable time frame. But since there would be no real loss of income to Washington, the Administration contends that there ought to be no effect on budget accounting.
If, for example, a country is now paying $1 million in principle plus $4 million in interest each year on an $80 million debt, it would go on writing annual checks to the United States Treasury for $5 million. But all the $5 million would be declared repayment of principle, allowing a far faster liquidation of the debt balance. The $4 million annual interest, converted to local currency, would go into the national environment fund.
This socially redeeming sleight-of-hand does not, however, sit well with the professionals who keep the books for Congress. Some want the Treasury to treat debt reduction the way a private creditor would write off a bad loan, taking a loss in the year the deal is signed. Congress would be obliged to appropriate funds to cover the paper loss, adding to the budget deficit.
That is not a problem in principle: if debt-for-nature swaps are worth doing, the logic goes, they are worth paying for. But as a practical matter it would probably torpedo large-scale swaps. "If there is a single budget item less popular than foreign assistance," said one senior Administration official, "I'm not aware of it."
 
Causes for Optimism

 
 Environmental groups are nonetheless optimistic. Many of their leaders believe that Mr. Bush is committed to their cause and is eager to offset his image as a proscrastinator on the problem of global warming. Moreover, there is no serious opposition to debt-for-nature swaps in Congress, and there probably will not be unless the plan runs afoul of the budget process.
Once off the ground, they believe, the initiatives will be imitated in Europe and Japan. Debt-for-nature provisions could also be routinely integrated into the rescheduling of hundreds of billions of dollars in debts owed to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. If the optimists are right, the only practical limit on their scale will be good ideas for making conservation compatible with economic development.
 
Alchemy of a Debt-for-Nature Swap
 
In March 1990, the Development Trust of Puerto Rico, a charity, spent $116,400 to buy $582,000 worth of the outstanding debt of the Dominican Republic, owed to the Swiss Bank Corp-oration. The trust then donated the right to collect the debt to the Nature Conservancy in Washington
 
The Nature Conservancy then swapped this asset to the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic for $581,000 worth of local-currency bonds. These bonds, paying 12 percent interest, are held bythe Pronatura Fund, a consortium of Dominican conservatioon groups. The interest and principle support four projects, including a national park with the world's largest population of crocodiles.

G.E. Sets Thorn Deal; Lamp Chief Is Chosen

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
The General Electric Company completed its deal yesterday to buy Thorn EMI P.L.C.'s $360 million European light bulb business and named David E. Momot to be president and chief executive of the newly created company, G.E.-Thorn Lamps Ltd.
Mr. Momot comes from a stint at the Genlyte Group, a maker of lighting fixtures, where he was president and chief executive, and which he joined in 1989. He is no stranger to G.E., having worked there for 30 years until 1989. 
 "We want to establish a larger presence in the European market and we will use the relationship with Thorn in support of that," Mr. Momot said yesterday.
He said G.E. would have "an enhanced position from a market standpoint," realizing the fruits of wider technology and economies of scale "by integrating the G.E., Thorn and Tungsram operations." Tungsram is a Hungarian lighting company that has been in a joint venture with G.E. since early last year.
Mr. Momot said the plan was to keep the Thorn and Tungsram brand names in Europe. Coincidentally, as G.E. was making its announcement of the Thorn purchase yesterday, it also announced the suspension of an upbeat G.E. television commercial that underscored the Tungsram tie and the emergence of democracy in Eastern Europe; it was inopportunely shown during a news program on Soviet crackdowns in the Baltics.
Mr. Momot said yesterday that the purchase of the Thorn light business would move G.E. from No. 5 to No. 3 in European market share. G.E. is making a cash payment of $57 million, the first installment of a $138 million sale price, payable over three years. G.E. will have a 51 percent interest and after three years Thorn's minority interest will transfer to G.E. Thorn is retaining its international business in light fixtures.
Mr. Momot, 54, is experienced in the fixture side of the business more than on the lamp side. He ran G.E.'s lighting fixtures division at Hendersonville, N.C., from 1984 to 1989 before leaving for Genlyte. Earlier, he worked in a number of G.E. assignments from motors to aerospace.
Mr. Momot is a graduate of the State University of New York Maritime College in the Bronx. After service as a naval officer he joined G.E. In his latest G.E. post Mr. Momot will be based in London, his first overseas assignment.

Texas Utility Concern Names New Chairman

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
The Central and South West Corporation, a big electric utility holding company based in Dallas, changed top managers yesterday and announced its 40th annual dividend increase.
"We're very proud of that," said the company's new chairman and chief executive, E. R. Brooks, known as Dick. "There are only three other corporations on the New York Stock Exchange with longer records." 
 Mr. Brooks, who has been with the company for 30 years, takes over on Feb. 1 from Merle L. Borchelt, who is retiring after 42 years there. Mr. Brooks was named president a year ago and will retain that title.
The company, based in Dallas, provides electricity for customers in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas. It has continued to increase its dividend as a matter of investor policy despite the region's economic difficulties, which have resulted in lower earnings, and a fight for rate relief for its $2.3 billion investment in a nuclear plant that has not yet produced a cash return.
Yesterday, the company announced a 14.5 percent income increase for last year and attributed it primarily to regulators' rulings, including the deferral of some carrying costs on the nuclear project
Mr. Brooks said that at age 53 he would have several years to tackle the utility's challenges. "We have what we think is a good strategic plan," he said. Future growth in earnings and dividends depends on how the company invests its cash during the years ahead, but Mr. Brooks said he did not plan to go far afield.
"We would never diversify outside of our core business," he said. "Almost anything not regulated would probably be more competitive than we would be able to be nimble with." The company, he said, passed up an opportunity to buy MCI, the long-distance telephone company, several years ago, and although MCI is now huge, Mr. Brooks said the utility probably did the right thing.
Mr. Brooks stressed "good conservative management," adding, "We know what we're doing in the core business."
The company said Mr. Brooks had been identified early as a chief executive candidate by Mr. Borchelt and Durwood Chalker, Mr. Borchelt's predecessor.
When he graduated from high school in the West Texas town of Slaton, Mr. Brooks said his ambition was to be an engineer, a classical pianist or a football coach. He choose electrical engineering at Texas Tech University and gradauted in 1961, joining the utility that year. As for the piano, he still plays for fun.

HEADLINE: The Spy Who Went Into Retailing

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGLEBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Marian Zacharski has a finely tuned sense of irony, and he ought to. A decade ago, he was sentenced by an American court to life in prison, a Polish agent who paid a high penalty for stealing military secrets. Today, six years after his release in a spy exchange, he is a leading businessman in Poland, director of this country's most profitable retailer.
"Each day, all that is becoming more distant," Mr. Zacharski said of his years as a foot soldier in the cold war in the guise of a sales representative for a Polish machine-tools company. "History has moved forward. I owe a lot to America. If I've become a seasoned businessman, it was because of the years I spent in America. It was my university of life." 
 With his perfectly coiffed gray hair, starched white shirt and lightly accented colloquial English, Mr. Zacharski epitomizes Poland's new breed of Westward-looking entrepreneurs. While competitors struggle to cope with the new principles of free-market economics, he has a sure grasp of his marketing strategy. He wants to emulate J. C. Penney, not K Mart, and hopes to build relationships with customers eager to buy previously scarce consumer goods.
The state-owned company he heads, Pewex, was the nationwide chain of stores that sold imported items for dollars, German marks, or other hard currency. It is being privatized and today, with the border open to imports, Pewex accepts payment in Polish zlotys.
Sitting in his office on the 12th floor of the Marriott Hotel in downtown Warsaw, Mr. Zacharski speaks confidently of prospects for doubling gross sales this year, to $2 billion. One advertising gambit he plans has a distinctly Western flavor: Pewex is playing host to a tour this spring by the American figure skating troupe the Ice Capades. Mr. Zacharski says the company must diversify to maintain market share.
American intelligence officials remember Mr. Zacharski for skills other than his marketing acumen. To them, he was the ultimate professional. His prowess in recruiting a disgruntled engineer at Hughes Aircraft as his American agent is still studied at the F.B.I. academy as a textbook example of how a resourceful spy plies his trade.
 
'Very Talented'
 "I knew he was very talented, and I was convinced he was a very talented spy," said Robert Brewer, a private lawyer in San Diego who prosecuted Mr. Zacharski in 1981. "I'm not a bit surprised that whatever venture he got involved in, he would succeed."
Indeed, Mr. Zacharski is a rarity among intelligence operatives East or West in his ability to prosper in a subsequent career. The attributes of a capable spy -- grace under pressure, personal charm, daring -- would seem to be ideal for business executives. But the United States has had enormous difficulty helping defectors from Soviet and Eastern bloc intelligence services find work in the West. And today, intelligence agents dismissed by the new democracies in eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland are also said to be struggling to find an employer who can make use of their abilities.
From 1977 until his arrest in 1981, Mr. Zacharski worked as what is known in espionage jargon as an "illegal." It is considered the riskiest job in the spy business.
 
Some Face Prison
 Most intelligence officers enter foreign countries as diplomats who enjoy immunity from arrest. They are closely watched by counterespionage agents and if caught are simply deported. To avoid surveillance, some spies pose as students, tourists or business executives. Their handlers work particularly hard at inventing credible cover stories because these illegals face imprisonment if detected.
In Mr. Zacharski's case, his cover as a sales representative for a Polish company was as much a vocation as spycraft. He recalled with evident pride his success in selling machine tools to American companies.
He was more circumspect about details of his espionage career, declining to say when and how he was enlisted. But it was still easy to see why he was both a successful spy and a formidable salesman. He fixes a visitor with his light blue eyes, and he has a knack for creating a warm, congenial atmosphere even in a short conversation.
 
'Like a Game'
 What was it like to be a spy?
"It's something in which you have to turn your emotions off," he recalled. "It's a job, and the same time, it's something like a game between certain types of agencies."
Mr. Zacharski grew up in the northern Polish city of Sopot, and attended college in Warsaw, studying business. At some point, he was enlisted in the Polish intelligence service, which was working closely with Soviet intelligence to steal Western technology.
"I consider myself a great patriot," Mr. Zacharski said of his decision to become a spy. "To me it makes no difference whether Poland is Socialistic, Communist or a feudal country. To me, it's that it was Poland. My country is Poland and I do everything possible for it."
Mr. Zacharski came to the United States in 1975, accompanied by his wife and daughter.
For several years, he worked as president of the Polish American Machinery Corporation, with headquarters in Elk Grove Village, Ill.
 
The Personal Touch
 Listen to how Mr. Zacharski describes the attributes of a great salesman: "Business is not done between companies. It's done between people. Before you sell your product, you have to sell yourself."
Mr. Zacharski was doing both in the United States. In 1978, he met William Holden Bell, an aerospace engineer at Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo, Calif., who was embittered and having financial problems. Mr. Zacharski moved into the condominium complex in which Mr. Bell lived, befriended him, played tennis with him and slowly eased him into espionage.
"This was a classic case in which an intelligence officer correctly assessed his target. Mr. Bell needed a friend and Zacharski just recruited him beautifully," said Kenneth Degraffenreid, former head of intelligence programs at the White House.
Over the next three years, prosecutors said, Mr. Bell was paid more than $110,000 for secrets on military radar systems, including the technology for the radar-evading Stealth aircraft then under development. In 1981, he was caught by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, confessed, and agreed to wear a hidden microphone to entrap Mr. Zacharski. The plan succeeded, and the handsome Polish emigre was arrested on June 28, 1981.
 
A Life Sentence
 Mr. Bell was sentenced to eight years. Mr. Zacharski went before a Federal judge for his punishment on Dec. 14, 1981, a particularly inauspicious moment. The day before, Poland's Communist Government had imposed martial law. Mr. Zacharski said the life sentence was not a surprise.
Though he would not have been eligible for parole until June 2011, he said he never gave up hope. He asserts that his biggest worry was whether he could get a job when he returned to Poland. In 1985, he and three other agents were traded for 25 spies being held in Eastern bloc countries. Months later, the Government named him to a post in Pewex and he soon went to work as head of the consumer electronics division. He became general director last year.
It is not yet clear whether he will head Pewex when the company is sold into private hands. Mr. Zacharski says he has the qualifications, pointing to a 74 percent increase in sales last year.
 
Political Concerns
 Of late, Mr. Zacharski's prominence has attracted some unwanted political attention. Lech Walesa, the new President of Poland, ran on a platform of sweeping the Communist elite, or "nomenklatura," from posts in business and industry. Though Mr. Zacharski was appointed to Pewex by the Communist Government, he was chosen director in a competition last year.
He was recently the subject of an unflattering article in Tygodnik Solidarnosc, the weekly paper with close ties to the Walesa camp. The article recounted published reports linking Mr. Zacharski's operations in the United States to the Soviet intelligence service, the K.G.B.
"They are trying to create an atmosphere that I am a foreign object in this country, and this is complete nonsense," he said.
These days, Mr. Zacharski seems to have little nostalgia for his years in the back alleys.
"No, I don't miss it," he said. "At a certain point in your life you do certain things. At that point in my life, I was young and brave. Now, I am old and settled," said the 39-year old Mr. Zacharski, with only the hint of a twinkle in his eye.

Down the Years, a Father Hunts His Stolen Son

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Gil Abeyta's interest in Mexico was set in motion on July 15, 1986, while he and his wife were asleep at their home in Colorado Springs. Sometime that night, Mr. Abeyta says, a stranger entered the unlocked house and stole his 7-month-old son, Christopher, who has not been seen again.
In the four and a half years since then, Mr. Abeyta and his wife, Bernice, have crisscrossed the United States in search of their missing child, badgering police officials, hiring private detectives, and following up hundreds of reported sightings that offered hope of finding their son. 
 But their search has come to focus increasingly on Mexico, where they believe Christopher may have been hidden or even sold for adoption beyond the reach of American authorities, and where their personal quest has now broadened into a public crusade on behalf of Mexico's own missing and abandoned children.
In a countrywide tour of Mexican towns, villages and regional capitals, Mr. Abeyta and his small, privately financed caravan of family members, friends and Mexican supporters have become a traveling political lobby.
 
A Void in the System
 They have brought pressure on local authorities, organized a network of private citizens in more than 30 cities to investigate sightings of missing children, and publicized what they say is the need for a comprehensive agreement between the United States and Mexico on the joint investigation and resolution of missing children cases.
"I came here looking for my son," Mr. Abeyta said, meeting with a reporter at a modest Mexico City hotel that has served as his base of operations in the capital. "But what I found was a void in the system between Mexico and the United States on this issue. There were no treaties, no agreements, no kind of support."
Like other third-world countries, Mexico has long suffered from the problems of neglected or abandoned children whose impoverished parents cannot afford to care for them. In addition, the long border with the United States, where there is high demand for adoption-age children, has made Mexico a prime suspect as a source of illegal traffic in infants who are bought and sold for adoption in the United States and Europe.
Mexican officials say the scale of that clandestine trade is difficult to measure with any certainty. But residents of poor neighborhoods throughout the country frequently describe relatives and friends who they say have given up unwanted newborns in return for payments of as much as $10,000 from illegal adoption brokers.
 
Talk Too of Smugglers
 Anecdotal evidence also abounds of coyotes, or black-market agents, who operate from northern Mexico and will buy -- or steal -- adoption-age babies on either side of the border to fill specific requests from prospective adoptive parents.
The potential involvement of such smugglers, together with repeated reports from local citizens who believed that they had recognized Christopher from press and television coverage of Mr. Abeyta's loss, first brought Mr. Abeyta to the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua two years ago in search of new clues to his son's disappearance.
Mr. Abeyta, who quit his job as a Federal labor official to devote full time to the search for his son, says that trip failed to provide direct new evidence for locating Christopher. But he says the number of abandoned and neglected children he encountered -- together with local accounts of child-trafficking -- convinced him that Mexico was a critical element in a larger problem of missing and abducted children.
"At first, if a child was not Christopher, I would just forget him and move on," said Mr. Abeyta, 48, who learned Spanish as a child from his Spanish-immigrant parents. "But I kept running into other questionable children that had no identity, no history, that had been abandoned in Chihuahua, and appeared to be from the United States."
"Some had apparently been left with relatives or friends, but no one knew where they had come from," Mr. Abeyta said. "The issue was that they were kids that did not fit into the place where they were living."
 
Strong Backing From Officials
 Although some Mexican officials remain highly sensitive about allegations of child trafficking in their country, Mr. Abeyta's overtures have received strong support from many Government figures, particularly in Mexico City, where local officials recently established the nation's first agency dedicated exclusively to finding the whereabouts of missing people.
"We have the deepest respect for Mr. Abeyta's efforts and are doing everything we can to help," said Hernan Figueroa Cal y Mayor, the director of the capital's new Center for Aiding Lost and Missing Persons, who has been a vigorous supporter of Mr. Abeyta's work. "This is the sort of thing where no one is going to stand in his way."
Mr. Abeyta says the goal of his efforts is to establish the kind of smooth cooperation on such issues that already exists between the United States and other countries such as Canada. Although most missing-child cases in the United States are handled by the police and private groups, a special federally financed agency, the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, was created in 1984 to coordinate information and publicity about missing children.
Among the most important steps to be taken, Mr. Abeyta argues, would be the expansion of local efforts like Mr. Figueroa's agency to give Mexico an analogous national institution dedicated to missing children. Such an agency, he asserts, could then oversee the establishment of cooperative information networks to track missing children on both sides of the border, and regular exchanges of police information.
 
Other Measures Suggested
 Other measures, he said, would include the tightening of immigration restrictions at border crossings to prevent the undetected smuggling of small children, most of whom now pass unchallenged as long as they are with an adult.
Those goals, Mr. Abeyta admits, are likely to take some time to become a reality. But each step toward their realization, he believes, can only bring him closer to finding Christopher, whose memory has propelled the entire undertaking.
"When you lose a child like this," said Mr. Abeyta, who has six other children, "it's like a movie projector starts running in your head. You can't stop imagining what might have happened, where he might be."
"There is only one way to turn that projector off," he said, "and that is to find him."

A System to Speed Computer Data

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
From a computer-filled trailer next to the Tampa stadium where the Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, photographs taken on the field will be relayed over telephone lines to newspapers in two minutes. That is about 10 times faster than has been possible in the past.
The system that rapidly sends photographs is only one of many new products emerging now that technical experts have agreed on a standard method for condensing computer images for faster transmission and more economical storage. The method, which blends sophisticated software with powerful specialized chips, squeezes the series of zeroes and ones that represent computerized images into far fewer bits of information so that the data take much less time to send. The method permits the condensed data to be reconstructed after arriving at their destination with no visible loss in quality. 
 Just as an internationally accepted standard for compressing facsimile images spawned mass production that drove down the price of facsimile machines, the internationally accepted standard for compressing the more complex images stored in computers is expected to encourage the introduction of a variety of inexpensive consumer products. They will feature high-resolution color images that can be stored, retrieved and manipulated. Such products include not only improved newsphoto transmission systems but also video telephones, facsimile machines, copiers and printers that will be able to send and edit images as simply as text, and television-computer hybrids that allow the viewer to edit images much as today's word processors edit text.
"The big shift is from today's analog television to digital images," said Andrew Lippman, associate director of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. "Television is learning the language of the computer."
A simple compression method is already used in high-speed facsimile transmission systems. Without compression it would take nearly an hour to transmit a simple 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper. But the internationally accepted Group III facsimile standard replaces blank lines with a short code that indicates that the line is empty. Other lines can be compressed by being encoded as lengths of black and white spaces.
The new standard for compressing digital images is already in commercial use and will be formally released in March. It was developed by an international standards group known as the Joint Photographic Expert Group, or JPEG. Later this year a second standard for full-motion digital video will be defined by a parallel group, the Motion Picture Expert Group, or MPEG. The MPEG standard is expected to offer image compression in ratios exceeding 100 to 1, making it possible to store and retrieve more than an hour of video images on a single compact disk.
 
How It Works
 The internationally accepted JPEG compression system works this way: A color image is converted into rows of dots, called pixels. each with a numerical value that represents brightness and color. The picture is then broken down into blocks, each 16 pixels by 16 pixels, and then reduced to 8 pixels by 8 by subtracting every other pixel. The software uses a formula that computes an average value for each block, permitting it to be represented with less data. Further steps subtract even more information from the image. To retrieve the data, the process is simply reversed to decompress the image.
A specialized chip compresses and decompresses the images hundreds of times faster than is possible on a standard desktop computer.
MPEG offers even greater compression by taking advantage of the fact that full-motion video is made up of a sequence of still images. Because many successive frames consist of large areas that are not changed -- like a blue sky background -- it is possible to reach far higher levels of compression.
But the current MPEG standard will lack some of the flexibility of the JPEG standard, which treats each image separately and therefore makes editing easier. Some companies, like Supermac Technology in Sunnyvale, Calif., see JPEG as an ideal standard for creating full-motion digital editing systems that permit computers to capture television video and store and edit the images on large Winchester or erasable optical disks. Current video-editing systems permit users to capture only single images.
 
'A Huge Bottleneck'
 Sophisticated compression standards are necessary if the promise of high-resolution digital video is to be realized, industry executives say.
"There is a huge bottleneck to working with images as opposed to working with text," said Robert R. Tillman, president of Storm Technology, a Palo Alto, Calif., company making products that use JPEG.
Consider the staggering storage requirements of a single color picture. A standard full-color digital image displayed on an I.B.M.-compatible computer requires about a million characters of computer text, or one megabyte, of storage capacity on the computer's disk. By contrast, the novel "Moby Dick" requires only 1.3 million characters.
The problem is exponentially compounded for engineers hoping to display full-motion video on a computer screen. To display 30 frames each second -- the rate needed to achieve smooth motion -- two billion bytes of storage are needed for a single minute of video.
The storage problem is even worse for color printing applications. Printing an 8 1/2-by-11-inch color picture at a resolution of 300 dots an inch, which is typical for an office laser printer, would require more than 25 million bytes of disk storage space.
Today's standard office personal computers generally come equipped with hard disk drives that store 20 to 40 megabytes. That is adequate for most text-only computer applications, but too little for the new class of graphics and color-image programs.
 
Licensing Agreement
 Last month the JPEG standard took a significant step toward broad acceptance for both specialized graphics and standard office applications when Adobe Systems Inc., publisher of the Postscript printer language, announced that it was licensing the JPEG compression software technology from Storm Technology.
Postscript is a standard computer printer language widely used in the desktop and higher-quality publishing industries. After Adobe adds the JPEG software to a future version of its Postscript, it will greatly ease the burden of sending large computer files in the Postscript format to computer printers.
Moreover, some computer companies like Next Inc. have begun to add to their machines chips built expressly to run the JPEG software. Next is using a custom JPEG processor made by C-Cube Inc. of San Jose, Calif.
The JPEG standard permits the user to select the degree of compression, and therefore how close to the original the decompressed image will appear.
At Sunday's Super Bowl, five newspapers, including The New York Times, will cooperate in using a system to digitize photos taken during the game. The pictures will then be run through the JPEG compression process and transmitted by modem to the newspaper offices. The new process will save two hours for newspapers on the East Coast, which will be closer to their production deadlines when the game is played, said Steven P. Schaffran, president of the Color Group, an Albany, Calif., company that is coordinating the process.
 
Making Digital Images Easier to Store and Send
 
Digitized images take up an enormous amount of computer memory. A 4-by-5-inch photograph being prepared for newspaper publication takes up hundreds of thousands of bytes of information, making transmission slow and difficult. JPEG, a new standard for compressing digitized images, reduces the information in such photographs and keeps the loss of visual quality at a minimum.
 
Photographs are composed of many tiny dots, called pixels. In a digitized color photograph, each pixel contains shade and brightness information, represented numerically. JPEG works by dividing the image into blocks of pixels, then assigning each block several numbers that describe its characteristics. This eliminates the need to process the image pixel by pixel.
 
Some pixels are removed from a block to reduce the information it contains. The amount of data removed depends on the amount of compression desired.
 
To further compress the image, each block is given a base value, shown here in the upper left hand corner by the letter B. All other pixels in the block are then assigned numbers that describe their shade and brightness in relations to the base value. In later steps, these values are simplified mathematically, but remain proportional. The loss of detail is minimal, because enough information about shade and brightness variations within the block is maintained.

Charity Begins In Washington

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
DECEMBER, the peak month for philanthropy, is history. And when the figures are totaled, 1990 will almost certainly prove to have been another record year for giving: By the reckoning of the American Association of Fund Raising Counsel, contributions in real terms have risen in 26 of the last 34 years.
Lest one grow too comfortable in the glow from a thousand points of light, consider this unsettling discovery by Ralph L. Nelson, an economist at Queens College in New York: Adjusted for rising incomes and a handful of other factors, Americans' inclination to give appears to have declined sharply over the last few decades. 
 The charitable explanation, favored by philanthropy professionals, is that sharp cuts in the tax benefits associated with contributions have discouraged giving. But Mr. Nelson argues it is possible, even likely, that the sense of private obligation to the commonweal is eroding.
Giving in 1989 totaled $115 billion, a 173 percent increase in real terms over donations in 1955, the association said in its annual report. Some $54 billion went to religious organizations, which used much of the cash to support churches and parochial schools -- endeavors that are not everyone's idea of philanthropy. But the residual $61 billion in non-religious contributions, triple the 1955 figure, still looks impressive.
Or does it? In spite of the fact that Americans are far richer than they were in the 1950's, the percentage of their incomes going to charity has hardly budged. In 1958, contributions represented 2.09 percent of G.N.P. -- a bit less than the 2.19 percent figure in 1989, a bit more than the 1.99 percentin 1985. Mr. Nelson uses an econometric model to explain why.
The model, updated last year for "Giving USA," the Fund Raising Counsel's annual report, confirms that total contributions are positively related to total personal income, the size of the population in the prime giving age group, 35 to 64, and stock market prices near the end of the year. The political party occupying the White House seems to matter, too: Americans are a bit more generous when Republicans are in power.
No great surprises there. What may surprise is that Mr. Nelson also isolated an independent downward trend in giving that has offset much of the gain that might have been expected as Americans got rich. If income growth were to stagnate, the equation suggests that contributions would actually fall by about 3.4 percent annually.
What could account for this inclination to selfishness? Tax rates surely influence giving. The lower the tax bracket, the smaller the tax savings associated with an extra dollar in donations. And top rates have indeed fallen sharply: In 1948, the taxpayers in the top bracket kept just 18 cents of the last dollar earned, while in 1989 they were allowed to keep 67 cents.
Uncle Sam, in effect, used to match an $18 gift to charity with $82 of its own. Last year, with the maximum tax bracket down to just 33 percent, a sacrifice of $18 in private spending power evoked a government match of about $9.
But taxes are apparently only a part of the explanation. Back in 1975 the Harvard economist Martin Feldstein estimated that the rising "tax price" of giving at most accounted for a 1.4 percent annual downward trend -- less than half the decline isolated in the Nelson equation. And to Steven Knack, an economist at the University of Maryland, the implication is clear: Americans' sense that they are obliged, as individuals, to care for the community is slipping.
One reason they feel less obliged is that they have created a welfare state to meet their collective obligations. Few Americans, surely, would prefer to return to the bad old days, when the unemployed depended on the Salvation Army for hot soup and Uncle Ed lived in the spare bedroom because he had no pension. But there could be a serious price to pay for this apparent erosion of communal values.
Well-run government may be able to manage the basics -- feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, educating the illiterate. But it is never going to be up to the task of giving the needy a sense of belonging. And it is by nature a better caretaker than an innovator able to adjust quickly to devastating new plagues like teen-age pregnancy.
The subtler problem is that the private and public welfare states may prove to be complements rather than substitutes: If the impulse to private charity is eroding, support for public charity may not be far behind. That is only speculation, of course. But taxpayers' reluctance to cope with homelessness and drug abuse -- even to pay to fill the potholes -- is hardly reassuring.

HEADLINE: Panama Canal a Worry to Shippers

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, Jan. 22

 BODY:
International maritime officials are expressing concern that the condition of the Panama Canal is slowly deteriorating and that Panama will be unable to manage the waterway properly when it takes full control in 1999.
The 1977 Carter-Torrijos Treaties envisioned a gradual transition in management of the canal from American to Panamanian hands with no loss in efficiency or security. But an increasing array of troubles is raising the question of whether a developing country with a population and economy smaller than many American cities can be expected to run one of the most complex engineering enterprises in the world. 
 "Efficiency has dropped constantly over the last 10 years," said a Panamanian shipping agent who asked not to be identified. "The perception of the world shipping community is that service is deficient."
 
Still an Important Link
 The 51.2-mile canal is no longer vital to the United States Navy, but it remains an important link for trade between Latin America, the United States, Asia and Europe. It carries 5 percent of the world's ocean-going commerce, a figure that could increase considerably if the war in the Persian Gulf increases insurance rates for shippers who would otherwise use the Suez Canal.
The potential for a future breakdown of service opens the possibility that Panama and the United States may have to renegotiate parts of the canal treaties to guarantee some American role in the management and protection of the waterway into the next century.
The canal railroad and ports, which have been in Panamanian hands for more than a decade, are in an advanced stage of decay. The canal locks, while still managed by a United States Government agency, are also showing growing signs of disrepair.
"Its not the same canal in terms of efficiency and safety that it was when I came here 12 years ago," said Gerard Petroni, an American canal pilot.
 
Growing Malfunctions
 As he guided the Columbus Australia, a German container ship sailing from Philadelphia to New Zealand loaded with cosmetics and frozen onion rings, through the Pedro Miguel Locks, Mr. Petroni complained about growing delays because of malfunctions of the water gates and of the locomotives that pull the ships through the locks.
"I can't remember one transit in the last two years that has happened without something going wrong," he said.
Mr. Petroni said the rotting away of rubber and wooden guards on the sides of the locks were responsible for a number of minor accidents, including the denting of ships that cost $50,000 and more to fix.
The Panama Canal Commission is currently headed by a Panamanian administrator, but it remains a United States Government agency with a board of directors whose majority is American. The agency, along with the entire canal, will be transfered to the Panamanian Government at noon Dec. 31, 1999.
 
Maintenance Is Criticized
 "Maintenance is a word the Panamanian Government has never heard of," complained Adrian Holmes, operations manager of C. D. Fenton, one of the largest shipping agencies here. "The port pilings are deteriorating, causing more ship accidents all the time. The oil pipelines off the docks are leaking. The launches are in bad repair. The railroad is useless."
Mr. Holmes said his customers, which include Mobil, Dole, and Star Shipping, may decide to phase out use of the canal and use the railroad "landbridge" across the continental United States instead. Decreasing traffic would mean disaster for the Panamanian economy, and force Panama to increase tolls for other shipping.
Panama City has yet to plan its final takeover of the waterway. Canal workers have been left wondering whether the Panamanian Government will retain their salary scales and benefits, which are far higher than Government workers enjoy. Young educated Panamanians who might otherwise have chosen to work at the canal are selecting more certain career paths.
 
Earlier Government Blamed
 President Guillermo Endara says his Government will begin to concentrate on current and future canal operations in the coming months.
"The international maritime community has had a very bad experience because of the past autocratic government," Mr. Endara conceded. "We inherited the ports and railroad in such bad shape that we are having trouble getting them back in shape. We need a lot of money and equipment, because the equipment was not maintained and was stolen. We can't change that overnight."
Mr. Endara pledged that "with democracy, we will be able to manage the canal." But he said Panama would need substantial technical and financial support from the United States and Japan to do the job.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Trading Is Bolstered By News on Rates and War

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most foreign currencies yesterday on signs that the Federal Reserve will not aggressively lower interest rates and worries that the Persian Gulf war may be escalating.
Against the German currency, the dollar closed at 1.4950 marks, up from 1.4925 on Monday. Against the Japanese currency, it closed at 132.30 yen, up from 131.95 on Monday. 
 The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, told a Congressional committee that the initial economic shock of the gulf crisis had largely worked its way through the economy but added that an aggressive lowering of interest rates could be "counterproductive."
"He'll ease if he has to, but he doesn't see the need at the moment," said David Wilson of Girozentrale New York.
Lower rates usually hurt the dollar because investors can get more return in other curencies.
Traders had speculated that the Fed would be more active in pushing down interest rates to revive the economy.
In testimony before the House Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan also warned of the dangers of further dollar declines. He said a lower dollar added to inflation pressures and might contribute to instability in financial markets.
While the comments of the Fed chairman initially helped the dollar yesterday, the United States currency rose further after Iraq fired missiles against Israel.
The dollar is a traditional safe holding for investors during war.
The British pound closed at $1.9455, down from $1.9565 on Monday. The dollar ended at 1.2590 Swiss francs, up from Monday's 1.2510. The dollar closed at 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1595 on Monday. It closed at 5.0840 French francs, up from 5.0575 on Monday.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN: EUROPE;
Baltic Assaults Lead Europeans To Hold Off Aid

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In the strongest Western response to date, the European Parliament blocked a $1 billion European Community food-aid package for the Soviet Union today to protest the crackdown by Moscow against pro-independence groups in the Baltic republics.
The 12-nation community, which on Monday night suspended a high-level meeting with Soviet trade officials scheduled for later this week, also announced that it would slow execution of a $550 million technical assistance agreement with Moscow after the latest violence in Latvia. 
 "We have to make the Soviets see that their behavior cannot be accepted," said Jean-Jacques Kasel, a senior Foreign Ministry official from Luxembourg, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the community.
 
Human Rights Complaint Planned
 Mr. Kasel, who said individual European governments could also announce sanctions against Moscow, added that the community would file a formal human rights complaint against the Soviet Union in the framework of the 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
In a separate move, France and Germany, which have already condemned the killing of at least four people by Soviet Interior Ministry troops in Latvia on Sunday, announced they were making a "joint approach" to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with a view to promoting a dialogue between Moscow and the Baltic republics.
But the clearest political message today came from the Budget Committee of the 518-member European Parliament, which withheld approval of food aid for the Soviet Union after Moscow repeatedly ignored community appeals that it temper its hard-line policy toward Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
The committee's chairman, Alain Lamassoure, said the aid package would be reconsidered at the next session of Parliament, in Strasbourg in late February. "The repression in the Baltics has made it impossible for the Parliament to take an immediate decision," he told reporters.
 
U.S. Offer Stands
 The European Parliament has no authority to veto the aid package since it was approved by community leaders. But by exercising its right to discuss all international accords, it chose to postpone the debate as a way of signaling its disapproval of Moscow's recent behavior.
The United States offer of up to $1 billion in credit guarantees for the purchase of agricultural commodities by the Soviet Union remains in effect. That offer was announced Dec. 12 by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. A bill submitted last Friday by several Republican senators would suspend those guarantees pending certification by President Bush that the Soviet threat to the Baltics had ceased.
Questioned in Washington today on whether the Bush Administration supported the European Parliament move, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, "If the E.C. judges that's the best way they can do it, I suspect we would support them, although we have historically been concerned about using food as a weapon."
While the community has agreed to "go slow" on dispensing aid to the Soviet Union, however, it is apparent that the 12 member governments have not agreed on what, if any, further action should be taken. Denmark is pressing for economic sanctions, while France and Germany favor a more flexible stance.
Last April, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl played an informal mediating role in the Baltic crisis when they sent a joint letter urging Lithuanian leaders to slow their campaign for independence to avert an open clash with Moscow.
 
Keeping Lines Open
 Now, by making their "joint approach" to Moscow, the two leaders reportedly want to warn that continued Soviet repression in the Baltic republics could sour East-West relations. By not joining calls for sanctions against Moscow, though, they are also keeping open their lines of communication to Mr. Gorbachev.
Through the European Community, France and Germany have nonetheless made it clear that the killing of at least 15 people in Lithuania last week and any further violence in the Baltics would threaten economic cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union.
Among the options available to the community are the suspension of numerous programs, including the $550 million technical assistance agreement and a $680 million food credit. The community had said it would not halt $330 million worth of emergency food aid, but this has now been blocked by the European Parliament.
So far, the strongest demand for sanctions against Moscow has come from Denmark which, along with its Scandinavian partners, feels both geographically and culturally close to the Baltic republics. Denmark has formally proposed that the community suspend all its aid programs to the Soviet Union.
"We cannot accept that Soviet troops attack the legally elected authorities in the Baltic states," Prime Minister Poul Schluter said today. "No one knows exactly who gave the orders, but one thing is clear: the responsibility rests with the top leadership."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: ISRAEL;
Israel Asks U.S. for Extra $13 Billion

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Basking in warm praise from Washington for its sacrifice and restraint since the gulf war began, Israel today presented the United States with the bill: $13 billion.
Explaining the figures during a meeting this morning with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai said $3 billion was compensation for actual and expected damages to Israel caused by the war and $10 billion was additional aid needed to resettle Soviet Jewish immigrants. 
 "We are expecting two types of aid" spread over the next five years, Mr. Modai said: direct economic assistance as well as loan and investment guarantees.
 
'Our Needs Are Very Clear'
 "Of course we are suffering," said Yossi Achimier, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. "Our needs are very clear, and we expect we will be helped by the Americans."
This afternoon, Israeli officials said they believed they had a reasonable chance of winning at least a significant part of this additional aid because they had heeded the American request not to retalitate for Iraqi missile attacks. But after the deadly missile attack on Tel Aviv tonight, it seemed much less certain that Israel would be able to remain restrained.
Mr. Shamir's office said the Prime Minister would meet with Mr. Eagleburger on Wednesday to discuss the missile attack. Mr. Eagleburger and several other American officials are here to coordinate the two nations' approaches to the gulf war.
Israeli officials said Mr. Modai's presentation today was not a formal request because the numbers are not firm. Mr. Modai suggested that Israel may in fact need more.
The United States Embassy said the request was received without promise or comment. An official noted that any appropriation of that scale would have to be approved by Congress.
If all or part of the aid package is approved, it would be only one part of a range of physical, monetary, political and emotional benefits Israel is receiving after the Iraqi missile attacks and Israel's decision not to retaliate, at least for now.
Mr. Eagleburger's warm words for Israel at a news conference on Monday were in marked contrast to the tenor of conversations between the Shamir and Bush administrations over the last year.
It has been less than a year since Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, testifying before a Congressional committee, scornfully recited his office phone number and told Israeli officials that when they were serious about advancing the peace process in the Middle East they should call.
While American relations have grown warmer, from the Israeli point of view world press coverage has suddenly turned positive, too. In addition to the 300 full-time resident foreign correspondents here, at least 700 others representing virtually every significant news organization in the world have arrived to cover the gulf war.
The Government has set up press centers at two hotels in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. And every day Government officials offer briefings, tours, explanations, translation assistance and almost any other form of help the visiting journalists might want.
For the first time in years most journalists are writing or airing sympathetic pieces about Israel, the victim of Iraqi aggression. It wasn't long ago that much of the news coverage centered on the Palestinian uprising and the army's harsh handling of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
If Israel receives additional aid requested from Washington, it would be on top of the $3 billion in economic and military assistance this state already gets from the United States each year, more than any country.
In addition, this year the United States agreed to guarantee $400 million in special loans to pay for housing Soviet Jewish immigrants, though Mr. Modai said the money hadn't yet arrived.
The Administration also agreed to provide $700 million in surplus military equipment from Europe, though again most of it has not been delivered. And by American estimates, Israel will also receive roughly $650 million more in a variety of supplementary benefits and programs this fiscal year.
 
Where Money Would Go
 A senior Finance Ministry official said $400 million of the $3 billion in compensation Israel wants would go for the costs of keeping the military at its highest level of alert for the last 10 days.
Another $1 billion would be to make up for the losses to the economy caused when the nation closed down for four days. Until today, almost everyone was told to stay home because of the Iraqi missile threat.
Another $1 billion was attributed to losses in the tourism industry. Since the gulf crisis began in August, few tourists have visited Israel.
"Syria, Egypt Turkey -- they got more aid than Israel because of their participation in the international coalition," the senior Finance Ministry official said. "But they haven't been hurt as much as we have."

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN DOUBTS NEED FOR TAX RISE TO MEET WAR COST

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, urged Congress today not to raise taxes to pay for the war in the Persian Gulf.
The Bush Administration has said it does not plan to ask for a tax increase. But some lawmakers and economists disagree with that judgment, and the issue is likely to dominate Congressional hearings and colloquies on economics in the months ahead. 
 Since no one knows how much the war will ultimately cost, Mr. Greenspan said, it is better to borrow the money at least for the time being, even though that would mean a substantial rise in the deficit.
But Mr. Greenspan, the Government's most influential economic policy maker and its leading forecaster, also insisted that taxes should not be cut or spending increased to stimulate the economy and counter the recession.
 
Risk of Mistakes
 "Assessing the economic outlook is especially daunting at the present time," Mr. Greenspan asserted in testimony before the House Budget Committee. He said it might be months before the proper course of action regarding taxes, spending and interest rates became clear, and he noted, "The risks of making policy mistakes are high."
Speaking in his customary oblique style, he refused to say whether he expected the Federal Reserve to drive interest rates lower. "Decisions on that score will depend on developing trends in financial markets and the economy," he said.
But under especially sharp questioning by Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts, Mr. Greenspan conceded that if the nation's money supply did not start growing in response to the Fed's cutting of short-term rates over the last three months, further steps would be needed to get banks to lend more money.
 
Remembering Vietnam
 Remembering the Vietnam experience, many politicians and economists here have begun discussing how to pay for the war in the gulf, which Mr. Greenspan said was costing hundreds of millions of dollars a day. In the late 1960's, the Johnson Administration imposed a surtax to finance the war in Vietnam, but most economists now agree that it came too late and that the inflation that resulted from trying to fight the war without paying for it inflicted serious damage on the economy for many years thereafter.
Mr. Greenspan maintained that today's circumstances were potentially different from those that existed at the outset of the Vietnam War. Then, he said, the military's inventory of planes, tanks, ships and other equipment was deemed inadequate, and the result was a rapid expansion of Pentagon spending and Government borrowing to finance it. Now, Mr. Greenspan said, with the military buildup of the 1980's and the end of the cold war, military stocks are ample.
Assuming the war is relatively short and the lost equipment does not need to be replaced, he continued, "the economic impact is quite materially different fromthat which occurred during the Vietnam War."
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that the war in the gulf would vastly increase the budget deficit, but he said that might not be consequential. The war, he said, was a one-time cost and was not "the same thing as introducing a new ongoing program that commits the Government into expenditures for the indefinite future."
Representative John Bryant, a Texas Democrat, said the United States might have to maintain a military presence in the Middle East for years to come. "This cost isn't going to end when the war ends," Mr. Bryant said.
That, Mr. Greenspan said, raised the question of whether America's allies like Germany and Japan should not bear a portion of the long-term cost.
 
Official Economic Estimate
 Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist, plans to release an official estimate on Wednesday that the gross national product fell by 2.6 percent in the last three months of 1990 and will fall by another 1.7 percent in the first three months of this year. At the same time, Mr. Reischauer will release a letter from Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, saying the Bush Administration is estimating an economic slide of 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1990 and 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 1991.
Under the law, the estimates of two consecutive quarters of negative growth, the popular definition of recession, prompt an automatic vote in the Senate and a possible vote in the House of Representatives to undo the spending cuts and tax increases that were enacted last year to lower the budget deficit.
The leadership in both houses opposes such changes, and President Bush has said he will veto the changes if Congress approves them. Thus, the spending and tax levels and the rules enforcing them are unlikely to be altered.
 
Policy Balance Needed
 Mr. Greenspan clearly agreed with that judgment. "Concerns about the appropriateness of a policy of fiscal restraint in a period of weak economic performance are understandable," he said. "However, they must be balanced against the benefits that will flow from adhering to a budget strategy that is geared to the longer-run needs of the economy."
Thus far, Mr. Greenspan said, he has seen "some hints" in economic data indicating that the worst of the recession may be over but he quickly added, "We must also recognize the possibility that overall activity may decline further before an upturn takes hold."
He said the Fed was concerned that the country's money supply had remained flat all fall despite sharp reductions in interest rates. One school of economics, called monetarism, holds that the money supply is the best measurement of how the economy is performing, and in the late 1970's and early 1980's that was the dominant view of the Federal Reserve. In recent years, however, the Fed has paid relatively little attention to the money supply and has concentrated on manipulating interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan's statement represents something of a reversal of the recent course. "I would think that the money supply in this particular environment will give us reasonably good signals relevant to how the economy is emerging," Mr. Greenspan said. "This is something which I would not have said two years ago, but I think we're beginning to see the money supply as being useful as a reflective force."
 
 
Pace of Lending Slows
 The money supply depends mostly on lending by banks and other financial institutions, and Mr. Greenspan said the unexpectedly slow pace of bank lending this fall had led money supplies to be inadequate. He suggested that if the situation did not improve, "further actions will be required."
Presumably, that would mean lower interest rates, but the chairman did not say so.
Mr. Greenspan said he thought the chances were better than "50-50" that an actual recession would not have occurred had it not been for the higher oil prices and uncertainty that followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. But he agreed that economic growth had been extremely slow all year, and he offered a somewhat new explanation for that.
The strong growth in the late 1980's, he said, caused Americans to buy so many cars and houses and office buildings that there was "a glut on the market." When people and companies no longer needed those things, a slowdown resulted from the fall in demand.
"I'm not sure the Administration or Congress or we could have materially altered that or should have," Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: Pope Urges a Convert Drive, Even Where Muslims Ban It

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II, in a new encyclical, issued a clarion call to Catholics today to go out and spread Christianity, emphasizing the need to evangelize in all parts of the world, including those where Islamic laws forbid proselytizing.
He urged Islamic countries to lift those laws as well as others that forbid Muslims to convert to another faith. Without identifying the nations but evidently referring to Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries where missionaries are refused entry, the Pope exhorted, "Open the doors to Christ!" 
 The document is the first encyclical since 1959 to be devoted to missionary activity and to argue so forcefully that spreading the faith should be one of the most important tasks of Catholics. In the United States, the encyclical will probably strengthen financial support for missionary efforts overseas and make theologians engaged in dialogue with other religions more cautious in their statements.
The encyclical letter "Redemptoris Missio" -- its title in English is "The Church's Missionary Mandate" -- is the eighth issued by John Paul II. An encyclical demonstrates the importance the Pope attaches to an issue, and as a formal expression of papal teaching, is an authoritative message for Catholics worldwide.
 
'Negative Tendency' Cited
 In an introduction, the Pope said the document was intended to help overcome a "negative tendency" in the church, where internal and external difficulties have weakened the missionary thrust toward non-Christians. He said the number of people who did not know Christ had doubled in the last 25 years and was constantly rising.
At the Vatican, papal aides said the Pope was above all responding to the rapid growth of Islam, which has overtaken former Christian areas in the Middle East and Africa and which through large-scale migration is making inroads into southern Europe. To a lesser extent, they said, he was reacting to limitations placed on churchwork in Asia and to the rapid rise of Protestant fundamentalism in Latin America, a traditional Catholic stronghold.
John Paul also focused on the church's relations with other religions and philosophies. He was sharply critical of churchworkers and theologians who in his eyes have gone too far in their sympathy for other religions while making no attempts to convert its members. This tolerance has lead to widespread indifference among Christians, which he said was one of the main reasons for the lack of interest in the missionary task.
Such thinking, he said, "is based on incorrect theological perspectives and is characterized by a religious relativism which leads to the belief that 'one religion is as good as another.' "
 
No Mention of Judaism
 He did encourage missionaries and Christian groups in their dialogue and respect for Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. But, he said, this does not lessen their duty to proclaim the teachings of Jesus Christ or "cancel the call to faith and baptism which God wills for all people." Citing here from a letter he wrote last year to the bishops of Asia, he made no mention of Judaism.
Difficulties outside the church, he said, are many. Some countries refuse entry to missionaries, he said. In some countries, the Pope said "not only is evangelization forbidden but conversion as well, and even Christian worship." Addressing himself to theose "who for various reasons oppose missionary activity," he declared, "The church repeats: Open the doors to Christ!"
At a news conference, the Rev. Marcello Zago, the Superior General of the Order of Oblates of Mary Immaculate, said the Pope referred "to most North African and Middle Eastern nations where Christians may practice privately but it is against the law to convert Muslims."
"Saudi Arabia forbids any cult that is not Moslem," he added.
Papal aides said that in many areas of Africa, proselytizing by Muslims has led Islam to expand much faster than Catholicism.
Jozef Cardinal Tomko, Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, inisisted that dialogue between Catholicism and Islam remained fundamental and must continue. Referring to the war in the Persian Gulf, he warned, "We must not fall into the trap of calling this war a war of Christianity against Islam."
 
Islam the Main Challenge
 Father Zago also told reporters that many Vatican officials saw the relations with Islam as Catholicism's main challenge of the future. "And the only way is a dialogue," he said. "That's why the Pope has spoken out so strongly against the war."
John Paul also had harsh words for the modern world and its "soulless economic and technical development," a world of "marvelous achievements" that neverthless seems to have lost the sense of existence itself. "The temptation today is to reduce Christianity to merely human wisdom, a pseudo-science of well-being," he said.
The most painful difficulties facing the church's missionary task, he wrote, are those in the church itself, and he referred to the dramatic drop in new priests in recent decades, the loss of religious practice and values in historically Christian countries, the in-fighting among Christians and the friction between fundamentalists sects and Catholics.
The 153-page encyclical, Vatican officials said, is the result of almost five years of work. It drew on extensive questionaires sent to church organizations and bishops around the world more than four years ago. Its writing took almost two years. The Pope signed it Dec. 7.

HEADLINE: Asians Lead Virginia's Population Increase

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Virginia's population rose by 15.7 percent to 6.2 million in the last decade, with an influx of Vietnamese, Cambodians and other Asians accounting for 11 percent of the state's total population increase, the Census Bureau said today.
The state's population growth was fueled by a decade of economic prosperity and sharp increases in immigration. Like that of other Sun Belt states, it easily outstripped the national increase of 10.2 percent from 1980 to 1990.
Virginia was the second state, after Vermont, for which the Census Bureau provided racial breakdowns.
Although Asian-Americans make up only 2.6 percent of Virginia's population, their numbers increased by nearly 93,000 statewide, with the majority clustered in Northern Virginia.
The state's black population, slightly more than one million in 1980, increased by 154,000, bringing it to 1,163,000, or 18.8 percent of Virginia's population. The white population increased by more than half a million, to 4.8 million, but the percentage of whites in Virginia slipped slightly, to 77.4 percent from 79.1 percent.
The state's Hispanic population doubled, and is now 160,000.

HEADLINE: Michigan Faces Painful Choices in Cutting Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich., Jan. 22

 BODY:
Michigan legislators today faced the kind of excruciating fiscal dilemma that is likely to lie ahead for many other states. They had to vote on whether to eliminate a state-financed welfare program that helps 125,000 poor residents, or accept smaller cuts in a wide array of social programs that help millions of people throughout Michigan.
But even the smaller, broader-based cuts would carry an unpleasant extra jolt: Because those programs are financed by both the state and Federal Governments, any reductions approved in Lansing would bring at least similar reductions from Washington, if not more. 
 In fact, some Michigan officials warn that the across-the-board state cuts, which would amount to about 9.2 percent from each program in the State Social Services Department, could mean a complete loss of Federal money for the Medicaid program. They explain that the Federal Government requires a certain minimum level of state contributions to programs like Medicaid before Washington contributes any money at all, and that the 9.2 percent cut would put Michigan's contribution below that level.
Michigan's new Governor, John Engler, a Republican who pledged during his campaign to reduce the scope of state government, has joined with the Republican-led State Senate in backing the elimination of the state-financed welfare program.
But today, a committee of the Democratic-controlled State House of Representatives refused to go along. The committee rejected the plan of Governor Engler and the State Senate in a vote that was along party lines.
The action set off the automatic across-the-board cuts in all social service programs, at least until the Governor and the lawmakers agree on another way to save $1.1 billion from the $8.9 billion state budget that went into effect last Oct. 1. The cuts are necessary to meet the state's constitutional requirement of a balanced budget.
 
Democrats Want Other Cuts
 Democrats say the state could largely spare the Social Services Department and find other ways to balance this year's budget, including drawing on a $400 million emergency reserve fund and reducing a program that provides property tax rebates. Then, in later years, they would keep the social service programs intact by extending existing taxes to cover more products, businesses and services. But Republicans say the last thing they want to do is raise taxes in the middle of a recession.
The House Appropriations Committee has scheduled six public hearings across the state this month to acquaint people with the proposals.
One of the Governor's representatives, Gerald H. Miller, who is director of the State Department of Social Services, said the House committee's action today would force the department to make unconscionable reductions in programs. It was Mr. Miller, faced with the Governor's orders to reduce his department's spending by $243 million, who had proposed eliminating the state-financed welfare program.
He said that the across-the-board reduction, which would come from the state's $2.6 billion spending on social services, would bring about the withdrawal of $207 million in Federal matching grants, for a total reduction of $450 million.
Worse still, the across-the-board budget reduction, which takes effect immediately, reduces the state's contribution to shared Federal-state programs to levels that violate Federal law. States, for example, are not permitted to reduce their contributions to Aid to Families with Dependent Children below the contributions they made in 1988.
Michigan's across-the-board reduction cut spending on that welfare program far below 1988 levels. The immediate result is that Michigan would no longer be eligible for many Federal subsidies, the largest being Medicaid.
"It's very clear that we will have to send a notice to the Federal Government that we are going to drop out of the Medicaid program," Mr. Miller said, referring to the program of health care and nursing care for people who have exhausted their savings.
 
Cuts in Other Deparments
 The remainder of the total $1.1 billion reduction in spending would come from a 9.2 percent cut in the programs of all departments except education, where a 2 percent cut would be made in higher education programs.
Democratic committee members brushed aside Mr. Miller's gloomy forecast and said there would be more negotiations on the budget between the Governor and legislators after the public hearings.
A few Republicans, too, expressed something like optimism. "The crisis will bring about some meaningful and productive changes in the system," said State Representative Shirley Johnson, who asserted that many people were receiving social benefits but did not need them.
But the remarks of most lawmakers reflected their anguish over the decisions. "Governor Engler's proposal was pretty bad," said State Representative Donald Gilmer, a Republican from southwest Michigan, "but the Democrats' is even worse."
At the center of this battle is the state program, which is called General Assistance here and in most other states that have a similar program. It provides subsistence-level grants to people who have been turned away from every other Federal income subsidy program. Beneficiaries include young men who have never found a job, single adults who are mentally or physically impaired, unemployed couples who have exhausted their jobless benefits, and parents who work too many hours to be eligible for the Federal welfare program, but earn too little to feed their children.
 
Other States Trim Programs
 Financially troubled states are now looking to this program for savings. Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma eliminated their General Assistance programs in the last few years. Many other states, including West Virginia, Wyoming, Nevada and Kansas, have substantially reduced benefits.
Apart from Michigan, which has one of the nation's largest programs, other states have not formally proposed great reductions in General Assistance this year. But fiscal experts in Washington say many other states may have to consider it. "A lot of legislators in last year's and this year's legislative sessions around the country have been saying that General Assistance is something they may have to cut back," said Timothy J. Eckels, a Washington consultant who did a comprehensive survey of these programs last fall for the Government.
If legislators do not act to curtail the programs, expenditures are expected to rise sharply this year as the recession and increasing unemployment rates force more and more Americans to seek public assistance.
 
One Woman's Plight
 When Michigan legislators, mostly Republicans, talk about cutting the program, they often say many recipients are able-bodied and could find work. But if the program were eliminated altogether, it would affect not only freeloaders but also people like Irene E. Guisbert, a 59-year-old widow, who lives in Iron River, an economically depressed town near the Wisconsin border.
Mrs. Guisbert lost her factory job in 1986 when an auto parts manufacturer closed. She said she could not find another job and, after exhausting employment benefits, applied for General Assistance. She now lives on the monthly grant of $246, plus $100 in food stamps. "I don't have any skills and I don't have any money to move away to find a job," Mrs. Guisbert said. She is taking courses at a local community college to become a social worker.
According to Michigan statistics, its General Assistance program has 126,000 recipients, including 95,000 single and married adults and 8,400 families with 17,000 children. A majority of the recipients are white men from 22 to 40 years old and, although half of the state's recipients live in the Detroit area, the fastest growing portion of the case load is in suburban counties. The average monthly grant for a single person is $217 and $458 for a family with two children.
While the caseload has declined from its peak in the mid-1980's, the number of families have increased by over 50 percent because of stricter eligibility requirements for the main Federal welfare program.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Eastern to Sell Northwest Its Washington Operations

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The carving up of Eastern Airlines continued yesterday, as Northwest Airlines agreed to buy the carrier's gates, landing and takeoff rights and other operations at Washington National Airport for $23.2 million.
The Northwest purchase follows by a day the announcement by Delta Air Lines that it had agreed to purchase 18 Eastern gates at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta and an international route for $42.9 million. 
 Eastern shut down late on Friday after running short of cash and being unable to generate enough traffic to cover its costs. The carrier, the nation's eighth largest before it halted operations, had been under Federal bankruptcy protection for nearly two years.
 
Terms of Agreement
 Under the agreement with Northwest, Eastern would sell 5 gates and 76 landing and takeoff rights, as well as ticket offices and jetways.
"This move is of major strategic importance for us," said John H. Dasburg, the president and chief executive officer of Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline.
He said the carrier would increase its flights from Washington next month and then undergo a large expansion in March.
Both sales must still be approved by Judge Burton R. Lifland, the chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan.
 
Other Strong Assets
 Even though Eastern still owns valuable assets, including additional gates, maintenance operations and aircraft, some doubt has arisen that its unsecured creditors will get anything back on their debt.
The quick sale of the assets is what the creditors had hoped for. According to a person familiar with the creditors' thinking, they want to make sure that Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the trustee appointed by Judge Lifland to run Eastern, does not have a chance to revive the carrier.
Eastern's creditors and Mr. Shugrue became increasingly alienated from each other as he sought to revive Eastern by using money that had been set aside for the creditors just as there seemed little chance to stem the airline's losses.
 
More Domestic Strength
 Eastern's sales to Delta and Northwest are expected to strengthen the carriers at important domestic hubs, including Washington and Atlanta.
Delta, for example, has its main hub in Atlanta and controls 48 gates there. With the Eastern purchase, it will control half the gates at the hub.
Hubs have become very important to airlines, since they can provide flights to many points and can feed those flights from surrounding cities.

HEADLINE: 2 Baby Bells Report Dips In Profits

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Two of the seven regional Bell companies yesterday announced write-offs and lower fourth-quarter profits from operations. The stocks of the two companies dropped sharply as a result.
Excluding one-time charges, fourth-quarter profits fell 6.3 percent at the Pacific Telesis Group and 1 percent at the Bell Atlantic Corporation. A slowing economy cut into telephone traffic and the installation of new phone lines. 
 With one-time expenses included, profits at Pactel tumbled 39 percent for the quarter and surged at Bell Atlantic, which took a large charge against earnings in the fourth quarter of 1989.
 
Share Prices Drop Sharply
 Shares of Pacific Telesis fell $3.125 yesterday, to $41.25, while Bell Atlantic's stock plunged $4, to $50, both on heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange.
Jeffrey A. Heyser, the executive director of investor relations at Pacific Telesis, said investors were disappointed because "they thought we were immune from recession," and the company turned out not to be.
Pactel and Bell Atlantic each suffered sharp drops in the growth rates of new telephone lines and medium-distance phone calls billed by local telephone companies. "For the first time, we're seeing the impact of a softening economy on the local telephone industry," said Jack B. Grubman, a telephone industry analyst at Paine Webber who canceled his buy recommendations for both companies yesterday and reduced his estimates of their 1991 earnings.
 
After-Tax Losses
 The companies, created by the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984, each took $60 million after-tax losses for their businesses that have suffered the most from the economic downturn. Pactel is quitting the real estate business, which it entered several years ago, and has said it will sell its entire $475 million portfolio of office buildings and industrial sites over the next several years.
Bell Atlantic reduced the value shown on its balance sheet for non-telephone financial services, which include leasing equipment and lending to other companies and real estate projects. The company announced on Oct. 26 that this charge would only be $40 million, but said yesterday that it was forced to increase the charge because the market value of these assets continued to slide.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Pacific Telesis
The San Francisco-based company, which provides most local phone service in California and Nevada, reported fourth-quarter profits of $196 million, or 50 cents a share, down from $322 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales dipped to $2.44 billion from $2.48 billion.
Excluding one-time charges, profits fell to $268 million from $285.6 million. But the actual deterioration in operating results was slightly greater because Pactel paid lower taxes in the fourth quarter of 1990 as it accelerated depreciation of some of its assets.
 For all of 1990, Pactel earned $1.03 billion, or $2.58 a share, on sales of $9.72 billion. A year earlier, the company had profits of $1.24 billion, or $3.02 a share, on sales of $9.59 billion.
 
Bell Atlantic
The parent of the main local phone companies for New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia earned $236 million, or 65 cents a share, on sales of $3.11 billion in the fourth quarter.
In the comparable 1989 period, the company's profits were $57.9 million, or 15 cents a share, on sales of $2.89 billion.
Bell Atlantic gained only 37,000 new lines in the fourth quarter, down from 127,000 a year before, said Cynthia M. Ciangio, a company spokeswoman. The number of medium-distance calls billed by local telephone companies, traditionally one of the main sources of local phone company profits, grew 2.7 percent in the quarter, down from 8.5 percent a year before.
For 1990, Bell Atlantic earned $1.31 billion, or $3.38 a share, on sales of $12.3 billion. In 1989 the company had profits of $1.07 billion, or $2.71 a share, on sales of $11.45 billion.
Stephanie Georges, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said the results showed a weak economy in the mid-Atlantic region but also successful efforts by Bell Atlantic to control costs.

HEADLINE: General Electric Reports 6% Rise in Profits and Revenues

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said yesterday that its net income and revenues both rose by 6 percent in the last three months of 1990.
Earnings increased to almost $1.24 billion, from $1.17 billion in the last quarter of 1989. And its revenues rose to $17.2 billion from $16.2 billion. 
 Although G.E. did not discuss the fourth-quarter performance of any of its businesses, which include the NBC Broadcasting group, as well as the investment firm Kidder, Peabody & Company, the conglomerate indicated that the gain represented a continuation of trends evident throughout much of last year.
Strong growth at businesses like aircraft engines and power equipment that operate with long lead times continued to compensate for declines in other groups, notably plastics and the NBC Broadcasting group.
 
Report Due Next Month
 G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., releases more detailed information on the performance of its businesses with its annual report at the end of next month.
The company's earnings per share for the quarter rose faster than net income -- by 9.2 percent, to $1.42, from $1.30 last year -- because General Electric bought 41.7 million of its common shares since November 1989, as part of a five-year, $10 billion buyback program.
G.E. took a $100 million charge against its earnings in the quarter to pay for a previously announced restructuring, which included some layoffs, to improve margins in several critical businesses, including aerospace, aircraft engines and appliances. The charge was largely balanced in the quarterly figures, the company said, by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Ladd Petroleum unit to Amax Inc. for $515 million plus working capital.
"It was a reasonably solid quarter, considering what's going on in the economy," said Robert W. McCoy Jr., who follows the company for UBS Phillips & Drew.
 
$4.30 Billion Net Income
 General Electric said its net income for 1990 rose by 9.4 percent, to $4.30 billion, from $3.93 billion in 1989, while its earnings per share rose by 11.2 percent, to $4.85 from $4.36. Its revenues totaled $58.4 billion, up by nearly 7 percent from $54.6 billion in 1989.
John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive, said companywide productivity improvements played a leading role in helping G.E. overcome the pressure on earnings from rising oil prices, the sluggish domestic economy and declining consumer confidence.
GE Financial Services was also a major contributor to earnings, reporting a 15 percent gain from the 1989 quarter, excluding GE Americom, a satellite carrier that was transferred to the Financial Services operation from Technical Products and Services. The GE Capital Corporation, which accounts for most of the financial group, recorded strong gains despite troubles in its investments in leveraged buyouts and commercial real estate.
 
Data Lacking on Units
 Financial services also includes the company's insurance unit, ERC, and the 80 percent stake in Kidder, Peabody, but General Electric declined to discuss the performance of either subsidiary, both of which are operating in troubled industries.
The company said that overall operating margins reached 11.6 percent in 1990, a company record. General Electric's shares fell 75 cents each yesterday, to $56.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: WASHINGTON;
Baltic Officials Meet With Baker And Congressional Panel on Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d received officials of the three Baltic republics today to hear their views of the latest actions by the Soviet authorities to repress independence movements in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The representatives of the three republics urged the United States to send a high-level American delegation to the Baltics and to extend more specific recognition of their democratically elected governments as independent regimes. 
 The three are Deputy Prime Minister Dainis Ivans of Latvia, Vice President Bronius Kuzmickas of Lithuania and Endall Lippmaa, Minister Without Portfolio in the Estonian government.
A Bush Administration official described their 30-minute session with Mr. Baker and their subsequent one-hour discussion with some of the Secretary's senior aides as "a good meeting" in which both sides offered ideas on the Baltic crisis. "Both sides talked on the pros and cons of what could be done and what would and would not work," the official said.
 
Request Meeting With Bush
 The Baltic officials have also asked to be received by President Bush, and several members of Congress have urged the President to do so.
Earlier in the day, two of the Baltic officials addressed a Congressional panel and found themselves outdone in the boldness of rhetoric and recommendations by some of the legislators, who are members of the United States Commission on Cooperation and Security in Europe.
Mr. Ivans, a former journalist, said, "We would like to see a high-level United States delegation visit the Baltic states as soon as possible."
But Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, added demands of his own, calling on the Administration to shut off Export-Import Bank credits to Moscow immediately. Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, said that with regard to strategic-arms negotiations and a summit meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union that is scheduled for next month, "we must send a clear message and cease some of these activities with Mr. Gorbachev."
A bill submitted last week by several Republican Senators would suspend all United States economic assistance to the Soviet Union and adopt a "sense of the Congress" language saying "the President of the United States should not attend the summit."
The summit, described again by the White House as "up in the air," is scheduled for Feb. 11 to 13 in Moscow and provide the setting for the signing of a treaty to reduce strategic arms. Several Administration officials say the White House is weighing the idea of proposing a one-day meeting between the two leaders in Geneva instead.
Aside from public condemnation and protests to the Soviet leadership delivered here and in Moscow, the only concrete step the Bush Administration has taken so far in response to the Baltic repression has been to agree to join in seeking "an explanation" by the Soviet Union of its actions under the 1975 Helsinki Agreement.

HEADLINE: MNC Financial Spins Off Credit Card Unit

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Unable to fetch an attractive price for its credit card business in a private transaction, the parent of Maryland National Bank spun off 85 percent of the subsidiary yesterday in an initial public offering valued at $861.6 million.
While the company did not realize as much in the deal as management had once hoped, it was above the threshold that the troubled parent company had determined it needed to repay coming debt obligations and satisfy banking regulators. The outcome of the offering was at least partly a function of the market rally kindled last week by early American successes in the Persian Gulf war, analysts and investors said yesterday.
 
$22.50 a Share
Under the deal, which was underwritten by Goldman, Sachs & Company, investors paid $22.50 a share for 38.3 million shares, representing an 85 percent stake in the MBNA Corporation, as the credit-card operation, based in Newark, Del., is now known. Of those shares, 27.7 million were sold by MNC Financial, the Baltimore-based parent company, and 10.6 million new shares were issued by MBNA. 
 At the same time as the initial public offering, MNC Financial also sold its remaining 15 percent interest in the credit card operation in two private transactions.
Alfred Lerner, chairman of MBNA, acquired about 10 percent, and the Progressive Corporation, a Cleveland insurance company he also heads, acquired a 4.9 percent stake, at the offering price less the underwriters' discount. Both he and Progressive would need additional regulatory approvals to raise their respective stakes beyond those amounts, investment bankers said yesterday.
Altogether, the series of transactions raised nearly $773 million for the ailing parent company, and $239 million more of common equity for the credit-card operation.
A roughly billion-dollar deal would have been ambitious even in a peacetime economy, but is especially impressive now. Indeed, the deal ranks as the third-largest public offering completed since the 1987 market crash, excluding closed-end funds, according to the Securities Data Company, a Newark research firm.
 
Efforts to Find Buyer
 As it turned out, the parent company had little choice. Goldman's attempts to find a buyer had faltered, and MNC desperately needed the cash to avert default.
Those efforts failed, analysts said, for several reasons. Many banks that would have made logical suitors had their own problems, and remaining bidders were well aware of the firm's financial straits and made disappointing offers. Another blow apparently came when Visa and Mastercard publicly implied that they would make it difficult for any potential buyer that was not already part of their network to acquire the business. That was an attempt by the credit card organizations to make it up to the banks for having given A.T.& T. approval last year to market its Universal card, said Elisabeth Albert Hayes, a bank analyst with Johnston, Lemon & Company in Washington.
To insure that at least the public offering would get done,the company's underwriters had shaved the final price down from a possible high of $25 to $22.50, a mere 7.8 times last year's earnings. The company also set the dividend yield at a fat 7.1 percent a year, roughly half its current earnings. And the company also promised in a revised version of its prospectus to terminate or review certain business relationships it has with some of its former affiliates that investors might have viewed skeptically.
 
Rushed to Market
 But in the end the market rally kindled by the early days of fighting in the Persian Gulf may have had more to do with MNC's ability to get the deal done than any other inducement.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Says Tax for Police Hides Surplus

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins admitted yesterday that his tax plan to pay for thousands more police officers would actually raise hundreds of millions more in taxes than the police hiring would require.
The surplus, more than $500 million over three years, was not mentioned by Mr. Dinkins when he presented the plan last month. 
 The hidden surplus first surfaced when state legislative aides, negotiating with the city over a city income-tax surcharge, noticed that it would raise more money than the plan apparently needed. It was first disclosed in an article in The New York Times yesterday analyzing the difficulties the criminal justice plan had run into in Albany.
"It should have been made clear, that is for sure," Mr. Dinkins said yesterday at a hastily called news conference.
 
Takes Blame for 'the Arithmetic'
 When his tax plan was first proposed, Mr. Dinkins repeatedly stated that the public was willing to support higher taxes as long as it was assured that the tax revenues would be used only for anti-crime efforts.
The disclosure of a surplus built into the plan seems likely to increase public cynicism about future tax increases, some city officials said, at a time when the city is proposing layoffs, service cuts and other tax increases to close a $2.5 billion budget gap over the next 18 months.
Mr. Dinkins said that while he did not "do the arithmetic" himself, he took responsibility for the failure of his administration to publicize the extra tax revenue, and seemed to apologize to the City Hall press corps for putting out incomplete information.
"There came a time when it was made clear to me that this funding mechanism would provide money in excess of the number of police officers we proposed to hire," he told reporters. "We certainly didn't intend to mislead anyone and we certainly didn't intend to incorporate you in our efforts."
 
Council President Is 'Distressed'
 Mr. Dinkins insisted yesterday that the surplus revenues would be used to pay for police officers already on the city payroll. But since city taxes already cover the cost of those officers, the new taxes would free money for the city's overall budget needs, fiscal aides said.
"I am distressed by this apparent deception," said City Council President Andrew J. Stein, referring to the surplus. "Many New Yorkers will feel betrayed when they learn that they have been misled. In these troubled economic times, government needs the cooperation and trust of the citizens. This will make it difficult to keep that trust."
Although Mr. Stein said he was unaware of it, City Council leaders said they had gone along with the plan to seek surplus taxes. Mr. Stein was not involved in the negotiations.
Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, said the Council was aware of the surplus from the first, and viewed it as a cushion to protect the city's criminal justice system during a recession.
"If anything, it is going to help us provide services as we come out a recession," he said. "If that is an evil, it is an evil."
Mr. Dinkins's tax plan, announced on Dec. 5, was the result of a compromise with the City Council to pay for the hiring of 3,500 additional police officers over six years.
The plan, eventually costing $450 million a year, was to be paid for by increasing property taxes, creating a new city lottery and extending a city income-tax surcharge, enacted last year to close a city budget gap.
A fact sheet distributed at the time showed that the tax increases -- including a total of $670 million over four years from a surcharge on the personal income tax -- would raise exactly the sums the city needed to pay for the police plan each year.
 
Beyond Tactics of Bargaining
 But the administration did not disclose that, in fact, the income tax surcharge would raise $1.2 billion, about $530 million more than the amount publicly disclosed in three of the four years, according to city calculations.
In its perennial effort to get support from the Governor and the State Legislature for its tax programs, city officials often ask for more taxes than the city needs. It is part of the bargaining.
But some legislators said the current city effort went far beyond the usual bounds, especially since the taxes were supposed to be dedicated for a specific purpose.
"There is always extra money built in," said State Senator Serphin R. Maltese, Republican of Queens. "If it is built in for negotiations, that is one thing. If it is built in as extra money for the city, that is hogwash."
 
Tax Surplus a Critical Issue
 The anti-crime program has been held up for weeks, as legislators wrangled with the administration over the police deployment plans and sought assurances that the tax revenue would be spent on police officers.
Senate and Assembly negotiators wanted to penalize the city if it failed to hire the officers it promised to hire, by witholding a percentage of the revenue from the tax.
The tax surplus became a critical issue, because city officials wanted to exempt it from the calculation of any penalty. Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that his administration had conceded this point and agreed to the penalty.
At the same time, in an effort to spur the Leglsature to act, the City Council yesterday voted 28 to 2 to approve an increase in property taxes to provide up to $150 million a year for the plan.
The increase would raise the tax bill of the owner of a home with a market value of $250,000 a year by $17.02 during the next six months and about double that the following year.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE OVERVIEW;
IRAQ SETS OIL REFINERIES AFIRE AS ALLIES STEP UP AIR ATTACKS; MISSILE PIERCES TEL AVIV SHIELD

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 22

 BODY:
As the skies over Iraq cleared and allowed an intensification of the American-led air war, allied military officials said today that Iraq had set fire to two Kuwaiti oil refineries and to an oilfield near Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia.
By setting the oil installations ablaze, they said, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq carried out his threat to destroy oil sites in the Persian Gulf if Iraq's occupation of Kuwait was challenged. 
 Tens of thousands of United States-led allied troops took positions along the Saudi border with Kuwait today, and in the Persian Gulf, where American forces attacked and apparently sank two Iraqi ships, one of them described as an Iraqi mine-laying vessel.
 
Bombing Republican Guard
 The American command said that so far more than 10,000 allied combat and support missions had been flown in what has been described as the most concentrated air attack over such a period of time. American military officials said much of today's bombing had been directed against positions of the Republican Guard, which forms Saddam Hussein's most important line of defense, and Basra, Iraq's second-largest city. B-52 bombers were reported to have dropped so much tonnage as to set off vibrations across the border in Iran.
No American warplanes were lost today, the United States command reported.
As they monitored today's oil fires in Kuwait, Western and Arab officials said they believed Iraq had sabotaged the oil installations in hopes of disrupting aerial surveillance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, or in preparation for a possible Iraqi withdrawal from areas of Kuwait near the oilfields, or simply as a signal of Iraq's willingness to lay waste to Kuwait if American-led forces advance on Iraqi troops.
The fires, which poured thick, jet-black smoke into the skies over the Kuwaiti desert, were detected by American satellites this morning, Defense Department officials said.
 
Damage to Field Unknown
 The extent of the damage to the oil sites could not be determined this evening, although oil industry analysts were quick to point out that it would be difficult to inflict long-term damage on Kuwaiti oilfields even if the wellheads were set ablaze. Oil prices rose today in response to news reports about the fires.
Western military officials said smoke from the fires could affect military operations against Iraq by limiting aerial surveillance, by planes or by satellites, of Iraqi military positions in Kuwait.
"Obviously if there's heavy smoke, that's going to affect operations somewhat," said Lieut. Col. Greg Pepin, a Pentagon spokesman here. Despite the smoke from the fires, American air and satellites will still be able to monitor Iraqi troop movements through aerial surveillance, including radar systems, that can penetrate smoke and dust.
 
Threat of Sabotage
 Last September, the Iraqi Government threatened to sabotage oilfields in Kuwait and elsewhere in the Middle East if Iraq's economy was seriously damaged by international economic sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait.
"Oil installations will be incapacitated" if the sanctions "strangle the people of Iraq," the Government said in a statement at the time.
The exiled Government of Kuwait has reported that the Iraqi military mined Kuwaiti oil installations shortly after the invasion, as a threat to any potential invader.
As the war against Iraq entered its second week, the Defense Department said today that the air assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait and southern Iraq had been intensified after two days of cloudy weather in the region hindered bombing missions.
 
More Than 10,000 Missions
 The Pentagon said today that allied air forces from the United States, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and other countries had flown 2,000 more missions today as part of the overall total of 10,000.
Because of bad weather earlier in the week that prevented pilots from seeing their targets, the number of sorties had reportedly dropped to 1,100 on Monday.
The importance of the opening of the skies was twofold. It allowed pilots a clearer look at their targets and at the antiaircraft defenses. In recent days, many missions were aborted because of the visual difficulty not only in confirming the targets but also in evading attacking missiles.
It also allowed American intelligence officers to receive clearer photos from reconnaissance planes and satellites of the targets that were hit and to allow them to evaluate the severity of the damage. From these reports, allied officials can decide whether it is necessary to repeat air strikes or shift to different targets.
 
On Strategic Waterway
 American military officials said a primary target of today's attacks was Basra, which is only about 20 miles north of the border with Kuwait and which rests on the strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
The official news agency in neighboring Iran reported today that the explosions heard from Basra "were so powerful that buildings in the Iranian port of Khorramshahr, 25 miles southeast of Basra, were severely jolted."
Iraq responded this evening to the bombing attacks with another volley of Scud missiles aimed at American military installations in eastern Saudi Arabia and at Israel.
Military officials who had been briefed today on the Kuwaiti oil fires said wellheads and storage tanks had been blown up or set afire at the al-Wafra oilfield in the Kuwaiti half of the so-called Neutral Zone, an oil-rich, diamond-shaped region that is shared between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Al-Wafra is a small, low-pressure field that had been responsible for only about 7 percent of Kuwaiti oil production before the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2.
Oil industry officials said there were potentially more serious fires today at storage sites the two refineries that were set afire, at Mina Abdullah and Shuaiba, south of Kuwait city. They are two of Kuwait's largest.
Kuwait has the world's third-largest known oil reserves and produced more than 1.5 million barrels of oil a day before the invasion.
 
Impact of Fires
 Oil industry analysts agree that while mines could cause extensive damage to Kuwaiti oil installations, the explosions would not destroy the bulk of the oil beneath the ground in Kuwait. The fires, however, could delay Kuwait's efforts to restore oil production after the war.
Smoke from the burning tanks and wells could have a measurable environmental impact in the gulf region, Department of Energy officials said, although they cited a Sandia National Laboratories study that found that "major climatic change on a global scale are unlikely as a result of smoke discharge" in the gulf.
As air attacks against Iraqi targets were stepped up, tens of thousands of American ground troops in Saudi Arabia were moving north, toward the Saudi border with Kuwait, in preparation for what is expected to be a heavy ground war with Iraq.
 
Gunfire at Border
 There were new reports today of gunfire across the tense border.
A small group of American reporters organized by the Defense Department and traveling with front-line Marine troops said in an account made available today that Marine batteries of 155-millimeter howitzers were used to fire on Iraqi artillery units inside Kuwait, just north of Khafji, a now-deserted Saudi city.
One sign of the final preparations for the American-led ground offensive was noted today at a remote Saudi desert camp close to the border, where members of the Army's First Armored Division were finally provided with new, desert-colored uniforms.
Until today, elements of the armored division brought to Saudi Arabia from their bases in Germany had been wearing the forest green camouflage uniforms that, while well suited to European terrain, made the soldiers stand out like a beacon in the dun-brown Arabian desert.
"I expect they'll probably fight very hard," said Lieut. Col. Bill Reese, commander of the First Division's Cavalry Squadron, describing the enemy he expects to face soon. "I expect we'll have to destroy the enemy, its tank platoons, all his armored units, one by one by one."
At a briefing this afternoon in the Pentagon, Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly told reporters that the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "is doing little or nothing" to respond to the threat from American-led forces "except launching the Scuds, which are really more of a terror weapon than anything else."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "The Air War Continues"
 
1. A widespread air assault continued, as the weather cleared somewhat and allied planes hit Basra. The number of sorties against Iraq passed 10,000, but a British Tornado was downed. The air force of Qatar joined in the attack on Iraq.
 
2. An Iraqi Scud missile hit an apartment building in Tel Aviv, killing 3 people and hurting more than 90. It was the first confirmed miss for the Patriot, of which two were fired at the incoming Scud.
 
3. United States satellites spotted burning oil tanks, refineries and wells in Kuwait and in the former Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The fires were apparently set by the Iraqis, possibly to create a smoke screen to limit the visibility of attack planes. The fires can also confuse infrared targeting systems.
 
4. In the northern Gulf, four Navy A-6 attack planes sank an Iraqi mine-laying ship on Monday. Later, Navy aircraft attacked three other Iraqi boats, sinking one. (pg. A6)

HEADLINE: Opera Is on the March in Boston, But Financing Is Lagging

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
Looked at one way, these are heady times for opera in Boston. Over the weekend, the ambitious, rapidly expanding Boston Lyric Opera presented two well-received performances of Richard Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos" at the recently renovated Emerson Majestic Theater.
 Tonight, the new Boston Opera Theater opens at the Colonial Theater with the first Boston performance of the Peter Sellars production of Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro." 
 Sarah Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston plans to present three operas later this season at the Opera House. Miss Caldwell is currently winning approving attention for her Making Music Together contemporary-music series in the Soviet Union.
 But, why, many Boston observers wonder, does a city without one truly established opera company have three similarly sized ensembles competing for the same financing sources -- sources that are dwindling in the current recession, which has hit Massachusetts severely?
 As Bruce Rossley, the city's Commissioner for the Arts and Humanities, said about a similar situation, the Boston opera scene is like "a feeding frenzy at an empty trough."
 
A Non-Producing Group
 There is even a fourth group: the well-heeled Bostonians who call themselves the Boston Opera Association stage no opera performances, their primary purpose up to 1986 having been the importation of the Metropolitan Opera on its annual tours. But they have declined to support any of the squabbling local companies.
 Boston's near-comic operatic hyperactivity stems from the mid-1980's, when several separate events conspired. In 1985, Miss Caldwell fell ill, and while she has fully recovered, her incapacity highlighted her financial difficulties and encouraged competitors.
The next year, the Met dropped its spring tours, creating voids in several American cities, including Boston.
 By 1987, the Lyric Opera had retired an accumulated $500,000 debt that dated back four years to an overambitious Wagner "Ring" cycle presented in Boston and at the Beacon Theater in New York, and felt ready to step up to a level beyond earnest community opera.
 
Another Group Heard From
 Then Mr. Sellars and his musical associate Craig Smith, encouraged by dissident board members from Miss Caldwell's company and support from local music critics, agreed to participate in the formation of a new company, the Boston Opera Theater.
 Miss Caldwell has already announced a season of Tchaikovsky's "Eugen Onegin" with Russian sets and singers; the double bill of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana" (with Shirley Verrett) and Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci," and, replacing a Leonard Bernstein "Mass" that was to have been a Russo-American co-production, a Puccini "Tosca."
 Speaking over the weekend from Moscow, Miss Caldwell alluded to a budget of $2 million. She had placed her hopes for long-range survival in a theater-development plan organized three years ago by Mr. Rossley that would have entailed the city's purchase of the Opera House with state-bond money. This would have retired Miss Caldwell's debt (said to be between $5 million and $7 million) and permitted the theater's renovation. But dire economic straits scuttled the bond issue.
 
One Crisis Weathered
 The Lyric Opera, having weathered its "Ring"-induced crisis, now has a new general director in Justin Moss and a new artistic adviser in Richard Gaddes, who made the Opera Theater of St. Louis into a model of regional-opera excellence.
 The Lyric seems committed to sensible -- meaning conservative -- productions of mostly mainstream repertory with an occasional safe novelty featuring promising American singers. Its board members are suspicious not only of Miss Caldwell, but also of Mr. Sellars, who has many conservative enemies and a somewhat similar reputation for flighty career commitments.
 Instead, Mr. Moss hopes to build up the number of performances for each production beyond the present two, and to eventually expand the number of annual productions beyond the current three. He and his board have been heartened by the public and critical response to their Donizetti "Daughter of the Regiment" and "Ariadne" this season, and are looking forward to Marc Blitzstein's "Regina" in March. The current annual budget is about $600,000.
 The Boston Opera Theater was formed by Robert Canon, who had been asked by Mr. Rossley and others to sort out Miss Caldwell's finances at the Opera Company of Boston. Mr. Sellars, though he emerged from the Boston scene, is now so busy that he will agree only to serve as artistic adviser and to direct his familiar Mozart trilogy over three years.
 
'Figaro' Five Times
 Mr. Canon, who despite lively box-office interest and bold announcements has been slow to generate an actual working company, said that his budget for this first year, for the "Figaro" and start-up costs, was about $1 million. There will be five performances of the "Figaro" through Feb. 2.
 For the future, he talks of a new version of the Boston composer John Harbison's "Winter's Tale," a collaboration with the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, a restaging of a Mark Lamos Puccini "Boheme" and possible joint importations with the Brooklyn Academy of Music. All

of this, Mr. Canon added, would entail an annual budget of nearly $3 million.
 The Boston Opera Association, in the meantime, is biding its time, contenting itself with supporting Boston Symphony star-singer concerts and semi-staged operas at Symphony Hall and Tanglewood. It is also discussing support for a revitalized opera program at Tanglewood.
 "The Boston Opera Association people had their life, being wined and dined in New York, and now they're searching for a new life," Miss Caldwell said.
 Everyone seems to feel some coalescing of forces is inevitable. But no one seems eager to coalesce.
 
Independence and Hostility
 The still-charismatic Miss Caldwell is likely to remain outside any alliance. "Sarah has poisoned the well," said Mr. Moss, citing Miss Caldwell's cancellations, schedule changes and last-minute bailouts. "As usual, she's now in total chaos."
Lawrence Perera, the association chairman, called her operation a "hair-raising ride that I and my board have no intention of galloping with."
Mr. Rossley, the arts commissioner, took a more sanguine view. "She has a history of being a phoenix," he said. "When people say there's no way there's going to be a season, it happens."
 In the meantime, both Mr. Moss and Mr. Canon said that when the Boston Opera Theater "Figaro" performances ended, they and their boards would discuss cooperation. "I don't know if it will be a merger or a cooperative venture or a split season," Mr. Canon said. "This is Boston -- it takes longer to get moving."
 Miss Caldwell, blaming the recession for most of her troubles, suggested that the present artistic climate is less chaotic than invigorating. The combined budgets of the three active Boston companies this season are less than $4 million, compared with $37 million for the Boston Symphony and $106 million for the Metropolitan.
"There are a number of little worlds in Boston, and if you are within one company, that becomes your little world," Miss Caldwell said. "But maybe it's healthier, instead of one centralized company, to have different people absolutely determined to do what they do. You have to keep trying. All of these companies, including ours, will last as long as a certain number of people will them to last."

Postwar Mideast Dreams

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
Contrary to frequent charges, Bush Administration officials are thinking about the postwar peace process. The direction of their brainstorming will displease knee-jerk advocates of an international Mideast conference and give Yasir Arafat a well-deserved diplomatic body blow.
 The ideas, and they are only ideas at this point, are grandiose and sound tinny to a political ear. But they spring from the shocks of war and the power of dreams -- the stuff that breakthroughs are made of.
 
 One track, encased in regionwide plans for economic cooperation and arms control, would try to clear the way for negotiations between two of the region's most bitter enemies, Israel and Syria. This regional effort, and not a Mideast conference, would be the diplomatic starting point.
 The second and parallel track would be laid by a generous Israeli offer to West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians for direct talks. The aim would be to make it tempting and possible for Palestinian locals to split from P.L.O. headquarters in Tunis.
These tracks could be set whatever Saddam Hussein's fate, although his early retirement to the post of color commentator for CNN would clearly benefit any peace process. The most immediate obstacle to the two tracks is not Saddam Hussein, but his now popular demand for an international conference.
 Such a conclave would produce only endless haggling over its own powers and guarantee Israel's isolation and intransigence. But Administration officials know that the U.S. cannot simply discard the idea. Britain, France and several Arab countries are paying dues in war and will expect it as their pound of peace. The challenge for Washington will be to convince them that the conference might serve a useful purpose if convened later rather than sooner.
 The right partners to start negotiations are Israel and Syria, under the rubric of a Mideast-wide conference on military and economic cooperation. They hold the key to future stability in the region. The pivotal question is Syrian President Assad's willingness to play. His historical instinct would be to reach for undisputed leadership of the radical Arab world, whatever Saddam Hussein's position after the war.
 But Mr. Assad is neither a romantic nor a masochist. He is a consummate strategist whose dispatch of Syrian troops to defend Saudi Arabia shows an appreciation of new strategic realities. He no longer has his Soviet military protector and is without funds. To rebuild his shattered economy, he can turn only to Saudi Arabia. The Saudis can use this dependence to nudge him toward talks with Israel. And it is to Israel that he must turn to fulfill his dream of restoring the Golan Heights to Syrian sovereignty.
Prime Minister Shamir shares the Syrian dictator's unromantic personality. Yet he and his fellow hard-liners make no secret of their willingness to probe Damascus on peace. They also know that if Mr. Assad would deal with them, the fearful Saudis and Jordanians would be close behind.
 But none of these Arab states would dare talk directly to Israel unless Mr. Shamir opened the second track for negotiations with the Palestinians. With all Palestinians in a state of shock and disarray, the moment could be ripe for an imaginative Israeli initiative.
 Mr. Arafat chose to back Iraq, and whatever Saddam Hussein's future, the P.L.O. leader and his organization will be losers. They will get no more money from the Saudis, and neither Israel nor Washington will let him back into the negotiating picture.
 The Arafat blunder creates the possibility of Israel's doing what it has always desired -- ignoring Mr. Arafat and negotiating directly with the Palestinians in the occupied territories.
 But no new group of Palestinian leaders will risk stepping forward unless Israel makes them an offer they cannot refuse. At a minimum, this means the right to organize their own elections and government, and not foreclosing their dream of a Palestinian state.
 Israeli officials have been hinting at similar thoughts. For they have a dream of their own -- absorbing a whole new generation of Israelis from the Soviet Union, a dream even many Israeli hardheads now sense will die unless Palestinians are reconciled.
 Historically, the power of Middle Eastern dreams has derived from their single-mindedness and exclusivity. The separate dreams of Arabs and Israelis lend themselves well to war, not compromise. But by ruminating on how to use the gulf crisis to retrack these dreams, Administration officials are on to something bold and attractive.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Buffalo, Finally Favored

BYLINE: By John Pettibone MacKenzie

 BODY:
Buffalo, erstwhile Queen City of the Great Lakes, a town often said to have a glorious past but a dismal present, is certifiably on the way back. Its football team, the Bills, is finally going to the Super Bowl. Suddenly the citizens of New York's second-largest city sense a long-deferred recognition, especially from the opposite end of the state where the Giants dwell.
The Giants, no less entitled to glory for their bitterly fought victory over San Francisco, will meet the Bills Sunday on Tampa's neutral ground. Students of the game favor the Bills by a few points. Whether they're right or not, it has been a long time since Buffalo was regarded with such favor in New York's first city. 
 Buffalo was attracting notice even before the Bills crushed the Los Angeles Raiders and earned their trip to Tampa. "The Last Best Time," by Verlyn Klinkenborg, a poetic account of the city and a family-owned bar, has revived interest in the city while winning favorable reviews. And Buffalo chicken wings, a celebrated bar food, have recently scored new culinary triumphs as the basis for "a trendy main course salad."
There's more to Buffalo, of course, but some other notices have not been so favorable. A city on the way to nowhere, some have said. Indisputably cold and bleak in winter, as the visiting Raiders were reminded. A region quick to suffer economic setback, sometimes slow to recover.
One favorite son, the late Michael Bennett, had a character in "A Chorus Line" speak of Buffalo as a place where suicide would be "redundant."
Not fair. Buffalo is above all livable, a place of diversity, congeniality and stubbornly high spirits. Getting around is easy, and its cool summers atone for some of winter's windy chills. Its legendary trees, blighted by disease, are fighting back. Canadian investors are stirring the economy. The State University of New York at Buffalo and other learning centers spark an active intellectual life. One can only pray that the city can keep and nourish its distinguished Philharmonic Orchestra.
If I grew up, it was in Buffalo. The Klinkenborg book captures many of the sounds and sights of that "city of panel-truck souls." I worked during my college summers not far from George & Eddie's, the East Side bar that is the star of the book. Relatives of mine have recently brought Buffalo baseball to the brink of major league status, ingeniously planting a gorgeous ball field in the heart of downtown.
I confess to a bias in favor of their National League franchise bid. Buffalo's minor league baseball, which outdraws some major league teams, has become a stylish civic event, even for baseball haters, with the help of side attractions like Pettibone's Grill, named for an ancestor.
At Sunday's American Conference championship game, when war anxiety was rising, Buffalonians on television showed their colors -- the flag's and the Bills' are the same -- and chanted from the stands that 1991 will be "the year of the red, white and blue." May the energy of those fans wave those banners proudly, in peace.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Chief Operating Officer For Montgomery Ward

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
In a promotion that Montgomery Ward & Company called a step toward corporate growth, the Chicago-based retailer has announced the appointment of Daniel H. Levy as vice chairman and chief operating officer. He will be the first company executive in more than a decade to hold both titles.
Mr. Levy, who is 49, was previously Ward's president for the apparel and home furnishings group. He joined the company in 1987, a year before Bernard F. Brennan, its chairman, began a management buyout of the company from the Mobil Corporation. Since then, through a shrinking of the company, termination of its catalogue business and the adoption of a specialty-store approach, Montgomery Ward has generated steady increases in profits and expects to report record earnings soon for the 1990 fiscal year. 
 In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Brennan said he was not aware of industry reports that Mr. Levy had been offered the presidency of Hess's Department Stores Inc. and that Montgomery Ward promoted him to keep him. Hess's, based in Allentown, Pa., is a 70-store group owned by the Crown American Corporation, a leading mall developer.
"I don't know about such rumors," Mr. Brennan said, "but since our turnaround lots of recruiters have come after our senior people. But I have advanced Dan Levy steadily with the goal of eventually appointing to these new posts."
The job at Hess's is still open.
"We have to start planning our company for new growth, both internally and externally," Mr. Brennan added. "Most C.O.O.'s are operations people, but I felt that we needed a marketing and merchandising executive for the future like Dan Levy."
A New Yorker who started his retail career in 1964 as an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's, Mr. Levy was associated with the Kaufmann's department stores in Pittsburgh from 1972 through 1979 as executive vice president, president and vice chairman. In 1981, he was merchandising senior vice president for Batus Inc., the American arm of B.A.T. Industries. He shifted to the Gimbels Pittsburgh group in 1982, where he was chairman and chief executive until he joined Ward's.
Mr. Levy holds a bachelor of science degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He and his wife, Gayle, have two sons and live in Chicago.

HEADLINE: The Soviet Union Has Ceased to Exist

BYLINE: By Roman Szporluk; Roman Szporluk, professor of history at the University of Michigan, is the author of "Communism and Nationalism."

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, MICH.

 BODY:
Although Mikhail Gorbachev insisted yesterday that "neither the internal nor the external policy has changed" in the Soviet Union, the truth is that everything has changed.
The Soviet interventions in Lithuania and Latvia have demolished any lingering hopes that Mikhail Gorbachev could transform the Soviet Union into a free association of republics. In essence, the Soviet Union has ceased to exist. The great question now, which will be played out over the next months and years, is what will emerge in its stead. 
 Before the Jan. 13 invasion of Lithuania, there was still hope that the republics could attain independence peacefully and go on to freely establish economic ties that would benefit them all. This still may occur, but not under the leadership of Mr. Gorbachev, who has clearly chosen to save the empire by falling back on the army, secret police and central bureaucracy.
While the crackdowns in Lithuania and Latvia mark the end of the reformist Gorbachev era, they do not portend, as some are saying, a return to the old ways. Given the political change that has already occurred and the country's sickly economy -- which might collapse entirely following a countrywide crackdown -- repression is not a solution.
The current trouble can be traced to early last year, when the Communist Party abdicated its constitutional claim to rule that had been based on its alleged insight into the laws of history. This left no justification, for holding the peoples of the Soviet Union together by force under a central Government in Moscow.
That Government lacked any alternative, democratic legitimacy. The Soviet Union might have been preserved by a popular, democratic election of a representative assembly that would in turn agree on a constitution binding all. But none of this was done. The central authorities in Moscow never acquired a democratic or constitutional foundation. The only democratic elections took place in some republics, regions and cities, most successfully in the Baltic states.
It is revealing and tragic that Mr. Gorbachev and his reactionary allies in Moscow have chosen to apply force precisely against nations that have behaved in a civilized, law-abiding way, free of terrible inter-ethnic violence. It is revealing because the Baltic states are defenseless, a fact that doubtless was not lost on a military that will think twice before invading one of the larger republics, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, where the citizenry is more heavily armed.
It is tragic because Mr. Gorbachev has failed to understand that the Baltic states would have made excellent allies of Russia -- would have been another Finland -- had they been allowed to become independent. And we know that Finland has helped the Soviet Union economically without in any way threatening its security.
Although Vilnius in 1991 resembles Prague in 1968 and Budapest in 1956, there is something completely new in the present situation. The brutal action in Lithuania was condemned not only by national democratic movements in the republics but also by some of the establishment. Most importantly, the leader of the Russian republic, Boris Yeltsin, has condemned the action. Moreover, mass demonstrations in Moscow and other major cities show that his stand has popular support among Russians.
Mr. Yeltsin's move is consistent with a policy he has quietly and steadfastly pursued since his election last spring. Drawing on his relatively democratic credentials, he has defined himself as a spokesman for Russia, not a claimant to leadership in the Soviet Union.
In his travels to non-Russian republics, Mr. Yeltsin has been building the foundation for a new relationship between Russia and the republics. Not only has he recognized the Baltic states but, during a little-noticed trip to Kiev in November, he signed a treaty recognizing the Ukraine as a sovereign state and Russia's equal -- a move without precedent in Russian-Ukrainian relations.
Mr. Yeltsin and his advisers understand that the political independence of the republics does not preclude their economic cooperation with Russia. Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, they realize that ethnic affairs in the former Soviet Union have been transformed into international relations, and that political liberalization and economic reforms must proceed from this fact.
Events in the Baltics have destroyed any hope that economic reform will be promoted by the center. Mr. Gorbachev's new allies oppose the market and private property, and he has removed the reformers from the leadership. Any further reform must come from the republics.
What is likely to happen next? As the Soviet economy declines, we can expect a more severe and brutal version of the Polish crisis of 1981, which followed Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's declaration of martial law. Throughout the 1980's, General Jaruzelski tried to institute economic reforms without political liberalization. Eventually, he gave up.
Mr. Gorbachev's problems run much deeper, since he also has to deal with republics demanding independence. In the Soviet version of this crisis, reactionaries in the center will battle reformers in the republics. As that struggle unfolds, a key role will go to Mr. Yeltsin, because he alone among the major Soviet figures active today has the credibility and vision to offer a way out of the chaos that seems likely to become Mr. Gorbachev's chief legacy.
The latest turn of events presents a dilemma for policymakers in the U.S. and the West. They understandably wish to keep dealing with Mr. Gorbachev, whose foreign policy has, to say the least, served Western interests. Yet, they have to recognize that to support Mr. Gorbachev and condone the repression in the Baltic states is to harm the forces of political and economic reform in all the republics.
In this respect, yesterday's decision by the European Parliament to block a $1 billion aid package was only half right. Actions aimed at penalizing the center should be accompanied by gestures of support for the democratic aspirations of the people.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Densie Webb; Densie Webb, a freelance writer and editor, is a registered dietitian.

 BODY:
IN recent years there has been a spate of research on how diet affects health and a dearth of practical information on what to do in the kitchen if one aspires to good health yet lusts for good food.
Now a biophysicist from Boston University School of Medicine has blended his research with the down-to-earth task of cooking dinner and produced a little kitchen chemistry that allows cooks to lower the fat and cholesterol content significantly of any grade of ground beef, lamb, veal or pork. 
 Dr. Donald Small, chairman of the department of biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine, developed a technique for lowering the fat content of ground meat. A paper outlining the procedure, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine two weeks ago, received international coverage.
At first glance, the preparation seemed cumbersome and time-consuming, leaving some people questioning whether the fat saved was worth the extra effort.
If the most recent national dietary survey is any indication, a significant amount of fat could be saved by using Dr. Small's procedure for defatting ground beef. The survey, conducted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services from 1976 through 1980, found that ground beef was the single largest contributor of fat to the American diet.
Dr. Small said the idea for the procedure just hit him one day while he was cooking, and he spent the next seven years perfecting it.
He now uses the procedure for all of the ground meat he eats. As strange as it sounds, the first step in Dr. Small's procedure calls for cooking ground meat slowly in a large amount of oil, about one and a half cups for every two pounds of ground meat. When heated, the oil causes the animal fat to leach out of the meat and to dissolve in the oil in which it is being cooked.
The cooked meat is then strained and rinsed with boiling water to remove any leftover oil. The liquid from straining and rinsing is kept and refrigerated to separate the broth from the oil.
Once the fat is removed, the fat-free broth is added to the meat and it is ready to use in dishes like chili, tacos, enchiladas, spaghetti sauce, stuffed peppers, stuffed grape leaves, lasagna, burritos, soups and moussaka.
Because the meat does not hold together, making dishes like hamburgers or meat loaf is not feasible. But Dr. Small has begun experimenting with binders like egg whites and oatmeal to develop a technique to make those kinds of dishes with low-fat ground meat.
In his laboratory analysis, Dr. Small found that his method of extracting fat reduced the fat content of cooked meat by an average of 68 percent and the cholesterol content by 39 percent. That would produce ground beef with only 21 percent of its calories from fat, instead of 65 percent, making its fat content comparable to skinless chicken breast.
If the same meat is cooked as a meat patty and the fat drained off, the fat savings would be only 6 to 17 percent and the cholesterol loss 9 to 18 percent.
Using Dr. Small's method, some of the vegetable oil used during the procedure also replaces the saturated fat in the meat.
"You end up with a meat that has the fatty acid composition of a healthy vegetable oil," Dr. Small said in an interview.
Any vegetable oil will do the job. Dr. Small has used safflower, canola, soybean, olive and generic vegetable oil with equal success.
He estimated that if a person consuming a "typical American diet" with 35 to 40 percent of calories from fat substituted one-third of the meat in the diet with reduced-fat meat, he would cut daily cholesterol intake by about 35 percent and saturated fat intake by about 20 percent.
This, Dr. Small said, could result in a drop of six or seven points in blood cholesterol.
For every 1 percent drop in blood cholesterol, there is about a 2 percent drop in the risk of heart disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. A person with a cholesterol level of 250, who experienced a decrease of seven points would theoretically enjoy a 6 percent decrease in the risk of heart disease.
As to the practicality of the procedure, Gail Levey, a registered dietitian who is a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association said: "It is an elaborate procedure, but if somebody uses a lot of chopped meat, I think it's probably worth it. But for somebody like me who only eats meat maybe once a month, I don't know how practical it would be."
Ms. Levey, who tried the procedure at home, said the only way to make it practical is to have all the ingredients and supplies assembled beforehand and to prepare three or four pounds at a time.
Dr. Small insists that if the meat is to be cooked and drained anyway, the additional steps required to extract more of the fat and cholesterol take only an extra 5 to 10 minutes.
When I tested the procedure, it took only 15 minutes using a gravy skimmer to separate the oil, rather than separating it by refrigeration as Dr. Small recommends, a step that can take up to an hour. If the meat is prepared in bulk and frozen in half-pound to one-pound portions, a minimal amount of additional time is required for each meal in which the meat is used.
A shortcut to reducing the fat is to rinse cooked ground meat with boiling water. Dr. Small's analyses showed that fat could be cut by more than 50 percent just by rinsing, but he said that the meat is "relatively dry and tasteless" because the flavorful broth is not used.
The procedure to extract fat works with any grade of ground meat.
The more fat the meat contains at the start, the more fat is lost during the extraction. Though a meat with a igher fat content is less expensive, the more fat the meat contains at the start, Dr. Small said, the less yield there is of reduced-fat meat, canceling out any initial savings.
As for the cost of the oil, olive oil would be the least economical. Because any vegetable oil works, the best bet is to use whatever is on sale. Dr. Small said the oil can be saved and used three or four times with results that are almost as good as the first time.
It's an individual decision as to whether the process is worth the time and effort. If ground beef, lamb, pork and veal are staples in your kitchen, then the amount of fat saved could be significant.
But as Ms. Levey said: "For people who have already tossed out meat and are making meatless lasagnas, for them I would say they should stick with what they're doing. You're still better off eating a spinach lasagna than a lasagna with meat."
 
The Key: Oil
 
Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol Ground Meat (Adapted from The New England Journal of Medicine)
 
Total time: 15 minutes
 
 2 pounds raw meat, ground (beef, veal, pork or lamb)
 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
 2 cups boiling water.
1. Add the meat to the vegetable oil and heat to 176 to 194 Fahrenheit, while stirring. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature. If it becomes too hot, the meat will fry and the fat will not be removed.
2. Stir for 5 minutes, allowing the meat and the oil to mix thoroughly. The meat will begin to brown.
3. Heat the meat and oil mixture to boiling, 212 Fahrenheit, for 5 more minutes while stirring, to finish browning the meat and boil off excess water.
4. Drain the hot mixture in either a large strainer or a colander, collecting the oil and remaining water into a measuring cup or bowl.
5. Pour the boiling water over the meat in the strainer or colander, collecting the water in the same cup or bowl in which the oil was collected.
6. Separate the fat from the broth by cooling the container in the refrigerator until the fat hardens on top and can be discarded or to save time, use a turkey baster to draw out only the broth that settles on the bottom or use a gravy skimmer.
7. The fat-free broth can be added immediately back to the cooked meat or it can be boiled to reduce the volume.
Yield: Approximately 5 cups.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
The Eating Well column in The Living Section on Jan. 23, about a technique for lowering the fat content of meat, miscalculated the percentage of calories from fat in ground beef from which fat had been removed. The technique produces ground beef with 37 percent of its calories from fat, comparable to a skinless chicken leg.

HEADLINE: Agency's View Of Recession

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Congressional budget officials today joined the growing number of economic experts predicting that the recession will be a brief one.
Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the Senate Budget Committee that his agency "expects the recession to end by midyear and to be followed by a period of solid economic growth and significantly reduced inflation."
Mr. Reischauer said he expected the economy to grow by a weak 1.3 percent this year, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991.
But in 1992, the economy will grow by 3.4 percent, he said. And he said that as the country pulls out of the recession, inflation -- now about 6 percent -- will drop to about 4 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 1992.
Despite his upbeat assessment of the economy's long- term performance, Mr. Reischauer told the senators that the economy will shrink for two consecutive quarters, the last quarter of 1990 and this year's first quarter.
That prediction, in which he was joined by White House budget officials, formally initiates a process under which Congress will decide whether to abandon last year's budget deal. But it seems highly unlikely that Congress will do so. The vote seems likely in the next few days.

HEADLINE: Delta Loss Sets Record

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines Inc. said today that it had lost $207.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1990. It was the worst quarterly performance in company history.
The loss was attributed to the surge in fuel prices since the Persian Gulf crisis began, to the recession and to the discount fares that Delta said it was forced to offer to compete with the fading Eastern Airlines.
In the fourth quarter of 1989, Delta had net income of $64.2 million, or $1.13 a share.
Eastern, which went out of business on Friday night, was Delta's main competitor at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta. As Eastern tried to stay alive during a bankruptcy court reorganization, it began offering drastic discounts, which Delta often matched.
Delta's revenue for the 1990 fourth quarter was up 3.9 percent, to $2.13 billion, compared with $2.05 billion in 1989.
For the year, Delta lost $154 million, compared with earnings of $473.2 million, or $9.23 a share, in 1989. Revenue totaled $8.7 billion, up 1.2 percent from $8.6 billion in 1989.
Trading on Delta stock at the New York Stock Exchange was halted for about 90 minutes this afternoon in anticipation of the loss announcement. Delta's shares closed today at $66.625, down 12.5 cents.
Analysts said the last three months of 1990 had been difficult for all the nation's airlines. Last week the parent company of American Airlines reported a fourth-quarter loss of $215.1 million.

Wang Posts Loss Again

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., Jan. 23

 BODY:
The computer maker Wang Laboratories Inc., which has been slashing costs, said today that it lost money in the last quarter as its revenue slumped.
For the quarter that ended on Dec. 31, Wang lost $24.7 million, compared with a loss of $10.5 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Wang's loss a year ago was reduced sharply by a one-time gain of $93 million from the sale of its 30 percent stake in a manufacturing plant in Taiwan.
Revenue for the latest period, which is Wang's second quarter, totaled $551.5 million, down 14.7 percent from $646.7 million a year earlier.
Despite the loss, Wang said its cash flow from operations remained positive. The company reported an operating loss -- earnings before interest expenses and income taxes -- of $7.7 million for the last quarter. It had an operating loss of $8.3 million a year earlier. But Richard W. Miller, Wang's chairman and chief executive, said the company's turnaround plans would be hurt by the weakening economies worldwide, the Persian Gulf war and sluggishness in the market for midrange computers.
Wang's close B shares slipped 12.5 cents today, to $2.625, on the American Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Fast Start for G.M. Redesign Strategy

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The new Buick Park Avenue sedan holds the distinction of being one of the few car models that has been selling briskly in a time of weak demand, and without the costly stimulus of rebates or other discounts.
The Park Avenue's strong sales in the last four months have encouraged the General Motors Corporation in its efforts to recapture customers by offering newly redesigned models, while avoiding the negative financial impact of low-interest financing and subsidized leasing plans, as well as rebates. 
 Buyers seem to like the new car's combination of price and looks, automotive industry analysts say. The Park Avenue costs between $27,000 and $30,000, depending on how well equipped the model is. With softer, rounder styling than past big G.M. cars, it is attracting some people who might otherwise have looked to European luxury cars.
Reviewers from several automotive enthusiast magazines, who routinely savage G.M. vehicles as drab and lethargic, rated the Park Avenue high on design, general allure and pleasing driving characteristics.
In recent years G.M. has introduced many models that started strong, only to fade after the initial excitement. Still, the company, which had been spending billions on new factories and tools while its market share dwindled, has lately redirected its financial resources to new vehicles like the Park Avenue. Executives at the nation's biggest auto maker are hoping that the warm reception for the Park Avenue will justify their efforts.
In this model year and next, G.M. is introducing 15 car and 7 truck models that have been substantially redesigned, more than any other car maker by far. These redesigns and work on new models beyond 1992 consumed the bulk of G.M.'s $7 billion capital outlay in 1990. G.M. says this spending pace will continue for several years.
Recent independent surveys show that G.M. has corrected many of the manufacturing problems and much of the shoddy workmanship in all model lines that drove customers away. In mid-1989, for example, G.M.'s Buick division surprised the industry by earning high marks from the influential J.D. Power & Associates, an automotive research company, in two important quality surveys.
But since its competitors are hardly standing still, G.M. must do more than simply eliminate defects to win back customers, automotive experts say. The auto maker has to make its interior and exterior styling more imaginative; improve the performance of engines and transmissions, and offer more advanced features like anti-lock brakes, which keep wheels from locking up during braking on slippery pavement, at reasonable prices.
The Park Avenue certainly seems to be a step in that direction. Its standard equipment includes anti-lock brakes and an air bag. The more luxurious versions like the higher-priced Ultra have an infrared security system with a remote control that opens the doors and trunk, and a climate control that allows a front-seat passenger to have a different temperature setting than the driver.
Car and Driver magazine, which frequently presents import models as the benchmark that Detroit routinely fails to meet, called the Park Avenue Ultra model "one significant step for Buick, one giant leap for G.M."
Buick executives have been jubilant at Park Avenue's reception by reviewers and the relatively strong early sales. In the first three months of the model year, Buick sold 21,979 Park Avenue models, an increase of 46.2 perecent over the corresponding period a year earlier. But Park Avenue sales, like those of all cars and trucks, have fallen sharply in January because of wariness over the crisis in the Middle East. Although Buick executives say dealers have been trading some import models for new Park Avenues, it is still too early to know whether the division is significantly adding business or just drawing from other G.M. brands.
To regain ground in the United States market, G.M. is trying to attract younger buyers who are driving imported brands, like Honda and Toyota, while hanging on to its traditional but dwindling pool of customers who would not dream of owning anything but a domestic car. G.M.'s Saturn and Chevrolet Geo cars attempt to lure younger import buyers.
The Park Avenue is primarily meant for the typical Buick customers who are looking for a comfortable sedan that can seat six. The company says the car is also attracting drivers in their 40's and early 50's who may be moving up to a luxury model and are considering imports.
"From a demographic viewpoint, Buick hit a home run," said Christopher Cedergren, who is in charge of evaluating vehicles for J.D. Power. Describing younger buyers who are considering the Park Avenue, Mr. Cedergren said: "This is a fringe generation. If the Park Avenue weren't there, this customer might buy Japanese."
The Park Avenue's performance and style do not match those of such Japanese and European luxury cars as the Lexus and BMW, he said. The Buick's ride is somewhat soft, especially compared with European road cars, although stiffer suspension and tighter handling options are availble.
 
Breaking the Mold
 But Park Avenue's price is at least $10,000 less than most of the model's foreign competition. That probably would not have been enough to assure Park Avenue's early success. But the car is also a distinct improvement over G.M.'s previous generation of domestic luxury cars: the Cadillac DeVille, Oldsmobile 98 and Buick Electra, introduced in 1984. Those three are about equal in size and weight and suffered from criticism that their boxy designs looked alike and were dated.
To make sure the Park Avenue's exterior styling was different, Buick designers rounded and softened their initial drawings and clay models. In fact, they borrowed styling themes from recent Jaguar models. Several reviewers noted a resemblance.
"There's a voluptuous quality," said William L. Porter, Buick's styling chief. "Not Euro-somebody or Oriental stir-fry, but rather an American motor car in the grand tradition of Buick." As for the Jaguar comparisons, Mr. Porter insists Buick is simply reclaiming designs that Jaguar filched in the 1940's.
G.M. engineers lengthened and widened the car, which increased the interior volume and trunk space. While the extra space added to the weight, the fuel-efficiency rating remained the same at 18 miles a gallon in city driving and 27 on the highway.
Buick engineers also increased Park Avenue's power with electronic and mechanical improvements to its six-cylinder engine. But the conventional V-6 could repel dedicated import-car owners, who for the most part prefer the engines with more than the usual two valves per cylinder used in luxury import brands.
Such multi-valve engines generally have just four cylinders, but are lighter and more powerful than American V-6's. They endow the car with a higher top speed and greater acceleration once it reaches moderate speed. G.M. engineers counter that the bigger V-6 engines give faster acceleration from a dead stop, a quality that their customers prefer.
Only if the Park Avenue can continue to sell without heavy rebates will it fulfill the auto maker's strategic goal of profitably increasing market share.
Buick executives know that strong early reaction to a new model does not guarantee strong sales for the three or four-year period until the next new model. When the new model was introduced in the fall of 1990 "availability was tight, a lot of people were ordering the car," said Stephen J. Snyder, general sales manager of Wilkins Buick in Glen Burnie, Md. "Now that they are more widely available, the Park Avenue is just another car in the lineup."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Driven Lower On Signs of a Rate Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was driven significantly lower yesterday by signs that United States interest rates may be headed down as German interest rates hold steady.
The dollar fell after testimony by Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, before the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed was considering a further rduction in interest rates, among other options, to help the United States economy start growing again. 
 Analysts said the market immediately interpreted his statements to mean the Fed might move to ease interest rates further, which would have the effect of eroding the dollar's value.
"The market would not be surprised if we saw a further cut as early as this week," said Bob Morrissey, senior trader for the Bank of Boston.
Some traders said they were caught off guard by Mr. Greenspan's comments because the remarks came one day after the Fed chairman seemed to indicate he would hold the line on interest rates and explore other methods of easing credit.
The dollar was down in particular against the German mark after statements from Germany's central bank that the nation's economy could not sustain lower interest rates and needed to keep its mark strong against other foreign currencies.
The dollar settled in New York at 1.4820 German marks, down from late Tuesday's 1.4970 marks.
The apparently unfavorable interest-rate climate overshadowed reports of another missile attack on Israel, which during less uncertain times might have prompted traders to flock to the dollar as a safe holding.
In New York, the dollar fell against the British pound. Sterling fetched $1.9595, more than late Tuesday's $1.9450. In London, the British pound rose to $1.9545, from $1.9490 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Florio Rejects Plan to Raise the PATH Fare

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey yesterday rejected a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plan to raise the fare on PATH trains and withheld a decision on an increase in bridge and tunnel tolls that the authority is seeking.
"It makes no sense to make our mass transit system unaffordable for those who need it most," Mr. Florio said in a statement issued a day before officials of the authority had hoped board members would approve a budget that included the increases. The board meeting has been postponed. A spokeswoman for Mr. Florio, Nancy Kearney, said he was "still in the process of evaluating" the bridge and tunnel toll increase. 
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, whowith Mr. Florio has the power to veto the Port Authority's budget, also has not made a decision on the agency's plan, said his press secretary, Anne W. Crowley.
"We are still discussing the whole budget with both the Port Authority and the New Jersey Governor's office," she said.
The authority, which operates most of the region's seaports, its three major airports and many bridges, tunnels and transportation terminals, has argued that without the toll and fare increases it would be forced to cut $325 million in capital spending and about $25 million in operating expenses in 1991.
The reductions would come on top of about $300 million in similar cuts made last year, when the agency withdrew a proposal to raise tolls and the Path fare after encountering opposition from Trenton.
"I think it's fair to say that we're still having discussions," said Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority's executive director.
In his statement, Mr. Florio indicated he was not satisfied with the speed with which the authority was proceeding with projects in his state. He cited the need for a mass-transit link to Newark International Airport. "More needs to be done with respect to transportation projects that will contribute to the state's economic growth," he said in the statement. "These projects have been in the discussion stage for too long."
The Path fare increase would raise only $8 million of the $131 million that the authority anticipates it would gain from the higher fares and tolls. But agency officials had argued that it was necessary to raise the transit fare along with bridge and tunnel tolls because of a possible legal challenge from motorists over the extent to which the agency can use revenues from bridges and tunnels to subsidize the Path system and its bus terminals.
The authority wants to raise tolls to $4, from $3, for the George Washington, Bayonne and Goethals Bridges, the Outerbridge Crossing and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels. Fares on the Path system would rise to $1.25, from $1.
The agency -- which raises money from tolls and fares, from bonds and from fees and rentals from airlines for airport gates and terminals -- has outlined plans to spend $5.4 billion from 1991 to 1995 on a capital program that includes rehabilitating its Hudson River crossings and modernizing the airports.
Even if it gets the toll and fare increases it is now seeking, officials have indicated, the authority would be likely to seek additional increases in 1994.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Silver Prices in a Plunge To Lowest Level in 15 Years

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver futures prices plunged yesterday to new 15-year lows as hopes for a quick resolution to the Middle East war continued to recede, leaving traders to ponder the oversupply that has weighed on the market for months.
Silver futures settled 9 cents to 10.6 cents lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for spot delivery at $3.908 a troy ounce, the lowest spot silver price since February 1976. The more actively traded March contract finished at $3.937. 
 Gold futures ended $1 to $1.40 lower on the Commodity Exchange, with the January contract off $1, to $378.40 a troy ounce. The active February contract fell $1.20 an ounce, to 378.90.
Platinum settled $5.70 to $5.80 lower, with the spot January contract at $394.80 an ounce.
 
Off With the Economy
 Silver's value has generally fallen as the economy slowed, reflecting both its relative abundance and its use in the photographic, jewelry and electronics industries.
It dropped to $3.93 an ounce in mid-December, but by mid-January silver had ridden on gold's coattails to nearly $4.20 as investors, unnerved by the threat of war in the Persian Gulf, sought the perceived safety of precious metals, analysts said.
But recent developments indicate the gulf war may last longer than many expected, and investors are focusing on the possibility that the American economy will suffer in a prolonged war, according to Frederick Demler, metals economist with Paine Webber Inc. in New York.
"The euphoria of last week has turned to a realization this week that Saddam Hussein is in for the long haul," Mr. Demler said. "Consumer confidence is not as high as it was last week."
John Jonat, precious metals analyst with Deak International Inc., said the silver market "gave up the ghost" of following gold higher and has again come under pressure from oversupply.
Analysts said further selling was prompted by silver's drop below $4, a psychological barrier they said now looks more difficult to surmount than a month ago.
Livestock and meat futures, meanwhile, rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of a monthly Agriculture Department report that showed a greater supply of frozen pork bellies than was expected.
The department said there were 47.2 million pounds of pork bellies in cold storage as of Dec. 31, compared with expectations of about 46.7 million pounds.
Analysts said belly futures probably would open 0.50 cent to 0.75 cent lower today in reaction to the report.
Live cattle futures settled 0.02 cent to 0.67 cent higher, with February at 77.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to 0.58 cent higher, with January at 89.45 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.18 cent to 0.60 cent higher, with February at 51.35 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 0.05 cent to 0.30 cent higher, with February at 67.40 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Kohl Says Gulf War May Bring Tax Rise

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today raised the possibility of lifting German taxes, citing Bonn's increased contribution to the allied effort in the Persian Gulf war as the reason. But economists said part of any additional tax revenues would be used to finance the ever-higher costs of German unification.
The international implication of Mr. Kohl's statement is that higher taxes, if enacted, would reduce the nation's borrowing needs and ease the pressure to maintain high interest rates. High German rates have been criticized by Bonn's European neighbors because it makes it more difficult for them to lower their own rates to stimulate economic growth. 
 Mr. Kohl did not give a specific figure for the increase in the German contribution to the United Nations' effort to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, saying it would be "of a large dimension which we will not be able to finance by normal budgetary means."
"I cannot exclude that we will have to raise revenues for some time," Mr. Kohl said. Asked if that meant a tax increase, he said, "I cannot exclude that either." He did not say which taxes might be raised.
 
'Fig Leaf' Seen
 Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Monday in New York that Germany would pay more toward the cost of the war. Government sources in Bonn said the new aid could total as much as $6.7 billion. Germany has already promised $2.2 billion for the war effort and financial assistance to front-line nations like Egypt, Turkey and Jordan.
Economists said financing Bonn's contribution to the war also presented Mr. Kohl with an easy way around the promise he made during his re-election campaign in December not to raise taxes.
"I would call his statement a fig leaf," said Warren Oliver, an economist with UBS Phillips & Drew in London. "Everyone has been expecting tax increases because the costs of unity are proving greater than anticipated. The gulf war provided an unassailable excuse."
The German budget deficit is expected to total well over $100 billion this year, up from $73.3 billion last year. Some experts say it could top $120 billion because of a surge in borrowing by the five new states in eastern Germany. Economists have estimated the cost of reviving eastern Germany at $1 trillion to $2 trillion over the next 10 years.
The Bundesbank has kept interest rates high in an attempt to counter the potential inflationary effects of the soaring Government budget deficit and demands for large pay increases by labor unions. The Bundesbank's president, Karl Otto Pohl, indicated on Tuesday that the bank intended to maintain its restrictive course.
"The Deutsche mark is a stable currency and there is no reason to doubt that it will remain so in the future," he said.
That stance and Germany's high interest rates have irked France and other European countries whose monetary policies are tied to Germany's through the European Monetary System. The system limits the exchange rate movements of most European Community currencies to a specific range.
Economic growth in France and elsewhere in Europe is slowing, however, and there is a growing fear of negative effects from the gulf war. French officials say Germany's tight monetary policy is keeping them from lowering interest rates in an effort to stimulate economic growth.
"It is vain to think you can compensate for budgetary policy which is too expansionary with monetary policy which is too restrictive," the French Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, said in late December of the German position.

Striving to Keep Libraries Open In Budget Pinch

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
A 13-year-old Brooklyn boy is the unsung hero of the Saratoga branch library, but his may have been a hollow victory.
From across the street, he called the police to report that vandals were stripping copper flashing and gutters again from the Spanish tile roof of the 83-year-old library building, endowed by Andrew Carnegie, on Hopkinson Avenue in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section. The vandalism had begun a year earlier, but library officials said they lacked the $42,000 or so needed for repairs; moreover, the job was apparently too small then to qualify for an emergency contract from New York City's construction budget. 
 Finally, the damage became so severe -- and the rehabilitation project so large -- that the leaky library was shuttered last fall. The suspected vandals were caught a few weeks later.
After lobbying by Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, and an expedited response from the city's Department of General Services, a new roof is expected to be completed next week. Repairing interior water damage is likely to take months more -- maybe until the end of the year. The total bill is likely to be about $300,000.
But even when the branch reopens, the young boy who so impressed grand jurors with his testimony against the vandals that he received a standing ovation will be shortchanged. As a result of budget cuts, library service throughout the city is being curtailed. The Saratoga branch, with 7,116 card-carrying borrowers, would be open only three days a week: Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, from 1 to 5 P.M., and Wednesdays, from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.
Its problems are, in some respects, emblematic of a system that historically has been both a vehicle for advancement and an early line of defense against juvenile delinquency -- a term that seems quaint, given the degree of violent crime committed by teen-agers today. This week, a City Council panel headed by Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn documented an alarming increase in juvenile arrests.
 Among the recommendations made by the panel were expanded after-school programs and greater focus on literacy. Mr. Albanese also hailed libraries as "a safe haven."
Children have been Mayor David N. Dinkins's mantra. His administration has gone to some lengths to preserve the youth services component of his public safety proposal and to all but guarantee that no library will be closed completely. Nonetheless, the impact of the libraries' share of economies will be profound, even if not all of the threatened or planned austerity measures are imposed or maintained.
This month, officials announced these reductions:
In Brooklyn, the central libary at Grand Army Plaza will be closed on Mondays; 52 of the 58 branches will be open only parts of three or four days a week. Nearly all of the branches will be closed on weekends. Layoffs are to take effect next week.
In Queens, only the central library will remain open on Sundays; 35 of the 62 branches have lost an additional day of service since the fiscal year started last July.
The New York Public Library will reduce hours at its central research library three days a week -- leaving some people little alternative but to camp on the Fifth Avenue steps and read what they can between the lions. Nineteen of the 82 branches in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, which receive most of their financial support from the city, will be open only three days a week because, officials said, the library's total allotment from the city has been reduced by $5.9 million from the $68.5 million approved last summer; about 40 employees are expected to be laid off, effective next week.
A Mayor must choose sometimes among hiring more police officers, dismissing teachers and improving library services. Only imagination and energy define other choices, though.
Libraries in many public schools never recovered from the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. Why not find some means of melding the school and public libraries to capitalize on scarce resources? Why not encourage corporations -- particularly those that depend on literacy -- and individuals to adopt branch libraries in much the same way that they subsidize individual schools? These strategies are under discussion, but, perhaps, without the urgency to which youngsters, in particular, are entitled.
For want of a roof, a library was lost. For want of its books, more children may be lost in a tough neighborhood where the teen-ager whose diligence spared the Saratoga branch from further damage declined to be honored publicly because his grandmother feared reprisals.

Is Saddam Hussein playing possum? If so, what does that portend for the course of the war in the Persian Gulf? A week after allied bombers opened the campaign to oust Iraq from Kuwait, those are the most pressing questions facing American strategists.
 Iraqi air bases, control posts, troop units and supply lines have been heavily damaged, according to witnesses and allied assessments. Enemy radar operations are said to have dropped off. The allies say their losses have been tiny. 
 Officials say Mr. Hussein has launched no militarily meaningful air, ground or naval attacks on allied forces in Saudi Arabia. "He has not thrown a single military punch at us," Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon briefing today.
Yet allied officials acknowledge that most of Iraq's army and air force remain intact, despite an air assault of unprecedented intensity. There is no indication yet that the Iraqis have lost either the capacity or the will to defend conquered Kuwait and their homeland.
As a result, a widespread expectation has developed here and in Riyadh that the war is going to last longer than many had anticipated. Three months or longer is now a commonly voiced estimate. Few officers predict a ground attack before another two weeks have passed, at least. That may be disinformation, designed to mask the allies' real intentions, but it seems more likely that it reflects the need for further softening-up raids.
 
Iraqis 'Hunkering Down'
 "They are hunkering down, probably questioning whether we can keep this up," General Powell said. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney conceded that major surprises might still lie ahead and added, "No one should assume that Saddam Hussein does not have significant remaining military capacity."
"For one reason or another," a British staff officer commented, "Saddam has decided to play it long. He says in his speeches that he hasn't yet begun to fight, and from my vantage point, that seems to be true enough. The only question is, why?"
Vladimir N. Sakharov, a former Soviet military attache in Iraq who defected to the United States, said this week that the Iraqis had assimilated much of basic Russian military doctrine. One of its principal tenets, he said, is to conserve one's resources if attacked by a superior enemy, with the intention of launching a surprise counterattack with massed forces.
Baghdad has committed no more than a fraction of its 600-odd combat aircraft to battle, and although a few American officers see this as evidence that Iraqi pilots lack the stomach for a fight or that most of their bases are unusable, many find it a disturbing development.
 
Damage to Communications
 In addition, American intelligence suggests that although the communications network by which Mr. Hussein controls the defense of Iraq and Kuwait has been damaged, there are enough backup systems to keep him in touch.
Nor is there much conviction here that the bombing has sapped the fighting qualities of the Iraqis or destroyed their capacity to adapt, repair, invent, replace and survive, as populations under air assault have often done. Like economic sanctions, bombing has made life in Baghdad and Basra and on the front much harder, but there are no signs yet of any large-scale defections.
A United States Marine officer on the Kuwaiti brder, relecting a typical view here, said he believed he was faced with elaborate systems of trenches and underground headquarters that would prove largely impervious to air attack. Skeptical about what he termed "Pentagon euphoria," he predicted that a bloody land offensive would be needed to break the 30 or more Iraqi divisions based in or near Kuwait.
The American command said today that to date its pilots had shot down 19 enemy planes and destroyed 22 more planes on the ground. Even if the figures are conservative, that would leave more than 500 combat aircraft in President Hussein's inventory.
 
Refuges for Planes
 According to pilots' accounts, some planes have been flown to northern Iraq, where there are at least three big airfields. Others may be hidden in tunnel-like bunkers with walls four feet thick and heavy blast doors, built in recent years by British contractors. Some hangars are believed to be buried in huge sand dunes, making the job of hitting them harder.
"If he has saved all those planes," an American operations officer said, "he must plan to use the for some big bang or other. Maybe a chemical attack on Israel, hoping that if he sends enough planes one or two could penetrate their air defenses. Maybe a run against our ships with Exocet missiles. Maybe an attempt to hit our ground forces as we move up."
Exocet missiles, made in France, proved deadly against British ships during the war in the Falkland Islands, sinking the frigate Sheffield. It was an Iraqi Exocet that severely damaged the American frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf in May 1987. Civilian analysts have spoken as well about the possibility that Mr. Hussein might be planning to use an even more horrific weapon, never before employed in combat, known as the fuel air bomb, which spreads a circle of fire.
 
Closer to Parity
 Others believe that the Iraqi leader will commit his planes and other weapons that he has held back, such as chemical and perhaps biological agents, only when the ground battle has been joined. Although on a man-for-man basis Iraqi troops are not considered a match for American, British and other allied troops, the size of the Iraqi ground forces means that they come far closer to equal strength with their opponents than Iraqi air or naval forces.
Their chances of hanging on for a time would be improved if even a fraction of Baghdad's planes could be used to support their resistance.
Iraq's intention would not be winning the war at a stroke, which allied officers and most analysts consider well beyond Mr. Hussein's reach, but striking a psychological blow, perhaps weakening the allied coalition by pulling Israel into the war and stringing out the conflict in the hope that public opinion in the United States would tire of protracted fighting.
Mr. Cheney sought to dismiss that possibility today with the comment, "He will quit long before we do."
Clearly, Vietnam is the Iraqi leader's model, at least in part. But his terrain is much more favorable to the allies than Ho Chi Minh's, and he has other disadvantages, such as the difficulty of resupply and the lack of a highly motivated civilian population and a mass political party.
Still, even in eventual defeat, experts on the Middle East think Mr. Hussein might be able to make himself a warrior-hero to many Arabs, as did Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. The longer he can hold out, the more he can argue that he stood up to the United States and other big Western nations and the more he can foment continued unrest in an already unstable region.

HEADLINE: Audi Spending Heavily to Rebuild Image

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TROY, Mich., Jan. 23

 BODY:
Few automotive brands have been besmirched in recent years as much as Audi.
To brighten its tarnished image, the German auto maker introduced today its new "Take Control" advertising campaign, which will be broadcast this week on radio and in two 60-second spots during the Super Bowl on ABC. Newspaper and magazine ads will follow in a yearlong effort estimated to cost $40 million to $50 million. 
 Still, like many advertisers concerned about placing their message alongside reports of the Persian Gulf war, Audi has issued instructions to pull any commercials during breaks for war news. The company said it also might cancel ads later in the year "if the economy becomes disastrous," said Ben Hilverda, Audi's director of marketing.
"We're a victim of timing," he said. "It's one area I can't control."
 
Good Reason for Urgency
 Audi, a division of Volkswagen A.G., has good reason for attacking its image problems with urgency. Sales of Audis have plummeted since a report in 1986 on the CBS program "60 Minutes" said Audis could accelerate out of control and cause accidents -- charges that never were substantiated. From a peak of 74,000 cars sold in 1985, Audi sales dropped to a mere 21,000 last year.
The charges against Audi were made by drivers involved in accidents, but tests in automotive laboratories could never reproduce the reported "unintended acceleration."
But Audi has also suffered from a less-than-stellar reputation for mechanical reliability and a soaring price because of the appreciation of the German mark.
While Audi floundered, the competition flourished, with Japanese auto makers introducing luxury brands and Mercedes and BMW aggressively going after the same market niche.
 
'Our Image Was Confused'
 "When we asked, people told us our image was confused," Mr. Hilverda said. "They recognized our cars as beautifully designed with good handling, but they also talked about mechanical problems."
The "Take Control" slogan, portrayed visually by Audi's symbol of four interlocking rings, is meant to convey the company's philosophy of "enabling the driver to have complete confidence and control" in all weather conditions and on all road surfaces.
The interlocking-rings, recognized by 81 percent of the company's target market, replaced Audi's old symbol, an oval.
In the luxury-car market, Audi is one of the few car lines to offer four-wheel-drive, which it calls "Quattro." Thus, the advertisements talk a great deal about poor weather, slippery roads and how comforted the driver will feel when power is transferred automatically "to the wheels that can use it best."
 
$800,000 a Commercial
 The campaign was created by Audi's ad agency, DDB Needham Worldwide, in Troy, Mich., where the auto maker's American operations are based, and in Chicago.
As for mechanical reliability, Audi believes recent quality surveys by J. D. Power & Associates and Maritz, the automotive consulting firms, confirm that those concerns have been solved.
At $800,000 for each 30-second commercial, the decision to buy time on the Super Bowl obviously was significant. But Audi believes it will be worthwhile because it expects about 72 percent of the prospective import luxury-car buyers to be watching the football game. One commercial will be shown during the pre-game show and the other during the first commercial break of the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Super Bowl Is All New York! (With Some Qualifications)

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
A battle between a state's two largest cities sounds like such a promising civic rivalry, a throwback to the famous Subway Series between New York's baseball teams. But something seems to be missing from the Super Bowl this Sunday.
Football fans are not calling it the Thruway Thriller. No headline writer has suggested the Empire Spate. The New York Post half-heartedly offered "The Supe's in a New York State of Mind," and reporters pestered Gov. Mario M. Cuomo with awkward questions about his loyalties, but otherwise the press and the fans have paid little attention to the all-New York angle. 
 One possible explanation is that the New York Giants' move to a stadium in New Jersey complicated everything, since it means that the only authentic New Yorkers in the Super Bowl are the ones from Buffalo. To some fans, that means there are no authentic New Yorkers in the Super Bowl.
 
Shuffle Off to Where?
 But the issue may go beyond even New Jersey. Another explanation for the civic indifference, suggested by the results of an unscientific survey of 25 adults in Manhattan, is that the average Giants fan has no idea where Buffalo is. The typical fan in the survey could not even place Buffalo in the correct half of the state.
Still another explanation, backed by the work of scholars, is that New York City and Buffalo have never really belonged in the same state anyway. These geographers have argued that it would make more cultural and economic sense to put Buffalo in another state, along with parts of northern Pennsylvania and perhaps Cleveland.
The current boundaries created problems for politicians this week. Yesterday, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a lifelong Giants fan, explained his Super Bowl preference by saying: "I've always been a stand-up guy, and nobody can ever accuse me of not letting you know where I stand -- until now. I'm rooting for the best team."
Mr. Cuomo, ever the agonizer when it comes to decisions, at first tried neutrality when asked about the Super Bowl. "Who are you rooting for?" he said to reporters. "I need instruction."
 
Cuomo Declares His Intention
 The Governor cited the Giants' odd status -- still named after New York but playing in East Rutherford, N.J. -- and mused: "They thought enough about their roots never to give up their name. On the other hand, the guy who stayed home, there's a special feeling there, too. But they're both born-in-New York teams."
On Tuesday he finally took a stand. Mr. Cuomo, a Queens native, announced that, having rooted the New York Giants and the New York Jets on to past Super Bowl victories, he would be rooting for the Buffalo Bills when they take the field in Tampa on Sunday at 6:15 P.M. (New York time). This left his press secretary, Anne Crowley, with some intricate -- not to say sophistic -- explaining to do.
"He's not going against the Giants; he's going for Buffalo," Ms. Crowley said yesterday. "He's supportive of the Giants."
She said the decision was based on "a criterion of need," since the Bills were the only New York team without a Super Bowl title, and on the fact that Mr. Cuomo had helped lure the quarterback, Jim Kelly, to Buffalo by promising to support the Bills.
 
'Our Giants,' Florio Says
 Mr. Cuomo did demonstrate some loyalty to the Giants by turning down a bet offered on Tuesday by the Governor of New Jersey, Jim Florio, who was watching Mr. Cuomo's plight with some amusement.
"I understand the Governor's confusion," Mr. Florio said yesterday, "because there used to be three football teams in New York. But the Jets and the Giants play in New Jersey now, so there's only one left. We wanted to bet on our Giants against his Bills. But since he doesn't want to, we're going to send him a nice sweatshirt to help him root for his team."
The sweatshirt, which Mr. Florio held up at a public appearance in Jersey City yesterday, has a Buffalo Bills logo on the front and a New Jersey Giants logo on the back.
One merit to Mr. Florio's view of the game is that a New York-New Jersey rivalry would at least be interesting. The residents of both states know each other well enough to have a healthy mutual disregard. But Buffalo remains a mystery to most Giants fans -- or at least to 25 reasonably sober adults interviewed in Manhattan bars this week.
 
Shrugs All Around
 When asked to point to Buffalo on a blank map of New York State, only three of the 25 men and women came within 50 miles. The average margin of error was 150 miles. The most common answer put Buffalo in the eastern half of the state, somewhere above Albany; the next most common answer was east of Rochester, on the wrong lake.
"The real answer is: Does anybody here care where Buffalo is?" said Tom Leder, an assistant commodities trader from Garden City, L.I., who was one of the three to get Buffalo's location. "When people think New York, they don't think Buffalo. It really would be more appropriate to have Buffalo in the Canadian Football League."
"Buffalo, there's just nothing there," said David Lois, a sanitation worker from the Bronx who placed Buffalo near Albany. "When you think about Buffalo, all you can think about is cold. It's surprising to me they even have fans. I just can't think of it being in New York."
 
Worry About That Offense
 Dave Sims, a talk-show host on the sports radio station WFAN-AM, said callers this week had been been concerned only with the football teams, not their cities or states.
"If there's a city rivalry, it's news to me," he said. "The Giants fans are worried about stopping the Bills' offense, but there's no animosity against Buffalo. You can't compare this to the Subway Series. If the Giants were playing Philly or Boston, there'd be some natural rivalry, but Buffalo is -- what, four or five hundred miles west?"
Actually, it's only 372, according to Rand-McNally's highway calculations, but that still means it's farther from New York City than Pittsburgh, Norfolk and Portland, Maine. This distance is one reason geographers have suggested that it would be more logical to put Buffalo in another state.
One proposal was put forth in the early 1970's by G. Etzel Pearcy, a geographer at California State University who drew a map of a 38-state America. One state, Hudson, would include downstate New York, northern New Jersey and parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts. Buffalo would be in the adjoining state of Mohawk, which would start around Albany and include most of upstate New York as well a strip of northern Pennsylvania.
 
Not to Be Outdone
 Another geographer, Stanley Brunn, has drawn a 16-state America that places Buffalo at the eastern end of a state he calls Industry, which includes western Pennsylvania, all of Ohio and much of Michigan. New York City and northern New Jersey belong to a separate state he calls Empire.
"Buffalo is much more similar to Pittsburgh and Erie and Cleveland than it is to New York City," said Dr. Brunn, a professor at the University of Kentucky at Lexington, "and New York has much more in common with Philadelphia or Boston. When it comes to the way people think of themselves, a regional identity is much more important than a state boundary drawn a long time ago."
At least one geographer, though, thinks it might be premature to expel Buffalo from New York State. The geographer, Saul B. Cohen, a professor at Hunter College and president emeritus of Queens College, agrees that Buffalo and New York have grown apart over the years, but he argues that a new bond is forming.
"As the preeminent foreign trade center, New York City needs Buffalo more than ever now," Dr. Cohen said. "Trade with Canada is becoming more and more important, and Buffalo is becoming the most important gateway to Canada, so New York City needs to keep its ties with Buffalo. I'd keep it in the state."
Dr. Cohen acknowledged that many New York City residents might be suspicious of his enthusiasm for Buffalo, especially in light of another opinion he offered. "For what it's worth," he said, "I'm picking the Bills by six."

HEADLINE: Fed's Advocate of Lower Rates to Resign

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Martha R. Seger, the Federal Reserve Board's most outspoken advocate of lower interest rates, announced today that she would resign within the next two months.
Ms. Seger, who is 58 years old, has been on the board since 1984, longer than any other member. Her resignation will give President Bush his third chance to fill a seat on the seven-member board, but it is unlikely to change the balance between those who want lower interest rates and those who favor higher rates to fight inflation. 
 The Federal Reserve Board determines the nation's monetary policy and thus has more influence over the economy than any other Government agency. It also is one of the principal regulators of the banking system. Ms. Seger has seven years remaining in her 14-year term, but Fed governors rarely serve the full 14 years.
 
Consistently a Dissenter
 In a letter she sent to President Bush today, Ms. Seger said she was resigning to "pursue other interests and tend to personal and family responsibilities."
In the last few years, she has consistently voted in the minority, often as the only dissenter, against what she saw as a Federal Reserve policy of keeping interest rates too high.
At a news conference this evening, she said the failure of the Fed to lower rates in the first half of this year might have contributed to the current recession. Certainly, she said, the Persian Gulf crisis contributed to the economic downturn, but she added, "The economy was slowing dramatically before Saddam Hussein even looked cross-eyed at Kuwait."
In Congressional testimony Tuesday, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said he thought the chances were better than even that a recession would not have occurred had it not been for the higher oil prices and loss of consumer confidence that resulted from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
 
Previous Nominations
 Last year, President Bush named David W. Mullins Jr., then an Assistant Treasury Secretary, to a board vacancy. This month, he promoted Mr. Mullins to be vice chairman and nominated Lawrence B. Lindsey, an economist on the White House staff, to fill a vacancy. Mr. Lindsey is awaiting confirmation. The other four board members were selected by President Ronald Reagan.
The Bush Administration has been pressing the Fed to reduce interest rates, and it is generally believed the President will fill vacancies with people who support that approach. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is known to favor candidates who have what he calls "real world experience" in business or even politics, but Mr. Greenspan has indicated he would like to have a board consisting of economists.
Ms. Seger, who is a professional economist, said she hoped to earn more money by teaching, lecturing and serving as a director of some corporations. She said she might also do some consulting work. Fed board members are paid $115,300 a year.
A native of Michigan, Ms. Seger said her views about the need for lower interest rates might have stemmed from her many conversations with executives in the Midwest whose businesses were suffering. "I picked up a different message from them than I picked up within the Beltway," she said.
In addition to her views on monetary policy, Ms. Seger was known as a supporter of looser regulation of banks and freedom for banks to enter other lines of business.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Move Higher; Crude for March at $22.04

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The price of oil edged up yesterday as traders continued to fret about the possibility of Israeli retaliation for a fatal Iraqi missile attack on Tuesday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for March delivery rose 16 cents a barrel yesterday, to $22.04. The spot price of oil in cash transactions had already risen in after-market trading on Tuesday following reports describing the extent of the damage from an Iraqi Scud missile that landed in Tel Aviv. 
 Robert F. Murphy, an energy futures broker at Lehman Brothers, said yesterday's modest gain also reflected traders' and investors' concerns about a weekly report released late Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington trade group. The report stated that the nation's supplies of oil, gasoline and particularly heating oil and diesel fuel had dropped during the last week.
 
Large Worldwide Supplies
 Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said yesterday that oil prices were likely to remain between $20 and $25 a barrel because worldwide supplies were large, Reuters reported.
Large speculative buyers of oil, including some oil companies and brokerages, are much less active in the market this week after sustaining heavy losses when the price of oil plunged $12.75 a barrel last Thursday and Friday, traders and analysts said.
"They're not in this market; they're on the sidelines licking their wounds," said Peter C. Beutel, an oil price analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
The Merc's contract for February delivery of oil expired Tuesday at $24.18 a barrel, up $2.88. During times of crisis, oil for immediate delivery tends to sell at a premium. The March contract rose $1.56 on Tuesday.
Wholesale gasoline for February delivery rose 0.45 cent yesterday, to 63.1 cents a gallon. Wholesale heating oil for February delivery climbed 1.69 cents a gallon, to 70.15 cents. These February contracts for refined products do not expire until Jan. 31.
 
Few Cash Transactions
 There were few cash transactions for individual ship cargoes after the Merc closed, and prices were little changed, said Cees W. Van Den Hout, an energy broker at Star Supply Inc. in Hoboken.
Several traders expressed surprise on Tuesday and yesterday that heating oil prices have risen very little lately despite cold weather in the Northeast, which tends to push up demand.
Mr. Murphy said that many speculative investors in heating oil had bought large quantities at the much higher prices prevailing before the United States and its allies began bombing Iraq. These speculators are now selling their stocks, and taking losses, each time the price begins to rise significantly, he said.
Few corporations are now willing to risk holding large positions in the oil market, said Alan R. Kaufman, the president of Mount Lucas Associates, an energy risk insurer in Princeton, N.J., that trades actively on the Merc. It is unusually difficult right now to predict the future price of oil, he said, adding, "I and most people I talk to are struck by how little we know."
Mr. Kaufman said premiums for insuring against sharp moves in oil or refined product prices had increased by 50 percent to 75 percent since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.

HEADLINE: War Cuts Companies' Trips Abroad

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Most globe-trotting executives will be staying home for a while. With war raging in the Persian Gulf, many large corporations have banned travel to the Middle East and greatly curtailed other international travel, officials of several dozen top companies said.
At many companies, permission for international trips deemed essential for business must come from senior-level executives. Domestic travel has apparently not been affected. 
 Many companies "have either limited travel, banned travel to Europe or banned travel outright," said John Riepe of the National Business Travel Association, an association of corporate travel managers based in Arlington, Va.
 
Bans at G.M. and 3M
 "Prior to the outbreak of conflict, we had implemented a ban on international travel," said Thomas Pyden, a spokesman for the General Motors Corporation in Detroit. "That has remained in effect."
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, in St. Paul, eliminated European travel in early January, and broadened the ban after war broke out on Jan. 17. "All international travel has effectively been curtailed," said Mark Fenner of 3M.
Companies said they had restricted travel because they were concerned about the safety of employees. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has encouraged his followers to commit acts of terrorism against the interests of the United States and its allies.
Some large companies, however, have simply urged employees to be careful. "We have advised employees to use extreme caution and common sense, but we don't have any travel bans," said Jack Batty, a spokesman for the General Electric Company in Fairfield, Conn.
A survey conducted last week by the Carlson Travel Group, one of the nation's largest travel agencies, found international travel bans at 25 percent of the companies surveyed. "Travel today is much more the exception than the rule," said Dexter Koehl, a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based agency. He said the other companies had restricted international travel, allowing trips only with approval from the highest corporate level.
Carlson Travel surveyed travel managers at 20 corporations. It also interviewed the managers of 20 of its own travel agencies.
The curtailing of travel goes beyond safety concerns, Mr. Koehl said. Senior executives "are very concerned about liability" if an employee is injured or killed traveling on business, he said.
At the Chrysler Corporation, for example, which has scaled back international travel sharply, responsibility for approving trips abroad has been kicked upstairs to the company's senior management, said Thomas Houston, a company spokesman.
 
Reduced Demand for Flights
 The shutdown of corporate travel has dealt another blow to the troubled airline industry. Trans World Airlines, for example, plans to cancel up to half of its overseas flights because of the drop in traffic.
At United Air Lines, "we have seen a softening in demand for international seats," said Sara Dornacker, a spokeswoman in Chicago. "We attribute this to a temporary suspension of travel by business travelers to international destinations." United has not cut flights because of the reduced demand, she said.
Traffic to Europe is also down for American Airlines. In a typical January, American's flights to Europe are nearly 60 percent full. Since the war broke out, the trans-Atlantic flights are only about 40 percent full, said Lise Olson, a spokeswoman for American.
"We have received reports from companies that have canceled business meetings in Europe," she said.
 
Scrutinizing Travel Costs
 While employee safety is the paramount concern, the travel bans come at an opportune time for corporations already scrutinizing travel costs in light of the weakening economy.
Several companies surveyed by Carlson Travel spend more than $100 million a year on travel.
Mr. Riepe of the National Business Travel Association said American companies spent more than $30 billion a year on travel.
The price of jet fuel doubled after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, and airlines raised the price of tickets three times. As a result, even before the war and the threat of terrorism, the sharp increase in travel costs in a soft economy had caused a number of companies to curtail travel.
"This just makes the decision to stay put a little easier," said Mr. Houston of Chyrsler.
 
Alternatives to Travel
 For safety reasons, the International Business Machines Corporation is trying to avoid all travel to sensitive areas and is suggesting that employees use teleconferences or video conferences to avoid trips, said Rita Black, a spokeswoman. She said I.B.M. had been seeking alternatives to travel for some time to control costs.
The companies with travel bans said the bans were in place for an indefinite amount of time.
A number of companies, including the Xerox Corporation in Stamford, Conn., Tenneco Inc. in Houston, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, do not have bans. A.T.& T. has only put out a memorandum about the dangers of air travel.
Barry Lane, a spokesman for the Unocal Corporation in Los Angeles, said, "We haven't restricted travel, but the company has strongly recommended against it at this time, particularly foreign travel." He said he knew of one executive, due to be transferred to London, who put off the move because of security concerns.
A few companies continue to send workers to the Middle East. The Lockheed Corporation has employees in Saudi Arabia supporting the operation of its transport aircraft and other Lockheed products.

HEADLINE: New York Total For Job Losses Tops Early 80's

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The recession in New York State, when measured by the number of jobs lost, is already worse than the economic downturn of the early 1980's but is not nearly as severe as the recession of the mid-1970's, according to a report released today by the State Department of Labor.
The state lost 46,000 jobs between 1989 and 1990, surpassing the 33,000 jobs lost in the recession of 1981-82, the report said. By comparison, the state lost 247,000 jobs between 1974 and 1975, losing an additional 40,000 jobs in the following year. 
 State labor analysts called the current downturn a "new age recession" because it has preyed on white-collar jobs that were once considered recession proof.
 
'A Very Different Animal'
 "We weathered the '81-'82 recession quite well in New York State because it was a commodity recession," said Vincent F. DeSantis, a market analyst for the Labor Department. "This recession is a very different animal."
The report also showed that the state began to lose jobs last January, six months earlier than had previously been believed by state labor analysts.
The state's job loss has yet to be accompanied by a significant rise in its unemployment rate, which at 5.2 percent at an annual rate was less in 1990 than the national rate of 5.5 percent. But state officials said today that New York's economic downturn might be far from its nadir.
"I'm not sure that we've seen the bottom yet, and that's one of the scary parts," said Thomas F. Hartnett, the State Labor Commissioner. "I don't see it ending by midsummer, as some prominent economists project."
The report, which includes end-of-the-year revisions to the state's annual work force analysis, compares the number of jobs in a given month in 1990 with those in the same month in 1989.
The losses began in January, when the state lost 7,600 jobs and accelerated through December, when the state lost 121,600 jobs. The annual average job loss was 46,000, which represented an erosion of six-tenths of 1 percent of the state's nonagricultural job base.
The largest declines were in construction, which lost 22,300 jobs, or 7.1 percent of its base; manufacturing, which lost 58,000 jobs, or 5.1 percent; wholesale and retail trade, which lost 37,900 jobs, or 2.2 percent, and finance, insurance and real estate, which lost 13,200 jobs, or 1.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Foreign Airlines Can Raise Stake In U.S. Carriers

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
With the nation's airlines losing billions of dollars, the Administration moved today to attract foreign investment to the industry. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner announced that foreign airlines would be allowed to invest more heavily in domestic carriers.
He said the changes would help preserve competition among airlines by strengthening them financially when they face higher fuel costs, stagnant revenues and in some cases bankruptcy. 
 As an immediate result of the change, the Dutch airline KLM will be allowed to retain 49 percent ownership of Northwest Airlines.
 
Shutdowns and Bankruptcies
 Mr. Skinner's move comes less than a week after the industry suffered its latest casualty. On Friday, Eastern Airlines, already operating in bankruptcy, stopped flying. Pan Am and Continental are operating under bankruptcy protection from creditors.
Despite Mr. Skinner's goals, some independent analysts questioned whether the move would have much effect, especially on weaker companies, because the rules limit foreigners to owning 25 percent of an airline's voting stock. Previously, foreign carriers were limited to owning 25 percent of the equity.
"I question what foreign owner would put up to 49 percent of equity into a domestic airline without exercising control," said Bradley R. Larschan, the general counsel at the Association for International Investment, which favors lowering investment barriers like those governing the airlines.
"I don't think that given the actual level of control that would be permitted it would have the effect of saving any of the endangered airlines," he said.
A senior Transportation Department official agreed that the new policy was "not a magic bullet," but he called it "a step in the right direction" and said it would help the industry in the long run.
In his speech, Mr. Skinner proposed two other ways the airlines might stem losses: cutting wages and raising fares. He has no legal authority over either wages or fares.
Mr. Skinner noted that pilots make five times the average American wage and that the average airline employee, when ticket agents and baggage handlers as well as pilots and mechanics are counted, makes twice the average national wage. "One might question whether something is seriously out of balance," he said.
As for fares, he said, "Unrealistically low prices are a bad bargain in the long run."
The losses of domestic airlines last year are expected to total $2 billion, with most of that coming after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 produced a surge in the price of jet fuel.
The previous limits on foreign ownership had been in place because of both strategic and protectionist concerns about other governments' controlling domestic carriers. .
But today's announcement signals the Administration's intention to broaden the international ties throughout the airline industry. "U.S. carriers must stay ahead of the pack in the move toward globalization," Mr. Skinner said.
Mr. Skinner, who has spent most of the last few weeks in a review of policies involving foreign investment in the airlines, told an audience at the National Press Club that he had in effect changed the yardstick by which the department would measure the merits of foreign investments. The changes announced today require no new legislation.
 
Outlook for Competition
 Mr. Skinner said today, as he has many times before, that "the loss of one or more airlines will not necessarily mean less competition." His policies, he said, are aimed at strengthening the stronger airlines and encourging competition, both by granting foreign airlines better access to American markets and by expanding the nation's airports so that more competitors can operate in large cities.
Domestic airlines that borrow from foreign banks or companies would not be considered to have fallen under foreign control, as long as the loans did not give special rights to the foreign lenders, Mr. Skinner said.
At least for the time being, he will not seek changes in the law prohibiting foreign citizens from dominating the management of domestic airlines.
"We will allow foreign membership on airline boards to reflect their voting-stock ownership, as long as it satisfies the statutory ceiling, and as long as representatives of foreign airlines do not take part in decisions affecting competition," Mr. Skinner said.
The immediate practical effect of the ruling is to allow KLM to hold onto the bulk of its investment in Northwest Airlines. More than a year ago KLM was ordered to sell much of its 57 percent stake, which was purchased as part of a complex package when the company was taken over in a leveraged buyout led by Alfred Checchi, the current chairman.
 
Speculation Dampened
 At the time, the booming airline business was viewed as an attractive investment, and the decision to limit foreign participation in Northwest was an important factor in dampening speculation in airline stocks. Shortly after the decision, an agreement to take United Airlines private, with financing from foreign banks and from British Airways, fell apart.
British Airways remains a prominent example of a thriving international carrier seeking partnerships with other airlines worldwide, and Mr. Skinner said the policy announced today acknowledges this trend and effectively encourages it.

HEADLINE: U.S. Budget Deficit Grows

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON. Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Federal deficit grew by $7.4 billion in December, swelling to $87 billion for the first three months of the 1991 fiscal year, the Treasury Department said today.
Many analysts had expected a far bigger deficit in December because of expenditures for the Persian Gulf operation and the savings and loan bailout and because of the sluggish economy. But last month's gap was only half as large as the $14.8 billion deficit in December 1989.
The Government did spend $2.7 billion on the savings and loan bailout in December, more than double the amount spent in December 1989. But military spending fell 9.3 percent, to $25.2 billion. Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said the Persian Gulf buildup was nearly completed by December.
Individual income tax receipts were up 24 percent, to $46.5 billion, and corporate tax receipts increased 19 percent, to $22.5 billion.
The deficit for the first quarter of the 1991 fiscal year was 23 percent larger than a year earlier. Total receipts were up 10.9 percent, to $253.8 billion, while outlays rose 13.8 percent, to $340.7 billion.
The Bush Administration has acknowledged that the 1991 deficit will set a record. The budget director, Richard Darman, has projected the imbalance at $250 billion to $300 billion.

HEADLINE: Hartford Panel Urges Overhaul Of Government

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 23

 BODY:
An independent commission established two years ago to study what does and does not work in state government said in its final report today that Connecticut's fiscal crisis offers an "unmatched opportunity" to overhaul the scope and vision of government.
The report, by the Commission to Study the Management of State Government, recommended paring back many state services, consolidating others, capping aid to towns and cities and reducing fringe benefits for state workers. 
 The analysis, based on 18 consultants' studies, would affect every state agency, every public employee and probably most contacts between residents and their government.
 
'The Pressure Will Be On'
 For legislators struggling to address the state's shortfall of more than $600 million in tax revenues brought on by the regional recession, the report also provided support for an idea that many people here believe is inevitable anyway: state government must scale back. And with such a document now in hand -- loaded with detailed arguments -- the pressure to make those cuts has also increased, lawmakers say.
"The pressure will be on now, particularly, to make some implementation," said House Speaker Richard J. Balducci, a Newington Democrat.
Connecticut faces a projected revenue shortfall of more than $600 million over the next five months in a budget of just over $7 billion, and of an estimated $1.5 billion more in the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
 
Far Beyond Finances
 Today's recommendations, even if enacted entirely into law as written, would save perhaps $578 million next year, according to the commission, and about $300 million to $400 million according to estimates by state budget officials.
But many of the most sweeping proposals go far beyond their financial impact.
The study concludes for example, that one of the fundamental categories of state spending, aid to local communities and nonprofit groups, should be rethought entirely because of shifting demographics, changes in Federal financial aid and the long-term prospects for the state's economy. The local grants, which total nearly $2 billion this year -- more than a quarter of the budget -- should be capped and frozen until the new "environment" can be assessed, the report says.
The state's budget director, William J. Cibes Jr., who was a member of the commission and voted on its proposals, has already said that towns should expect no increase in funds next year.
The commission, which was informally known as the Thomas Commission, for its chairman, DeRoy C. Thomas, a top Hartford executive with the ITT Corporation, also suggested cutting back on the traditionally generous terms with which the state has treated its own employees.
Specifically, the report recommended reducing the state's contribution to the employee medical plan and the retirees' medical plan from 100 percent to 80 percent, for a savings of about $20 million, reconsidering the 35-hour work week, and reducing workers-compensation benefits.
 
Drew Angry Rejoinders
 Last year, the Republican Party candidate for governor, John G. Rowland, recommended precisely those things during the governor's race and drew angry rejoinders from many Democrats. But today it was the clear that many Democrats had become convinced.
"We're going to take every nickel and dollar," said State Representative William R. Dyson, the co-chairman of the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee and a Democrat of New Haven. "There's a public perception out there that we're being presented with a tremendous opportunity to save money for the state and we have to do it," Mr. Dyson said of the commission's recommendations.
Some of its early recommendations have already been taken to heart. Former Gov. William A. O'Neill established an interagency task force last year that was charged with looking at every state agency's relationship with the Federal Government and finding all the loopholes to squeeze out Federal dollars in grants or other aid.
Other recommendations are clearly moving through the system. On Tuesday, for example, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. announced that as many as 180 state employees at the Department of Mental Retardation's Mansfield Training School could be laid off to save money. Today, the report said the school should be closed.
 
A Bonus System
 Some of the changes seem to further what has been a trend in Connecticut for years anyway. The study recommended that many of the duties now performed by county sheriffs, such as providing security in court buildings, be scaled back, eliminated, or folded into state agencies like the Department of Correction. County sheriffs are a last vestige of county government, which was abolished in the 1960's.
Other proposals would take the state into new territory. The study suggests implementing a bonus system that would directly link a manager's performance to his pay -- an idea completely alien to civil service tradition.
But the commission also stopped short on many recommendations. One consultant suggested, for instance, that the state reduce the number of local offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles, from 18 to 8. In its final document, however, the commission said that while such ideas should perhaps be considered in the long-run, the consolidation would cause too much inconvenience to be worthwhile for the moment, and was perhaps impractical given the realities of the legislative process.
"There will have to be an attitudinal change," the commission's report said. "Legislators cannot rise in opposition every time someone suggests closing a school or a court house or shutting down a motor-vehicle office in their district."

Business activity was falling in most parts of the country in the weeks leading up to the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf, with little sign that the contraction was being blunted by lower interest rates, a Federal Reserve survey showed today.
The Fed's "beige book" report on current economic conditions called the situation in the gulf "a key determinant of both current and future economic activity," which the Fed said "appears to be declining in most districts." 
 The survey, taken to help the Fed prepare for its Feb. 5-6 meeting to plot monetary strategy for the rest of the winter, suggested that further cuts in interest rates lie ahead.
 
'Additional Easing' Is Seen
 "The report strongly supports the case that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve additional easing steps," said Robert T. McGee, chief economist for the Tokai Bank Ltd.
He said his view was strengthened by statements to this effect by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, in appearances before Congress on Tuesday and again this morning. Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee today that the Fed would act in a "shorter rather than a longer" period to spur greater lending and borrowing.
Both the stock and bond markets reacted positively to the Fed chairman's comments. Traders said the prospect of lower rates helped push up the Dow Jones industrial average, which ended the day ahead 15.84 points. And prices of Treasury notes and bonds also rose and yields fell. But the dollar, whose value is eroded by lower rates, dropped against most leading currencies.
 
A Resignation Announced
 The most consistent champion of easier credit on the Fed, meanwhile, announced today that she was resigning. Martha R. Seger, who has been on the seven-member board since 1984, said she would be leaving within the next two months. Although departing board members normally remove themselves from policy actions that will extend beyond their terms, Ms. Seger said she saw no reason why she would not vote at the policy meeting in two weeks. [Page D16.]
The beige book report today stated that so far "interest rate declines have done little to stimulate residential housing" and, by implication, other interest-sensitive parts of the economy.
The survey, which consists of anecdotal evidence collected by the Fed's 12 district banks, was compiled this time by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The information was collected before Jan. 14.
"Despite continued export growth," the Fed found, "manufacturing orders, employment and shipments have weakened" and construction is still slowing in most places. It also cited "widespread weakness" in both consumer and business loan demand, and even farm incomes, which had been holding firm, "have weakened somewhat."
Inflation, however, "does not appear to be accelerating," the survey declared.
Nearly all the Fed's districts reported weak or falling activity in manufacturing, it said, but export growth remained stronger than domestic growth in Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco. Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis reported a drop in automobile output that had spread to the auto makers' suppliers and other related sectors.
The Cleveland Fed reported signs of consumer distress, including increases in auto repossessions and foreclosures.
The New York district's economy was reported to have remained "soft to mixed," with office vacancy rates rising in both midtown and downtown Manhattan in recent weeks. Upstate merchants were said to be hopeful of finding new customers from Canada, which in mid-December imposed a 7 percent sales tax.
Mr. Greenspan said again today that while there was some evidence that the "intensity of the credit crunch may be topping out, it is sufficiently severe to create considerable concerns at the Federal Reserve."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Fire Fight;
U.S. and Iraqi Soldiers Skirmish Near Border

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 23

 BODY:
In the first significant ground skirmish reported in the Persian Gulf war, Iraqi troops crossed the border into the Saudi desert on Tuesday night and exchanged fire with American troops, wounding two of them before six of the Iraqis were taken prisoner, United States military officials said today.
The clash near the Iraqi-Saudi border was disclosed in a Pentagon statement released here on a day when Iraq launched more missiles on eastern Saudi Arabia and Israel and as Iraqi forces continued sporadic artillery fire against American-led troops massing near Kuwait. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the missile attacks tonight. 
 American officials said relatively clear weather in the northern Persian Gulf today allowed extensive bombing of targets in Iraq and Kuwait.
The air forces of the anti-Iraq coalition, led by bombers and attack jets from the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia, have flown more than 12,000 sorties since Jan. 16, the officials said today; they said 6,000 of those were combat missions.
 
Small Arms Fire Returned
 The pilot of an American Marine Harrier jet was killed today when the vertical-takeoff plane crashed during an exercise. There were no reports of allied planes lost today in combat.
According to the Defense Department's account of Tuesday night's fighting, soldiers from the Army's Third Armored Cavalry, working from an observation point near the Saudi border with Iraq, confronted an Iraqi patrol and returned small arms fire.
The department did not provide details on the two soldiers' wounds, except to say that they had received medical treatment and have returned to duty. The Iraqi prisoners of war were moved to a Saudi detention center, the statement said.
American officials denied an Iraqi assertion that American troops were captured in the skirmish, the exact location of which was not disclosed. The Iraqi assertion was reported by the official Iranian press agency.
As coalition forces make final preparations for what is expected to be a large-scale ground war against Iraq, the border region between Saudi Arabia and Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait has grown tense.
 
'The Knockout Punch'
 A small group of American reporters, organized by the Defense Department under restrictions for covering the war, provided details today of an American artillery attack on mobile Iraqi batteries in southern Kuwait on Tuesday night.
According to one report, American forces fired 155-millimeter howitzer salvos against Iraqi border forces that had been responsible for what American military officials called harassment rocket attacks against American soldiers dug in close to the border.
The First and Second Marine Divisions are stationed across miles of Saudi desert near the Kuwaiti border. Should a ground war against Iraq begin, it will be the first time the two divisions have fought side by side since World War II.
"We are looking to deliver the knockout punch," said Capt. Bryan McCoy, a 28-year-old infantry commander from Norman, Okla.
Iraq responded to the American-led, week-old bombing assault with yet another volley of Scud missiles tonight on eastern Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Initial reports indicated that at least three missiles had been launched at 11 P.M., one each against Riyadh, the Saudi capital; Dhahran, the Saudi oil industry center, and another area in central Saudi Arabia.
There were no reports of injuries in Saudi Arabia, and military officials said they believed that the Scuds aimed at Riyadh and Dhahran had been intercepted by American-made Patriot anti-missile missiles.
 
Iraq Halts Gasoline Distribution
AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 23 (Special to The New York Times) -- Iraq reported today that distribution of gasoline had been halted throughout the country to marshal supplies, suggesting that the allied air assault and economic sanctions are forcing the authorities to divert essential supplies to the military.
Earlier this week, residents of Baghdad reported long lines at the few gasoline stations still open.
In a commentary, Baghdad Radio also said that the Iraqi missile that hit a Tel Aviv suburb on Tuesday night showed "the superior creativity of the Iraqi mind." The remarks were broadcast hours before another Iraqi missile attack was thwarted tonight over northern Israel by Patriot missiles. Three people died and nearly 100 were wounded in the attack Tuesday night.
The Iraqi radio also reported the capture of a British pilot that it identified as Robert Stewart, and said that more than 20 allied pilots previously captured had been moved to "vital targets" to serve as shields against allied attacks.
Baghdad Radio also asserted that at least 60 more Iraqi civilians had been killed in allied attacks, 13 of them when a downed plane plowed into four houses. That brings the total number of civilian deaths reported by Iraq to about 100.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Japan;
Japan Pledges $9 Billion to War Amid Opposition

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Japanese Government said today it would contribute $9 billion to the allied force fighting Iraq and supply military aircraft for evacuating refugees from the war zone. But both proposals are encountering stiff opposition among the Japanese people.
The money would be in addition to the $4 billion in aid already promised by Japan, although less than half of that pledge has actually been disbursed. Half of the earlier sum was earmarked for the war effort and half for economic assistance to Jordan, Egypt and Turkey. 
 To pay for its contribution, the Government must obatin legislative approval. The opposition has focused on reports this week that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will soon propose a special tax and possibly a bond issue to raise the cash as quickly as possible.
Officials expressed confidence that they would win Parliament's approval of the tax and the airlift measures. But the Government has had problems mustering a consensus even within its own leadership and that of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
 
Kaifu Canceled Announcement
 On Wednesday evening, Mr. Kaifu suffered embarrassment when he was forced to cancel a news conference at which he was planning to unveil the aid proposal and outline his views on Japan's role in the war.
Officials said the cancellation was the result of squabbling among Government officials and senior members of the ruling party and of criticism from opposition parties controlling the upper house of Parliament.
There has been disagreement about how many strings are to be attached to the new money. Up to now, Japan's aid to the gulf military effort has been restricted to nonlethal support. Even the cash has come with a requirement that it not be spent on arms or ammunition.
The United States has asked that these restrictions be removed, but the announcement today left them in effect for the time being.
 
Opposition to War
 The announcement also comes amid growing dissatisfaction with the American-led offensive against Iraq. Some officials in the Government are worried that news accounts and television commentary has focused over the last week on the American decision to wage war rather than on the Iraq's initial invasion of Kuwait.
Opposition in Japan has focused on the price tag of the aid proposal, estimated earlier as ranging from $5 billion to $10 billion. The possibility of a tax is increasingly denounced by business and consumer groups.
The Japanese press has described the proposed aid as equivalent to Japan's annual welfare payments, and the tax as equivalent to $75 for every man, woman and child in Japan. Many seem shocked at the amount of money Japan is being asked to pay.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Egypt;
In Egypt, Public Sentiment Is Shifting in Baghdad's Favor

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 23

 BODY:
A segment of public opinion in Egypt, the largest Arab country and a key Arab ally of the United States, is clearly shifting in favor of Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.
The shift is evident enough to force the Government of President Hosni Mubarak to step back from its propaganda campaign against Iraq and to recast its stance as one dictated by the United Nations rather than Egyptian national interest. 
 Apparently taken aback by this rapidly growing shift in public opinion in favor of Iraq, the Government extended the midyear vacation for high schools and universities, out of fear that public demonstrations in favor of Iraq might break out if students returned now and that other Egyptians might join in.
Fundamentalist Islamic forces and leftist secular opposition parties have called for a pro-Iraqi rally this week.
The shift has been equally clear in the growing criticism by the Egyptian public of what they perceive as the callous behavior of many Kuwaiti exiles, sitting out the war in luxury hotels in Egypt and "struggling in the discos," as some Egyptians have described it. And it is finding an echo in the apologetic comments by the Cairo Government about its military participation in the war, with 45,000 soldiers making up the second largest army contingent among the allied forces in Saudi Arabia.
Of equal significance is the visible and increasingly solitary role of Mr. Mubarak, who has made himself the central Egyptian and Arab figure in the overt anti-Iraqi campaign, in the same way President Anwar el-Sadat, shortly before his slaying by Muslim fundamentalists in 1981, became a lone figure defending his signing of a peace treaty with Israel.
By contrast, other leaders of the Arab pro-Western alliance, including King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the Emir of Kuwait, have kept a low profile and limited their verbal assaults on the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, to occasional comments.
"Mubarak is committing a tactical mistake by making himself the center of all comments and positions about Iraq to the exclusion of other senior officials in Egypt," said Tahseen Bashir, a former senior Egyptian diplomat who was a close aide to Mr. Sadat.
This apparent change in Egyptian attitudes is in direct contrast to what seemed to be total support for Mr. Mubarak in August, immediately after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He took a very hard line against Iraq and Mr. Hussein as most Egyptians were aghast at the sight of Egyptian refugees streaming out of Iraq and Kuwait, penniless and jobless.
But over the last few months, the feeling that the Arab gulf nations have not done much to ease Egypt's growing economic burdens, in addition to the killing of 21 Palestinians by Israelis at Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem, has diluted enthusiasm for Mr. Mubarak's anti-Iraqi stand.
In addition, over the last few days, many Egyptians have been shocked by the force and breadth of the allied aerial bombing of Baghdad and other places in Iraq, where nearly a million Egyptians continue to live and work, seeing in it a measure of carelessness for the value of Arab lives that exceeds what is necessary to force Iraq out of Kuwait. This has been aggravated by incidents that betray a growth of anti-Arab sentiment in Western Europe and the United States, which have been reported here.
In the six days since the war started, Egyptian professional groups of engineers, doctors, pharmacists and students as well as leading figures in the opposition and other Egyptians have been arguing that Egypt's troops stationed in the gulf region should not take part in any assault on Kuwait with allied troops led by the United States.
Instead, these voices call for the Egyptian military forces in Saudi Arabia to limit their mission to defending Islamic holy places in Mecca and Medina, close to the Red Sea and away from the borders of Kuwait on the Persian Gulf coast where allied attacks are expected.
In addition, there is increasing skepticism among a widening segment of the Egyptian public about the ability of the American-led troops to wipe out Iraqi defenses and score clear "surgical" strikes against Iraqi troops and a growing suspicion that Iraq is far from being down and out.
 
Islamic Militants a Problem
 By far the most worrisome opposition for the Government has come from the militant ranks of Islamic fundamentalists.
A leading opposition weekly newspaper representing Islamic groups, Al Shaab, said in a fiery front-page editorial this week, "The blood being spilled in Iraq is our blood, and the bodies being torn on the land of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are our bodies." The editorial went on to ask the Egyptian Goverment whether "all this destruction being sowed across Iraq in the name of liberating Kuwait or out of love for the ruling Al Sabah family of Kuwait" could be justified by any other purpose.
Al Shaab said the lives of the million Egyptians still in Iraq were also endangered by the United States-led bombing campaign.
The growing opposition against the war and against Egypt's part in it is affected by three factors that in some ways bring even those who support the eradication of the Iraqi Government together with those who oppose any action against Iraq.
 
Insufficient Reward Seen
 The most important factor is the view that Mr. Mubarak was feeble in negotiating the terms of his support for Saudi Arabia and the United States. This argument maintains that the country got little for its involvement save for vague promises of financial support and the elimination of about $14 billion in debts owed to the United States for arms purchases and to Arab oil-producing countries -- debts that the country was not expected to pay anyway.
"Egypt's support for the multinational campaign is like a match," said Mohammad Farid, an Egyptian businessman. "It is valuable before you strike it, but it looses all its value once it has been lit." He opposes Iraq's invasion of Kuwait but argues that without Egypt's commitment of troops it would have been impossible for the United States to put an Arab face on the international coalition.
"I think we should have sat down with the Saudis and insisted on a written commitment that after the war Egyptians will get an absolute priority in the reconstruction of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in terms of expatriate labor as well as substantial financial assistance in real numbers," Mr. Farid added. "We have lost almost a million jobs in Kuwait and Iraq because of this invasion and the return of Egyptian expatriates without their money or possessions as unemployed persons here. The Syrians got cold cash from these regimes because they bargained hard. Mubarak has been too soft."
The second factor is the strong alliance of the United States with Israel that has resurfaced in the aftermath of Iraq's Scud missile attacks against Israel. That revived alliance has aroused the almost automatic reflex widely shared by many Egyptians of not wanting to appear to side with these two Westernized nations against an Arab country.
The Muslim Brotherhood party, a very strong political force, is banned from taking part in Egyptian politics as a religious institution but is allowed to play what turns out to be a big role as an instigator of pan-Islamic feelings against the West.
Finally, one of the principal sources of eroding support for Mr. Mubarak is the prospect that the gulf war will be long and bloody, a prospect that contradicts his repeated assertions that Iraq will crumble in the face of the superior technological and military might of the American-led forces in a matter of days.
Mr. Mubarak, undoubtedly feeling this mounting criticism, has scheduled an address to the nation in the form of a speech Thursday to a combined session of Parliament and the Shura, or consultative council.
But it is already clear that the longer the war lasts, the stronger the opposition to it here will become.
"I do not think it will reach the point of freezing Egypt's armed forces' participation in the war effort, but the longer this goes on, the more it will arouse feeling of sympathy for the Iraqi people," Salamah Ahmad Salamah, the managing editor of Egypt's main daily newspaper, the Government-owned Al Ahram, said in an interview here today.

HEADLINE: Fourth-Quarter Profit Dropped 10% at Southwestern Bell

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Southwestern Bell Corporation announced yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings had fallen 10 percent because of one-time charges.
Southwestern Bell, the main provider of local telephone service in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, reported fourth-quarter profits of $267.5 million, or 89 cents a share, on revenues of $2.45 billion. This compared with earnings of $297.2 million, or 99 cents a share, on sales of $2.32 billion a year earlier.
The company's results roughly matched analysts' expectations, although the company suffered a sharp drop in the number of new telephone lines it installed, said Joel D. Gross, a telephone industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a New York brokerage.
 
Concern Over Regional Economy
 "The concern is where the regional economy goes from here," he added.
Excluding $45 million in special charges, Southwestern Bell's profits rose 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter, to $312.5 million. The biggest of these special charges was for a voluntary severance and retirement plan accepted by 1,100 managers.
Southwestern Bell said that it acquired a record 92,000 new cellular phone customers in the fourth quarter. But its total number of conventional phone lines increased by only 15,000, down from 110,000 lines a year earlier, and from 140,000 in the third quarter of 1990.
The fall in new phone lines reflected a reluctance by residential customers to install a second phone line and a reduced effort by the company to promote such lines, said Susan B. Fox, Southwestern's managing director of investor relations.
The business market for telephone services remains strong in the region, she added.
For all of 1990, Southwestern Bell earned $1.10 billion, or $3.67 a share, on sales of $9.11 billion. In 1989, the company had profits of $1.09 billion, or $3.64 a share, on sales of $8.73 billion.
 
Shares Drop $2.375
 Shares in Southwestern Bell dropped $2.375 in a rising market yesterday to close at $50.25. The stock had already fallen $2.625 on Tuesday. The shares of the other regional Bell companies, with the exception of the Nynex Corporation, all fell by at least $1 yesterday for the second day.
The Pacific Telesis Group and the Bell Atlantic Corporation announced weak fourth-quarter results on Tuesday. The recession was blamed for the poor performances. Pactel fell $3.125 on Tuesday and another $1.50 yesterday, to $39.75. Bell Atlantic dropped $4 on Tuesday and another $2 yesterday, to $48.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Germany;
Kohl Is Sending $165 Million In Humanitarian Aid to Israel

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced today that his Government would send $165 million to Israel as "immediate humanitarian aid" after Iraqi missile attacks, and that more money would be sent to support the anti-Iraq alliance in the Persian Gulf.
"The news of renewed rocket attacks by Iraq against the territory of Israel fills us Germans with deep outrage," Mr. Kohl said at a news conference. "It is a clear blow against Israel's integrity and right to exist, for which we Germans have a special responsibility." 
 Mr. Kohl said he would send Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to Israel to demonstrate German support.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Jerusalem welcomed the gesture as "very, very positive."
 
No Decision Yet on Amount
 Mr. Kohl said no decision had been made on how much extra money the German Government would give to the alliance, but he has warned that tax increases may be necessary.
Germany has been under international criticism for not taking part more fully in the anti-Iraq coalition. Germany has pledged $2.2 billion to the anti-Iraq coalition, and it has contributed some planes to Turkey, a fellow member of NATO, for defensive purposes. But its postwar Constitution prohibits it from conducting offensive operations abroad.
Chancellor Kohl's advisers say that he would like to do more for the allied effort, but that the political climate here is unfavorable.
Public opinion surveys taken in recent days suggest that most Germans support the allied decision to attack Iraq. Nonetheless, the anti-war movement here is very active and appears to have tapped a well of public concern.
At a news conference today, leaders of the German anti-war movement rejected charges that their movement was anti-American or that it advocated the appeasement of tyrants.
 
'Arguing for Peaceful Way'
 "The reason for these charges is that our peace movement seems at this moment to be the largest in the world," said one of the protest organizers, Andreas Buro. "We are arguing for a peaceful way, and not the military way chosen by the United States and its European and Arab allies. The social, economic and ecological costs of this policy are so great that it must be changed."
In an interview on Tuesday, Volker Ruhe, one of Chancellor Kohl's advisers, said the German anti-war movement was strong because Germans have "a different psychology regarding the use of force."
"In countries like the United States and France and Britain, there is a psychology that if other means fail, it is the right of the state to use force," Mr. Ruhe said. "That is not the case in Germany."
"Here there has been a selective understanding of the United Nations resolutions," he said. "There was great attention to the various peace initiatives. The other side, that if everything failed the United Nations was legalizing the use of force, has not been talked about here."

HEADLINE: War Hurt Theaters And Helped Films, But Effect Was Brief

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
War in the Persian Gulf glued people to their television sets and reduced attendance at some entertainment events last week, people in the cultural and entertainment industry in New York report. But they add that some escapist entertainment benefited from the war and that attendance and video rentals are returning to normal.
"Box office was off by about 7.5 percent last week, but yesterday sales were as good as before the war started," said Paul Libin, producing director of Jujamcyn Theaters, one of Broadway's major theater owners. He was interviewed yesterday. 
 "I think people responded pretty much the way the news media did," he continued. "At first, the only news was war news, but then gradually other things reappeared. People were the same. After four days of watching TV or listening to the radio, they began to say, 'I've got to start getting my life back on track.' "
Mr. Libin added that January is normally "a very tough season for ticket sales." He said he was nevertheless hopeful because "traditionally, in bad times people go to the theater to get away from it all."
Phil Smith, executive vice president of the Shubert Organization, the largest Broadway theater owner, said his company's experience was much the same as Jujamcyn's.
"The daily take was considerably off last Wednesday and Thursday," he said, "but on the weekend it began to build as if people needed some diversion."
 
Closings Were Expected
 A spokesman for the Nederlander Organization, Broadway's second largest theater owner, said attendance at its theaters declined sharply, but he attributed that to the traditional January slump.
Sunday's closing of "Black and Blue," "Shogun" and "Peter Pan," said Arthur Rubin, vice president and general manager of the company, was expected even before the fighting started.
Mr. Rubin acknowledged that the Nederlander Organization's box office receipts were definitely affected by a new war-related phenomenon -- the sudden departure for Israel by stars who are Israeli citizens or who want to express solidarity with Israel during the war.
Topol, who stars in the revival of "Fiddler on the Roof," left Saturday night and is expected back in time for Sunday's matinee. The comedian Jackie Mason canceled four performances of "Jackie Mason: Brand New" to visit Israel. He is expected back for tomorrow's performance.
"It's hard to differentiate whether box office is being affected by the season, the economy or the war," Mr. Rubin said. "We may get some indication of what's going on next Monday when the box office opens for Neil Simon's play 'Lost in Yonkers.' "
 
Half-Price Tickets Off
 Stuart Little, a spokesman for the Theater Development Fund, said that sales at the TKTS booth in Times Square were "considerably down," but he attributed that to the recent closing of shows like "Peter Pan" as well as to preoccupation with the war.
But cancellations are few. "People cancel when there's a snowstorm," Mr. Rubin said, "but not when there's a war."
Several producers said they have noticed a few empty seats in sold-out houses, and they suspect that some foreign tourists cut short their stays to return home before the expiration of the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait.
Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York, agreed with this assessment. "Foreign visitors to New York went home sooner than originally planned," he said.
Joseph McKaughan, vice president for public affairs at Lincoln Center, said that ticket sales for tonight's performances were "good to strong." The shows are "Don Giovanni" at the Metropolitan Opera, "Six Degrees of Separation" at the Beaumont, "Monster in a Box" at the Newhouse and performances by the New York City Ballet and the New York Philharmonic.
He added: "That's largely because subscription tickets for these performances were sold about a year ago. However, the City Ballet held a nonsubscription performance last Sunday and that sold quite well."
 
Movies Do Well
 Movie attendance apparently benefited from the war. "Last week was a big box office week," said John Krier, president of the Exhibitor Relations Company of Los Angeles, which tracks movie attendance.
"The box office take was about $63 million, which is approximately the same as the previous week and slightly better than the same period last year," he said.
The comedy "Home Alone," about a boy who defeats a couple of burglars when left at home alone by his vacationing parents, led the top 10 box-office earners for the 10th consecutive week by taking in an estimated $9.4 million.
More disappointing was "Flight of the Intruder," featuring Vietnam-era air combat, which was in fifth place, grossing $4.9 million for the week. "It didn't capture the public interest as might have been expected," Mr. Krier said.
"If the heavy coverage of the war continues," he added, "people will tend to look for escapism more and more."
A spokesman for Loew's Theaters in New York said business seemed not to have changed at all from this time last year.
Video rentals, however, went into "a steep decline and then rebounded," said Amy Innerfield, general manager of Videoflash, a home video tracking service of Alexander & Associates in New York.
Before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August, she said, about 41 percent of the families owning a VCR rented at least one cassette a week. After the invasion, only 36 percent of VCR households did so. Later, the figure slipped to 35 percent, but then after the fighting started last week it bobbed up to 42 percent.
"You could see a real impact," Ms. Innerfield said, "and the reason seemed to be that last fall people were watching the news and didn't have time for rental cassettes. Then, after the first few days of real war, people wanted some escape from the war coverage so they went out and rented a movie."

HEADLINE: Fighting Fire With Rubles

 BODY:
President Mikhail Gorbachev can't be serious. He may think he can solve his political problem in the Baltics even to the extent of some 19 deaths in Latvia and Lithuania. Now he purports to get tough with the Soviet Union's economic problems by withdrawing 50- and 100-ruble notes from circulation. That is supposed to control an explosive growth of the money supply and stifle a booming black market.
In fact, the plan is little more than a half-hearted detour from the monumental reform needed to move the Soviet economy out of the wreckage of Communism. It will punish ordinary citizens, incite justifiable outrage at the Kremlin and risk inflaming the Soviet public against the real reforms needed. 
 Mr. Gorbachev knows what effective monetary reform requires. It means, first, that he would have to close the Government's budget deficit, immense even by U.S. standards. Perhaps he would replace rubles with a limited supply of a new currency. He would certainly decontrol prices.
But he has rejected these fundamental steps; they would transfer economic, and therefore political, power from Moscow bureaucrats to ordinary citizens. The Soviet economy is self-destructing; Mr. Gorbachev is dithering.
Illegal markets are thriving in the Soviet Union. The Government has been running huge deficits, pumping billions of rubles into the economy. That makes each ruble worth less. Worse, there is precious little for Soviet workers to spend their rubles on. And, because prices are controlled, the workers cannot use all their extra rubles to bid for whatever goods are available.
 The combination of excess rubles and controlled prices is an open invitation for black marketeers to buy low and sell high. Mr. Gorbachev says he will defeat them by wiping out the 50- and 100-ruble notes.
The claim is dubious. Most black marketeers are smart enough to deal in small notes or hard currency. But the policy will hurt ordinary workers, many of whom lack American-style bank accounts and are forced to save much of their earnings in cash. At the black-market rate of 20 rubles to the dollar, a 50-ruble note is well within reach of many citizens, especially the elderly, who have had plenty of years to save.
If Mr. Gorbachev ever gets serious about economic reform, this "ruble overhang" will become a serious obstacle. When price controls are lifted, Soviets with the extra cash will rush into stores waving fistfuls of rubles. Inflation will skyrocket, punishing people without extra cash.
Mr. Gorbachev knows the solution. First, he must plug his Government's budget hemorrhage and stop printing new rubles. But there's no sign that he's willing to get tough in this real way. Two former economic advisors, Nikolai Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin, disparage the latest 1991 budget as a fraud, sure to generate a huge deficit and another round of money creation.
Mr. Petrakov and Mr. Shatalin lobbied hard for tough fiscal policy and sweeping monetary and price reforms; they left the Government because Mr. Gorbachev wouldn't listen. He has degraded central control but remains unwilling to substitute market control. So now there is no control. The economy is imploding, and Mr. Gorbachev fiddles.

HEADLINE: What If the Oil Just Burned Away?

BYLINE: By Andrew Revkin; Andrew Revkin, who teaches journalism at Columbia University, is the author of "The Burning Season: The Murder of Chico Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest."

 BODY:
I had a little daydream as I watched the latest television reports from the war in the Persian Gulf. As plumes of black smoke rose from the blasted refineries in Kuwait and Iraq, and Saddam Hussein promised to blow up still more, I found myself briefly imagining what would happen if all the oil beneath the desert sands of that troubled region were set ablaze by this war.
Just imagine the startled looks on the faces of all the generals and politicians and economic pundits as they looked around after the last flickering flames had died down and the last clouds of smoke dissipated. 
 Suddenly, they would see the swamps of Iraq and the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula in a different light. All around would be an inhospitable landscape unsuited for the production of anything except dates and camel dung. Everyone would just pack up and go home.
Even Saddam Hussein.
After all, why did he invade Kuwait to begin with? He was fighting with the Emir over the vast pool of oil that straddles their common border, 10,000 feet underground.
Once all the oil burned, things would get interesting on the home front as well. With the world deprived most of its known reserves, oil prices would jump, let's say, fivefold. Suddenly, President Bush wouldn't have to worry about crafting an energy policy because the country would have one instantly, born of necessity. Who would need Government incentives to conserve oil with crude going for $125 a barrel and gasoline hitting $7 a gallon at the pump?
The millions of commuters who take their cars to the office every morning might finally have to opt for mass transit. Maybe then they'd be willing to put some of the money they spend on parking and gas into improving those woeful trains and subways.
Car manufacturers might even be forced to start putting those unsightly gas mileage figures back in their sleek magazine ads again. And the Japanese -- who have recently put all their efforts into outdoing the Americans at building high-performance, eight-cylinder, gas-guzzling luxury sedans -- might have to lead Detroit back to small cars again.
Maybe the worldwide population explosion of automobiles would be slowed. It had better slow down. There are 500 million cars on earth. In 35 years, that number is expected to quadruple. Two billion cars. More oil wars.
Maybe American businesses would finally learn to use fossil fuels efficiently. After all, the Europeans and Japanese already get twice as much industrial production out of a gallon of oil as we do.
Maybe Americans would finally replace some of their leaky windows. More energy escapes through the poorly insulated windows of American homes each year than flows through the Alaska pipeline.
Maybe more people would screw in those new compact fluorescent bulbs that throw the same amount of light as standard incandescent bulbs but consume a fourth as much energy and last 10 times as long.
Maybe solar power would no longer be scoffed at as a pipe dream. With the price of plastics -- which are made from oil -- skyrocketing, maybe Americans would finally put an end to the throw-away age.
It was a nice dream while it lasted. But the days wore on, the casualties mounted and the ground war began. There were plenty of fires in the Middle East, yes. And the smoke posed a grave environmental threat. But most of the oil still lay safe, beneath the sand.
There it will stay, patiently waiting for the day when peace returns. After the last of the fallen soldiers and civilians are buried, the Saudis and Kuwaitis -- and the Iraqis -- will return to the battered oilfields, uncap the wells and let it flow.
And we in America, Japan, Europe and the third world will write them a check, breathe a sigh of relief, and slake our relentless thirst.

HEADLINE: Banks Try to Make Students Debt Junkies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
American banks are deluging college students with plastic, encouraging credit-card debt for many who, on top of tuition loans, will graduate with debt burdens. 
 "Dear John," began a letter to my son from a bank in Virginia, "Because you are a full-time college student or recent graduate, . . . [the] Bank has reserved a Visa or Mastercard for you with a credit line up to $1,500 . . . available immediately!" And: "Obtaining your Visa or Mastercard couldn't be easier: No parental signature necessary -- No need to be currently employed (if you are a full-time student) -- No previously established credit required."
What happened to the 3 C's of credit: capacity to repay, collateral and character? That 10 banks would offer $1,500 each, or $15,000, to an unemployed college student raises questions about bank management and morals. Even in the most highly leveraged corporate transactions of the 1980's, loans were not made to companies with no cash flow, no assets, no business plan and a negative net worth. Banks mostly complied with the adage "Know your customer."
"Flexible monthly payments," the letter continued. "Your minimum monthly payments are only 3 percent of your balance. Unpaid balances will be charged at an annual percentage rate of 19.8 percent." In the small print was the $18 annual fee, the 2 percent flat fee on cash advances, the 5 percent fee on late payments.
Saddling college students with credit-card debt is a growing business. That does not make it right. As parents, we must now teach our children that they must also just say no to debt.

HEADLINE: Don't Scrap U.S.-Soviet Arms Accord Summit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I have no quarrel with the analysis and account of recent events in Lithuania by Jeri Laber and Catherine Cosman, respectively executive director and Washington representative of Helsinki Watch, in "A 'Gorbachev Doctrine' Takes Shape" (Op-Ed, Jan. 16). But they are unconvincing in arguing that Washington should cancel next month's scheduled summit between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
 This meeting relates to an arms accord between the United States and the Soviet Union. The article's authors urge that the United States should not support a Soviet Government that is party to repression and killings. But arms control is vital and mutually beneficial.
Punishment of President Gorbachev reinforces the designs of the Soviet military-industrial complex. The United States thereby sacrifices political leverage. Independence, separatism and sovereignty in Lithuania are not realizable through this suggestion. World tensions are not reduced by it. One cannot ascertain whether or not a successor to Mr. Gorbachev would treat the Baltic republics differently. Linkage is a risky doctrine; diplomacy is continuous.
The two authors also propose that the United States withhold economic aid from the Gorbachev Government This may make us feel better; however, it gives no reasonable assurance of increasing Moscow's receptivity to independence for the Baltic republics.
However one condemns Soviet behavior in this instance, President Gorbachev is scarcely likely to modify his Baltic policies or those toward other nationalities because the United States tries to exact political extortion. And in attempting to punish Mr. Gorbachev by cancelling a summit, in disregard of the United States interest in bringing down the levels of armament, this nation unwisely punishes itself, to its own political-military detriment.

HEADLINE: A Rock Climber's Reach For the Top on Wall St.

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Before going to Wall Street, Steve Wunsch became a legend in the world of free rock climbing -- scaling sheer rock faces using gear only to break a fall. He became so known for his death-defying climbs with names like Supercrack that he is immortalized in such places as Moose, Wyo., at the base of the Grand Tetons, where his portrait hangs at the local outfitting store.
Today, he is testing limits of a different sort. The former Kidder, Peabody trader is taking on the New York Stock Exchange with a controversial -- threatening, to some -- computer designed to replace specialists who trade shares on the exchange floor. If successful, he will run the nation's first electronic auction exchange, setting prices off the Big Board. And, according to schedule, it should be up and running next month. 
 There are, of course, other electronic trading systems that have cropped up to steal business from the Big Board. But these are simply computerized bulletin boards that match brokers' buy and sell orders, typically using Big Board prices.
Mr. Wunsch's proposed exchange is different in that it threatens to undermine the basic role of the New York Stock Exchange as the price setter for corporate shares -- a role that has helped keep the Big Board the central marketplace for nearly 200 years.
Mr. Wunsch's exchange is, in fact, a computer programmed to create an auction. It will come up with a price at which buyers and sellers will trade their stocks -- and then execute those orders. This is what specialists do on the floor throughout the day.
Under his system, investors will submit their buy and sell orders. Then, three times a week, the computer will sort through the orders, come up with a price, and execute trades. At times of extraordinary demand, as when bombs first fell on Baghdad, Mr. Wunsch says he could hold more frequent sessions.
Not surprisingly, most of the nation's exchanges have protested to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York Stock Exchange contends the Wunsch system will "cherry pick" less risky trades, while the Philadelphia Stock Exchange says it threatens "fair competition." The Pacific Stock Exchange calls for "close oversight" and the National Association of Securities Dealers, which trades over-the-counter stocks, terms it a "novelty."
For his part, the 43-year-old Mr. Wunsch dismisses such talk. "Their not-surprising attempts to stop us are coming from their self-interest," Mr. Wunsch said in an interview. "Although there is the appearance of competition among the exchanges, in fact, it's like all different rooms in the same club. We're not worried."
Mr. Wunsch landed his job at Kidder when his rock-climbing skills attracted the attention of a fellow climber, Max C. Chapman, former Kidder president and now chairman of the Nomura Securities Company's American operations. He's been working on the system, first at Kidder, but success is hardly assured. Before trading begins, Mr. Wunsch must pass stiff regulatory hurdles. After that, he must garner enough business -- "liquidity" as it's called by traders -- to make his exchange worthwhile. So far, some 125 institutional investors, like pension funds and insurance companies, have signed on. And more are waiting to see if it succeeds before trading.
Today, there are basically two ways to trade stocks: through the continuous auction market on an exchange floor or over electronic screens, where dealers trade stocks directly among themselves based on Big Board prices. Like the competition between A.T.& T. and such rivals as MCI and U S Sprint, the Big Board has seen its market share erode steadily because of these off-exchange activities. Currently, the Big Board trades 83 percent of its listed shares, compared with 88 percent in 1980 -- a decline that affects the profitability of the exchange since it collects a fee for every share traded.
 
Costs Are Lower
 Large institutional investors have turned to a number of electronic trading systems because of lower transaction costs. A trade on the exchange floor might cost 3 to 7 cents a share, compared with about a half-cent to 2 cents off the floor.
Every day, institutional investors telephone each other, send facsimiles and get in touch with broker-dealers announcing what they want to buy and sell. This "Rolodex and fax" market, as it is called, is tapped first by big buyers, who then turn to the Big Board if they do not easily find a counterparty or if they have a particularly difficult trade.
Timothy F. McCarthy, an executive vice president at Fidelity Investments in Boston, recently surveyed institutional trades and found that up to a third were off an exchange. "Daily, we are inundated with faxes and phone calls," Mr. McCarthy said. "When investors look for liquidity, they look at exchanges, and they also look beyond the exchanges."
Still, Mr. McCarthy said, institutional traders do not want the exchanges to disappear. "A lot of people are talking out of both sides of their mouths," he said. "They say they want to meet directly. But they still want the exchange because that's where the central price discovery mechanism is and where they go when the markets get bad."
So far, Mr. Wunsch's machine has garnered interest, both for its unique approach as well as Mr. Wunsch's relentless promotion. He promises to keep trades at under 2 cents a share, and lined up the Bankers Trust Company as a clearinghouse.
"Wunsch's system is an economist's dream machine," said Hans Stoll, head of financial markets research at Vanderbilt University. "It brings buyers and sellers together at one point and the computer quickly reflects prices. I kind of like it."
 
Not for Quick Traders
 But will institutional investors? With auctions held only three times a week, the system is not designed for those needing quick trades. In addition, investors put in the price at which they want to trade, and, if the computer's price is quite different, orders could be left unfilled.
"Those people who have to trade at 10 A.M. are not a candidate for this auction," Mr. Wunsch said. "It's more for non-time critical trades. How many of those are there? That's the $64 question."
Mr. Wunsch believes that by taking non-time critical trades out of the market, volatility will be reduced. "With these orders out, the market won't be subject to wild swings," he said. "Ironically, we may be the salvation of the markets."
Institutions are cautious, but curious. DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer of the California Public Employess Retirement System, which trades $4 billion a year, said a "growing 30 percent" of his trades were off an exchange. He has no electronic system of choice, and only cares that there is sufficient "liquidity" -- enough people trading.
 
Courting Brokerages
 Mr. Wunsch must also win over large brokerage houses. Head traders at two major firms, who asked not to be identified, said they preferred to support the Big Board. 'Automatic trading systems that create fractionation are a terrible danger to the entire financial system," said one trader. These firms, it should be noted, are members of the New York Stock Exchange.
Another obstacle are such entrenched operations as Instinet and Posit, two electronic systems, as well as the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, a floundering electronic system that trades at very low volume.
Robert H. Reid, executive vice president of Instinet, said Mr. Wunsch's exchange might have trouble getting orders. Like Instinet, which trades about 95,000 shares a day, compared with the Big Board's 200 million, he said Wunsch's system may suffer from a reluctance of older brokers and traders to use computers. "How much business will we lose to him, if any? I don't know," Mr. Reid said.
 
Exemptions Sought
 Mr. Wunsch's attention is focused on the S.E.C., which will soon decide whether to exempt his system from costly regulations governing exchanges -- the first such request from an electronic system. All other electronic systems are registered as broker-dealers because they do not fit the definition of an exchange. Mr. Wunsch argues that his exchange's volume will be so limited and his customers sufficiently sophisticated to warrant an exemption. Without it, institutions could not trade with him, nor could he list over-the-counter stocks, restrictions that would cut deeply into his business.
Brandon Becker, associate director of the S.E.C.'s division of market regulation, gives no hint about the agency's thinking. "The question of what constitutes an exchange is becoming an exciting one," Mr. Becker said. "Where does a trading system end and an exchange begin?"
Mr. Wunsch remains confident. He's doggedly pursuing test runs and preaches to potential clients. "I'm hopeful," he said. "I believe in our approach and that what we're doing is the correct philosophy."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 30, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about a new stock trading system developed by Steve Wunsch, a former Kidder, Peabody trader, misstated the average daily volume on Instinet, an electronic stock trading system. Instinet says its average in the last six months has been about eight million shares -- most reported as trades through Nasdaq -- not 95,000.

HEADLINE: At Last, Pax Americana

BYLINE: By Joshua Muravchik; Joshua Muravchik, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is author of the forthcoming "Exporting Democracy."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It will be weeks before the guns in the gulf fall silent, but we can see already the political contours of the world following an American victory. Important changes are in the offing on three levels of politics: domestic, Arab and global.
Domestically, the most profound consequences may be felt in the Democratic Party, dominated ideologically since the Vietnam War by its dovish wing. If the large majority of American voters continues to view the gulf war as the most just, necessary and successful our country has fought since World War II, the Democrats will pay a heavy price for having opposed it. 
 However, those who bucked the leadership and supported the President -- Stephen Solarz, Les Aspin, Dave McCurdy, Dante Fascell in the House; Joseph Lieberman and Albert Gore in the Senate -- will emerge vastly strengthened. They will win plaudits both for being right and for having risen above partisanship. If they stick together even loosely they will constitute a formidable new force in the party. From their ranks may come the next Democratic Presidential candidate, albeit not before Mr. Bush has had his second term.
In the Arab world, the drubbing of Saddam Hussein will be an epiphany that will demolish the appeal of the radical path. The bane of Arab politics has been a millenarianism that has stood in the way of a reckoning with reality -- the reality of Israel, the reality of the West. Whether in the form of pan-Arabism, religious fanaticism or secular radical ideologies, this millenarianism has led many Arabs to believe that, with unity or the right leader or theory, the humiliations of colonialism and underdevelopment could be redeemed and the world could be had on Arab terms rather than through compromise.
Not since the heyday of the former Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, has one man concentrated in his own person all the wishful hopes of Arab radicalism as has Saddam Hussein. The very outrageousness of his aggression against Kuwait, his irrational defiance of America and his missile attacks on Israel have only reinforced his hold on the radical imagination.
If -- as seems all but certain -- the war ends in Saddam Hussein's utter humiliation, the sobering effect should be enormous. With Mr. Hussein's Baath Party in tatters, Soviet influence a thing of the past, Islamic extremism losing its luster in Iran and the myth of unity shattered as never before, the Arab world may be ready finally for realism and moderation.
Last but not least, the gulf war marks the dawning of the Pax Americana. True, that term was used immediately after World War II. But it was a misnomer then because the Soviet empire -- a real competitor with American power -- was born at the same moment. The result was not a "pax" of any kind, but a cold war and a bipolar world.
During the past two years, however, Soviet power has imploded and a bipolar world has become unipolar. A global rush toward democracy and free markets has spelled a huge victory for America on the ideological plain. Now, in the gulf war, our ideological supremacy is being matched by a demonstration of America's refurbished military capability.
Since Vietnam, doubts had abounded, both at home and abroad, about America's willingness to use force and its ability to do so effectively. It may well have been such doubts that led Saddam Hussein to ignore President Bush's pleas and threats. It is not likely another ruler will soon hasten to make the same miscalculation.
America's rediscovered prowess will not be used for conquest but to deter others from conquest: to secure the "new world order" that has been a goal of American policy since President Woodrow Wilson. In addition, it will strengthen the attraction of America's political and economic system.
This Pax Americana will rest not on domination but on persuasion and example as well as power. It will consist not of empire but of having won over a large and growing part of the world not only to the joys of jeans and rock and Big Macs but also to our concept of how nations ought to be governed and to behave.

HEADLINE: Peru Develops Plan to Work With U.S. to Combat Drugs

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Peru has drawn up plans for a multi-faceted joint venture with the United States to fight coca leaf cultivation, a detailed outline received here indicated today.
To help Peru cut its coca harvest, the world's largest, the plan calls for the United States to provide military aid, development aid and debt relief. A new Peruvian "super ministry" would coordinate a multi-pronged effort to promote crop substitution and to attack traffickers and their guerrilla backers, a planner said in a telephone interview from Lima today. 
 On Friday, Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist, is to present the plan in Washington to United States officials. Mr. de Soto is working against a deadline: if President Bush does not certify by March 1 that Peru is cooperating in the drug war, Peru will lose $100 million in military and economic aid.
 
Fujimori's Drug Plan
 The blueprint that American officials will start studying this weekend represents the first comprehensive drug strategy presented by the Peruvian President, Alberto K. Fujimori, since he took office last July.
In a break with previous Peruvian policy, the plan calls for the United States to help "feed, equip, train, outfit and adequately remunerate the police and armed forces who will be fighting drug trafficking and those who support" the traffickers.
Under this provision, the United States, for the first time, would provide military equipment and counterinsurgency training to help Peruvian security forces fight the Shining Path. A Maoist guerrilla group, the Shining Path protects growers and traffickers in Peru's main coca leaf production area, the Upper Huallaga Valley.
On the national level, Peru's spreading war with the Shining Path accounted for the majority of 3,384 Peruvians killed in political violence last year. The group, which last week declared President Saddam Hussein of Iraq "a world hero," is believed to have carried out a dynamite attack Wednesday on an English-language school in Peru, the North American Cultural Institute.
 
Military Aid Rejected
 Last September, Mr. Fujimori rejected $36 million in United States military aid on the grounds that coca leaf cultivation should be fought on many levels. With a four-month delay, the new proposal reflects that approach -- aid for farmers and repression for traffickers.
To encourage Peru's estimated 200,000 coca farmers to switch to other crops, the Government would improve roads in the Huallaga, would provide land titles, low interest credit and agricultural extension services and would slash government bureaucracy that strangles food production. Peru's agriculture is in such disarray that the United States currently provides $85 million in food aid. American food reached 13 percent of the population of 22 million.
To spur food exports, Peru would cut domestic bureaucracy and would sign a free trade pact with the United States, the 10-page anti-drug plan said. President Bush has called for free trade between the Americas, and the United States is currently negotiating free-trade pacts with Mexico and Chile.
 
Role of Military
 To atack drug traffickers, an elite military force would intercept airplanes, blow up laboratories and seize traffickers' assets. Other units would protect judges and special prisons, would investigate corruption and would minimize environmental damage caused by coca cultivation in rainforest areas.
Coordinating the campaign would be the "superministry," formally called the Autonomous Authority for Alternative Development. This agency's director would answer directly to President Fujimori and would have the power to coordinate anti-drug efforts carried out by 11 ministries.
In addition to direct financing from the United States, the Peruvians are asking for relief -- or outright forgiveness -- of Peru's $1.2 billion official debt to the United States.
In Lima today, one diplomat expressed skepticism that Peruvians could be easily weaned away from what has become the nation's most profitable export -- semi-refined cocaine.
"The proposal may make a lot of sense, but there is going to be a lot of bloodletting," the diplomat said in a telephone interview. "Hernando de Soto seems to think that the United States would be enchanted to see a good plan. The United States would love to see a good plan -- put in place and working."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Figuring a War Into the Budget

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE problem of managing the American economy now is complicated by the war in the Persian Gulf, coming on top of a recession that is cutting tax revenues, increasing unemployment and swelling the Federal debt and the budget deficit.
In his Congressional testimony this week, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, urged Congress not to raise taxes to finance the war, arguing that since nobody knew what the war would cost, it was better to borrow the money, at least for now. Such borrowing would increase the Federal debt but would not add to the deficit for the fiscal year 1991, as defined by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law. 
 In the agreement reached in December between the Administration and Congress to cut nearly $500 billion from deficits over the next five years, the costs of the military operations in the gulf were excluded from the deficit. The hostilities are what Congress calls an "off-budget war."
The Administration has joined Mr. Greenspan in opposing a tax increase, even as officials watch the budget deficit climb, with the extra costs of the savings and loan bailout taking their toll -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has just asked for an extra $30 billion for the bailout. Indeed, in its budget proposal for the fiscal year 1992, due in two weeks, the Administration is expected to seek a cut in the capital gains tax. Such a cut seems unlikely, given the opposition of Congressional Democrats, who see it as a tax break for the rich.
Without other specific plans for fighting either recession or inflation through fiscal policy, the Administration is really relying on the budget as an automatic stabilizer of the economy against either inflation or recession. Michael J. Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, said the new budget legislation adjusts the deficit targets forshort-run changes in economic conditions: A forecast of higher growth lowers the deficit target and a forecast of lower growth raises it. He calls this "good economic policy," adding, "There is widespread consensus among economists that Government budget deficits should rise if the economy weakens and should fall if it strengthens." Tax revenues automatically rise or fall in booms or slumps, and Government payments, like unemployment insurance, do the reverse, reinforcing the countercyclical effect of the budget.
By shifting attention from the "cyclical" components of deficits or surpluses, Mr. Boskin said in an interview, the deficit targets focus attention on reducing the "structural" deficit. In the longer run, this should reduce interest rates and stimulate investment, productivity and economic growth.
One concern, however, is whether the war's cost might overwhelm the automatic stabilizers. Mr. Greenspan this week estimated the cost of the air war at "several hundred million dollars a day" but "probably under half a billion a day." Military planners put the cost of an air-ground war at $1 billion a day, but this is a very rough number.
Much depends on the intensity of the war and whether one uses total costs, including sums already in the military budget, or incremental costs-- the extra costs of using reserve troops, fuel, ammunition and so forth -- and whether lost equipment is replaced.
The Congressional Budget Office, in a study prepared shortly before the war began, said, "If a war started early in calendar year 1991, added costs could range from $17 billion to $35 billion in budget authority in fiscal year 1991, with large additional costs in later years for the replacement of lost equipment." If all losses of major weapons and munitions were replaced, the report added, the cost could range from $28 billion to $86 billion.
Those costs are to be reduced by aid from the allies, but how much they will contribute is unclear. Up to the start of this year, direct allied contributions to the United States' gulf operations came to $4.6 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in kind.
Kuwait's government-in-exile gave $2.5 billion in cash and $6 million in kind. Saudi Arabia contributed $760 million in cash and $854 million in kind. Prof. M. A. Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that the Saudis have been earning $45 billion to $50 billion at an annual rate because of higher prices and increased sales of their oil since the gulf crisis began.
Japan contributed $428 million in cash and $206 million in kind up to this month. The Japanese Government, which had pledged support of $4 billion, half to the war effort and half for economic aid to Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, said this week that it would raise its contribution to $9 billion, but that pledge is facing stiff opposition at home. Germany has done even less. So far German contributions total $272 million in cash and $66 million in kind.
The United Arab Emirates have put up $661 million, mostly in cash. Korea has given $61 million, $50 million of it in cash.
The budget office puts other allied contributions to the United States at $3 million in kind. These figures do not include the amounts that countries like Britain, France, Italy and Turkey spend on their own operations in the gulf.
As the budget office dryly notes: "Allied contributions will have to rise substantially if they are to offset a large fraction of U.S. costs in 1991."

For some contribututors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, concern about New York City's sick and poor was only a secondary reason for giving. They were moved by their devotion to New York -- and the pain they feel at its current plight.
In interviews and letters to the fund, these contributors often mentioned fond memories of New York as a center of culture and commerce. But they also described it as a city that has declined in recent years, becoming a national symbol of urban ills, a place where people sleep in cardboard boxes and the number of homeless people grows every day. And they said that their gifts to the Neediest Cases were intended to help the city rise from its current economic troubles. 
 "New York remains our capital for human talent," wrote J. Nicholas Ziegler, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. "The homelessness and desperation of the city's less fortunate persons are diminishing the moral, not to mention the economic, vitality of the whole country."
 
A 'Unique Collection'
 Dr. Ziegler said the decline of New York should be considered a national issue. He sent $75 to the fund, calling it a small step toward encouraging the "unique collection of firms and organizations to remain in the city." Many businesses will move away if the city's problems continue to grow, he said, and such a flight would affect the entire country's economic vitality.
Another donor, Margaret F. Boorstein, of East Norwich, L.I., sent a $45 contribution "to help to improve life in New York -- not only directly for the 'needy,' but for all." She added, "A city needs a vibrant and healthy society in order to survive and thrive."
There was also a gift of $36 from Michael M. Arrow, of New Rochelle, N.Y. "I was born in New York City, living in a modest and not unpleasant area of the Bronx that is now synonymous with severe urban ills and despair," he wrote. "That the need is there is without doubt; the fund is a ray of light and hope in satisfying it."
The 79th annual appeal for the Neediest Cases opened in November and runs through February. The proceeds are distributed among seven charities to aid the sick and the poor in the New York area. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead.
More than 11,600 people and organizations have contributed to the current drive, and many of them have written that they see donating to the fund as something they owe a city that has given them so much.
 
'The Most of Everything'
 "New York, of course, has the most of everything, and much of it the best," wrote Jeanne Alexander, of San Francisco. "Twenty-five years of living there taught me that."
Ms. Alexander said the city also has "the most and the neediest of neighbors." A $100 gift was enclosed to show that "moving away doesn't mean forgetting."

HEADLINE: So Far From Mideast: Mongolia's Oil Intrigues Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
It has a vast desert and a large oil potential, President Bush was told, and this piqued his interest in Mongolia, a country about three times the size of Texas and thousands of miles from the Middle East.
The topic of oil came up when the President, a former Texas oilman, conferred with Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, President of Mongolia, the Asian leader said today. 
 Asked about reports that American oil companies are interested in developing production in basins in the Gobi desert, Mr. Ochirbat said that at his White House meeting with Mr. Bush on Wednesday "we told him about it and maybe expanded his knowledge."
President Bush was extremely cordial to Mr. Ochirbat, the first Mongolian head of state to visit Washington, and after announcing that the United States would extend trade benefits to his Government said he was looking forward to increased American commerce with Mongolia.
 
Oil Production to Begin
 In a meeting with reporters, President Ochirbat said that within two years Mongol Gazryn Tos, the Mongolian petroleum company, would begin extracting oil from deposits discovered decades ago by Soviet geologists at Zuunbayan, 280 miles southeast of the capital, Ulan Bator, and that "shortly we will begin exploration for new deposits."
Mr. Ochirbat said the Mongolian Parliament had recently approved laws permitting foreign investment and joint ventures.
Mongol Gazryn Tos was set up a year ago, replacing a Government ministry, as part of program removing Communist political and economic structures that had existed since the 1920's.
Last month, Exploration Associates International of Houston, a consulting concern, published a report on previous petroleum exploration in Mongolia that showed good prospects in Gobi desert sedimentary basins.
Mike Buck, vice president of the company, said the report was based on 150 exploratory studies conducted by Soviet, Hungarian, Romanian, East German and Polish geologists and geophysicists between 1939 and 1989 and covering about 60 percent of Mongolia.
Mr. Buck said he became interested in exploring Mongolian oil deposits two years ago when he learned while in China that some of the oil-rich sedimentary basins of North China extended across the frontier into southern Mongolia. The North China basins are estimated to contain about 10 billion barrels, he said.
 
200 Wells Are Drilled
 "The more we dug into the geological reports, the more we found," Mr. Buck said of oil prospects in Mongolia, "We are very enthusiastic." About 200 exploratory wells have been drilled in Mongolia.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Buck said the report covered Mongolia's 13 major sedimentary basins, most of which lie to the south of Ulan Bator.
The report, at $45,000 a copy, has become something of a best seller in the oil industry, and the company has become the technical adviser of Mongol Gazryn Tos in a new joint venture.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
I.B.M. Gets Lift From Mainframes

BYLINE: By John Markoff

 BODY:
STRONG sales of I.B.M.'s newest mainframe computers gave the computer maker a solid fourth-quarter report, and analysts say the trend will continue in 1991.
The International Business Machines Corporation's results surprised Wall Street, which pushed the company's stock up 8 percent since Jan. 17. The robust showing also appears to have surprised I.B.M. itself. Company executives told analysts in a conference telephone call on Jan. 17 that demand was exceeding supply of the new System 390 mainframes. The company also said that it had seen unusual strength in the sales of its largest disk drives used to store data for its mainframes. 
 Growth in mainframe sales appears to contradict advocates of a computer industry trend called "downsizing." In the past, some industry analysts have said mainframe growth would slow as important corporate data processing applications were moved to networks of smaller work stations and personal computers.
But I.B.M.'s strong results appear to present a more complicated picture. "Downsizing is real," said Peter L. Burris, a researcher at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass. "It's not wise to say we're seeing an upsizing trend, but clearly the mainframe has remained a moving target."
In fact, many industry researchers and Wall Street analysts say that the most significant factor in predicting mainframe sales growth rates appears to be the product cycle, which moves far more slowly in the mainframe business than in markets for smaller systems. New families ofmainframe computers are introduced as infrequently as every 7 to 10 years, while in the personal computer business product lines tend to emerge every 2 to 3 years.
Over long periods of time, mainframe growth has been surprisingly constant. Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential-Bache, said mainframe growth had varied little, staying between 5 to 10 percent a year since he began surveying the market more than 15 years ago.
Mr. Martin said that he had surveyed 50 of the largest data processing customers in early December and that he believed I.B.M. would have a particularly strong second half this year when its more powerful water-cooled ES/ 9000 processors become available in the third quarter. Currently I.B.M. is selling a transitional system, with much of the new System 390 equipment, that can be easily adapted to the next generation central processor.
The second half of the year could be particularly strong because of I.B.M.'s strategy for encouraging the company's largest customers to upgrade to the new top-of-the-line water-cooled ES/9000, said Robert Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a Phoenix-based consulting firm. He believes that I.B.M. is hoping to pave the way for a smooth transition by offering attractive trade-in options for its current machines. He said the company will guarantee the 1990 price of its previous top-of-the-line machine, giving a customer effectively free use of the machine for 12 months.Such incentives plus new models from I.B.M.'s competitors guarantee a resurgence of the mainframe market in the second half of the year, analysts believe.
"Both I.B.M. and Amdahl estimates show weak first-half comparisons with acceleration in the second half with the mainframe cycle," said Steven Cohen, an analyst at the Soundview Financial Group, referring to the Amdahl Corporation, the No. 2 mainframe maker after I.B.M.
To keep its dominance of the market, I.B.M. is making it more difficult for competitors to sell their equipment to I.B.M. customers. Much of the compatible business has come from selling added performance at lower cost to I.B.M. customers, Mr. Burris said. I.B.M.'s new System 390 family will make it more difficult for compatible makers to integrate their machines into I.B.M. data processing centers using the new systems. Such a strategy will increase what is referred to as I.B.M.'s "account control." This is an indicator of the computer maker's ability to keep its customers from mixing machines from different vendors.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of I.B.M.'s strong quarter is the new evidence the report provides that the computer industry may escape the worst effects of the recession. said Mark D. Stahlman, a computer industry analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons. "For computer companies, the recession has proved to be a hoax," he said. A 20-year analysis shows no relation between the rate of G.N.P. growth and computer company performance, he added. Factors as diverse as product cycles and strong marketing campaigns have offset broader economic factors.
A recession can even be a plus for computer makers, he argued. "The more people thrown out of work, the more people will start a business out of their homes. You can't start a business without a computer."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up After Early Slide; Silver Plunges a Second Day

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday after recovering from a morning slide on concern that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates to cushion the recession.
Silver, meanwhile, plummeted for the second day and gold also fell. 
 Gold was under pressure from the steep slide in silver prices. Silver for March delivery fell 15.2 cents, to $3.785 an ounce, its lowest level since 1976. Gold for January delivery on the Commodity Exchange fell $5.40, to $373 a troy ounce. The active February contract also fell $5.40, to $373.50 an ounce.
In the currency market, the dollar's recovery, which was partly technical, followed comments by Israel's Ambassador to the United States, who said Tel Aviv would be ready to join in regional arms control efforts and possible peace talks with the Palestinians once the Persian Gulf war ended.
Traders said the dollar initially dropped on the news. But when it did not fall as far as traders had feared, it rebounded.
"I think the initial reaction was selling," said George Eckhardt of Paine Webber Group. "It should be somewhat bearish for the dollar if you accept the idea that war is bullish."
Traders said the dollar also received a late lift from comments by a Federal Reserve Board governor, Edward Kelley, who told Reuters that a lower dollar was cause for concern.
The dollar is seen as a safe holding, and tends to rise in times of crisis.
But after the initial selloff, traders grew encouraged by the dollar's resilience, said Chuck Spence of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.
The dollar closed at 1.4870 German marks, up from Wednesday's close of 1.4825 marks. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar closed at 132.35 yen, up from Wednesday's closing price of 131.72 yen.
Trading remained edgy, as dealers focus on both the fragile state of the economy and war in the Middle East.
With the nation mired in wartime recession, the prospect of lower interest rates to spur growth is looming large, and would be bad news for the dollar, whose value erodes when interest rates fall. But the tougher war proves, the more investors seek safety, a possible plus for the dollar.
Tom Moore of American Express Bank said that those bearish on the dollar have been talking about a fall to 1.4300 marks and 1.2200 Swiss francs. The all-time low for the dollar against the mark is 1.4630, set late last year.
Mr. Moore said the bearishness was reinforced when United States and German authorities this week talked of the possibility of lower American interest rates and steady German rates.
The British pound closed at $1.9565, down from Wednesday's $1.9595. The dollar rose to 1.2575 Swiss francs, from 1.2510 francs Wednesday, and to $1.1595 against the Canadian currency from Wednesday's $1.1580 (Canadian).
Against the French franc, the dollar closed at 5.0545 francs, up from Wednesday's 5.0410 francs.

HEADLINE: Northwest Air in No Hurry to Spend

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
While strong airlines like American and United have been jumping to buy the precious international routes that weaker carriers have been forced to sell, Northwest has so far remained on the sidelines, picking up only small pieces.
Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest carrier, certainly appears to be in a position to buy. Moreover, its cash position was strengthened considerably by the decision announced Wednesday by Samuel K. Skinner, the Transportation Secretary, to allow foreign companies to own bigger portions of domestic carriers. As a result, the Dutch airline KLM will be able to keep its 49 percent ownership of Northwest, and Northwest will not have to use $250 million to redeem common shares held by KLM. 
 Even so, John Dasburg, Northwest's president and chief executive,gave no indication in an interview yesterday that he was poised to go after major European routes.
 
Threat to Dominance
 Granted, the buying pace set by the leaders, American and United, is not being matched by strong carriers like Delta and USAir, either. But the stakes are higher for Northwest because it stands to lose ground where it has been dominant in the past -- international routes.
For years from its base in Minneapolis and major hubs at Detroit and Memphis, Northwest was the largest American carrier to the Pacific. Now its leadership is being challenged by United Airlines, which acquired the Pacific routes of Pan American World Airways in 1986 and after stumbling badly at first has become a formidable competitor.
International routes are awarded to airlines only after long lobbying and negotiations between the United States Government and the other country involved. Airlines with any resources at all are usually eager to bypass those delays and buy routes wholesale when bleak times force weaker carriers to give them up.
 
A Faster Consolidation
 Mr. Dasburg said the economic effects of the Persian Gulf war have greatly speeded up a consolidation that most of the industry had believed would take a decade to complete.
"It has been telescoped into a 12-month period of time by Saddam Hussein," he said. "The industry is under tremendous pressure both from fuel prices and a rapid fall in traffic."
But so far, the pressures have not caused Northwest's managers to jump into the fray to become a major player in Europe.
"We're a niche player in the North Atlantic and Europe," Mr. Dasburg said. "We're reviewing our strategy at this time."
While Northwest has been reviewing, others have been pouncing. United bought Pan Am's London routes for $400 million, and American bought the London routes of Trans World Airlines for $500 million.
 
Move in Hawaii
 Last December, Northwest bought a 25 percent interest in Hawaiian Airlines for $20 million. That gave Northwest the ability to fly to Australia and to Nagoya and Fukuoka, in Japan, strengthening its already huge Pacific system.
This week the airline announced that it had bought landing slots, gates and other assets at Washington National Airport from Eastern Airlines for $23.2 million.
While Northwest, which Alfred A. Checchi and a group of investors bought in 1989, has used much of its cash to pay off a large part of its debt from the acquisition, Mr. Dasburg said the airline still had the money to make strategic acquisitions. He refused to disclose any details about the airline's cash.
Northwest's moves so far, however, will not be enough to keep it in the running with the major carriers.
"Northwest must make a strategic move either in the North Atlantic or further strengthen its domestic system," said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst with Salomon Brothers.
To do so, he said, Northwest might be forced to make a major purchase like buying the rest of Pan Am, which even without its London routes still offers extensive service to Europe. Pan Am has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code and is awaiting final approval of the sale of its London routes to provide it with enough money to get through its financial crisis.
 
'Quietly Aggressive'
 Edward Starkman, the airline analyst for Paine Webber, said Northwest in its own modest way was making moves that it could build on later.
"They have been quietly aggressive in their own way," he said. He said that Northwest was building on its strong Pacific routes and that the National Airport acquisition would add another important domestic hub.
As for Europe, he said the association with KLM could give Northwest the advantages of new routes to Europe without having to buy and fly the routes. He said Northwest could offer its frequent-flier customers flights to Europe on KLM, with coordinated connecting flights on Northwest.
"If done well, it's as good as flying the system itself," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Continue Upward

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose again yesterday and yields fell, as traders responded to a second day of seemingly positive developments in the Persian Gulf war by buying notes and bonds.
In addition to the generally favorable news from the gulf, credit market participants said the nearly pervasive sense that the Federal Reserve Board would move soon to push down short-term interest rates also helped to buttress prices. 
 "Everybody understands that the Fed chairman has given the market assurance that the Fed will be helpful in the near term," one government bond trader said. "That assurance is the groundwork for further gains."
In Congressional testimony earlier this week, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, suggested that the central bank was looking at a number of options, including a reduction in short-term interest rates, to stimulate the economy and address the credit squeeze at the nation's commercial banks.
Although the fixed-income market dotes on bad economic news, largely because such reports tend to push down inflation, the Government announcement yesterday of a rise of 67,000 in initial unemployment claims for the week ended Jan. 12, to 463,000, did not create much of a stir.
"For the next few weeks, the bond market is likely to be more responsive to reports of defections from the Iraqi Army than it is to weekly unemployment claims numbers," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc.
Similarly, market participants gave only a token response after the Federal Reserve reported late yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Jan. 14. The narrowest measure, M-1, fell by $4.2 billion.
 
Concern Over Money Growth
 In recent weeks, Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have expressed concern about weak money growth.
Analysts said the money figures were pretty much in line with expectations.
Market participants said that an auction of $9 billion worth of new five-year Treasury notes went well.
The securities were sold at an average yield of 7.62 percent, the lowest yield on a five-year note in nearly four years. At the last five-year note sale on Nov. 28, the average yield was 7.95 percent.
Trading activity, which dealers said was fairly brisk early in the session, wound down as the day progressed. In part, traders said they were unwilling to establish additional positions in advance of a report expected from the Commerce Department this morning on how the economy fared in the fourth quarter.
 
Estimates on the G.N.P.
 Virtually all economists inside the Government and out are predicting that the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate will show that the gross national product contracted sharply in the fourth quarter. Estimates of the rate of decline range from as low as 2 percent to as high as 4 percent.
In making their projections, most analysts have added that the fourth-quarter decline in output will most likely represent the steepest slide of the recession.
"We are in the neighborhood of down 3.0 percent," for the fourth quarter, said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. "And while it is a reasonable forecast that the drop was the steepest in the fourth quarter, that isn't very comforting."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered in late trading at a price of 106 18/32, up 14/ 32, to yield 8.15 percent, compared with 8.19 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 1/2, up 1/4 point, to yield 7.97 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.03 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.11 percent, down one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills were offered at a 6.15 percent rate, down three basis points.
In other developments, positive developments in the Persian Gulf spurred a number of corporations to price new debt issues in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
Among the issuers was BP America, the American subsidiary of the British Petroleum Corporation.
The company offered $350 million of 8 3/4 percent 12-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The securities were priced at $99.75, to yield 8.784 percent, 80 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which mature Feb. 1, 2003, are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of outstanding Chrysler Corporation and Chrysler Financial Corporation securities were little changed despite the fact that a major ratings agency, Fitch Investors Service Inc., lowered its ratings on $12.5 billion worth of debt to BB-plus, a sub-investment grade level, from BBB.
"The downgrade is already in the market," one trader said.
Traders said that prices of most corporate bonds rose by about 1/8 point in generally sluggish trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/4 point, traders said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Climb Broadly as Dow Jumps 24.01

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
With no unsettling news from the Middle East by closing time, stock prices advanced broadly yesterday in the heaviest trading in a week.
Analysts attributed it to Wednesday's Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that the economy needs a lift -- a clue that he would make sure it happens. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 24.01, or nearly 1 percent, to 2,643.07. Birinyi Associates said repeated waves of computerized program buying raised the blue-chip index close to 21 points.
Activity soared to 223.2 million shares, up from 169.4 million the day before and the highest since last Friday.
The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.4 percent, or the equivalent of 37 points on the Dow, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed nearly 2 percent, the equivalent of 56 Dow points.
 
Gains Outpace Declines
 Advances outnumbered declines 3 to 1, with 1,231 stocks, or 61 percent of the Big Board total, ahead for the day while 398 fell. Seventy-two stocks reached new highs and 17 fell to new lows.
Analysts were impressed by the rise in secondary stocks, the mainstay of the Nasdaq index. The lesser stocks were a big factor in leading the market out of its lows last October and are expected to do it again.
From airlines, banks, chemical companies and paper to technology, drugs, insurance and retailing, the advance in the Dow extended across most leading industry groups.
Airlines were especially strong, rising in the wake of weak crude oil prices and the news that foreigners would be allowed to invest more heavily in American air carriers.
The rise pushed the Dow transportation index ahead 40.02 points, or 4 percent, with UAL up 5 1/4, to 128 3/4; Airborne Freight 2 1/8, to 20 1/2; AMR 1 1/2, to 52 5/8; Delta Air Lines 1 3/4, to 68 3/8, and Southwest Airlines 1 5/8, to 22 5/8. Conrail rose 4 3/8, to 44 1/2, after reporting better-than-expected profits.
 
March Crude Oil Contract
 The March crude oil contract, meanwhile, fell 33 cents, to $21.71 a barrel, close to its low for the day.
"Many people were puzzled why the transportation index went up so much," said Hugh Johnson, chief strategist for the brokerage firm First Albany Corporation. "I think the main reason was that the Saudi oilfields appear to be safe," but he also cited the relaxation of limits on foreign investment in airlines.
He attributed the rise in the Dow to "a carry-over of Greenspan's testimony on Wednesday implying that the Fed was prepared to lower short-term interest rates, particularly if bank lending and money growth remains sluggish."
Shocked by the rise in the market -- after Wednesday's gain -- short-sellers who had hoped to make a killing if the market fell, were forced to buy to cover stock they had borrowed, driving the market ahead.
The Dow picked up steam from the opening bell. By 10 A.M. it was ahead nearly 25 points. Bt 11:15 it was up 31. Prices fell a little but by 12:30 were ahead 33 points.
Traders have become accustomed to shocks from the Middle East late in the day, which may explain why the Dow drifted a little toward the close.
Despite the strong rise in the Dow industrials, individual price gains were mainly thin. A.T.& T. rose 5/8, to 29; Kodak 1/8, to 40 1/8, and Coca-Cola 3/4, to 48 7/8. But International Paper tacked on 2 1/4, to 57 7/8; Boeing 1 5/8, to 48 3/4; I.B.M. 1 3/4, to 121, and Sears 1, to 26 7/8.
Blockbuster Entertainment, which has been strong since the fall, headed the Big Board active list, sliding 2 1/4, to 25 5/8, on 4.8 million shares even though fourth-quarter earnings met analyst estimates.
Data General, a technology company, rose 4, to 8 1/4, after going into the black in the December quarter. Bankers Trust fell 4 1/8, to 41, after George Salem, banking analyst for Prudential-Bache, cut his earnings estimate for this year after a lower-than-expected 1990.
News Corporation, headed by Rupert Murdoch, rose 7/8, to 7 7/8. He said he was prepared to dilute his family's 45 percent control by issuing more full voting stock, Dow Jones reported.
 
Tokyo Stocks Advance
TOKYO, Friday, Jan. 25 (REUTERS) -- Japanese stocks rose today for the second straight gain. The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 304.24 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 25,573.25. The Nikkei rose 218.91 points on Thursday.

HEADLINE: A.T.& T.'s Earnings Are Flat

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
A.T.& T. announced yesterday that its earnings were nearly flat in the fourth quarter. The loss of tax credits, higher interest expenses and reduced gains from cash investments and asset sales offset a strong increase in operating profits.
Two of the seven regional Bell companies created by the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984 also reported fourth-quarter results yesterday. U S West posted a tiny gain in profits, while Nynex reported that profits from operations fell slightly. Nynex also announced a one-time after-tax loss of $211 million, mostly to cover losses and reorganization costs in subsidiaries selling equipment and software to businesses. 
 Nynex fared worse than U S West because of management problems, regulatory disputes and a weakening economy in the Northeast, said Marion M. Boucher, a telephone industry bond analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
A.T.& T.
A.T.& T. said it earned $698 million, or 64 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, off about 1 percent from $705 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter jumped about 7 percent, to $9.96 billion from $9.31 billion.
The nation's largest long-distance carrier also reported modest increases in sales and profits for all of 1990.
Morris Tanenbaum, the chief financial officer and a vice chairman of A.T.& T., said that while the company's executives had hoped for better earnings in 1990, he was satisfied with the results because of weaknesses in the economy last year. "Considering the environment we have had, particularly in the last three quarters of last year, I think our people have done a really solid job," he said.
John S. Bain, a telephone industry analyst at Raymond James & Associates, a brokerage in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the company had exceeded his earnings estimate of 62 cents a share because of continued growth in long-distance telephone traffic and rising sales of telephone company switching equipment. "Everything looks good across the board," he said.
James M. McCabe, a telephone industry analyst at Nomura Securities, said A.T.& T.'s telecommunications equipment business had done much better than he had expected, while the long-distance business had done worse.
A.T.& T. reported an 8 percent increase in long-distance traffic in the quarter but only a 1.8 percent increase in long-distance revenues. More and more large business customers are buying packages of telecommunications services at heavily discounted rates, instead of paying for each service separately at higher rates.
The company said it had stopped losing market share in the business market, and Mr. Tanenbaum said this change contributed to the company's growth in long-distance traffic.
This growth did not drop at the end of the quarter even though the economy was slowing, said C. Perry Colwell, A.T.& T.'s senior vice president for financial management. "We were pleased with the strength we saw in December," he said, "and we closed out the year on a strong note."
A.T.& T. predicted that it might not feel the full effects of a recession until this year but added that it expected the economy and its own financial results to rebound later this year.
Some analysts have suggested that A.T.& T.'s rising marketing expenses could reduce its profit margins on long-distance service and that a drop in long-distance traffic this year could plunge the industry into a costly price war.
A.T.& T.'s companywide sales and administrative expenses rose in the fourth quarter. But the increase was partly offset by a $50 million drop in network operation expenses, the result of labor cutbacks and heavy investment in computerized equipment that requires little maintenance.
Mr. Tanenbaum said that A.T.& T. would not start a price war and that "it is not our intention to join or to fuel a price war."
Several regional Bell companies have reported anemic growth in telephone lines during the fourth quarter, a situation that has traditionally led to reduced purchases of new switching equipment. While A.T.& T.'s sales of telephone network equipment to these companies were weak in the fourth quarter, sales to other domestic phone companies and to foreign companies more than made up the difference.
The company reported that its overall sales of telephone network products and services grew 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, A.T.& T.'s share price gained 37.5 cents, to $30.875.
 
Nynex
The main provider of local telephone service in New York and New England announced a series of changes in its unregulated businesses and took a $211 million charge to cover the anticipated cost.
Nynex said it would seek a corporate partner for Nynex Business Centers, which sells office computers. Nynex said it also planned to sell or transfer to another division its 460-employee unit that maintains office telecommunications equipment. And the company took several one-time losses relating to its purchase and sale of various small software companies and the creation of a holding company for some overseas operations.
The New York Department of Law and the New York State Public Service Commission are investigating whether some of these unregulated business-equipment subsidiaries overcharged the company's regulated local telephone companies. Peter T. Goodale, a spokesman for Nynex, said yesterday's moves were part of a continuing effort to reorganize the company and were not related to the investigations.
David S. Cook, owner and chairman of the Computerland franchise in Hartford, said that Nynex Business Centers had been selling computers for as little as 1 percent above wholesale cost. Most companies charge a 12 to 15 percent markup to cover costs like labor, rent and advertising, he added.
Mr. Goodale said the Nynex unit became profitable in the fourth quarter of last year and was growing.
Nynex earned $60.7 million, or 30 cents a share, on sales of $3.44 billion in the fourth quarter. A year earlier it had a loss of $43.7 million, or 22 cents a share, on sales of $3.37 billion.
Excluding one-time charges in both quarters, earnings fell 3.4 percent, to $271.7 million from $281.3 million.
For 1990, Nynex's profits rose 17.6 percent, to $949.4 million, or $4.78 a share, from $807.6 million, or $4.10 a share, in 1989. Sales rose about 3 percent, to $13.59 billion from $13.20 billion.
Nynex's share price rose 75 cents, to $68.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
U S West
The dominant provider of local telephone service in 14 Western states reported fourth-quarter earnings of $348 million, or 89 cents a share, up about 1 percent from $344.4 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 3.9 percent, to $2.64 billion from $2.54 billion.
In all of 1990, U S West Inc. earned $1.20 billion, or $3.11 a share, up 8.1 percent from $1.11 billion, or $3.01 a share, in 1989. Sales rose 2.8 percent, to $9.96 billion from $9.69 billion.
U S West's share price climbed 50 cents yesterday, to $36.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: British Court Decision Could Hurt U.S. Banks

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
In a decision that exposes United States commercial and investment banks to tens of millions and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars in potential losses, the House of Lords today upheld a lower-court ruling that local governments in Britain had no authority to enter into complex financial transactions known as interest-rate swaps.
The unanimous ruling by the five law lords of the House, which serves as Britain's highest court of appeals, means that international financial institutions -- including American companies like Citicorp, Chemical, Security Pacific, J.P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers -- face losses that could total as much as 600 million ($1.18 billion). But one banker at an American institution who spoke on the condition of anonymity estimated that exposure of United States banks was probably no more than 10 to 15 percent of the total, or no more than $176 million. 
 Many American and British banks had previously added to their reserves to cover the potential losses following rulings by lower courts, which date back to November 1989.
Interest rate swaps are basically transactions in which two parties agree to exchange interest payments on their debts. The financial institutions are liable in this case because the way they arranged the swaps was to enter into the individual agreements themselves; offsetting one swap against the other so their own position was neutral. Before the current case, many financial institutions, lawyers, accountants and local governments had interpreted existing law to mean that the local governments could enter into swaps as part of their legal power to borrow.
 
'Provide a Just Outcome'
 In response to today's decision, financial institutions called on the British Government to pass a law that would make most if not all of the deals legal. The decision "now frees the British Government to take action and to provide a just outcome," said Mark C. Brickell, chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association, whose members include 130 financial institutions in 15 countries.
Mr. Brickell, who is also a vice president at J.P. Morgan & Company, noted in a phone interview from New York that the Conservative Government had previously said it would take no action while the matter was before the courts.
If the Government does not act, financial institutions said they might sue those who had either entered into the swap deals or who had rendered opinions that they were legal. These include local governments, their individual councilors, lawyers and accounting firms
Several bankers said today that 130 local governments in Britain had engaged in interest-rate swaps with 78 banks. The Press Association, the British news agency, put the number of local governments at more than 70.
 
Hundreds of Lawsuits Are Likely
 "There are likely to be hundreds of lawsuits," said Daniel Cunningham, a lawyer for the International Swap Dealers Association. Indeed, several American banks and many British banks had filed lawsuits against local governments that were on hold, pending the outcome of the test case. Today, some bankers said they would proceed with those suits unless the British Government enacted a law to legalize swaps.
Mr. Cunningham, a partner at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, said in a phone interview from New York that under British legal doctrine known as restitution, banks might be able to insist that parties in the deals remiburse whatever they had paid to each other, and in essence go back to where they stood before entering into the deals.
In a phone interview from New York, Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Chemical, said the bank's lawyers were studying the decision. But she added: "In our opinion, many legal avenues still exist and can be pursued. This decision" by the House of Lords "is unlikely to be the end of the matter." She said Chemical added $26 million to its reserves to cover its exposure in late 1989.
Spokesmen for Citicorp and J.P. Morgan said their banks had modest exposures. And Citicorp, which has a lawsuit pending against a local government, has already set aside reserves.
Executives of Amerian and British banks said if the British Government did not settle the dispute, it would undermine confidence in British financial markets and threaten London's position as a major financial center.
 
Reluctance to Lend
 Some bankers also warned that unless a new law were passed to legalize most swaps, including past deals, financial institutions would be reluctant to lend to local governments.
Sir Jack Layden, chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said the Government "must act to head off the torrent of litigation that could flow from this decision. If it does not act, then taxpayers, local government and the reputation of" London "as an international banking center could all suffer."
The case arose over the use of swaps by the local government of Hammersmith and Fulham, a London borough. While most local governments that engaged in swaps did so as part of their prudent management of debt, Hammersmith and Fulham reportedly tried to use them to make a profit and increase its spending resources. This occurred at a time when the Conservative Government then headed by Margaret Thatcher was trying to limit local government spending.
Mrs. Thatcher believed that many local governments, especially those controlled by the opposition Labor Party, were irresponsible big spenders.
The dozens of institutions that had made swaps with the borough included Midland and Barclays, the British banks; Security Pacific; Chemical; Citicorp, and Japan's Mitsubishi Finance International.

HEADLINE: Bush Said to Lean Toward Summit Delay

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Administration officials said today that it was increasingly likely that the next Soviet-American summit meeting would be postponed, as President Bush came under increasing pressure from Congress to put off the Moscow meeting because of the violence in the Baltic republics.
After a meeting in the White House today between Mr. Bush and Republican Congressional leaders, some lawmakers who attended the session said Mr. Bush was warned of a rising sentiment in Congress for him to take some action toward Moscow, and that postponing the summit meeting, scheduled for Feb. 11 to 13, seemed like a good way to do that. 
 "There was sentiment that he should not go," Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota, said of the hourlong meeting, which also touched on the situation in the Persian Gulf and domestic issues.
A senior Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Bush's initial disapproval of Soviet policy toward Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia had hardened into a sense of "outrage" during the recent violence in the Baltic regions, which are seeking independence from Moscow.
 
Baltics and Other Reasons
 After some initial reluctance to put off the summit talks, primarily because of his desire not to undercut President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's position, Mr. Bush is now leaning more strongly toward a delay, officials said.
According to another senior official, Mr. Bush told the Republican lawmakers this morning that if the summit meeting was delayed, he wanted to find a way to do so "in a way that doesn't weaken Gorbachev's position vis-a-vis those who might be more authoritarian than he is or who seek to strengthen the crackdown in the Baltics."
For that reason, officials said that if Mr. Bush made the final decision not to go to Moscow in February as planned, the White House would avoid citing the Baltics as the only reason. Instead, both sides are likely to present a delay as a "mutual decision" that was also based on the war in the gulf and on delays in arms-control talks.
The final decision is expected to be made after a meeting this weekend between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh of the Soviet Union, officials said.
 
Soviet Official's Customary Call
 The White House said no meeting had been scheduled between Mr. Bessmertnykh and Mr. Bush, but officials said it was customary for the Soviet Foreign Minister to be received in the Oval Office when he is in Washington.
The possibility that the summit meeting would be postponed was first reported by Administration officials more than two weeks ago, as war in the Persian Gulf loomed, Soviet internal tensions worsened and negotiators from both countries remained snagged in their efforts to wrap up a treaty on reducing long-range nuclear weapons. That treaty is to be signed at the Moscow summit meeting.
The United States and the Soviet Union also are at odds over American assertions that Moscow is evading counting and verification rules in the treaty on reducing conventional weapons that was signed in November in Paris. Until those problems are solved, Administration officials said, Congress has warned Mr. Bush that he should not send that treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent.
The White House has said there is no formal linkage between the two treaties. But officials have made it clear in private that the Administration is not eager to conclude the treaty on long-range missiles while the fate of the accord on conventional arms is unsettled.
 
Gorbachev's Backing in Gulf
 A senior official indicated today that there had been a significant change in the Administration's thinking about the summit talks, shifting the burden of proof, in effect, from those who argued that the summit meeting should be put off to those who are arguing that Mr. Bush should proceed with the plan to go to Moscow.
The official said he did not want to paint too pessimistic a view of Soviet-American relations, particularly because of the Administration's desire to promote democratic change in that country and because of Mr. Gorbachev's continued support for American policy in the gulf.
But he said, "The summit is being reconsidered because of the war, because of the arms-control problem and because of the situation in the Baltics."
He continued: "If we can clear all those things out of the way, maybe there is still a chance. But it clearly is up in the air."
 
Senate Vote on Baltics
 During this morning's meeting in the White House, Mr. Weber said: "There was no pounding of the table and saying, 'You better not go to Moscow.' But there's a sense that we ought to make our position clear to Moscow as firmly as we can and the summit is one of the few pieces of leverage that we have."
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, also said that some of those at the meeting suggested that Mr. Bush consider a delay in the summit.
By a vote of 99 to 0, the Senate today passed a nonbinding resolution condemning Soviet action in the Baltics. It urged the President to suspend all technical exchanges with the Soviet Union, review all American economic assistance to Moscow and consider withdrawing Washington's support for Soviet membership in the world's financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE COSTS;
2 Unsavory Choices on the Budget: Increase Borrowing or Raise Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
No one knows how much the war will cost. That is because no one knows how long it will last, how many lost planes and expended weapons will have to be replaced and how much money the allies will contribute to offset the price to the American taxpayer.
 But the cost, running at several hundred million dollars a day since the shooting began, is sure to be substantial, and that started a debate this week over how the war should be paid for. 
 Policy makers have their fingers crossed that a healthy share of the tab will be picked up by the Japanese, the Germans and the Saudis, but most officials agree that the United States will end up bearing the brunt of the financial cost as well as the human cost of the allied effort.
 
Two Options
 Since few in the Administration or Congress are willing to cut domestic spending by enough to pay the war bills, there are only two ways to meet them: by raising taxes or by borrowing the money.
Those who favor a "pay as you go" approach take their text from the contrast between the American experiences in Korea and Vietnam.
In 1950, at the outset of the Korean War, taxes were raised; the country came out of the war with inflation under control, and the economy boomed after the war.
By contrast, President Lyndon B. Johnson waited for more than a year to propose a tax increase after his Council of Economic Advisers in late 1965 recommended one to pay for the Vietnam buildup. Then, Congress did not approve the war surtax for another 18 months. The inflation that resulted from the increased budget deficit damaged the economy for years afterward.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist, say that circumstances now are different in two respects from those that existed at the outset of the Vietnam War.
 
Recession Is a Factor
 First, the economy was growing rapidly in the mid-1960's; now it is in recession. As a consequence, inflation is a less serious threat now than it was then. And a tax increase now, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Reischauer said at separate Congressional hearings this week, could worsen the recession. Mr. Greenspan urged Congress not to raise taxes to pay for the war, even though that would increase the budget deficit.
The second difference is that when the fighting began in Vietnam, the military's supply of planes, tanks, ships and weapons was deemed inadequate, and a rapid expansion of Pentagon spending ensued. Now, because of the military buildup in the 1980's and the end of the cold war, the war in the Persian Gulf can be fought largely with stockpiled weapons and equipment.
Each of the Navy's Tomahawk cruise missiles, for example, costs $1 million to produce. But if new missiles are not produced to replace the ones that are shot in the war, there is no budget cost and thus no cost to the economy.
Economists acknowledge that borrowing the money to finance the war would substantially raise the budget deficit, which already will be above $300 billion this year. The war costs could easily wipe out the nearly $40 billion in deficit reduction for the fiscal year 1991 that President Bush and Congress so laboriously negotiated in the fall. That would lead to somewhat higher interest rates, less saving and investment and some long-term harm to the economy, they say.
 
Uncertainty Is Cited
 But most economists in and out of the Government agree that to raise taxes now when the country is in a recession and when no one has the foggiest idea how much money will be needed would be foolhardy.
"This is a one-time emergency expenditure," a Bush Administration economist said in an interview. "It's like an investment, like a city issuing a bond to pay for a sewer system, and it makes more sense to deficit finance than to tax finance."
Charles L. Schultze, who was budget director in the Johnson Administration and who is now a senior fellow in economics at the Brookings Institution, said he agreed that taxes should not be raised while the economy is in recession and that taxes might not need to go up at all if the war turns out to be a short one. But he said, "If as we learn more, the costs seem to be at the higher end of what seems probable, once we're in recovery we probably ought to put on a temporary tax to recover the loss."
But some politicians are uneasy with the idea of going further into debt to pay for the war. "We face a choice of whether we are going to face up to this thing and do it on a 'pay as you go' basis or let it slide by and let our grandchildren pay for it," said Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat.
The lawmakers have been frustrated by the Bush Administration's reluctance to address the matter fully and publicly. Charles H. Bowsher, the Comptroller General and the Government's top auditor, told Congress that the Pentagon's accounting systems were so weak that it was impossible to measure the costs with any precision. Indeed, the budget President Bush will send to Congress early next month will have what budget writers call a "place-holder," a number picked out of the blue with a notation that the actual amount cannot be estimated.
 
Sharing the Burden
 What the politicians want, of course, is for more of the burden to be borne by the allies, particularly Japan and Germany, which have strong economies, rely on Middle Eastern oil and do not have any troops in the gulf region.
Japan promised $4 billion last year but has only paid about $600 million so far. After days of behind-the-scenes wrangling, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced today that Japan would give another $9 billion this year. But the contribution must be approved by Parliament, and Mr. Kaifu faces strong opposition on the issue.
Germany pledged about $3 billion last year, but actually contributed about a tenth of that. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, despite strong antiwar sentiment among Germans, has promised an additional, unspecific amount this year. Mr. Kohl said he would probably have to raise the money with a tax increase. Analysts said the Chancellor was simply using the war as an excuse for higher taxes that were necessary in Germany for other reasons, principally to pay the high costs of the unification of West and East Germany. In any case, getting the allies to contribute a larger share may be easier said than done.
"What do we have to do to force the Germans and the Japanese and others to pay more?" Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, asked a panel of economists at a hearing this week. "How do we do it? What kind of leverage do we have?"
The economists had no ready answer.

HEADLINE: Microsystems' Results Soar

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Buoyed by strong demand for its newest work stations, Sun Microsystems Inc. today reported record revenues and earnings for its second quarter. The company said internal cost controls helped increase its profitability.
For the quarter ended Dec. 28, Sun had earnings of $39.1 million, or 39 cents a share, nearly 94 percent above the $20.2 million, or 23 cents a share, it reported in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenues rose nearly 27 percent, to $753.5 million, from $595.4 million in the second quarter of the 1990 fiscal year.
About half of Sun's revenues were derived from outside the United States. The strength of foreign currencies relative to the dollar benefited revenues and earnings.
"Our momentum in the marketplace has helped us overcome the economic and product uncertainty of the last several quarters," Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement.
He said that while overall economic conditions could suppress demand, Sun is confident about the remaining quarters of 1991.
The company's shares rose 62.5 cents today, to $27.875, in over-the-counter trading before the results were announced. Sun's trading volume of almost 2.1 million shares was the seventh highest of the day.

HEADLINE: Disney Profits Drop 2% for Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company's profits dropped 2 percent in the final three months of 1990, the first quarterly decrease in six years, as the recession and Persian Gulf worries hurt theme park attendance, Disney said.
Disney said today that domestic tourism was so soft that revenues from its booming film entertainment division exceeded those from theme parks and resorts for the first time.
In the quarter ending Dec. 31, the first quarter in Disney's fiscal year, the company earned $170.4million, compared with $174.4 million in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Revenues, pumped up by the film entertainment and consumer products divisions, rose 16 percent, from $1.29 billion to $1.49 billion. Earnings on a per-share basis rose from $1.26 to $1.28 as Disney bought back stock. Disney's stock closed today at $99.50, down $1.625 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Film entertainment revenues surged 28 percent, to $646 million, and operating profits rose 19 percent, to $92 million, Disney said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Revises New York Census: City Is Growing, Not Shrinking

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE

 BODY:
The United States Census Bureau revised its 1990 count of New York City's population yesterday, adding 289,385 people to its August count and providing the city with a net gain since 1980.
The new figure, 7,322,564, was about 300,000 people short of the population estimate by city officials, but it represented an important statistical gain that left New York as one of the few older urban areas to experience such growth. The previous figure, released in August, left the city with a population of 7,033,179, a slight decline from 1980. 
 The increase failed to silence a fierce debate between the Census Bureau and city officials over the correct count. Mayor David N. Dinkins continued to insist that the numbers were incorrect.
 
'Report Falls Short'
 "After much prodding, we are pleased that the bureau no longer is headed in the wrong direction, is no longer statistically shrinking a city which actually is growing," the Mayor said. "But even today's bureau report falls short -- far short -- of the number of people who live in New York City."
The Census Bureau reported that all three states in the metropolitan area gained in population during the 1980's, though at a far slower pace than the national average of 10 percent.
The biggest gainer proportionally was Connecticut, whose population grew to 3,287,116, up by 5.8 percent from 3,107,564. The number of New Jersey residents increased to 7,730,188, up 5 percent from 7,365,011. The population of New York State rose to 17,990,455, up 2.5 percent from 17,558,165 in 1980.
The figures released yesterday were part of the second of three rounds of reports from the 1990 census. They would normally be considered final, but this year's results are subject to a Federal court ruling on a lawsuit filed by New York, Chicago and other urban areas seeking to force the bureau to adjust its figures.
In adding to the August figures for New York City, the Census Bureau again acknowledged that its earlier figure was incomplete. Since August the census officials have recanvassed neighborhoods where initial counts looked suspiciously low and have obtained from state correction officials lists of parolees and probationers who might have been missed during the initial counting.
The population of New York City increased by 3.5 percent over the last decade, in part because Manhattan enjoyed its first big jump in residents since before World War I, the Census Bureau reported yesterday.
 
Reversal of Loss
 The new population figure of 7,322,564 is up from 7,071,639 in 1980 and reverses the loss of more than 800,000 people during the previous decade. All five boroughs showed population increases of at least 3 percent, with Staten Island, the least densely populated, having the largest gain, 7.7 percent.
The figures released yesterday were 4 percent higher than those in preliminary data released in August, when the final phases of the 1990 count were still under way. At the time the bureau put the city's population at 7,033,179, but indicated that more people would be added before the count was complete.
New York City's turnaround in the 1980's contrasted sharply with the continuing decline in the state's other large cities. Albany was essentially stable, but Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers all showed falloffs in population.
 
Big Drop in Newark
 Among New Jersey cities, Newark's population plummeted by 16.4 percent -- from 329,248 in 1980 to 275,221 in 1990 -- but Elizabeth, Jersey City, Paterson and Camden all registered modest gains.
Connecticut's largest city, Bridgeport, showed a drop of 0.6 percent -- from 142,546 in 1980 to 141,686 in 1990 -- but that state's other large cities -- Hartford, New Haven, Stamford and Waterbury -- showed gains.
Demographers attributed New York City's increase primarily to more births and new immigrants. Emmanuel Tobier, an economics professor at the Urban Research Center at New York University, noted that with the exception of "little blips" in the 1930's and 1940's, Manhattan had been declining steadily since a population peak in 1910 of 2,332,000. The borough's increase was fueled in part by a surge of jobs in fields like the financial services industry, experts said.
Mr. Tobier, who believes that the figures released yesterday underestimate the city's population by 200,000 to 300,000 people called the city's population growth "remarkable" because "it makes New York one of the few older big cities in the frostbelt or the rustbelt to show an increase."
 
Urban Decline Slows
 Other figures released yesterday by the Census Bureau showed that the rate of urban population decline in the country slowed during the last decade but did not stop.
Philadelphia, which lost 261,000 people in the 1970's, lost 103,000 more in the past decade, bringing its population to 1,586,000. In the 1980's, Pittsburgh lost 55,000 people, or 13 percent of its population, which now stands at 370,000. It had declined by 19 percent from 1970 to 1980.
This pattern was also evident in Ohio, where four of the five most populous cities -- Cleveland, Cincinnati, Akron and Toledo -- continued to show population declines. The state capital of Columbus, however, grew by 12 percent to 633,000 -- a gain that pushed it ahead of Cleveland as the state's most populous city. Cleveland's population, which declined by 12 percent, is now 505,000.
 
Detroit Tops a Million
 Detroit, which lost 175,000 people, or 14.6 percent of its population in the 1980's, barely nudged above one million with a population of 1,028,000. The city had fallen below one million in the August preliminary counts, creating fears that it would lose special taxing powers and other revenue benefits that Michigan law grants to cities whose population exceeds one million.
The Census Bureau also released data on the racial composition of New Jersey, showing that the percentage of the non-Hispanic white population of the state in 1990 was 79.3 percent, down from 83.2 percent in 1980. The largest increase was registered by Hispanic people, whose total rose from 491,883 in 1980 to 739,861, or 9.6 percent of New Jersey's population.
Such racial data is used in the redrawing of Congressional districts to prevent legislatures from diluting the impact of minority votes when creating districts.

HEADLINE: Sales of Cars and Light Trucks Down by 20.2%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks made in the United States fell 20.2 percent in mid-January, as demand for vehicles remained sluggish.
Industry analysts cautioned that the market for vehicles could become volatile, as consumers are buffeted by sometimes contradictory economic signals and war-related developments. 
 The 10 auto makers with United States plants sold 123,994 cars between Jan. 11 and Jan. 20, a decline of 10.8 percent from the corresponding period last year, when sales were moderately strong. Sales of United States-made light trucks plunged 33.5 percent, as consumers shunned less fuel-efficient vehicles.
There were eight selling days in the period this year, and nine last year.
Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.6 million, compared with 7.1 million in the period last year. The sales pace for the last 30 days was 6.9 million; for the last 60 days, it was 6.3 million.
Analysts said the mid-January results pointed to a deepening recession, suggesting that vehicle sales would stay soft.
 
Production Cuts Seen
 They added that buyer wariness caused by the war and economic uncertainty could could result in further production cuts during the first quarter at plants operated by the Big Three domestic auto makers. The car companies have already scheduled widespread temporary shutdowns because dealer orders have slipped.
Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter, said United States truck output for January was running 14 percent below schedule, while car assemblies were 7 percent behind planned output.
The General Motors Corporation said it will cut one of two work shifts at two car assembly plants later this year in Fairfax, Kan. and Van Nuys, Calif. At the G.M. plant in Fairfax, which makes the Pontiac Grand Prix model, 975 workers will be indefinitely idled. The G.M. plant in Van Nuys makes the Chevy Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, and 850 workers there will be indefinitely idled.
The Big Three domestic auto makers reported a 22 percent drop in overall sales of cars and light trucks. The Japanese companies with United States plants posted a collective sales gain of 1.1 percent in mid-January.
In cars alone, however, the so-called Japanese transplants suffered a 7 percent decline in sales of United States-produced cars, compared with a drop of 11.3 percent in sales of cars made by the Big Three.
The sales results include an estimate for the Chrysler Corporation, which since January has stopped reporting sales of its vehicles every 10 days. The estimates, provided by Ward's Automotive Reports, indicated Chrysler's sales of domestically produced cars fell 19.8 percent, to 14,400. Sales of Chrysler's mini-vans, Jeeps and pickup trucks plummeted 54.7 percent, to an estimated 12,930 vehicles in mid-January.
Last year, sales of Chrysler mini-vans were helped by large incentives.
G.M. sold 59,913 United States-made cars in mid-January, a decline of 3.3 percent. G.M.'s light-truck sales fell 25.3 percent, to 27,269 units.
The Ford Motor Company's domestic car sales were down 19.5 percent, to 33,173 units. The company's light-truck sales were off 30 percent, to 22,255.
The Toyota Motor Corporation posted a decline of 37.9 percent in sales of cars made at its plant in Georgetown, Ky., and the joint venture plant it operates with General Motors in Fremont, Calif. Toyota also reported that sales of imported cars in mid-January fell 23.4 percent, to 7,351 cars. Toyota's sales of imported light trucks were down 22.4 percent, to 4,561 units.
The Honda Motor Company's sales of United States-made cars were flat, at 6,490 units.
The Nissan Motor Company said it sold 2,178 domestically produced cars, up 44 percent from last year.
