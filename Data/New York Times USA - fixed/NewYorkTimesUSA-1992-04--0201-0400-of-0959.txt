HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New York;
After Scanning Ballot, New York Rolls Its Eyes

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ

 BODY:
Come, hear the voices of New York on the eve of Election Day:
They are cries of "Yes!" for Bill Clinton at a Brooklyn restaurant, thumbs down for him just a few tables away. They are disappointment. They are Jerry Brown the savior in Harlem, Jerry Brown the untrustworthy in Westchester. They are shrugs. They are jokes that while one candidate never inhaled, the other never exhaled. 
 "I am voting for the Governor of Arkansas," said 63-year-old Paul Hammond of West Islip, L.I., adding that the Governor, Mr. Clinton, was the one Democrat who could win in November.
With that, his companion at the movies, Jane Congro, broke into a smirk. "When I go into the voting booth," she said, "I'm on my own, and I don't trust Bill Clinton."
Said Mr. Hammond, "We're going to have to talk about this."
 
A Collective Sigh
 If there is one sound that rose up from New York over the weekend, it wasn't a shout but a giant collective sigh. No fire-in-the-soul political religion here. In some 250 conversations throughout the city and its suburbs, most Democrats lamented that all they could do was choose the lesser of two evils. Support for Mr. Brown was strong, but more and more people seemed to be coming to the realization that the Democratic nominee is almost certain to be Mr. Clinton so they might as well grit their teeth and learn to live with it.
"What else can you do?" asked Robert Cherry, a 34-year-old Manhattan lawyer. "Brown's flaky. Tsongas dropped out. So we'll put all our money on Clinton and watch him lose to Bush."
Time and again, the most telling comments by supporters of both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown, the former Governor of California, were not so much the words as the shakes of the head, the rolls of the eyes.
"The lesser of two evils," Victor Desanguine, 63, a plant engineer in Mount Vernon, said of Mr. Clinton.
"The lesser of two evils," Barry Lankford, 42, of Jamaica Estates said of Mr. Brown.
The conversations were riddled with contradictions: People are fed up with political deal-making, yet many want the most extreme of all political deals, a brokered convention. People are beside themselves when talking of their anger at Government, yet they throw up their arms, resigned to an election with no candidates they like. In similar interviews last month in Michigan, the overall emotion was rage. But in New York, it's frustration.
"It's so irritating," said Helene Saks, a 43-year-old secretary in Manhattan. "I'm angry, but I don't feel there's anything I can do about it. These are the choices. That's it."
Nowhere was the frustration more evident than in Woodside, Queens, a working-class neighborhood that is nearly 75 percent Democratic and that feels left out. On one shopping street on Friday, under the shadow of the elevated subway line, not one person had received a piece of campaign mail or a telephone call.
 
Talk of Character
 Dorothy W. Viggiano of Woodside said she would vote for Mr. Clinton but bemoaned the loss of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. She said she had voted for Mr. Bush in 1988 but would do her best to stay Democratic in November. "The Democrats put up such ding-dongs the last time around," she said. "What can you do? You're forced into going the other way."
In the conversations throughout the New York area, some people cited issues, like the candidates' economic platforms, as their big concern. But most people talked of personalities and character. Accusations that Mr. Clinton had been involved in an extramarital affair and questions about conflicts between his family financial interests and state business were raised in all parts of the metropolitan area, but especially by the elderly and in Roman Catholic working-class sections.
Richard J. McCabe, a 55-year-old bus driver eating in Woodside said he had problems with a man who wants to take "the oath of office as President of the United States and violates the most basic vow, the vow between husband and wife."
Said Joseph S. King, an 80-year-old drama critic and playwright, "He has to have better ethics and morality. If he said 'I made a mistake,' I would trust him more."
 
See Strength and Frailty
 In the neighborhood of two-family brick row houses north of Flushing Meadow Park, Mr. Clinton was almost universally labeled "slick."
"Clinton is a phony from the word 'go' " said Bob Reddy, a 33-year-old electrician. "I'm afraid to see what they're going to pull out of his closet."
Mr. Clinton did not help himself any with his admission that he had smoked marijuana, but not inhaled. In a line that was echoed throughout the area, Hermenio Christian, 46, of the Bronx said: "Who smokes pot without inhaling? I'm voting for Brown."
But to some people, the criticism of Mr. Clinton has left him stronger, a victim of overzealous news reports who had held his own.
"I'm voting for Bill Clinton because he's defended himself with lots of class," said Margaret Keaveney, 45 of Riverdale.
 
Too Much Attention to Scandal
 Said Ann Platt of New Rochelle, "Anyone who can take this kind of abuse would make a good President."
In the East Tremont section of the Bronx, which was visited recently by Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, the feeling was that too much attention has been paid to hints of scandal.
Mrs. Clinton was a big hit in the Bronx, but in the conversations regionwide, the verdict was split, with half calling her the best part of the Clinton team, and half calling her obnoxious.
At the Galleria in White Plains, Kathie Finley, having coffee with other sales associates at the Abraham and Strauss department store, said that she was troubled by accusations of sexual infidelity against Mr. Clinton and would vote for Mr. Brown. With that, a fellow employee cut her off.
"I don't go for that," said the other employee, Helen Cohen, 68."I don't care about his personal life. Everybody has skeletons in there." She added, "I'll vote for Clinton."
For Mr. Brown, the equivalent of the character issue is the flake issue, a feeling that he is too much on the fringes to be President. He won high ratings in black areas and some suburbs, picking up Tsongas supporters here and there. But he was seen as too liberal in many working-class neighborhoods. Only a few people spoke well of his proposal for a flat tax.
"I can't take Brown seriously," said Alice Tuohey, a 45-year-old former bookkeeper who lives in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. "I know he's serious. But I can't take him seriously."
Said the Rev. Glen C. Missick, senior minister at the Church of the Master on Morningside Avenue in Harlem, "I think Brown is a little cuckoo."
 
Experience Is Questioned
 Mr. Missick spoke in Sylvia's Restaurant on Lenox Avenue, that green-tablecloth bastion of soul food, coffee, cornbread and conversation. The majority of patrons said they supported Mr. Brown, partly because he said he would name the Rev. Jesse Jackson as his Vice Presidential running mate.
But others, like Jim Cuffee, a real estate agent, said that they backed him because Mr. Clinton, as Governor of a small state, did not have the experience to deal with big problems. It was a line repeated often.
"This is a melting pot of races and problems," Mr. Cuffee said, "and I don't believe he'll know how to deal with them."
His wife, Rayna, says she feels so strongly about Mr. Brown that she will vote in a primary election for the first time. "I think he knows the cause of the minority groups," she said. "We're a nation within a nation."
But Jacky Clay, a psychology student at Fordham University, was not so sure. She turned to a Brown supporter who was arguing with a Clinton supporter and expressed a cynical view of Mr. Brown and Mr. Jackson. "Everytime there is a position available," she said, "there is Jesse. I don't care for either one."
The Jackson association cost Mr. Brown dearly elsewhere in the New York area, especially among Jewish voters. "I was planning to vote for Jerry Brown until I heard that Jesse Jackson would be on his ticket as Vice President," said Jeff Weinstein, 39, who lives in Queens.
Among Brown supporters, the most frequent comment was that he would really shake up Government and that he genuinely seemed to care about people.
As in interviews elsewhere in the country, people treated Mr. Tsongas differently than the other candidates. In New York that is partly because he is not officially running. But as in other states, he was treated with more respect, as a professorial figure, above the fray of politics.
Many people said they would vote for him out of regard for his positions, as well as to force the nomination to a brokered convention. But many others who had supported him said that he had betrayed them, that by suspending his campaign he had violated their trust.
"When you come in and out, it shows a weakness in you," Paul Palombo, 49, said in the Bronx. "When you are searching for the Holy Grail, you don't start and stop."
For about one in six, so great is their frustration that the answer is not to vote.
"There's all this talk about protest votes, that you're not voting for who you're voting for," said John Lowe, a 25-year-old law student at New York University. "I don't want any part of that. I don't respect any of these guys. It's that simple. I'm not voting for them. Period."

 CORRECTION:
An article and caption on Monday about New Yorkers' views of the Democratic Presidential candidates misstated one voter's view. Jacky Clay, a student at Fordham University, was referring to Gov. Bill Clinton and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., not to Mr. Brown and Jesse Jackson, when she said, "I don't care for either one."

Chart: "What They Think About the Candidates"
In conversations with about 250 Democratic voters in New York City and its suburbs, strong support for Bill Clinton and Edmund G. Brown Jr. came through. But many people lamented that their choice had come down to the lesser of two evils. Here's a summary of New Yorkers' views:
 
Why they're for Clinton . . .
 
* He is a good governor
* Like his economic policy
* Admire his wife, Hillary
* Reminds people of John F. Kennedy
* He's committed to the middle class
* He's young
* He's goodlooking
* He's a wheeler-dealer, which will make him effective as President
* He speaks his mind
* He's the lesser of two evils
 
Why they're not . . .
 
* Arkansas is too small for his experience to matter
* Hate his wife, Hillary
* Allegations of extra-marital affair
* He's too slick
* He'll bring no change. He's just another politician
* His line about not inhaling marijuana was ridiculous
* He's unelectable
* Has no foreign-affairs experience
* He's from the South
* He's more a Republican than a Democrat
* His smile is bogus, as is much else about him
 
Why they're for Brown . . .
 
* Was a good governor
* He'll really shake up government
* He tells it like it is
* He picked Jesse Jackson for Vice President
* He's a strong advocate for blacks, for gay people and other minorities
* He proposes a flat income-tax rate
* He truly cares about people
* A vote for him will stop Clinton and force a brokered convention
* He's the lesser of two evils
 
Why they're not . . .
 
* He's flakey
* Flat tax would be a disaster
* He's not electable
* He picked Jesse Jackson for Vice President
* He's too concerned about blacks and other minorities
* He preys on people's unhappiness and dispair
* He's been too mean-spirited with Clinton
* He's too liberal
 
Why they're for Tsongas . . .
 
* He's not Brown or Clinton
* His economic policy is the soundest
* His bout with cancer strengthened his character
* A vote for him would help force a brokered convention
 
Why they're not . . .
 
* He's unelectable
* His economic policy is too pro-business
* Ne's not politically shrewd enough
* He pulled out of the race and doesn't deserve any votes
 
Why they're for none of the above . . .
 
* None of the candidates will lead to true reform
* All of the candidates have character deficits, be it scandal or flakiess or not enough gumption to take command

HEADLINE: Few Strikers Return to Their Jobs As Caterpillar's Deadline Passes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., April 6

 BODY:
Striking members of the United Automobile Workers union held firm in the nation's most bitter labor dispute today, largely defying an order by Caterpillar Inc. that they return to their jobs or risk being replaced by nonunion workers. Caterpillar said about 300 of the 12,600 striking workers had crossed the picket lines, while union leaders insisted that the number was far lower.
The union, which has been on strike for five months, said that the low nunmber demonstrated that its members were united in wanting Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of construction equipment, to match a labor agreement signed last year between the U.A.W. and Deere & Company, but the union was far from jubilant about the day's events. 
 "We don't look at this as a victory," said Bill Casstevens, the U.A.W.'s secretary-treasurer. "The only victory we will have is when our workers go back to work with a decent contract." On the other side, Caterpillar said it would begin advertising on Tuesday in local newspapers for recruits to fill the strikers' jobs.
Both union members and experts on labor-management relations say the confrontation has implications far beyond this particular strike. Indeed, breaking the strike would reduce the bastion of unionized collective bargaining to a new low, they say.
While Caterpillar employs fewer than 2 percent of the U.A.W.'s 900,000 members, unionism is deeply entrenched at this large industrial company. And breaking the union at Caterpillar would almost surely weaken the U.A.W.'s bargaining positions in negotiations next year with General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, companies that could take positions similar to Caterpillars, many in the union fear.
Corporations' hiring of permanent replacement workers has become a political issue this year. The Administration has suggested that President Bush would veto any legislation that banned such hiring; one such measure did win approval in the House in the summer. The Democratic Presidential candidates have generally supported such legislation. One exception was former Senator Paul Tsongas; his refusal to endorse such a ban was considered a big factor in cutting into his labor support.
Many union members said that because they considered their decisions crucial to the union's future, they chose at the last minute to stay away from their jobs, despite the personal hardships the choice entailed.
"This has hurt me a lot financially," said Morris Bell, a 51-year-old machine operator who has worked for Caterpillar for 20 years. "It has created a strain on my family, and we do the best we can with food stamps. But we have to stand together as a union if we're going to be successful."
Gerald S. Flaherty, a Caterpillar group president, said: "Caterpillar would like nothing better than to get all striking employees back to work. We know that it's a difficult decision. So we anticipate that their return will take place over time, not in just one day."
The company said that the striking workers could claim their positions as long as they remained vacant and that filling the jobs with replacement workers would take about three weeks.
Today's protests on the picket line were peaceful, even upbeat, with union members driving down the long road that links the three gates at the company's plant on the east side of Peoria on the Illinois River. As car after car driven by union members moved past with strikers raising their fists in a triumphant sign of solidarity, pickets kept their vigil at the gates, looking to recognize anyone who might cross the picket line. That scene was repeated at seven plants throughout the Peoria area.
The drivers' cars and trucks carried signs with such slogans as "God bless the U.A.W.," "Fites and Lorenzo: two of a kind," a reference to Donald V. Fites, Caterpillar's chairman, and Frank Lorenzo, who led Eastern Airlines when the it replaced striking workers several years ago.
At Caterpillar's downtown headquarters, the tone was decidedly more somber. Management repeated that to yield to the union's demand to match the contract it has at Deere would render Caterpillar less competitive globally. It also continued to attack the practice of pattern bargaining, in which unions negotiate similar contracts with a number of companies within the same industry.
"Pattern bargaining is an outdated concept that makes no sense in a global economy," said Mr. Flaherty, the Caterpillar group president. "We need an agreement that makes sense for our employees and enables Caterpillar to continue providing high-quality jobs here in the United States. We also need an agreement that will allow us to sell products against non-United States competitors around the world."
The company makes 75 percent of its products in the United States and exports a huge 59 percent of them, making it second only to the Boeing Company among industrial exporters.
Mr. Flaherty said employees who do return to work will receive "one of the world's best wage and benefit packages." That package, he said, includes six-year individual job security, a promise not to close plants for at least six years, immediate pay increases and improved pensions.
Caterpillar is demanding wage and benefit levels that it says would help the company match the costs faced by foreign makers of construction equipment. Caterpillar maintains that its contract offer will raise wages about 13 percent over three years and will cover workers' health care in full if they use specified hospitals and doctors.
But the union says that the company's proposed contract represents a loss of some health-care benefits and that the company can afford to be more generous in what it pays for labor, which the union says accounts for only a sixth of Caterpillar's costs.
The apparent resolve of union members will almost insure that the dispute will become even more high pitched. "While it is a small operation for the U.A.W., this issue is tremendously important to this union," said Michael J. Piore, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "If Caterpillar is successful in this, it will change the line where the chalk has been drawn between the union and the companies they work for."
Caterpillar officials say that the five-month-old labor dispute has not yet affected production, given a drop in domestic demand that has resulted from the nation's economic recession. Mr. Flaherty said the company had built up a sizable inventory last year and is continuing to make deliveries.
Analysts say that Caterpillar will soon show signs of strain, however. "By the late spring and early summer, they will feel some economic pressure," said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in New York.
Company officials say that they expect 50 percent of the strikers ultimately to return to their jobs. Union members, in contrast, have privately suggested that the number will be below 20 percent. Even so, the next few days will be very important here, and many unemployed and laid-off workers in this economically depressed area are waiting to get an opportunity to fill the jobs of the strikers.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
CLINTON AND BROWN MAKE LAST APPEALS FOR NEW YORK VOTE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California made their final impassioned appeals yesterday in a New York primary campaign that is virtually certain to shape the race for the Democratic nomination as well as both of their political futures.
Mr. Clinton, battling to regain his status as the party's presumptive nominee, returned to the central themes of his campaign yesterday, pleading with voters to set aside any misgivings about his character and give him a chance to lead. 
 "I have lived a lifetime of commitment and service," he said as he stormed through New York before heading on to Wisconsin and Kansas, which also hold primaries today.
 
Underdog's Rallying Cry
 Mr. Brown, hoping to prove that his upset victory in Connecticut two weeks ago was merely the first rumbling of an angry electorate turning his way, urged New Yorkers yesterday to "send a powerful message: Get off the dime, Washington! We want a country that works for all of us."
Echoing the rallying cry of his underdog campaign, the former California Governor declared: "Take it back, America! Take it back!"
The voting today in New York, with its rich prize of 244 delegates, has come to be seen as a referendum on Mr. Clinton's long-term viability and his ability to prevail over several character issues.
 
Tsongas, and the Draft
 The campaign wound down with some crucial unknowns, notably the strength of the support for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who suspended his faltering campaign three weeks ago but remains on the ballot. He says he may return to the contest depending on what happens here today.
Also unclear in these final hours was the effect of the latest round of news reports about Mr. Clinton's status during the Vietnam War, which critics said raised new questions about his candor in discussing his draft history.
Mr. Clinton had neglected to disclose that he had received a draft induction letter shortly before he sought a deferment by joining a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit in Arkansas. But he insisted again yesterdaythat it was not a material omission.
For his part, Mr. Brown has hardly emerged unscathed from the past two weeks of what many saw as a classic New York primary: rough, unpredictable and often mean. His policy proposals, notably his support for a flat tax to replace the progressive income tax system, have drawn new scrutiny and fire. And his anti-politician persona has been tarnished by a new focus on his record as Governor of California and his long history as a politician.
The New York primary has been driven, in many ways, by the complicated demographics of this state. Mr. Clinton's campaign advisers hope to base a winning coalition in part on Jewish and black voters, although Mr. Brown has fiercely competed for black support here.
In the Democratic Presidential primary four years ago, Jewish voters accounted for 25 percent of the vote statewide, while blacks accounted for 24 percent, a turnout that analysts say was swelled by the presence of the Rev. Jesse Jackson on the ballot.
Mr. Brown's efforts to court Jewish voters were stymied by his embrace of Mr. Jackson as his choice of running mate. Because of his 1984 characterization of New York as "Hymietown," Mr. Jackson remains unpopular with many Jewish voters.
 
Vote for a Loser
 In general, Mr. Brown has offered himself as a ready vehicle for those who wish to send a message and stop Mr. Clinton, whom he described yesterday as "the anointed one." Emblematic of his strategy, the former California Governor urged New Yorkers yesterday to vote for Mr. Tsongas if they could not vote for him. He later explained, "Anybody who's not going to vote for me, please vote for someone who's not going to win."
Mr. Clinton also campaigned yesterday in Wisconsin, which was considered fertile ground for Mr. Brown, but politicians and polls reported a competitive race in recent days. Wisconsin has 82 delegates at stake today, while Kansas has 36.
Mr. Clinton is far and away the leader in delegates, with 1,118, more than half the 2,145 needed for the nomination. Mr. Brown has 175.
The two men spent their final day in New York in a characteristic style for this campaign, beginning it with some tough exchanges on television. On the NBC program "Today," Mr. Brown escalated his attack on Mr. Clinton for golfing at an Arkansas country club that has no black members, asserting it was "a product of the old-boy network." Mr. Clinton -- who at one point told Mr. Brown, "Don't scream, Jerry" -- asserted, "Jerry Brown knows I'm not a racist, he knows that in the South I've fought for equal opportunity."
The encounter, typical of recent days, suggested the Zen-like wisdom of Mr. Tsongas's sidelines strategy, which has preserved him from attacks, debates, negative television advertisements and any requirement to make promises and act like a politician. As Mr. Brown said, "If you stand on the sideline, you increasingly look better as the other two candidates get closer to the 15th round."
After a more subdued encounter on "Donahue," the two men fanned out on their own final search for votes. Mr. Brown, who spent the entire day in New York, said at a rally in Albany that his campaign had one goal: "To galvanize the moral energy to rededicate America to social and economic justice."
He also made a few promises. "I will promise you that before the decade is out I will move people from one end of Manhattan to Long Island in 20 minutes on a clean, American-built transportation system," he said.
Mr. Clinton dashed around the country, appearing at an afternoon rally at Syracuse University before flying to the Midwest. He sought to cast himself as the authentic candidate of change, and argued that young voters had the power to "choose a different future than the path we're on."
His campaign began broadcasting new commercials that proudly listed the newspaper endorsements the Governor has received, as well as a new radio spot affirming his commitment to abortion rights. For his part, Mr. Brown was broadcasting a 60-second television commercial in which Carroll O'Connor, the actor who played Archie Bunker on the longtime television series "All in the Family," defends Mr. Brown's flat tax proposal.
 
How Close a Race?
 Mr. Brown was asserting yesterday that the race was close, but Stan Greenberg, the poll taker for the Clinton campaign, seemed to be in the quintessential political state of guardedly optimistic. Although Mr. Greenberg said that Mr. Tsongas was gaining in the campaign's Sunday night polling, particularly among Jewish voters, and would clearly be a factor in the race, he added, "We're showing good margins for us over Brown."
But a poll released by the consulting group Sawyer-Miller showed a far closer race. And in separate polling, Lee Miringoff of the Marist Institute said his incomplete survey had detected a jump for Mr. Tsongas and a large undecided contingent, particularly among blacks.
Mr. Miringoff predicted that voters' lack of enthusiasm, indecision and reservations about Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown could result in a low turnout today.
 
Buzzing About Tsongas
 The buzz in political circles yesterday was over the Tsongas factor. Some Democratic party leaders in Nassau and Suffolk counties said they had detected a Tsongas flurry, with Joe Galante, the executive director of the Nassau County Democratic Party, noting that Mr. Tsongas had won a straw poll at a meeting of the Nassau Democratic Committee last Thursday. The editorial page of the Long Island newspaper Newsday has endorsed Mr. Tsongas.
But Bruce Nyman, supervisor of the City of Long Beach and a co-chairman of Mr. Clinton's Long Island campaign, said he saw Mr. Clinton solidifying his support. "I think we've grown stronger among Jewish voters and among people who are beginning to focus in on Brown," said Mr. Nyman. "They see he is not the savior of the Democratic Party."
In many ways, the primary still revolved around the persona of Bill Clinton. He tried with some success in recent days to return the campaign dialogue to the issues of economics and education, health care and foreign policy, but much of the news coverage still focused on him.
In Milwaukee last night, Mr. Clinton complained that voters had been told for years that politicians are hiding "deep, dark secrets." He said he found this "absolute orgy of obsession with the past" to be sad.

HEADLINE: Peru Suspends Democracy, Citing Revolt

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 6

 BODY:
The President of Peru has dissolved Congress, suspended the Constitution, imposed censorship and arrested politicians in what he called an offensive against rebels and drug traffickers. But others said today that the crackdown amounted to a coup as troops surrounded the Congress building and took up positions around the city.
"The country cannot continue to be weakened by terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption," President Alberto K. Fujimori said in announcing his decisions in a televised speech on Sunday night. "The political corruption and the infiltration have reached such a degree that it can be found in all levels and rulings of the judicial power." 
 President Fujimori's action was condemned by President Bush and by leaders of South American nations.
[The Bush Administration suspended all aid to Peru except for humanitarian assistance. Page A16.]
Since taking office in 1990, President Fujimori has struggled with a stagnant economy and the Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrilla movement. He asserted in his speech that Congress and the courts had blocked his efforts to fight the drug trade, put down the guerrillas and end privileges for the political elite.
 
Cabinet Resigns
 The President said that he was suspending some articles of the Constitution to allow him to form a "government of emergency and national reconstruction" and that his Cabinet would temporarily assume congressional powers.
Mr. Fujimori said some political reforms would be put before voters in a plebiscite but did not say when that might occur. He summoned key members of his Cabinet today to discuss plans for new executive decrees, officials said.
But Prime Minister Alfonso de los Heros announced that he and the rest of the Cabinet were resigning in what appeared to be a protest against the decrees, local radio reported. Mr. de los Heros, whose power was second to that of the President, was not told in advance of Mr. Fujimori's decrees, officials said.
In a ceremony at the presidential palace tonight, Mr. Fujimori moved quickly to put a new Cabinet in place by swearing in Housing Minister Oscar Solar de la Puente Raygada as the new Prime Minister.
The military Joint Chiefs of Staff had earlier issued a statement giving their "most decided suppport" to the measures announced by Mr. Fujimori.
The leader of the Senate, Felipe Osterling, who has been placed under house arrest, called the decrees "totally unacceptable" and said they amounted to a coup.
His view was shared by Valentin Panagua, a constitutional expert. "This is a coup d'etat carried out from Government Palace," Mr. Panagua said in a radio broadcast.
The President of Argentina, Carlos Saul Menem, said he "condemned the change in constitutional order."
But Mr. Fujimori said in his address that his actions were "not a negation of real democracy," but "the starting point of the search for an authentic transformation that assures a legitimate and effective democracy."
 
Assails Judiciary System
 In his speech, which was unannounced, President Fujimori said Peruvians could not wait the three years it would take Congress to carry out the legislative changes he sought. The President has criticized the judiciary system as corrupt, accusing judges of releasing suspected guerrillas and drug traffickers in exchange for bribes. Peru is the world's leading producer of coca leaf, which is the raw material for cocaine.
Former President Alan Garcia managed to escape from his home before troops surrounded his home and was in hiding today, said Hugo Otero, Mr. Garcia's closest adviser.
Mr. Otero said security forces had detained Augustin Mantilla, a former Interior Minister; Myrta Larrauri, Mr. Garcia's secretary, and Abel Salinas, another former Interior Minister.
The crackdown has also reportedly led the arrest of prominent Peruvian journalists as military troops were deployed to nearly all newspaper, television and radio offices. Only the text of the President's address was published today in the opposition La Republica newspaper, whose first two pages were blank. Troops also closed down two radio stations that had been interviewing opposition leaders.
Despite the heavy presence of troops in Lima, citizens seemed to be going about their business normally.
Many Peruvians condemned the measures but others, in call-in radio shows, said they supported them.
President Fujimori has kept most of Peru under state-of-emergency measures since taking office to give security forces greater leeway in combating the Shining Path guerrillas.

HEADLINE: Italy's Long-Ruling Party Suffers Its Worst Setback Ever in Voting

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, April 6

 BODY:
Italy's Christian Democrats, who have dominated politics here since World War II as Europe's longest-ruling political dynasty, suffered their worst setback in elections today as insurgent groups gnawed at the support for established politicians.
Two days of high turnouts in the election left none of the bastions of Italy's politics unscathed. According to computer projections tonight, the Christian Democrats' share of the vote fell below one third, its lowest ever, while the renamed Communists, once the most powerful Communist party in Western Europe, also lost ground. 
 Based on a figure of 48 percent of the vote for the governing alliance of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals, the projections give the governing coalition a potential 13-seat majority in the lower house -- enough to form a fragile government.
But many politicians seemed to discount this forecast. A Christian Democratic spokesman said the projection did not take into account the complex system by which votes are weighted under the electoral laws.
 
No Obvious Combination
 Italian politicians and commentators said the projections presaged turmoil because they showed no obvious combination of parties strong enough to govern. "This is an earthquake for the entire Government," said the Christian Democratic spokesman, Enzo Carra, as the vote came in.
The election for the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies had been cast as the country's most important since the war. But while many Italians voted for change, what they seemed to confront tonight was the prospect of upheaval from a protest vote reflecting discontent over corruption and inefficiency.
The computer projections showed Prime Minster Giulio Andreotti's Christian Democrats, who have dominated Italian governments since the fall of Fascism, with 29.2 percent of the lower house vote, down from 34.3 percent in the 1987 election. Nonetheless, the Christian Democrats remained the nation's single biggest party.
The overall support for the four-party coalition amounted to 43 percent in the Senate and around 48 percent in the lower house -- far lower than in 1987, when the coalition won almost 54 percent. The lower house is important because the destiny of governments hinges on their ability to construct and maintain a majority there.
"The old majority no longer exists, and putting a new one together seems very difficult," said the Socialist leader, Bettino Craxi.
 
The Hunt for a Deal
 The prospects are for vigorous, and possibly vain, horse-trading in the effort to find a new coalition, or even new elections if coalition negotiations fail, Italian political analysts said.
Spokesmen for most parties said that the vote showed an urgent need for reform in the system of proportional representation, which was designed to prevent a recurrence of totalitarian rule, but which has produced weak and unstable governments made up of the same politicians. The need for a stronger central government, Italian analysts said, is heightened by pressing economic and social problems -- a crippling budget deficit, crumbling public services, the widespread influence of organized crime and the probable strains of European integration beginning next year.
Tonight's projections threw many political plans into disarray. Mr. Craxi, for instance, had reportedly struck a pre-election deal with Mr. Andreotti to take over the premiership, but his comment tonight -- and his party's failure to improve its 1987 standing beyond 14 percent -- suggested that his future was in doubt.
Technically, it is still possible for the governing allies to rebuild an alliance that ended last year when the small Republican Party left the coalition. Since then, however, the Republican leader, Giorgio La Malfa, has vowed to remain in opposition.
 
Communists Now Split
 Since the collapse of Eastern European and Soviet Communism, this country's former Communists have been in turmoil and are now split between the Democratic Party of the Left, as the retitled Communist Party is known, and a splinter group, Communist Refounding.
According to the projections, the Democratic Party of the Left won 16.8 percent and Communist Refounding, 6.3 percent. In the last election, the Communists won 28.3 percent.
Clear regional winners were the insurgent Lombardy League, a group seeking autonomy for the wealthy north, which secured 8 to 10 percent of the national vote, and the southern Rete party, which polled 27 percent on an anti-Mafia ticket in Palermo, Sicily, the Mafia's heartland.
The setback for Italy's governing parties seemed to fit a European pattern as the Governments of France, Britain and Germany are also confronted with an insurgent threat.
As in France and Germany, part of the challenge is from groups whose followers feel threatened by and hostile toward immigrants. Many supporters of Umberto Bossi, the Lombardy League's leader, back his demand for greater fiscal independence for the industrial north, which bears half the country's tax burden, and are also opposed to the growing number of immigrants from third world countries.

HEADLINE: Guarini Quitting Congress After 7 Terms

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
In a blow to New Jersey's influence here, Representative Frank J. Guarini, the iconoclastic Eastern establishment Democrat who maintained a luxury apartment overlooking Central Park while representing the ethnic polyglot of Hudson County, N.J., announced today that he would not seek an eighth term.
"It's time to go home," Mr. Guarini said, noting that he has spent almost a quarter-century in public service. "It's time to resume my private life. The job satisfaction hasn't been the greatest, but it's not the work itself. It's just that deep down in your guts you know when it's time to go home to friends and family." 
 Mr. Guarini, a 67-year-old lawyer, is the third of New Jersey's 14 representatives to retire this year. He follows Robert A. Roe, the Democratic powerhouse from Wayne, and Bernard J. Dwyer, the Edison Democrat.
The decision by the three Democrats, among the most powerful New Jersey legislators in Washington, will mean a sharp reduction in the delegation's seniority and is likely to diminish its influence. That would be a setback to efforts to obtain a larger slice of the Federal pie for New Jersey, which by many measures receives less Federal money per capita than any other state.
 
Big Congressional Turnover
 In the wake of the House checking-account scandal and a threatened revolt by voters, a total of 45 House members have announced they will not seek re-election. Thirty-three are retiring from politics outright, and 12 are leaving to seek other offices. More are expected to follow in the next few weeks as new districting maps become final, leading to the greatest Congressional turnover since World War II.
"This whole place is going to be Hooverized, turned upside down," said Mr. Guarini. "It's going to be cleansed. And I say that may be good. And maybe the White House should be cleansed too."
He added that he would take a "deserved sabbatical" but might run for another office in the future and would consider an appointment to a state board or commission if one were offered, as expected, by Gov. Jim Florio.
The Jersey City Democrat denied that he was leaving the House out of frustration and went out of his way to differentiate himself from many of his retiring colleagues.
But even in denying any frustration, Mr. Guarini spoke the language of legislative discontent. He complained that key economic and budgetary decisions had become hostage to party politics and that Congress seemed deadlocked on necessary changes, such as reducing the budget deficit, restraining the growth of entitlements and health-care costs as well as limiting the pervasive influence of special interests.
"I don't think that any one or two terms that I can serve will make that much difference," said Mr. Guarini, who had a coveted seat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, where he is the 11th-ranking Democrat, as well as on the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, where he is the 7th-ranking majority member. "It would be worth staying in the battlefield," he added, if he thought "some of those problems could be resolved."
Mr. Guarini, a former state Senator, had the Congressional seat almost handed to him when a Democratic Representative, Joseph A. LeFante, backed the loser in Jersey City's divisive 1977 mayoral election and retired rather than face a challenge for renomination. Although he is a reserved politician who became renowned for his dour grimace and confrontations with the Ways and Means Chairman, Dan Rosteknowski, Mr. Guarini boasted a finely tuned political radar and routinely won re-election by 2-to-1 margins.
He said he was convinced that he could win again despite redistricting, which increased the proportion of Hispanic voters in his district to 43 percent.
The district -- ruled with an iron fist from the turn of the century until the 1940's by Frank Hague, the quintessential political boss -- it was the set and the model for the 1954 movie classic "On the Waterfront."
"Politics in Hudson County has been no cup of tea, but it's no toughter today than it was 10 or 20 years ago," Mr. Guarini said in dismissing speculation that he was leaving Congress to avoid a tough campaign. "It may be more gentle."
Mr. Guarini said he made the decision to step down over the weekend and noted that he was untainted by the checking scandal. "I've been in an ideal position from a personal viewpoint," he said.
The Congressman added that his campaign treasury still contains about $350,000. While he is permitted to keep the money if he steps down this year, he repeated longstanding promises to donate it to charity.

HEADLINE: U.S., Condemning Fujimori, Cuts Aid to Peru

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today branded President Alberto Fujimori's dissolution of the Peruvian Congress and the detention of politicans "unjustified" and "unconstitutional" attacks on democracy, and suspended all aid except for humanitarian assistance.
Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, who arrived in Peru on Sunday for talks on a range of issues, today canceled an appointment with Mr. Fujimori and was refused permission to see the President of the ousted Senate, the State Department said. But Mr. Aronson was able to meet with the Foreign Minister and the Government's coordinator for human rights. 
 For the Administration, which points to its role in fostering progress toward democracy, the establishment of free-market economies and the end of civil strife in the hemisphere, the unexpected reversion to military rule in Peru is a setback. It follows by barely six months the military overthrow of the Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti and by an attempted coup in Venezuela in January.
 
Emergency Meeting of O.A.S.
 "Those who have been applauding democracy so hard have not stopped to pay attention to the fact that its roots are very shallow," said Robert Pastor, the National Security Council's Latin America specialist in the Carter Administration.
"There is a connection between Haiti, Venezuela and Peru," said Mr. Pastor, now professor of political science at Emory University. "The United States needs to take a leadership position in the Organization of American States to solve the Haiti crisis once and for all and establish a safety net for democracy. The time has come for the O.A.S. to pass beyond collective rhetoric to collective action on democracy."
The O.A.S. called an emergency meeting tonight, but it was unclear if there would be any action. Some diplomats suggested that sanctions against Peru might be discussed.
A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said today, "While we recognize that President Fujimori inherited severe problems, we believe that these problems do not justify, nor can they be resolved though, unconstitutional means."
"The United States calls for the full and immediate restoration of constitutional democracy, which must include immediate freedom for those detained, and full respect for human rights, immediate restoration of a free and independent press and civil liberties, and immediate resotration of independent legislative and judicial branches of government," Mr. Boucher said.
The Administration had requested $275 million in economic and military aid for Peru for fiscal 1992, an increase of nearly $40 million over the 1991 appropriation.
In Congress, where there has been reluctance to give military aid to Peru because of the human rights record of the Peruvian Army in its encounters with leftist guerrillas or its conduct of the war against cocaine growers, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, announced that he would introduce legislation Tuesday cutting off all nonhumanitarian aid.
In a statement, Mr. Kennedy called Mr. Fujimori's action a "brutal mugging of Peruvian freedom."
 
'Rapidly Descending Spiral'
 Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the House subcommittee on the hemisphere, agreed that Mr. Fujimori's action was condemnable but had to be understood in the light of the "rapidly deteriorating" Peruvian political situation.
"Peru is on a rapidly descending spiral, with authority increasingly exercised by narco-traffickers and Shining Path guerrillas," Mr. Torricelli said in an interview. "Increasingly, the legal authorities in Peru are not in control of their own country."
Mr. Torricelli said Latin American and Caribbean nations that have been reluctant to take action against the military in Haiti should learn that "not taking a take strong stand against a coup anywhere opens each and every government in the region to a similar problem."
Richard Feinberg, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a forum for hemispheric leaders, said many of Peru's problems derived from a 20-year-old economic debacle that has not narrowed gaps in the hemisphere's most divided society -- "the colonial enclaves of the upper-class suburbs in a sea of indigenous mestizo people." But there are also wider political issues to be considered, he added.
"With notable exception of Mexico," Mr. Feinberg said in an interview, "parliamentary institutions and political parties are lacking in legitimacy in Latin America. Politicians are seen as old, tired and corrupt."

HEADLINE: CHINA DENIES VISAS TO TWO SENATORS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
Two leading Democratic Senators who have been critical of China's human rights record have been denied visas to visit China this month, Congressional aides say. The denial is highly unusual, and likely to increase antagonism toward China in Congress.
The Senators, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and David L. Boren of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, were planning to visit Tibet. The trip was scheduled for mid-April. 
 Senator Pell has been an outspoken critic of the Chinese administration of Tibet, where nationalists have been suppressed by force since the 1950's.
He and Senator Boren also played prominent roles in the recent Congressional attempt to attach conditions to an extension of favorable trade status for China.
 
No 'Rejection,' State Dept. Says
 The State Department acknowledged tonight that the Senators had been informed that they could not visit China in April, but added that the Chinese Government denied it had rejected the visa requests. According to the department, the Chinese say the timing was "inconvenient."
"The State Department believes that Congressional fact-finding missions are extremely important in the conduct of foreign policy, and we have consistently urged the Chinese to respond favorably to such visa requests," a department statement said, adding that it hoped the Chinese Government could agree on another "mutually convenient" time for the visit.
Administration officials and Congressional aides say the State Department is apparently working through diplomatic channels to get the Chinese decision reversed or modified.
A person who answered the telephone at the Chinese Embassy this evening said there was no one available to comment on the matter.
 
Pressure on Administration
 The Bush Administration has been under sustained pressure to get China to account for its human rights record since the suppression of the democracy movement in 1989. Congress has also been critical of Chinese sales of weapons or weapons technology in the Middle East, and of reports of extensive prison labor in China.
In 1991, aware of Congressional concerns, the Administration introduced sanctions against two Chinese companies as the President extended the "most favored nation" trade status for a year. Those sanctions were lifted this year after China agree to adhere to an international agreement restricitng sales of missile technology and parts.
Congress then tried again to attach conditions to a one-year extension of the favorable trade status, an effort that failed when the President's veto survived.
President Bush -- who in the 1970's headed the United States Liaison Office in Beijing, the precursor to an embassy -- has apparently been personally active in promoting a policy of low-key approaches to China rather than public confrontation. Administration officials have also argued that Beijing's committment to economic reforms may pave the way for political change.
The recent reappearance of China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, speaking in support of economic reform, and the recent criticism from other quarters of the more conservative Prime Minister, Li Peng, have led some officials here to judge this policy a success.

HEADLINE: Europe Nods to Bosnia, Not Macedonia

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 6

 BODY:
The 12-nation European Community decided to recognize the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina today, arguing that the move could help end the latest outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Yugoslav republic.
But it once again bent to pressure from Greece by delaying a response to the Macedonian republic's request for recognition. Greece, which is a community member, has accused the republic of trying to usurp the name of its northern province of Macedonia and of harboring territorial ambitions over the region. 
 Community governments have already established diplomatic relations with breakaway Slovenia and Croatia, while Montenegro has decided to remain part of Yugoslavia along with Serbia.
The Bush Administration is going to recognize the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia on Tuesday with an announcement by the White House and a policy statement by the State Department. Officials expect the statement will shed some light on what the United States intends to do about Macedonia and the remaining members of the old Yugoslav federation, Serbia and Montenegro, .
Community foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg also agreed to end economic sanctions against Serbia so long as it continues to cooperate with European-sponsored peace talks, restores air links with the other republics and recognizes the legal authority of United Nations peacekeeping forces.
 
Sanction Is Lifted
 On a separate issue, the community today lifted its last remaining economic sanction against South Africa -- a 1985 embargo on the sale of crude oil and other oil products -- in recognition its moves to dismantle apartheid. The decision was warmly welcomed by South African officials.
Today's meeting, though, was dominated by the Yugoslav question, with foreign ministers eager to demonstrate that the community can still play a mediating role in the crisis even though its failure to end the fighting in Croatia last year forced it to turn to the United Nations for help.
When the community recognized Slovenia and Croatia in January, it spelled out its terms for recognizing other new states. European officials said Bosnia and Herzogovina and Macedonia had since fulfilled these conditions, which included popular endorsement of independence through referendums.
After the ethnic violence of recent days in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal's Foreign Minister, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the current community chairman, said the new republic would be recognized on Tuesday because there was "no reason" for a further delay.
 
Violence Called Worrisome
 "We are worried about the violence," Mr. Deus de Pinheiro went on, referring to opposition by the Serbian minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina to the republic's independence. "We hope the violence will not continue, we hope that it is just an outburst that will fade away."
The republic is made up of 1.9 million Muslim Slavs, 1.4 million Eastern Orthodox Serbs and 750,000 Roman Catholic Croats.
Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianni de Michelis, said that making "no decision today would have worsened" the situation.
A British official in Luxembourg quoted by The Associated Press also asserted that a delay would bring more trouble. "The whole business would simply be repeated next time," he said.
On the question of Macedonia, Mr. Deus de Pinheiro said the community was negotiating with both Greece and Macedonia to find "an acceptable solution" that would permit recognition of the republic. He said he was optimistic about a breakthrough before community foreign ministers meet again next month.
In a statement today, Macedonia's President, Kiro Gligorov, reiterated that the republic did not claim any Greek territory and warned that postponement of recognition of its independence could lead to "very severe consequences," including the risk of "a wider Balkan conflict."

HEADLINE: Tel Aviv Journal;
A Fiddler on the Street (and Other New Strains)

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEL AVIV, April 4

 BODY:
Grigory Matyukov rolled up his sleeve to show the bandages wrapped around his left wrist. That's what comes from playing music on the street, he said.
For 25 years, Mr. Matyukov was a cellist in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and he did fine for himself, he says, playing for the local symphony orchestra and opera, and teaching on the side. 
 Then 14 months ago he joined the 350,000 emigres from former Soviet territory who have flowed this way since 1989, only to find that Israel needs one more 52-year-old cellist about as much as it needs another fight with the United States. So now he takes his cello and a small folding chair to Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv, playing up to seven hours a day, sometimes for only a few shekels.
The acoustics, as one might imagine, are nothing to shout about, Mr. Matyukov said. The other day, he had to play so hard to be heard over the traffic that he sprained his wrist.
 
'We Don't Eat'
 No, he said, it isn't easy. "If there are not a lot of nice people on the street," he said in broken Hebrew, "we don't eat."
In Israel's large cities, the streets are alive with the sound of music, provided by Soviet immigrants on a scale that this country has never before experienced. About 11,000 of the new arrivals say they are artists, and 60 percent of this group list themselves as musicians. A running joke is that if a Russian comes off the plane and he is not carrying a violin case, it can only mean he's a piano player.
What to do with them all is hardly a joke, though, because there is steady work for only the few hundred who are unquestionably top-rate or who perhaps know how to pull a few non-musical strings.
Even assuming the Government was doing a stellar job in trying to absorb them -- and there is little danger of its ever being accused of that -- Israelis find themselves stuck with the hopeless question of how many violinists can squeeze into a postage-stamp country with a population half that of Moscow.
The proportion of musicians among the new immigrants, roughly 2 percent, is several times that to be found in the general Israeli population, although it is said not to be out of line with occupation patterns among Jews in the former Soviet Union.
A similar quandary holds true for the nearly 40,000 former Soviet doctors, dentists, engineers and architects who have arrived in the last two years. One Government goal is to channel newcomers into growth fields -- turning oil engineers into computer specialists, for instance. But teaching an old oboist new tricks, especially after he has invested years in professional studies, is not so easy.
"A musician does not like to throw it all out the window -- it's like denying your previous life," said Daniel Fradkin, principal violinist for the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and himself an emigre from the Soviet Union 19 years ago.
While it is too early to tell exactly how the Russians and others may change cultural life here, they have already created a new pool of concert- and theater-goers that delights Israelis who fret that interest in such pursuits is declining. They also pump new life into music schools.
"They are saving us," said Esther Narkiss, director of the Conservatory of the Jerusalem Rubin Academy of Music and Dance. In the last two years, her prestigious school has taken on 100 of the newcomers, who now account for 25 percent of the student body.
Although the Government is widely criticized for not doing nearly enough, it has not been sitting on its hands.
It sponsors arts projects. The Ministry of Absorption, after testing musicians to see who it considers the most gifted, pays wages for a year to a chosen few. The Jewish Agency helps out by paying for instruments, and the Ministry of Education and Culture picks up salaries in some cases after Absorption Ministry money runs out.
In Jerusalem, the Israel Museum hires newcomers for weekly concerts and special events. Around the country, established orchestras have taken on Soviet players, and new Soviet-only groups have formed in large cities and even in smaller ones like Rehovot, Ranaana and Rishon le Zion, all near Tel Aviv. The uncontestably talented are busy, if not always well paid.
Still, thousands of unemployed and despairing musicians remain out there, many playing for time on the streets. "Three or four years ago, we could have helped even the mediocre," said Galina Zaltsman, an Absorption Ministry official. "Now we have to concentrate only on the best. It's a brutal business, but we don't have the resources."
And so the frustrations mount, especially among those who know they are far from mediocre.
Vladimir Bakk says he won prizes through 20 years with the Moscow Philharmonic, but after 21 months here he still has no regular employment and finds his life "unendurable." For Mark Mirotin, a 50-year-old conductor from Russia, Israel became so bleak that in January he hanged himself.
"Russians don't know what it is not to work," said Moti Schmit, a Russian-born leader of the Jerusalem Symphony, who came here in 1970. "They feel like they don't exist. You can see the death in their eyes."
Many try teaching. But there were so many taking that route that salaries have dropped to $3 or $4 an hour, so low that one experienced teacher in Jerusalem decided she can make more money as a cleaning woman.
Even on the street, there is a talent glut, and the competition sometimes gets rough.
One recent afternoon outside the Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv, a native Israeli named Yotam was playing his violin when four Russian trumpet players told him that he was ruining their act. If he showed up there again, they warned, they would kill him.
Yotam says he decided to take no chances. He got his act together and took it to Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem.

HEADLINE: School Officials Optimistic On Upcoming Budget Votes

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARAMUS, N.J., April 6

 BODY:
After two years of widespread rejection, school officials will put their new budgets before the voters in towns across New Jersey Tuesday, and educators say they are hopeful that taxpayers will be less hostile this spring.
Some officials sense a softening of the rabid anti-tax mood that dominated the last two budget votes, nearly toppled Senator Bill Bradley in 1990 and routed Democrats from the state Legislature last November. In addition, they say, state limits on school budget increases and a hold-the-line mentality by local superintendents may increase the number of approvals. Yet, they caution, voter anxieties about the recession may be counterbalancing. 
 "I think a considerable number will pass," James A. Moran, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators, said of the 560 budgets up for a vote. "Increases are very small in most places and within the range of what the economy is doing. You've got an era of contraction going on that's relatively unprecedented."
Dr. Moran, a statewide spokesman for school superintendents, said local officials have tried to "present clear, straightforward" budgets in hopes of reversing the broad rate of rejection of the last two years.
Forty-four percent of the budgets lost last year, and 48 percent were rejected in 1990 in the New Jersey's deepest wave of anti-spending sentiment since nearly 56 percent of school budgets were defeated in 1976, the year the state's income tax was created.
Here in Paramus, one of the largest districts in Bergen County, the proposed $38 million budget is up only 1.2 percent, as opposed to increases of 6 to 8 percent in recent years. Taxes on the average home in Paramus will increase $70 under the budget, but there will be no new educational programs and no new school equipment in the 1992-93 academic year, said the superintendent, Harry A. Galinsky.
"In the last two weeks, I've become much more optimistic," Dr. Galinsky said. "Given the economic times, I see a glimmer of hope out there." He said he was buoyed by that fact that a citizens' budget committee, which included senior citizens, many of whom are generally opposed to higher school taxes, had approved the budget and recommended it to voters.
In nearby Mahwah, a growing community in the northwestern corner of Bergen County, the proposed $22.7 million budget contains $900,000 in new spending and has won the endorsement of the local taxpayers' association. This year's increase does nothing more than restore the $900,000 cut from the school budget by the town council a year ago after voters rejected it by a 2.5-to-1 margin, said Donald S. Hawkins, the school district's business administrator.
"Everybody here is very hopeful this budget will pass," Mr. Hawkins said, in part because Mahwah's enrollment is projected to grow by 145 pupils to 2,175 in September. He said a recent reassessment led to a sharp increase in the value of commercial properties. These increased revenues, along with the small budget increases, mean that school taxes for 1992-93 would actually decline by 2.7 cents for each $100 of assessed valuation on residential properties, he said.
In Wayne, a sprawling middle-class district with 6,200 pupils in neighboring Passaic County, the proposed $61.8 million budget is up 0.7 percent from the previous year. "It reflects the economic realities of our times," said the superintendent, Robert Winter. "I'm feeling positive. I think most people will feel that's reasonable."
Wayne's proposed budget means retrenchment. Dr. Winter said no major programs will be started. Bus routes not mandated by the state will be scrapped. And because none of the elementary and middle school textbooks are more than three years old, none will be replaced, he said.
 
Calm in Middlesex
 On the eve of the vote, Middlesex County, last year's hotbed of antitax sentiment in central New Jersey, appears to be calmer. Eighteen of the 22 budgets in Middlesex failed to pass last spring. "Things are extraordinarily calm this year," said John Namath, the county school business administrator.
Tomorrow's vote will be held despite an attempt by the Republican-controlled Legislature to delay it. Gov. Florio has ignored a bill, passed by both houses, that would change the date. He is expected to veto the measure Thursday, hoping to remove any legal challenges to budgets that are approved Tuesday.
Republicans wanted to delay the vote to give them more time to devise a spending formula providing wealthier suburban districts a larger slice of the $341 million in increased aid the Florio Administration is providing through a re-evaluation of state pension funds. Statewide education associations representing teachers, principals and superintendents all opposed the Republican move.
Republican legislative leaders say they will not attempt to override the Governor's expected veto.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
All Fervent on the Recycling Front

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: SHELTON, Conn.

 BODY:
ALL right, listen up. It's time to get tough. We're only going to write this once.
We're in an environmental crisis: too much junk polluting our planet. Adults have had their chance to fix things. Sure, adults talk a good game against pollution. And adults are super talkers about the environment, too, especially planning for the environment. You should see the impressive environmental reports they turn out on recycled paper and then talk about at important conferences. 
 Some of these collections of cliches, hot-air projections, methane minutiae and recycled ideas are this thick. Talking and planning to save the environment are very important in adult American society because they keep us from actually having to do anything ourselves.
Now, if you were a recycling revolutionary, someone who wanted to change history and actually accomplish something about, say, garbage and recycling, to whom would you turn? Hint: they're under 60 inches tall, can't vote and do not recall anything before the mid-1980's. Answer: a bunch of fourth graders, who still have the intellectual clarity to cut through the, uh, garbage.
Most important, fourth graders have the developing vocabulary, the simplistic savvy and the innocent persistence to form an amazing amalgam called Pester Power. The Disney World people have built an entire economic empire by mining this unlimited resource. Perhaps it's the environmentalists' turn.
Graphs and political realities mean nothing to 10-year-olds. They have yet to understand why nothing can possibly be accomplished about garbage until the year 2000 and maybe not even then unless we drastically increase spending, which is impossible given budget cutbacks and anyway, first, we need several more studies of previous studies.
Enter Briggs Baugh and Andrew Mark. They look like adults, except they have this notion that children are society's salvation from drowning in its own garbage. So these men, the Che Guevaras of the children's anti-garbage movement, have started a quiet pilot program of environmental indoctrination that took a trip to the front lines of the suburban garbage wars here the other day. You will soon imagine what happened when their young troops returned home at night.
The first company of 70 recruits was from the North Street School in Greenwich, a leader in recent recycling. Greenwich annually churns out over 70,000 tons of affluent garbage. Thanks in part to Mr. Baugh, the town's ebullient recycling coordinator, about one-quarter of that waste is recycled, including magazines, junk mail and 7,000 tons of leaves that are composted with sewage sludge and sand and sold back to residents as rich soil.
The idea is to show pupils the vast volume of garbage; that contrary to popular belief, trash doesn't just disappear inside trucks; that its disposal has unpleasant consequences, and that each person can reduce trash starting today by buying better and recycling more. "Once you see a landfill," said Mr. Baugh, "your conviction level soars quickly."
First, the youngsters smelled the Greenwich transfer station ("Yuck!"). Then they saw their trash burned in Bridgeport at 2,200 degrees ("Wow!"), 8,000 pounds a scoop ("Neato!"). Then their bus crept to the 165-foot summit of a mountain of ash here ("When's lunch?"). Then ("Where's the bathroom?") after a rest stop, they patrolled a grocery to denounce juice boxes and one-portion bags of chips while cheering bulk boxes, fruits and reusable containers. "Less packaging per ounce!" they chorused properly.
The tour, which is likely to include all Greenwich fourth graders come fall, also involved Socratic exchanges on what to do when this landfill fills in August. "Build another." Next to your house? "Well, no." "Dump it in the sea." "Send it to the sun."
Then it happened. A studious Fred Bjorn was scratching his head. Mr. Baugh mistook this for a raised hand and called on him. A shocked Fred thought quickly: "We should charge people for each garbage bag and collect recyclables for free." Eureka!
The classes will now write themes and indignant letters to environmentally incorrect packagers. But first Mr. Mark, himself the father of a fourth grader and a second grader, offered advice. "Your parents are good people," he said, "but they're very busy and need your help."
Time for the solemn oath: "Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I pledge to go home tonight and instruct my family on what we can do to reduce the waste stream. I will inspect all kitchen and bathroom cabinets and point out those examples of unnecessary and wasteful packaging. From now on, I will not purchase, and will encourage my parents not to purchase, any wasteful or nonrecyclable packaging."
The children streamed off the bus, eager to assault the home front. Mr. Mark had high fives for every convert. He seemed to be smiling rather mischievously, for an adult.

HEADLINE: N.Y.U. Head Remains Wedded to Classroom

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
Sleeves rolled to the elbows and pens firmly ensconced in shirt pocket, L. Jay Oliva is addressing 25 undergraduates at New York University who have signed up for his course on "Topics in the History of the Russian Empire." In front of almost every student is a soft drink and a cookie, a nice touch, and one that Dr. Oliva can easily provide. After all, he runs the place.
Dr. Oliva, who took over officially as the university president in November, teaches the course every Wednesday afternoon in the spring semester. The subject this day is Napoleon's conquering march from Warsaw to Moscow and the emperor's hasty retreat in the bitter Russian winter. Or, as Dr. Oliva says in the easygoing manner that is his trademark, "the shootout at the Warsaw corral." 
 University presidents are not usually found in classrooms; their natural habitat is more often the dais at the fund-raising dinner. And Dr. Oliva is familiar with the rubber-chicken circuit. But contact with students keeps him going, he says, just as the soda, the sweets, the shirtsleeves and the slightly nerdy pen-in-pocket look are very much part of the relaxed just-folks image that the leader of N.Y.U. wants to convey.
 
Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside
 "What I am is a professor," Dr. Oliva said as he sat in his office next to the conference room. "That's the way I see the world. I realize that as president I have to be a public person, I have to raise money. But my notion of being a professor is to keep in mind that those things are just devices designed to accomplish what I came here to do: make the classroom and the laboratory special places for students to learn."
Dr. Oliva, who is 58 years old, is the 14th president in the 160-year history of N.Y.U. and the first to be chosen from its faculty. He replaced Dr. John Brademas, for whom he worked as chancellor. As a result of their partnership N.Y.U. has grown enormously and has survived relatively unscathed when many universities were beating a rapid economic retreat.
Dr. Oliva arrived at N.Y.U. in 1960 as an instructor of Russian history, but he has long been an administrator. He has held 14 positions at the university, including dean, vice president and provost. He became chancellor in 1983, assuming responsibility for day-to-day operations, broad policy issues and the budget, which now exceeds $1.1 billion a year.
Dr. Brademas, a former Representative from Indiana, transformed N.Y.U. in 10 years from a commuter school to a major residential research and teaching institution by recruiting top scholars and housing on campus almost 50 percent of the undergraduates. In the process, he nearly doubled the endowment, to more than $540 million. Drs. Oliva and Brademas worked together for most of that period, becoming widely known as Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside. Dr. Brademas built the university's image, and Dr. Oliva concentrated on the inner workings.
When Dr. Brademas announced his retirement in July 1990, Dr. Oliva was widely viewed as his natural successor. Several N.Y.U. officials, in fact, have said that Dr. Brademas's retirement was announced early because other universities were interested in recruiting Dr. Oliva and that the trustees wanted to insure that Mr. Inside did not walk out.
He moved up at a troublesome time for higher education in the United States. Budget problems brought on by the recession, decreases in government aid and a drop in high school graduates have helped to force universities from Yale to Berkeley to consider eliminating entire departments and making other drastic cuts.
Not so at N.Y.U., and for many reasons, Dr. Oliva says. "We saw the demographic decline coming" a decade ago, he said. "And we realized that if we relied exclusively on the Northeast, on the 17 counties in the metropolitan area, it would not be enough. A lot of us had a dream to go national. So we went and did it, and we changed the nature of the student body."
There have been 10,800 applications for the incoming undergraduate class, he said, a 10 percent increase over the current class. The number is second only to the record of 1986. The university has 13,000 undergraduates among its 47,000 students.
In 1981, 17.3 percent of the first-year students were from outside the New York metropolitan region. By 1991 the number exceeded 43 percent. Forty-six percent of the students now live on campus. Almost half the students are members of minorities, with Asian-Americans -- 28 percent of the students -- in the lead.
Dr. Oliva also said, "We spent a lot of time over the last 10 years putting parts of the university that were in financial trouble in order." The Education School had a $5 million deficit eight years ago, said Dr. Oliva, but has no deficit today, nor do any other schools at N.Y.U.
But the university has not been immune from the recession. In a letter to students and faculty members, Dr. Oliva wrote, "Hard choices are a part of our present and future." Last fall he declared a moratorium on administrative hiring, and he recently began a longterm $8 million plan to reduce administrative costs. But the bottom line, he added, is that N.Y.U. is financially healthy.
Dr. Oliva acknowledges, however, that there is no way to know for sure whether N.Y.U. will continue to be protected from problems besieging other universities. So he plays a retro theme, small-scale concerns are again beautiful. "We built the residence halls, but what will happen there?" he asked, adding that he wanted to help create many small groups like clubs and dormitory basketball teams to foster a university community in the big city.
 
Host to World Conference
 Those concerns are part of Dr. Oliva's vision for the future, a vision in keeping with his emphasis on the classroom. "It's time to look to the people," he said. "We want to focus on the quality of student life, intellectual and social, both inside and outside the university."
Efforts to strengthen cultural and business ties in the city provide a foundation for another goal, what Dr. Oliva calls the "international mission," linking the university to other major cities. Immediately after Dr. Oliva's inauguration, N.Y.U. was host to a conference attended by educational leaders from cities around the world, including St. Petersburg, New Delhi and Paris.
The classroom focus, he says, requires a strong faculty. In the year of transition between Dr. Brademas and Dr. Oliva, N.Y.U. obtained 19 endowed professorships.
Dr. Oliva's colleagues say he is much beloved by students and faculty members and has made few or no enemies in his more than 30 years at the university. Even off the record, no one would offer a negative word.
"He is a real teacher," the Henry James Professor of English and American Letters, Denis Donoghue, said.
Some evenings are in the large penthouse apartment in a dormitory where Dr. Oliva lives with his wife, Mary Ellen. He constantly invites students for discussions and parties, occasions that almost always involve Dr. Oliva's picking up his guitar.
Music, especially Irish music, is one of his loves. In the 60's and 70's, while he was teaching, Dr. Oliva sang and played banjo with the Men of the West at places like Glocca Morra, John Barleycorn, the Kettle of Fish, the Bells of Hell and Flanagan's. "My starting salary as an instructor at N.Y.U. was $3,700," he recalled. "I needed the money."
He doesn't anymore. But, like all universities, N.Y.U. does. And, especially when it comes to fund raising, Dr. Brademas's success may be a hard act to follow.
Dr. Oliva said he was not worried. "I'm not a minor version of John," he said. "You'll have a very different presidency. We're both gregarious. But I'm a teacher. That's what I do. And I've always followed a piece of advice my grandfather gave me: 'As you go through life, dance with the girl what brung you.' "

HEADLINE: U.S. Unable to Lead Europe Out of a Slump

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 6

 BODY:
Europe's sluggish economy is painfully coming to terms with a new reality: signs of a modest recovery in the United States now matter less than bad news from Germany.
The prevalent pessimism, called "Eurodoldrums" by Smith Barney's international economist, J. Paul Horne, essentially reflects the economic situation in Germany. The huge financial pressures of rebuilding what was East Germany are causing a higher budget deficit, higher inflation and higher interest rates, which in turn are afflicting an increasingly integrated Continent. 
 "Having had the benefit of German reunification in the form of a demand surge that boosted other countries' exports, European nations are now paying the cost," said Warren Oliver, an economist at UBS Phillips & Drew in London. "Moreover, the relative influence on Europe of the U.S. economy seems to be diminishing."
But the European Community remains a market for American goods nearly as large as the one comprising Canada and Mexico, Washington's partners in the proposed North American free trade zone. While European Community exports to the United States grew just 17.4 percent from 1987 to 1990, United States exports to the community rose 60.9 percent. The United States had a trade surplus of almost $17 billion with the community in 1991, compared with a trade deficit of $16.6 billion in 1987.
This export surge has changed the balance of the relationship. It used to be said that where the United States economy led, Europe followed. But as signs of a modest upturn have emerged in the United States in recent weeks, Europe has been plunging deeper into gloom. Unemployment has surged to 9.4 percent, from 8.3 percent, in the last year, reaching 20 percent for those under 25 years old.
As in the United States, housing prices are falling. Economists throughout the Continent are revising their already anemic growth forecasts downward.
The political consequences of the slump are profound. Anti-immigrant, extreme right movements are gaining strength, most prominently the National Front in France but also the growing Lombard League in Italy and, most recently, the Republicans and the German People's Union in Germany.
Political leaders from John Major in Britain to Francois Mitterrand in France are suffering as high interest rates, falling property prices and lost jobs arouse bitterness.
 
Pressure on Politicians
 This in turn makes discussions of European monetary union, aid to Eastern Europe and trade agreements with the United States more delicate. Politicians feel they can make few concessions as the tough monetary pressures of Germany on an integrated Europe are becoming clear.
Because the European Monetary System obliges European Community countries to keep their currencies within a fixed range of exchange rates, higher German interest rates inevitably lead to rate increases throughout the Continent to insure that currencies maintain their relative values. This higher cost of money deters borrowing and investment and acts as a brake on economies seeking to rebound.
Germany is especially influential because it accounts for about 25 percent of the community's output.
At the headquarters in Brussels of the 12-nation European Community, Servaas Deroose, a senior economist, said the executive commission's initial forecast of 2.2 percent growth in 1992 would be sharply lowered, to between 1.5 and 1.75 percent.
Similar revisions are under review at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. And the respected Kiel Institute of World Economics came out last month with the most pessimistic 1992 European growth estimate among prominent forecasters to date -- just 1.25 percent.
If such pessimistic forecasts prove correct, Europe's expected rebound from paltry 1.3 percent growth last year will not materialize.
"Right now, the recovery looks invisible," said Mr. Horne of Smith Barney. By contrast, the European economy grew a robust 3.25 percent annually between 1987 and 1990.
 
Sharp Downturn Not Universal
 The picture is by no means uniform for the 344.3 million citizens of the European Community. While Britain has suffered a full-fledged recession, other countries have generally been spared a downturn as sharp as that in the United States in 1991.
The Continent has suffered from extreme sluggishness rather than an outright slump. One good sign has been that inflation in the European Community, running at 5.5 percent in 1990 and 5.1 percent last year, is now down to 4.7 percent.
But against this trend, German inflation has been rising, to 4.3 percent from 2.7 percent in 1990 and 3.5 percent last year. Fueled by high reunification costs, this trend has alarmed Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank.
In December, to cool inflationary pressure, the Bundesbank raised its two key interest rates -- the discount rate to 8 percent and the short-term Lombard rate to 9.75 percent. Most of the rest of Europe reluctantly followed suit and has waited since then for a sign that German rates may come down.
Recent signals have not been encouraging. "I see interest rates remaining relatively high for the next year and no really visible improvement in the European economy until 1993," said Norbert Walter, the chief economist for Deutsche Bank.
Germany's inflation has several sources, among them wage demands from the country's powerful labor unions. The four-million-member public-sector union is threatening a strike to secure pay increases of 9.5 percent. The Government has offered 3.5 percent.
 
Costs of German Unification
 More fundamental, in the view of many analysts, is the absorption of the eastern part of the country. Unification initially set off a boom driven by consumption and investment. But this expansion has now dried up, and the costs are becoming apparent. Net transfers from Bonn to the east are expected to total about $112.5 billion this year.
"It's a fact that we're now a dampener on European growth, but we accept that we're paying the cost for unification," said Michael Zapf, the managing director of Bank Julius Baer in Germany. "The question is: do you want built-in inflation or a little bit of pain to prevent this? Over the longer term, Europe will benefit from our current attack on inflation."
For now, the rest of Europe must live with the uncharacteristic problem of a Germany battling budget deficits and inflation while its economy is temporarily stalled. As one result, a country like France -- where inflation, at 3 percent, has been tamed -- has been obliged to maintain interest rates of close to 10 percent, a cost of money bound to hold growth in check.
"The European outlook is mediocre because with real interest rates so high, the investment required for a rebound will not be stimulated," said Etienne Davignon, a former European Community commissioner and the chairman of the Societe Generale de Belgique industrial group. But he added that there was no alternative to Germany's inflationary spending on the east. "What other choice exists?" he said.
 
Decline in Germany's Output
 Germany's total output fell for the last three quarters of last year, and this year's first quarter is likely to show only a slight upswing, largely as a result of mild weather, which spurred construction. So keen is the nation's disillusionment that Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned Germans last week not to gain a reputation for being "sniveling and faint-hearted." But some predict an upturn in the second half of the year.
Compounding Europe's problems, exports to the United States are less reliable as a source of growth. In part this reflects Europe's growing integration; commerce within the community now accounts for more than 60 percent of the 12 member states' trade.
"The direct, real influence of the U.S. is diminishing," said Mr. Deroose of the European Community commission. "More and more, Europe, like the U.S., acts under its own dynamic."
Moreover, the United States recovery appears to be too slow to create a strong demand for imports, especially since many American industries are increasingly competitive and able to export.
In 1984, when the United States economy rebounded sharply, United States imports surged 24 percent while domestic demand grew 9 percent, said Mr. Oliver of UBS Phillips & Drew. "This time," he said, "the U.S. will not help Europe as much."
Still, European economists and business people look very much to the economy in the United States as the barometer of the world economy. A clear American upswing is regarded by many analysts as the best hope for a change in this somber European mood.
"Psychologically, we still need the U.S.," Mr. Deroose said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Mixed in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in thin trading yesterday, as credit market participants paused to assess conditions following last week's rally.
Short-term securities continued to attract buyers, despite sharp appreciation last week. But prices were weaker for long-term notes and bonds. 
 The recent decline in yields of short-term maturities reflects a change of traders' expectations about the Federal Reserve Board's likely conduct of monetary policy in the coming weeks.
 
Receding Fears
 Until late last month, traders overreacted to signs of economic strength by pushing yields up to levels that would have been consistent with a tighter policy by the central bank.
The fears have receded in the last two weeks, however, and yields on short-term bills and notes have come back down.
"The market has finally recognized that much of the strength in the monetary and economic data seen for the first two months of the year were exaggerated by temporary factors," analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, noted in the firm's daily market commentary.
The improvement in short-term interest rates was visible at yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
 
3-Month Bills at 3.95%
 The new three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.95 percent, well below the average rate of 4.08 percent at last week's bill auction.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 4.02 percent, compared with an average rate of 4.19 percent at the sale a week ago.
Traders said that coming supply of new intermediate to long-term Treasury issues, including tomorrow's auction of $9.75 billion in new seven-year notes, weighed on the bond market yesterday. But the traders said few long-dated issues actually changed hands.
Late yesterday, the new seven-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.12 percent.
 
Slow, Slow, Slow
 To illustrate how slow business was yesterday, the head of a government bond desk at a leading investment bank, who asked not to be identified, said his firm traded $19 billion worth of securities on Friday, versus about $4 billion yesterday.
"I'm sort of surprised prices have moved as much as they have, because nobody is writing any tickets," said Steven A. Wood, the director of financial markets research at the Bank of America.
"And with no real information out until Thursday," he added, "I would suspect that not much is going to happen over the next couple of days unless we get a real surprise in the New York primary."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 1/4, down by 7/32 , to yield 7.88 percent, compared with 7.87 percent late on Friday.
 
10-Year Notes at 7.41%
 Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10019/32 , down by 5/32 , to yield 7.41 percent. The 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 10017/32 , unchanged from late on Friday, to yield 6.74 percent. And the 5 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 10023/32 , down by 1/32 , to yield 5.36 percent.
Activity was equally listless in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Traders in those markets said prices of most securities were unchanged on the day.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Credit-Card Use in February Up as Other Borrowing Fell

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
In what may be a sign of reviving buying interest, the Federal Reserve Board said today that consumers expanded their use of credit cards in February, although they paid off more debts than they incurred.
Overall consumer installment credit -- the type of debt that requires monthly payments -- fell by $199 million in February after growing by a slight $53 million in January. 
 The January figure was a sharp revision from the Fed's original report, in which it said that installment credit had fallen by $183 million at the beginning of 1992.
But the biggest single category within the consumer credit report, "revolving," or credit-card, credit, expanded by $1.19 billion in February following a $312 million expansion in January.
That was in line with Commerce Department reports showing that retail sales grew a strong 2.1 percent in January and 1.3 percent in February. Many department-store purchases, from clothes to home appliances, are paid for with credit cards.
But auto loans shrank by $476 million in February after increasing in January by $347 million. Sales of new cars have been slowly rising, and factory orders for cars rose in January and February.
Total outstanding bank loans, aside from home mortgages, fell during February by $550 million after declining in January by $139 million.
The total of credit owed for mobile homes fell by $358 million after decreasing by $466 million in January.
Recent surveys suggest that consumer confidence has begun to increase amid mounting, if mixed, signals that the economy is recovering from recession.
Last week, increases in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index as well as the Conference Board's consumer confidence measure suggested an improving economic situation in March.
So far, however, growth has been too slow to provide a big lift in job opportunities that economists say is necessary to sustain economic expansion.
The Labor Department reported Friday that only 19,000 non-farm jobs were added to payrolls in March, and the unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent, the same as in January.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Cable's Use Of 'Free' TV Is Debated

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
Saying they were sticking up for consumers, entertainment executives quarreled with one another before a Senate panel today over whether cable television should continue to have free access to over-the-air broadcasts.
Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Patents, suggested that the executives' opinions had been shaped not by consumer concern, but their own profit motives. 
 If the free-access law is repealed, "someone is going to make more money," Mr. DeConcini said, adding, "How much more are you going to make?"
Addressing the subcommitee were heavyweights from the motion picture, cable television and broadcast industries. No one answered the question directly.
 
Those Who Seek Payments
 "The greatest economic benefit will be to consumers," said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, who supports repealing free access.
He said a fair market value was not being paid for the Hollywood products broadcast by the television networks and picked up by cable systems. If cable operators had to start paying, Mr. Valenti said, the money would be used to enhance the programming available to everyone.
Barry Diller, outgoing chairman of the Fox Inc. broadcasting network, went even further, saying that if cable did not start contributing to the costs of broadcast programs, "there will be nothing worth watching on free television."
Mr. Diller pointed out that cable operators had two sources of revenue: rates and advertising. Broadcast stations and networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- have only advertising.
 
'Compulsory Licensing' Debated
 Under a law known as "compulsory licensing" that was passed in 1976 to help the fledgling cable indusry grow, the creators of programs for broadcast are compelled to allow cable companies free access to local television signals. Broadcasters argue that the so-called compulsory license represents a giveaway to their biggest competitor.
A bill to repeal the law has been introduced in the House, but not yet in the Senate.
Repeal would open the door for negotiations between those who make the shows and those who carry them and would likely lead to payments by cable companies for local and network programs. Such a change is thought likely to add to the monthly bills of cable television subscribers.
But Mr. Diller argued that the new source of revenue would mean continued quality programming for everyone, not just those who can afford cable.
Ted Turner, head of the Turner Broadcasting System, said the networks made a lot more money than cable, which was just starting to see success. "Cable has succeeded and now the broadcasters want to get our money," Mr. Turner said. "These guys are up here because we're in their pockets a little bit."
He said the law had been good for consumers because it was promoting diversity in television programming.
James Hedlund, president of the Association of Independent Television Stations, also opposed repeal of the law, while Edward Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters said it should be re-examined.
Broadcasters provided crucial support when the Senate passed a tough cable television regulation bill in January.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Shift in Executive Style For Toyota Unit in U.S.

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday that Shinji Sakai would replace Yukiyasu Togo as chief executive of its United States sales arm. Officials of the Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Company said that a date had not been set for Mr. Sakai to take over but added that the change would probably occur this summer.
Other changes in the top management of the North American division include the shift of Yale Gieszl, senior vice president for finance and administration, to replace Robert McCurry as executive vice president for sales and operations in the United States, said a Toyota executive who spoke on condition that he not be identified. 
 Mr. Togo, 68, and Mr. McCurry, 69, had been expected to announce their retirements, though Mr. McCurry has not said when he will step down.
Mr. Sakai, 55, a director who has oversight in Japan of the auto maker's North American operations, shares with Mr. Togo a career path that includes work in Canada for Toyota. But industry officials and analysts said similarities might be limited to their resumes, as Mr. Sakai (pronounced sah-KIE) is less gregarious than Mr. Togo.
Mr. Togo helped motivate Toyota's sales force to rapid success by energizing sales rallies with his trademark slogan, "Sell, sell, sell like hell," and handing out bonus checks, which became known as "Togo bucks," to the sales staff. In Mr. Togo's nine-year tenure, Toyota expanded its model lineup to include the Lexus luxury-car division and sold more than a million vehicles last year for the second straight year.
The more subdued style of Mr. Sakai -- his business cards have the standard, rectangular form; Mr. Togo's are round, with a line drawing of his face -- may be more appropriate in the turbulent 1990's. Trade friction and concern among some consumers and legislators over the eroding market share of domestic brands haveprompted Toyota to take a less aggressive stance. At a press conference last fall, a Toyota official appeared pleased to announce that the company's production capacity constraints, as well as new product offerings by the Big Three auto makers, would probably mean a lower market share for Toyota in the United States.
Mr. Sakai joined Toyota in 1961 after graduating from Kyoto University with a degree in economics. He held several planning and research positions for the auto maker's marketing arm, working primarily in international sales. He worked for five years in the early 1980's as assistant to the president of Toyota Canada.
In 1985, he became general manager of the North American division, and was named to Toyota's board in 1988, overseeing North American production and marketing activities.
A native of Osaka, Mr. Sakai and his wife, Ryuko, live in Tokyo. They have two daughters.

HEADLINE: In Poll, Executives Back Free Trade

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Corporate executives who are suppliers, customers and rivals of the swelling ranks of foreign companies in the United States get a firsthand glimpse every business day of the economic impact of the nation's free-trade policies.
And most of them conclude that the benefits of free trade -- stimulating economic activity and efficiency -- outweigh the costs of stiffer foreign competition, like lost jobs and markets for some industries, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll. 
 The 490 executives surveyed, representing a cross section of American industry from multibillion-dollar corporations to small family companies, are considerably more emphatic in their support for keeping the nation's markets comparatively open than is the public in general, which, according to previous Times/CBS polls, is more sympathetic to curbing imports to protect American jobs and industries.
In the survey of top executives, completed last month, 61 percent said their opinion was closer to the statement "Free trade must be allowed, even if domestic industries are hurt by foreign competition." By contrast, only 33 percent said their opinion was closer to the statement "Trade restrictions are necessary to protect domestic industries." Six percent declined to agree with either statement.
The free-trade support among executives is largely explained by how far the internationalization of Corporate America has progressed, which was clearly evident in recent follow-up interviews with two dozen of the executives who were surveyed.
Neal Trask, for example, is president of Trask Decrow Machinery Inc., a company with $5 million in sales that markets industrial pumps and compressors in South Portland, Me., a town scarcely known as a hub of global commerce.
Trask Decrow sells its machinery to the region's pulp and paper makers, shipbuilders and for use in the snow-making equipment on nearby ski slopes like Sugarloaf. But for the last few years, the company has also done a brisk trade in snow-making pumps with the Hokkaido Snow Service Company. "One of my best customers is in Japan now," Mr. Trask said. "I'm a free trader."
 
View on Japan Restrictions
 In Bartlesville, Okla., the Mark Roberts dealership sells Honda Accords and Chrysler Voyager and Caravan mini-vans. Like 58 percent of the executives polled, Mr. Roberts replied that restrictions in Japan were probably a main reason that more American products are not sold in Japan -- more important than explanations such as that American goods have a reputation for lower quality or that United States companies have not tried hard enough to crack the Japanese market.
Like most executives in the survey, Mr. Roberts regards Washington's pursuit of opening the Japanese market as necessary, worthwhile and in the interest of fairness. But even if all the restrictions were lifted, he doubts it would help America much.
"It wouldn't make a hill of beans worth of difference to the U.S. economy," Mr. Roberts said. "That's not the trouble with our economy."
Mr. Roberts's showroom provides an example of the increasing globalization of American industry, as well as the complexity surrounding that issue. Most Hondas on his lot, Mr. Roberts notes, are shipped from the Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio.
 
Washington-Honda Debate
 Honda is currently embroiled in a debate with Washington over just how American its made-in-America cars really are. Customs Service investigators have challenged Honda's contention that the "domestic content" of its cars built in America is 75 percent, meaning that three-fourths of the value of each car is based on American labor, parts and other costs.
Even the definition of an American executive is getting more complicated these days. Tachi Kiuchi was one of the randomly selected chief executives in the survey. Mr. Kiuchi is the head of Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc., a $2.5 billion-a-year subsidiary of the Japanese company, which has six factories and employs 50,000 people in the United States.
Mr. Kiuchi's free-trade sympathies are not in doubt, but he does sense a growing economic nationalism in the United States that he believes is making it more difficult for Mitsubishi Electronics to sell its semiconductors, televisions, elevators, auto parts and other products in America. Mitsubishi Electronics' target for 1992 is to increase sales by 5 percent.
 
'Buy America' Effect Seen
 "To attain that goal would be much easier if it were not for this Japan-bashing business climate," Mr. Kiuchi said. "It's hard to put your finger on or point to some set of figures, but the 'Buy America' sentiment is having an effect."
Other business people in the survey agreed, but they also said the Buy America effect was hard to measure and that some customers were more nationalistic in their speech than in their buying habits.
John Kiefer, whose car dealership in Santa Cruz, Calif., sells Mazda, Oldsmobile and BMW cars, said: "I've had people come in that have bought four Mazdas in the past and say that they're not buying another Japanese car. Some still do, though."
The appeal of economic nationalism seems to be much stronger among the public than among corporate executives. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll in January, 1,281 adults were asked, "Which is more important to you: to protect American industries and jobs by limiting imports from other countries, or to allow free trade so you can buy good products at low prices no matter what country they come from?"
Of the adults surveyed, 56 percent replied that it was more important to "limit imports," while 38 percent chose to "allow free trade." By contrast, 61 percent of the corporate executives polled in March said free trade was more important, while 29 percent said limiting imports was more important.
Still, in their personal purchases, some executives show signs of buying American. W. John Devine, the chairman of Child World Inc., a 125-store toy retailer, has not bought an American car in 15 years. And after owning a Porsche, Ferrari and Audi, he said he was considering buying a Lexus, made by Toyota. But upon reflection, and following favorable reviews in car magazines, Mr. Devine said he was now leaning toward a Cadillac Seville STS.
"I'm not a Buy America guy," Mr. Devine said. "But I figure, if the quality is about equal and it helps G.M. and the U.S. economy, why not?"
 
Growing Social Pressure
 Ralph Colello, managing director of the operations management practice at Arthur D. Little Inc., said he saw a climate of social pressure building behind the notion of buying goods that are clearly identifiable as American products.
"It's quiet and beneath the surface, like what went on with smoking years ago," he said. "With the recession and all the cutbacks at American companies, there's a lot of potential for nationalism."

(Based on a survey of 490 U.S. business executives conducted Feb. 18 to March 6 and on a survey of 1,281 adults nationwide conducted in January.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The New York Times/CBS News Poll of American business executives is based on interviews with 490 senior executives at companies throughout the United States, interviewed by telephone from Feb. 18 to March 6.
The sample of companies and executives called was provided by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services. The sample was randomly drawn from those listed in the company's nationwide data base of privately held and publicly owned companies.
Companies with $5 million or more in annual revenue were eligible for the survey. Within each company, one senior executive was interviewed. Titles eligible for the poll included chief executive, president, chairman, executive vice president, senior vice president, owner and partner -- starting from the top down.
Because smaller companies are most numerous, to provide more reliable comparisons between companies of various sizes, those with larger annual revenue were sampled at a higher rate.
The completed sample included 274 interviews in companies with $5 million to $99 million of revenue, 121 interviews in companies with $100 million to $499 million of revenue, and 95 interviews in companies with $500 million or more of annual revenue. The completed sample was then weighted by revenue size to reflect the actual distribution of all listed companies in the country.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, results based on such samples will differ by no more than six percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out senior executives at all listed companies in the country with annual revenue of $5 million or more.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for the biggest companies -- those with $500 million or more in annual revenue -- the potential sampling error is plus or minus 10 percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey can introduce other sources of error into the poll.

Equitable Seeks A Radical Change

BYLINE: By Peter Kerr

 BODY:
MORE than two million policyholders of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States recently received a hefty packet describing Equitable's plans to transform itself from a mutual insurance company to a publicly traded stock company.
The policyholders will have until May 6 to try to wade through the 336 pages of documents to decide whether to vote for or against the move to go public. If the plan goes ahead, as most people expect, policyholders will be rewarded with stock, cash or a combination of the two. 
 While it is still too early to estimate the value of the stock to new shareholders, some analysts say the mailing is refreshingly frank about Equitable's plans and problems. They say it sets a new standard for disclosure -- no small matter in an industry groping to regain public trust.
The so-called demutualization comes after Equitable has struggled for more than two years to overcome losses and a battered reputation. Last month, the company announced it lost $898 million last year, including $308 million in write-offs and other charges taken against real estate, junk bonds and commercial mortgages.
In the documents sent to policyholders, the company detailed its problems with commercial mortgages, for example, which totaled $500.5 million out of a $7.44 billion mortgage portfolio. It also gave a highly specific breakdown on loans, including scheduled principal repayments and outstanding balloon loans. The company also disclosed that it had reduced its guaranteed investment contracts to $7.2 billion, from a high in 1986 of $14.5 billion.
The documents certainly confirm that Equitable's hard times continued last year. Problem real estate loans surged 77 percent, for example.
"This is a level of disclosure that could force everybody to go to a higher level," said Myron Picoult, an analyst at Oppenheimer Inc. "As a result of what they have released, I think that people are going to find that this is a company that has problems, but it is not the basket case that everyone has been talking about."
In the late 1980's, the company lost more than $1 billion on guaranteed investment contracts, which promise a specified return and are sold to large corporate pension and profit-sharing plans and to municipalities. The contracts obligated Equitable to make payments at high interest rates; they became money losers when interest rates fell.
It also gorged on commercial real estate and filled its new 50-story tower in midtown Manhattan with so much expensive art (including a five-story-high painting by Roy Lichtenstein) that it became a symbol of conspicuous consumption.
In 1990, the company, facing large losses, a shrinking capital base and falling debt ratings, forced out its senior management and chief executive and replaced them with a team under Richard H. Jenrette, an investment banker who has sought to raise capital and erase an image of excess.
Mr. Jenrette has moved to scale back on such symbols and expenses. Equitable has been slow, like other companies, to reduce its exposure in real estate; mortgages and commercial real estate still total 42 percent of its portfolio. But analysts have generally praised its decision to try to become the largest mutual insurer ever to go public.
A mutual insurance company, like Equitable, is owned by its policyholders. Demutualization will allow Equitable to raise money by selling shares to investors. Although some smaller companies have made the switch in the past, nothing on this scale has ever taken place. If successful, it seems likely that other mutual insurers, also badly in need of new capital, will follow suit.
In July, Equitable got a $1 billion investment from the French insurer Groupe Axa S.A. Initially in the form of notes, the investment will be converted to stock after Equitable's initial offering, which should occur late this year. The process is subject to approval by the New York State Insurance Department and by two-thirds of the policyholders who vote. Analysts say approval seems likely.
"From the policyholders' perspective, it can't be anything but a positive package," said Kevin Ceurvorst, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago, who said he thought policyholders would want the company to have access to new capital. "It's in their interests to vote for it."
Exactly how much a policyholder will receive in stock or cash will not become clear until the company actually goes public. Anyone can vote who owns a life, health or disability policy or annuity contract issued before Nov. 27, 1991.
Nancy Amiel, a company spokeswoman, said Equitable could not project the market value of the offering or its price per share. The mailing mentions a range of possible market capitalizations from $1.1 million to $3.9 billion, but the company said it had used those numbers only to illustrate how the process would work.
 "It looks like 'War and Peace,' and it is not going to be easy for John Q. Public to follow," Mr. Picoult said of the mailing. "But they did a commendable job. These documents make it clear that this is a company that is going through pains to clean up its act."

Revamping The Training Of M.B.A.'s

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
GRADUATE business schools across the nation are revising and updating M.B.A. programs to meet changing business needs. They are integrating programs to include international aspects, ethics and crisis management, while stressing total quality management, as well as adding courses and seminars to treat the new subjects.
Business school deans say they have relied on the advice of corporate executives, alumni and students in addressing the practicalities needed for the business world. 
 "Our new program gives our students more time to take electives," said Dean Thomas F. Keller of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, who was in New York early last week to talk about the school's new curriculum for M.B.A.'s, which starts in the fall.
Fuqua students, who previously took six courses each semester, will now take four courses in seven-week sessions, half the length of regular semesters, he said. "Classes will meet two and a quarter hours twice a week instead of the current one and a quarter hours," he said.
Each of the four semesters opens with an intensive week of studying. The four special weeks during the two-year program are called integrative learning experiences and cover timely subjects. Team building and leadership development is the first. It includes one day of an Outward Bound experience in a wilderness setting, doing rope climbing and solving problems that require working together, like handling an injured person.
"This is a team-building experience," Dr. Keller said, adding that after the wilderness day professors relate it to the need for working as a team in business.
The other intensive weeks focus on managing quality and diversity; competitive business strategy, and complex management problems.
There is also an exchange program under which students may spend a semester at foreign business schools, including Manchester Business in Britain; Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium; University of Sydney, Australia, and Ecole Superieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales near Paris.
Another emphasis is on communications. Both concise writing and the ability to stand before an audience and talk with no more than a few small cards to jog the memory are required.
"Many students get cold sweats when they try to do this the first time," Dean Keller said. He recalled that one student fainted.
The professors are using new case histories as fast as they can be written to make up for the few textbooks available in areas like globalization and crisis management.
"Our copy center runs overtime with our 625 students getting what we call teaching notes," Dean Keller said.
Later last week, Dean Meyer Feldberg of Columbia University's business school talked about his new program, also scheduled to start in the fall, at a breakfast held at the Bankers Trust Company, which employs about 100 Columbia M.B.A.'s. Eugene B. Shanks, the president of Bankers Trust and host of the breakfast, said that about 30 of them had been hired in the last four years.
Dean Feldberg said that through a survey he learned that the school's alumni wished they had been able to take such courses as globalization and ethics, which were not available when they got their M.B.A.'s. They do not favor study-abroad programs, he said, and he called Outward Bound experiences "flaky."
Columbia, where 1,500 M.B.A. students are enrolled, stressed integration of four basic subjects into each of the core courses that students must take -- globalization, ethics, total quality and managing human resources, which includes training to instill communications ability. For example, in a finance course a professor might introduce ethics by discussing illegal insider trading.
The core courses are managerial statistics, accounting, managing human behavior, managerial economics, business finance, marketing, operations management, the global economic environment, strategic management and decision models, which are typical of courses at other schools.
To make sure the students have basic skills, the program requires them to take noncredit seminars in such areas as mathematics, computer science and communications.

Apprenticeships: Reluctant Choice

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
IT is called youth apprenticeship: enrolling high school juniors in four-year work-study programs that train them for skilled jobs. Such programs in Europe, where they are often compulsory, make millions of young people into sophisticated entry-level workers. And now youth apprenticeship in a voluntary form is becoming fashionable in the United States -- in theory, at least.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, seeking the Democratic nomination for President, advocates youth apprenticeship. Various bills in Congress and in state legislatures push the concept. And the Labor Department, along with several private foundations, helps finance pilot projects. But after two years of efforts to start programs, the results are still meager: fewer than 1,000 apprentices nationwide, the Labor Department reports. 
 "It is undeniable that youth apprenticeship has caught people's imaginations, but it may just stay in that realm," said Richard Kazis, a director of Jobs for the Future, an organization financed by foundations and the Government that promotes apprenticeship programs and other work training.
The foot-dragging seems embedded in national attitudes. Youth apprentices are supposed to be bright teen-agers, not dropouts or youngsters who are failing in school. But in a nation that puts so much value on a college education, able students do not rush to join a program that shunts them into special classes in such subjects as technical writing and computer programming -- first in high school and then usually at a junior college -- and rules out the standard bachelor's degree.
"We had one student recruited in Williamsport who summed it up best," said Jean Wolfe, director of the Pennsylvania Youth Apprenticeship program. "He said: 'If I start at 16 and the program is four years, I'll be about 20 when I graduate. I suppose that is not too old if I really don't like what I am doing then.' "
Corporate America is equally wary. The youth apprentices must be given jobs two or three days a week as part of their training. To justify that outlay on a grand scale, tens of thousands of companies must be constantly upgrading their operations and drawing on a pool of skilled workers to man their ever more sophisticated machinery. That constant upgrading is not yet happening in the United States, said Stephen Hamilton, a Cornell University professor who oversees a youth apprenticeship program in the Binghamton, N.Y., area. He cited three reasons.
The recession is one; companies find it hard to justify hiring youth apprentices when they are laying off skilled workers. More important, companies like Motorola, Xerox and I.B.M. that do spend heavily on worker training, traditionally invest their money in existing employees and not in a future work force of apprentices still in school.
Finally, American companies generally try to compete in world markets by simplifying work and lowering labor costs. "Youth apprenticeship runs up against this mindset of viewing labor as a cost to be minimized," Mr. Hamilton said. "You have to view workers as an investment, and when you do, you try to get as much output from them as possible, and you train them accordingly."
Youth apprenticeship is intended to be the first step in this investment process. Its goal is distinct from traditional apprenticeship programs, which are preparing 300,000 young people already out of high school to be licensed carpenters, electricians, bricklayers and the like. Youth apprenticeship, in contrast, is intended to steer high school juniors not likely to go to college into skilled jobs -- avoiding the risk that after high school they will drift and get no training at all.
Whatever the merits, so far only hospitals chronically short of technicians, and manufacturers equally starved for highly skilled machinists and metal workers have responded to youth apprenticeship projects.
Such worker shortages certainly persuaded the Textron Corporation's airplane engine plant in Williamsport, Pa., to hire 6 of the 12 high school juniors recruited into a youth apprenticeship program in that city last fall.
"We have skilled workers on layoff now, but if the economy goes back up to where it was in 1989, they'll all be called back, and we'll be forced to hire unqualified people and train them," said Paul Batkowski, Textron's manager of labor relations. "That's wasteful."
But employing the six teen-agers two days a week at $4.45 an hour is not without headaches. Once their training is over, the teen-agers are not obligated to take regular jobs at Textron, although Mr. Batkowski hopes they will, lured by the pay of $15 an hour, plus benefits. And while they are in training, there is always the risk that Textron will be accused of using minimum-wage apprentices to displace regular workers.
"In this country, there is no national tradition of youth apprenticeship," Mr. Hamilton said. "There will have to be a huge selling job."

HEADLINE: Taiwan to Act on McDonnell

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, April 6

 BODY:
The Taiwan Government will decide soon whether to approve Taiwan investors' plans to acquire a stake in the commercial aircraft business of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a senior official said today.
The Vice Economics Minister, Yang Shih-chien, said his ministry expected to receive a report from an evaluation team and relay the findings to Parliament later this month. 
 The report was to have been out late last month but it was delayed because of some changes in the design of McDonnell Douglas's MD-12 trijet, a new type of long-range passenger jet.
Several lawmakers have opposed the proposed acquisition, saying Taiwan should not buy shares in a commercial aircraft maker with serious financial troubles. The commercial aircraft division of McDonnell Douglas has been in the red for 25 years.
Taiwan Aerospace, a private concern representing the local investors, signed an agreement last November to buy up to 40 percent of the commercial aircraft operations of McDonnell Douglas for $2 billion. But officials have indicated the actual stake could be as low as 25 percent.
The venture would produce wings and fuselages of MD-12 wide-body jets in Taiwan for final assembly in the United States.

Blass and Herrera Keep It Real, Mostly

BYLINE: By BERNADINE MORRIS

 BODY:
Realism rules as the fall and winter fashion openings begin in New York.
Usually the curtain raiser is a big show at the Plaza or Pierre hotels, but on Monday, Carolina Herrera and Bill Blass introduced their collections modestly in their Seventh Avenue showrooms. 
 'I'm pleased to be showing downtown," Mr. Blass said. "I simply feel more in touch with the business."
Mrs. Herrera, who just moved into the top floor of a building with a wrap-around terrace and a panoramic view of the city, said: "It's such a relief. I don't feel I'm producing a show on Broadway. I'm just presenting my clothes."
The retailers at Mrs. Herrera's 9 A.M. show, which opened the day's events, were equally delighted. "It's great to be in the market and not have to shoot uptown," said Tom Marotta, a Nan Duskin executive.
Ron Frasch of Neiman Marcus, said, "I'm close to the clothes so I can see the detail."
 
Glamorous and Cheering
 The clothes were down to earth, but not completely.
"Clothes have to be glamorous," Mr. Blass said. "People need a shot of glamour, and where are they going to get it if not from their clothes? The economy is gloomy. Most people are worried about their lives. They need something cheering."
His clothes were both classic and cheering. The tailored styles, verging on sportswear, were particularly appealing. They were not the tired old classic shapes: everything was reworked to a contemporary beat. The colors were spectacular, whether they were muted or vibrant. The black dresses were exciting, especially when they were long and tight.
"The extremely short dress can look boring," the designer said. "Long and tight is better. I think young women will accept it."
An exception to his short-is-boring observation is a little black dress cut exactly like the top of a pair of overalls, but with rhinestone buttons. Other short black dresses had laced effects at the shoulders, and an extended group of styles had black chiffon scarfs tacked around the skirt, dipping to different lengths and setting up a flurry of movement as the models walked.
A curved jacket with dolman sleeves was the key to many casual outfits. One of the best was in celadon green, with the jacket floating over a matching sweater and pants. Another paired a beige jacket with a long gray skinny skirt. The same gentle rounded outlines were repeated in knitted cardigans as part of the revitalized twin-sweater set.
Mr. Blass shows the twin set in innumerable ways, including tweedy patterns for day, with big skirts in matching green or red satin for evening. He is so intrigued by the sweater that he often just wraps it around the model's neck as a scarf.
 
A Subtle Color Sense
 Among the more subtle color combinations are the mauve jacket with brown lace blouse and brown herringbone trousers, and the grape skirt wrapped over blue-green satin for evening. Vibrant tweeds and plaids alternate with gray flannel for day.
The designer said the collection reflects "how I feel women should look now." It gives them a lot of leeway, but the emphasis is on the kind of American look with which he has long been associated.
The simplicity of the daytime clothes is complemented by the extravagance of some of the evening styles. Too much sobriety in fashion can indeed be boring. Mr. Blass keeps the mixture just right.
 
Herrera's Sense of Freedom
 Mrs. Herrera touched a lot of bases, but her major contribution to the season was a sense of freedom.
"You can mix anything together -- that's the modern way," she said after her show. That is why her finale consisted of elaborately embroidered jackets, all worn with gray flannel pants. Fake diamonds and emeralds were attached to these fitted jackets on a densely embroidered gold background, but the flannel pants gave them a throwaway look.
A red wool jeans jacket over black-and-white checked pants is another example of this anything-goes attitude. Animal patterns, including tiger and zebra stripes, are also embroidered in sequins and paired with a variety of tops, including bellhop jackets, velvet turtlenecks and fitted hip-length jackets in blending colors. All these have a contemporary feeling.
The designer can also be quite grand, as in a fitted gray-and-white jacket with a voluminous black velvet calf-length skirt, both reminiscent of Dior's New Look. A better version of the longer skirt for day is a simple double-breasted coat dress in Black Watch tartan.
There are plenty of short skirts and even more pants suits for both day and night. Her collection offers a neat, concise approach to fashion for the next cold-weather season.

HEADLINE: Mark Morris Returns, Buffeted but Unbowed

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Mark Morris, the bad boy of Belgian dance, has returned to New York, where he opens tonight in a two-week season at the Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street. The experiences of his two and a half years as the resident choreographer of the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie, the Belgian national opera house in Brussels, do not seem to have greatly changed him.
Mr. Morris was widely attacked by a press and public who had greatly revered Maurice Bejart, whom Mr. Morris succeeded at the theater at the invitation of its director, Gerard Mortier, an admirer of Mr. Morris's iconoclasm and his musicality.
 
Back Talk to the Belgians
 The young American choreographer, never one for undue reverence, responded in kind, outraging the Belgians further with outspoken views and flamboyant behavior. Mr. Bejart specialized in grand rituals danced by exotic, sleek performers. Mr. Morris's work was more cerebral, shaped in large part by the concert music to which it was set and danced by everyday-looking men and women of all shapes and sizes. 
 "It was on occasion dispiriting," said the 35-year-old Mr. Morris when asked about the Belgian experience in a recent interview. "The work process was fabulous. Other than that I was in my apartment or in a restaurant all the time, pretty much what I do here. But here there are options. Interesting people. The dancers in my company got better in Brussels. There was nothing else to do."
 
Back to Spontaneity
 He enjoyed having studios at his disposal, he said, and the freedom to work whenever he wanted in luxurious, free state-supported facilities of a sort unimaginable to American modern dance choreographers. "Right now," he said, "I'm renting a studio from American Ballet Theater for a shocking amount of money."
Working at the Monnaie gave him the chance to create "giant stuff." He had to learn to create his dances well in advance of their premieres. "I used to finish all my pieces five minutes before the curtain," Mr. Morris said. "Now I can do it again." And in the process of weathering the storm of bad publicity in Brussels, Mr. Morris said he had perhaps become a little more tactful. "I've never been a great diplomat," he said. "But I've decided now I'll avoid subjects. If someone asks me if Bejart is awful, then I'll say yes."
Mr. Morris has remained as free-spirited as ever. The first notice of his new performances appeared in the form of small, sober-looking newspaper advertisements for discounted tickets for students, the elderly and the unemployed. He chose the ballroom for its fine acoustics, funky atmosphere and "what it's not."
"It's not City Center and not the Joyce, or for that matter P.S. 122," he said. "It's not official dancedom." The theater will open an hour before each show for entertainment by Jay Bailey, a subway musician.
 
2 Programs of Diverse Dance
 The Mark Morris Dance Group will present two programs of dances that are, as Mr. Morris put it, "new to New York, new to me and ancient history." There will be two world premieres on the first program, both created during a recent residency at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. "Beautiful Day," a duet, is performed to an alto aria from a cantata variously attributed to J. S. Bach and Georg-Melchior Hoffmann. "Polka," a five-minute "jungle dance" for 16 performers, is set to new music for violin and piano by Lou Harrison.
The music for the first program, which runs through Saturday night, will be performed live by the Orchestra of St. Luke's. The second program, next Tuesday through Saturday, will have taped music. It includes Mr. Morris's early "Songs That Tell a Story" and his dark "Behemoth," one of three New York premieres in the season.
 
Fully Packed Schedule
 The company is booked for the next two years, including performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in December in "The Hard Nut," Mr. Morris's antic-sounding reworking of "The Nutcracker." He will continue to create dances for Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project. All that's missing to make life nearly perfect in New York, he said, is an apartment, a building with offices and studios for the 16-member company, a workout studio and "a theater I could use as my own."
He talked exuberantly of recent work he'd seen by Merce Cunningham and of his admiration for Yuriko and her coaching of the Martha Graham dancers. "We're totally responsible and professional and human," Mr. Morris said when asked about that exuberance. "It's the humane part that throws people off. If you have fun, you're not serious. And I think you have to be serious enough to have fun."

HEADLINE: Mayor's Film Office Is Losing Its Director

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Jaynne C. Keyes, the director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Television and Broadcasting, announced yesterday that she would leave her post on May 1 to begin work as an agent in the motion-picture and talent departments of the William Morris Agency in New York City.
Ms. Keyes is leaving the office in a time of uncertainty for the city's film industry, which is struggling to regain the business it lost in a boycott that stopped most filming in New York between November 1990 and mid-May 1991. During the boycott, the major studios filmed in Los Angeles or on location in cities like Chicago and Pittsburgh instead. New York also faces increasing competition from the South, where labor costs are far less than here because film workers there are not unionized. The mayor's film office estimates that filming brings as much as $3 billion a year to the city's economy. 
 At a time of steep budget cuts in other city agencies, Ms. Keyes managed to fend them off. The office's 1992 budget is just less than $600,000.
In nearly two and a half years as the director, Ms. Keyes has been credited by many film and television producers with bringing greater efficiency and a new sense of purpose to the film office, which issues more than 8,000 one-day permits in the course of a year for the location shooting of everything from big-budget feature films to music videos and fashion advertising.
 
Still a Busy Location
 In 1990, despite the boycott in the last two months of the year, New York had its busiest year ever as a filming location. The film office issued 123 permits for feature films and 598 for television, up from 110 and 414, respectively, the year before. So far this year, the office has issued 15 feature and 112 television permits.
To woo film production back to the city and broadcast the message of labor peace, Ms. Keyes traveled to Los Angeles last month with three of New York's film-union leaders for two major film-industry trade fairs.
"Last year we went to Cannes with Jaynne and brought back three independent projects that weren't going to come here," said Lou D'Agostino, executive director of the cinematographers' and script supervisors' unions in the city. "This was during the boycott, and it helped keep some of our members working."
Mr. D'Agostino said the three films encouraged nine other independent producers to film in New York.
 
Thanks From the Mayor
 In her letter of resignation, which was delivered to Mayor David N. Dinkins on Friday, Ms. Keyes thanked the mayor for his "support and warmth" and offered to help in the search for a successor.
In a letter written the same day, the mayor said that "the city will be losing the services of a hard-working, effective and talented employee: a public servant in the best sense of the words."
Referring to her handling of the boycott, the Mayor wrote: "Not only were you able to withstand the storm, you were instrumental in turning the tide and the future of the industry in the city is much brighter as a result."
In a telephone interview, Ms. Keyes said she was offered her new job by Johnnie Planco, the head of the William Morris Agency's motion-picture and talent departments.
"I had never thought of being an agent," Ms. Keyes said, "but someone close to me said, 'Jaynne, I don't know why you find this surprising. You've been an agent all along for the state and the city.' The more I thought about it, the more attractive it seemed."
Ms. Keyes worked for the state film office for six years before becoming director of the mayor's film office in January 1990.
 
Cutting the Red Tape
 Alan Kannof, the Morris agency's chief operating officer in New York, said Ms. Keyes would be signing and representing motion picture writers and directors, for the most part, as well as actors. Ms. Keyes said her salary at William Morris would be more than the $78,000 she earns as director of the film office. "But you know what's wonderful?" she added. "I don't have to tell what it is, for the first time in 12 years."
Several film producers and union leaders expressed regret at Ms. Keyes's resignation. "What I liked about Jaynne was she pulled no punches; she said it the way she saw it," said Mac Brown, associate producer and production manager for the Universal Pictures film "Scent of a Woman," which finished location shooting in New York yesterday. "She was able to cut through the red tape immediately. That kind of a personality was very good for New York."
"If she'd resigned a year ago, it would have been worse," he added. "She was instrumental in getting us back on track. I'll miss her."
If Mayor Dinkins does not choose a new director by April 30, Ms. Keyes said, her deputy, Nina Streich, will be named acting director.

N.H.L. Board Refuses to Vote on Proposal

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
The National Hockey League team owners refused to vote on a new proposal by the players yesterday and said they would offer a proposal of their own today in an effort to end the players' strike.
Bob Goodenow, executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association, said yesterday's developments were "in one sense a disappointment" because he had hoped for a solution to the strike, which began last Wednesday and threatens the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
 "There are six or seven issues that haven't been tied down," Goodenow said in a news conference at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. "The owners had the opportunity to end this strike today and they chose to come up with a new proposal. We really feel we're at the end of the line as far as what we are able to do."
Two of the major issues remaining to be settled are distribution of revenue from trading cards and length of a new collective bargaining agreement. In addition, both sides indicated that a free-agency formula that was thought to have been decided was a renewed subject of debate.
 
'Crucial Issue Not Playoffs'
 John Ziegler, president of the N.H.L., speaking after a meeting of the league's board of governors, said that the players' proposal "wasn't high-octane gas" and added that "the crucial issue is not the playoffs.
"What really is before us is will this business survive as we have known it?" Ziegler said in a news conference at the Plaza Hotel. "The restructuring must take place immediately. One of the problems we've had in dealing with the association is a refusal to face the economics."
The owners say they will lose $9 million this season after making $125 million in the previous three seasons. The union says the owners will make $24 million.
The players say the trading-card issue is crucial. According to figures released by the league yesterday, the players will get between $11 million and $12 million this year and the owners will get $8 million as their share. Although the money has never before been the subject of collective bargaining, the owners say it now must be.
 
Proposal for 3-Year Deal
 On Sunday night, the players said they had answered a major owner demand by offering to accept a three-year contract, including the current season, with the possibility of a re-opener after one more season if certain, unspecified economic conditions existed.
Ziegler said yesterday that the re-opener clause was "really kind of fictitious."
When the strike began, Ziegler resumed discussions with Goodenow. Missing from those talks was William Wirtz, the owner of the Chicago Blackhawks who is the chairman of the board of governors and the co-chairman, along with Ziegler, of the negotiating committee.
Wirtz was in the Bahamas, where he spoke by telephone to criticize Goodenow, charging that Goodenow miscalculated in leading the players into a strike. Ziegler said the issue of Wirtz's absence was "a bogeyman" and that he talks by phone with Wirtz once or twice a day.
 
Gretzky Joins Discussions
 Meanwhile, Goodenow brought to New York his nine-player negotiating committee and the representatives of all 22 teams. Goodenow said the group would meet last night at a Manhattan hotel. Also joining the discussions was Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings, who is not a negotiator or a player representative, but is one of the most talented and respected performers in the sport.
Mike Gartner, the player representative of the Rangers, asked if he thinks the owners sincerely want to end the strike, replied: "I think there are definitely some owners concerned to get this done and getting on with the playoffs. I hope they are in a majority."
When the negotiations began, many players said the primary goal was increased free-agent mobility. Since then, the players have given in on most demands. Owners have sought greater control by trying to add to the contract the right to match contract offers given to free-agent players like Brendan Shanahan, who moved last year from the Devils to St. Louis.
Under the new formula, the former team could keep such a player by matching his new salary offer.
 
Savard 'Very Confident'
 "The players feel we have gone far enough, in most respects, probably too far," Gartner said.
If there is no solution today, Gartner said, "I don't see what can be accomplished."
Asked how long the strike could go on, Gartner said, "We look at it as a worst-case scenario, possibly not playing until next fall, if then."
A more optimistic note was sounded by Serge Savard, general manager of the Montreal Canadiens. "I think the playoffs will go on, I'm very confident," Savard said. "But my confidence level could change."
Ziegler said there was a "clear and present danger of their being no completion to the 75th-anniversary season."

HEADLINE: Into the Fire in Peru

 BODY:
Latin Americans call it an "autogolpe," a self-coup. On Sunday night Peru's President, Alberto Fujimori, dissolved congress, suspended the Constitution and the judiciary and began rounding up his critics. Military leaders are cooperating in this assault on democracy and human rights.
The hemisphere's democracies need to respond swiftly and vigorously -- with diplomatic ostracism, economic sanctions and support for those whose life and liberty are threatened. 
 In recent years Peru has seemed all but ungovernable. Its Indian and mestizo majority bridle at domination by Spanish-descended whites; fighting between the army and bloodthirsty Shining Path guerrillas has killed 25,000; and coca leaf has become the most dynamic element in a weak economy, spreading violence and corruption.
Peruvians have been frustrated to see frightened judges release Shining Path prisoners. President Fujimori, who lacks a congressional majority, has been frustrated to see legislators overturn his economic and national security decrees.
But that was hardly justification for a coup. After all, it was congress that gave Mr. Fujimori his decree authority, and many of its objections to his specific measures were justified. For example, he authorized the army to commandeer people and resources almost without restriction. And he outlawed reporting on "secret documents," without specifying what those might be.
By lashing out against democracy, President Fujimori destroys his most potent weapon against guerrillas, generals and drug dealers: his constitutional legitimacy. The former presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa, who ran against Mr. Fujimori but shares many of his goals, denounces this rupture of legality and warns of danger to other Latin democracies.
Strong action on Peru is imperative, for the sake of the hemisphere. Similar problems trouble Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador, though in milder form. The leaders of these countries have resisted dictatorial temptations, but events in Lima could give their generals dangerous ideas.
At a minimum, the Organization of American States needs to withhold recognition from the new regime, suspend economic links and demand the release of nonviolent detainees. The U.S. rightly treats this "autogolpe" like an open military coup, suspending all but humanitarian assistance.
America's principles and interests coincide in this case. The best hope for containing the Shining Path, combating drug traffic and sustaining democracy lies in an early return to lawful rule in Peru.

HEADLINE: For Russia, Reforms Without Aid Will Fail

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Doug Bandow (Op-Ed, March 26) and Leslie Gelb (column, March 30) offer useful cautions about financial assistance to Russia, but are seriously off base in their analyses and data. They both claim that Russia has squandered huge sums of Western aid in the last two years ($44 billion in 1991, according to Mr. Bandow; $50 billion in the last 20 months, according to Mr. Gelb). A response to both is in order in view of International Monetary Fund approval of Russia's economic reform plan (front page, April 1) and the Bush Administration's move to join a seven-nation fund to aid Russia (front page, April 2).
Mr. Gelb writes that "the money has virtually disappeared without a trace." In fact, the $50 billion is a mirage, though an understandable one. According to European Economic Community data, the former Soviet Union received commitments of assistance of $52.6 billion in 1990 and 1991. Only $28 billion of that was disbursed, and the I.M.F. estimates that only about $15.6 billion of what the Soviet Union received went to Russia (the rest went to the other republics). Russia also had to make huge payments of interest and principal on accumulated debt, which in 1990-91 came to $15.5 billion, of which about $13.1 billion was actually paid. 
 Overall, almost no resources came to Russia in 1990-91, after taking account of debt payments. Money was surely squandered, but by the Communist regime over a much longer period as foreign debt built up. By 1990-91, new loans to Russia were covering the service payments on the old debts that the Communists had incurred. Russia's new democracy is at risk of being throttled by the old Communist misdeeds.
In 1990-91, Russia's energy export earnings collapsed (because of a collapse of oil production), and so did earnings on other exports to Eastern Europe. The result has been a balance-of-payments crisis and a precipitous fall of crucially needed imports, which has left Russia's new democratic government in peril. Imports fell from about $82 billion in 1990 to $44 billion in 1991, and import levels remain very low this year. The result has been an intense shortage of foods, medicines, spare parts and raw materials to keep factories going, and machinery needed for restructuring.
Russia's reform program, carried out with the International Monetary Fund, offers the most promising way out. The I.M.F. has identified Russia's urgent needs in 1992, and the Group of Seven has responded with emergency financing to cover them. Even with this financing, the squeeze on the Russian economy will remain severe.
Mr. Bandow overstates his condemnation of I.M.F.-supervised programs. The I.M.F. has played a key role in the first stages of Eastern Europe's market reforms and a valuable role in such Latin American successes as Bolivia, Chile and Mexico.
Mr. Bandow quotes me as writing that "most I.M.F. programs are now honored in the breach." This was written in 1989, and my point then was nearly opposite that of Mr. Bandow. I was stressing that I.M.F. programs work only when accompanied by adequate financial support. Also, inadequate attention was then being given to debt reduction.
Aid without reform would be wasted, but reforms without aid would likely fail. The I.M.F. program worked out with Russia can succeed, now that it appears likely that the West will support Russia with the same vigor as Boris N. Yeltsin's Government is pursuing economic reforms.

HEADLINE: For Russia, Reforms Without Aid Will Fail;
Opportunity Knocks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a blueprint for immediate or long-range United States policy toward Russia, "Let Germany Do It" (Op-Ed, March 21) by Robert G. Livingston is negative and misguided. Mr. Livingston's argument that the interests of the United States in Russia are far less than those of Germany revives the specter of isolationism.
The future of our country and the well-being of our people demand the same risk taking that led Yankee traders to open the markets of Japan and China in the 19th century. We are in grave danger of losing out to the entrepreneurs not only of Germany but also of Japan, Italy, South Korea and other countries. 
 Mr. Livingston states, "German businessmen, bankers and officials understand Russia's needs far better than we do." If so, the prescription for the future is not retreat, but acceleration of knowledge and involvement with Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
No country on earth has done even remotely what ours has done to bring about the events that make the former Soviet republics a potential source of strong, vigorous and close economic, political and social relationship. Several generations of Americans since 1945 have made economic sacrifices, and some have shed blood, to counter the political system that locked the former Soviet Union in an inhumane, incentiveless and ultimately unproductive condition. To advocate that we allow the fruits of the final triumph of our values, as that success was so vividly displayed in the events of 1989-91, to be carried off by other Western countries represents a betrayal of the last 45 years of our history.

HEADLINE: Resume Writers Can Read Between the Lines;
An Early Barometer of Trouble, and Then a Sympathetic Ear

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Nowhere perhaps is there a more accurate barometer of the economy than in the offices of those who write resumes for a living. They offer walking case studies of the psychology of coping with a faltering economy and provide early warning signs of industries going bad.
Stan Wynett said he did not need to read the newspapers to find out whose company is on the verge of financial collapse. Mr. Wynett said their employees drifted into his cluttered office on the 10th floor of a building on Madison Avenue. 
 Mr. Wynett said he had smelled trouble at Macy nine months before it declared bankruptcy. High-ranking executives came in first, followed by lower-echelon workers, with at least 12 people in all.
Mr. Wynett also sensed clues of hard times ahead when a stream of fresh clients preceded the Bonwit Teller closing and the major layoffs in 1990 at Citicorp and Chase Manhattan.
"Gulls can sense a storm from afar, and resume writers can sense calamity before it strikes," he said. "If you get enough customers coming through, you can tell."
Like many other resume writers, Mr. Wynett said, he had watched his service evolve into something more than the dispassionate high-volume work that has traditionally consisted of repackaging careers in crisp persuasive packages and checking for dotted i's and bad grammar.
"I try digging into their past and making them aware of the things they have done that are appreciated by employers," he said. "A word of confidence goes a long way. Some are so melancholy, they make you feel melancholy."
Sometimes, resume writers have felt compelled to offer more than soothing words.
Peter Newfield, a resume writer in Westchester County, was recently drawn into the life of a senior executive who had grown increasingly despondent over his layoff from a major company. Mr. Newfield tracked down the executive's synagogue and called the rabbi to suggest that the rabbi counsel the executive.
"His confidence was shattered," said Mr. Newfield, who is managing partner of Career Resources, which has several offices. "He started dressing disheveled. If he left the office, he would sit in the car. There are people out there who are absolutely distraught, and they don't know where to turn."
Mr. Newfield said he learned that the executive, a middle-age man with children, was eventually treated for depression. But for other resume writers, the outcomes of many of their customers' lives remain mysteries.
Dealing with out-of-work clients can be uncomfortable, as well as rewarding. David Rothman, a resume writer in midtown, has found that his clients can be "very demanding, cranky, combative."
"It really drives me nuts," said Mr. Rothman, who manages the Career Pro resume service. "I tell them to have a positive attitude, and it would help to lighten up a little. 'Who's going to hire you if you're in a bad mood?' "
But keeping a positive attitude is not all that easy for resume writers. Despite the thousands of workers out of jobs, these are not the best of times for resume services, which flourished along with other parts of the economy in the mid-80's. There was an explosion of resume services with the advent of desktop publishing. The changes attracted entrepreneurs, secretaries and writers. Employers also were in a frenzy to hire. And many resume customers felt economically secure enough to look elsewhere for jobs.
 
Free for Direst Cases
 But now calls to resume services in the Yellow Pages are often met with a disconnect message because soaring advertising costs and tighter consumer budgets have driven scores of services out of business. Even so, the hard-luck stories of the recession's victims have led some resume writers to offer free resumes for the direst cases.
"It's almost becoming like law firms, with some doing pro bono work," said Frank Fox, executive director of the Professional Association of Resume Writers in St. Petersburg, Fla. The group has 600 members.
"They feel like they're making a contribution to someone who needs a helping hand," Mr. Fox said.
How far that help should go is a topic of debate. Niel Carey, head of the National Career Development Association in Alexandria, Va., said: "There are some emotional or mental-health issues involved in getting work or not getting a job and the frustration of being turned down. People who are not qualified at it can exacerbate the problem to a considerable degree."
But such matters seem only fine points to those who are desperate to find work. John Tyburski, 27, who was recently laid off by an auto dealer in Rockland County, said he needed a resume right away, but received something more when he turned to Career Resources in Tarrytown.
"I'm not the type of person who worries, but this is a tough one," Mr. Tyburski said. "It's good to speak with someone who can relate to where you're coming from."

HEADLINE: Corruption and Cocaine in Peru

BYLINE: By Stephen G. Trujillo; Stephen G. Trujillo, a former Army Ranger and Green Beret, is writing a book about his experiences with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Peru. The views expressed in this article are his own.

 BODY:
I was an adviser to the Peruvian drug police in 1990 in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, where most of the world's cocaine originates. As an enforcement specialist with the Drug Enforcement Administration's Operation Snowcap, I helped the Peruvian police seize smugglers' planes, raid cocaine labs, destroy illegal airfields and disrupt drug mafias known as firmas.
Despite the war on drugs, coca production was not leveling off, Maoist Shining Path guerrillas were extending control over the Upper Huallaga Valley and corrupt Peruvian Army elements increasingly thwarted us. And corruption was creeping into the ranks of the Peruvian drug police, the main U.S. ally in the drug war. 
 The morass in Peru only worsened, as Shining Path continued to make inroads, the economy disintegrated and the destabilizing effect of the cocaine trade became more and more acute. These factors paved the way for yesterday's crackdown -- which amounted to a right-wing military coup -- by President Alberto Fujimori, who suspended the constitution with the army's backing. Besides the reality of localized military collusion with the traffickers, top officers were accused of narco-corruption by journalists and opposition politicians.
Where does this leave the U.S. and the war on drugs in Peru? First, let's consider where things stand now.
The drug war in Peru has long been paralyzed by the Peruvian Government's inability to control its own army. The traffickers have forged relationships with senior army officers who do not see cocaine as a threat to national security.
Though cultivation leveled off last year in the Upper Huallaga Valley, fungal blight, not counter-narcotics campaigns, was the cause. Up to 380,000 inhabitants of the valley are engaged in the cocaine industry. Meanwhile, cultivation has been increasing elsewhere in Peru and the rest of the Andean region.
Eradication, crop substitution and even interdiction efforts have failed to disrupt the flow of cocaine to the U.S. Though the Andean Strategy, as the U.S. blueprint is known, has dedicated more than half its five-year $2.2 billion budget to economic measures, most of Peru's allotment has gone to banks to pay interest on its $18 billion debt. Meanwhile, smuggling from the Upper Huallaga Valley has continued unhindered: barely a dozen of the hundreds of drug flights were diverted last year.
The Peruvian drug police and D.E.A. agents operating out of the Santa Lucia base, a U.S.-financed counternarcotics bastion in the heart of cocaine country, have so far avoided frequent combat against Shining Path guerrillas. But limited moves against cocaine laboratories have resulted in clashes: the guerrillas claim they shot down a U.S. helicopter, which crashed in January killing two American pilots and a mechanic; the rebels harassed the Santa Lucia base last summer with small-arms fire, and tried one full-scale attack a year ago that halted all operations for weeks.
Paradoxically, the destruction of dozens of cocaine labs by U.S. and Peruvian forces has only encouraged the coca processors to be more efficient. Smaller, more decentralized labs are processing purer cocaine deeper in the impenetrable jungles. Many more are hidden in wild coca towns protected by the Peruvian Army, where the Peruvian police and D.E.A. teams cannot operate.
The traffickers of the firmas forged relationships with senior army officers after the Upper Huallaga Valley was first declared an emergency zone. Tensions worsened between the police and army, with confrontations endangering D.E.A. agents rising in frequency.
On June 15, 1990, three other D.E.A. advisers and I accompanied the drug police to Tocache, north of the Santa Lucia base. Hovering over the municipal airfield in our helicopters, we caught soldiers red-handed as they transferred a load of refined cocaine to a stash house. We landed and chased the fleeing soldiers back to their barracks, only to be surrounded by the remainder of the garrison. The soldiers raised their assault rifles, and their commander ordered us to surrender our weapons. Only the adroit diplomacy of the senior D.E.A. agent saved us.
I survived several other confrontations with Peruvian soldiers who were guarding stash houses, airfields and aircraft used by traffickers. I owe them my gray hairs.
The threshold of actual violence has been crossed. Army units have fired on U.S. helicopters. The former political military commander of the zone, Gen. Alberto Arcinieta Huby, sent a Soviet-made Hip helicopter to menace the base in January 1990. He was angered by repeated police incursions into Uchiza, where he had relocated his headquarters.
The Peruvian Army dominates Uchiza, a bustling city dedicated to the export of unrefined cocaine. The going rate for protecting a planeload of cocaine is about $20,000. A conservative estimate of 15 to 25 flights a week at the Uchiza airfield adds up to at least $20 million a year. A more likely range is $35 million to $50 million. When I was there in December 1990, Peruvian Army commanders and city authorities, who included men affiliated with the powerful Vaticano cocaine mafia and Shining Path, divided up this revenue. This collusion occurs in other towns, too.
The dream of halting drug trafficking in Peru, not to mention stabilizing the country, was fading fast, even before yesterday's crackdown. My contacts in the drug police confirm that corruption in their ranks is rising. I understand that the military leaders in Uchiza recently welcomed one commander from the drug police at the Santa Lucia base to their conspiracy. While few Americans work at Santa Lucia, D.E.A. agents based there on temporary tours are at greater risk than ever.
If corruption among the Peruvian police reaches the point where agents cannot safely sleep in their quarters, then construction of the $50 million installation will have been in vain. As it is, security is barely adequate to protect Americans from guerrillas and traffickers.
The Peruvian military has always been uncooperative in fighting cocaine trafficking, and if the grip of yesterday's coup remains tight, the drug war in Peru may be essentially over. The U.S., by committing itself half-heartedly in Peru, now appears to have missed its chance, at least in the near future, to make any difference at all. Now I fear for the safety of the honest police I shared risk with so many times.
Given the events of yesterday, it is clear that even a huge escalation of current efforts might have failed. Maybe no amount of aid would have been adequate to buy the fealty of those who profit from narcotics trafficking. We would have to have been prepared to stay for the long haul, 10 years at least.
We may have missed our opportunity in Peru. The military-backed Government may seek to involve the U.S. more directly in the counter-insurgency against Shining Path. We must remain engaged in Peru. But the generals have to be told that U.S. aid will not be forthcoming unless democracy is restored.
Our vices are the cause of great suffering in Peru. We must fight cocaine at the source, in my estimation, but we must do so with more sensitivity to the crisis confronting Peru.

HEADLINE: Lawyers Say U.S. Has Lost Haitian Refugee Files

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Lawyers representing Haitian refugees held at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo, Cuba, have told a Federal judge that more than 50 Haitians who qualified to apply for asylum may have been returned to Haiti mistakenly, and that the records of at least 2,500 refugees had been lost through computer errors or poor record-keeping.
A Congressional report, to be made public Thursday, is expected to include similar findings. 
 Immigration officials, acknowledging there may have been errors in record-keeping, say they are working under under extreme pressure from both refugee organizations, which want more Haitians admitted to the United States, and the Bush Administration, which wants fewer. The Administration argues that most Haitians are economic migrants, not victims of political persecution.
The Federal judge, Sterling Johnson Jr. of the United States District Court in Brooklyn, has twice ruled -- most recently on Monday -- that the Haitians at Guantanamo have the right to legal counsel, and that none of those conditionally qualified for asylum may be interviewed further without access to legal assistance.
The Administration, which is expected to appeal the ruling, says that Guantanamo is not United States territory and that foreigners held there do not enjoy legal protections available in this country and its territories. The Navy base is on land leased from Cuba.
Lawyers from the Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale and from the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, who brought a class action suit on behalf of the Haitians, discovered the confusion in record-keeping when they interviewed immigration officials at Guantanamo.
More than 18,000 Haitians have been picked up at sea by the Coast Guard since the overthrow of the Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Sept. 30. Virtually all of the 3,296 who remain at Guantanamo have been judged by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to have credible claims to a full hearing on asylum in the United States.
Nearly 10,000 Haitians have been sent back to Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, and another 4,149 have been allowed to enter the United States to apply formally for asylum.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service says the rate at which Haitians are being judged to have credible claims to asylum -- 34 percent -- is extraordinarily high.
Some delays may have been caused by confusion caused by raw data kept by the I.N.S., the military and other organizations. Of the 2,500 files that were lost at one point, only 1,080 could be recreated, and the rest of the Haitians had to be interviewed anew, an asylum official told Michael Ratner, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights.

HEADLINE: Peru Chief Orders New Mass Arrests

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 7

 BODY:
Following up his seizure of broad powers, President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru moved swiftly today, ordering the roundup of more politicians and labor leaders and sending troops to prisons where terrorist suspects are confined. He also signed sweeping decrees to give the Government of National Reconstruction he had proclaimed a semblance of a legal framework.
But in an effort to quiet growing international protests over what many here were calling a civilian-military coup, Mr. Fujimori ordered the withdrawal of military and police forces from television, radio and newspaper offices. They were sent there on Monday when Mr. Fujimori, with the consent of the armed forces, assumed virtual dictatorial powers. 
 Close associates of the President further sought to mollify foreign critics by telling ambassadors that all but a few of the detained politicians would be released in two weeks and that plebiscites would soon be held to measure the extent of public support for the actions.
The authorities also released Gustavo Gorriti, an internationally known journalist and expert on the Shining Path guerrilla group. Mr. Gorriti, the author of a three-volume study of the Maoist movement, was seized along with his files and computer records soon after Mr. Fujimori suspended constitutional rule, asserting a need to curb Shining Path's activities more aggressively..
"Initially, there has been a lack of understanding on the international level," President Fujimori said at a Cabinet meeting late on Monday, adding, "This is basically due to incomplete information about the measures the Government will take."
Late this afternoon,Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller outlined a timetable for the creation of a "new Peruvian republic."
 
Ambitious Schedule Outlined
 Within six months, he said at a news briefing, the Government intends to have drafted a new Constitution, and a plebiscite will be held within 12 to 18 months to vote on the Constitution.
Mr. Blacker Miller said President Fujimori would "name" a new Congress but gave no indication when.
He also said Mr. Fujimori would not stay in power past the expiration of his term on July 28, 1995.
Still, international protests mounted. Argentina recalled its Ambassador and the United States froze all except humanitarian aid, cutting off assistance projected at $275 million this fiscal year. White House officials said about $45 million in the pipeline from 1991 would also be affected. Japan protested Mr. Fujimori's actions, and Germany said it would reconsider a $161 million aid program.
The loss of the aid could be devastating for Peru. To make things more ominous, officials of the Organization of American States have been debating whether to order some form of sanctions against Peru, a move that could cripple an already weak economy.
On Sunday night, in a national address, Mr. Fujimori dissolved Congress, took control of the judiciary and suspended the Constitution. He contended that Congress was hindering economic reforms and that the judiciary was corrupt and impeding the fight against terrorism.
One of the mysteries that remain unresolved was the fate of Alan Garcia, the former President and the leader of the main political opposition to Mr Fujimori, the Apra party. On Sunday night, troops surrounded Mr. Garcia's house in the Chacarilla section of Lima.
At first it was thought he was under house arrest. "But he escaped just at the last minute and is in hiding," said one of Mr. Garcia's closest aides, who insisted on not being identified. "None of us know where he is. He will wait and slowly build a political counter-force to Fujimori."
Mr. Garcia was President from 1985 to 1990. His administration ended in disgrace, with inflation rising exponentially during his term. Last year, he was investigated after members of Congress accused him of illegally enriching himself while in office. The Supreme Court, most members of which he had appointed, cleared him on all the accusations.
In the last few months, he has mounted intense opposition to Mr. Fujimori's policies.
 
President's Actions Endorsed
 The President, in an interview while walking in downtown Lima to assess the effects of his actions on the public, said Mr. Garcia and other top Apra officials would not be released quickly. He did not clarify whether Mr. Garcia was in custody.
Two days after the seizure of power, in which Mr. Fujimori had the express backing of the military and the police, tanks, personnel carriers and soldiers were deployed outside the Congress building and the Palace of Justice.
Today, those willing to respond to reporters' questions for the most part endorsed the President's actions.
"We support what the President did because he is working for the people," said Alberto Montero, a chauffeur. "The members of Congress are crying now because they are out of power, but where were they when we were crying for help."
The Fujimori Government's strategy now seems to be twofold: to neutralize the power of Apra -- at least four of the party's leaders are under arrest and warrants are out for others -- and to move decisively against Shining Path.
A tense scene prevailed today at the Castro-Castro maximum-security prison in Canot Grando, a shanytown outside Lima. At dawn, 500 soldiers and policemen took up positions outside the prison, which houses 450 men and 180 women suspected of being Shining Path members. They live in two cellblocks and control all activities there. The authorities fear weapons and lethal material like acid might be concealed in the cellblocks.
Troops were also stationed outside the Lurigancho Prison half a mile away, where some three dozen guerrillas are being held.
The scenes were reminiscent of June 27, 1986, when a strike by jailed terrorists ended in a massacre of 300 in Lurigancho and El Fronton prisons.
But the actions have yet to stop the killing by the guerrilla group. This afternoon, terrorists assumed to be Shining Path members killed a Peruvian businessman, and on Monday morning two policemen were gunned down.
 
Lawyers Reported Seized
 The country's secret service also appeared to be rounding up people suspected of either sympathizing with the Shining Path or having knowledge of its activities. Three men who identified themselves as members of the Association of Democratic Lawyers, which defends people accused of subversion, said that five of the group's leaders had been taken from their homes by the police since Sunday night.
Officials at the United States Embassy continued to express anger today about the actions taken by Mr. Fujimori, especially since they occurred on the day that Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, arrived in Lima for talks with President Fujimori. Mr. Aronson canceled his meeting and left for Washington on Monday night.
Late Monday, President Fujimori swore in a new Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Oscar de la Puente. Its first act was to adopt a resolution creating a legal framework for the new Government. It then declared the legislative branch dissolved until an election could be held. It also ratified the complete reordering of the judiciary.
Government officials said the Justice Minister would soon begin removing judges and prosecuting attorneys and appointing new judges.
Most newspapers, radio stations and news weeklies had been either censored or placed under military observation, but by late today, most of those practices appeared to have ended. Still, many Peruvian journalists expressed concern that the intimidation would lead to self-censorship.
Members of the dissolved Congress continued to protest. "This is nothing less than an outright coup," said Pedro Cateriano, a member of Congress's lower house, "and if we do not remove President Fujimori, we will be put back into the days of dictatorship."
When several legislators tried to meet at the Lima Law Association on Monday, they encountered police officers who reportedly roughed up some of them.
So far those known to be under either house arrest or in jail include Felipe Osterling, president of the Senate; Roberto Ramirez de Villar, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and other members of Congress.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
The Voters' Message: Very Murky
Results Show Unhappiness With Choices

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
Maybe it was foreordained. Two weeks of tumult -- two weeks of accusation and denial, heckling, shouting, frustration and fury, mostly in the streets and television studios of New York City -- produced far more color than clarity, and the New York Presidential primary sent a very murky message.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas won tidily enough here, but he failed to pull completely free of his competition, both active and passive. He had hoped to make his nomination seem inevitable once again, as it had seemed to most prominent Democratic politicians only a few weeks ago, but yesterday a solid majority of New Yorkers voted against him, and about half of that group voted for a man with a suspended candidacy, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts.
 
Wanted: Another Candidate
 Almost two-thirds of those who cast Democratic primary ballots, according to a survey of voters leaving their polling places, said they wished that candidates other than Mr. Clinton and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California were running. 
 In a state that the Democrats consider absolutely essential to their chances of recapturing the White House in November, those figures offered encouragement principally to George Bush and the Republicans, and perhaps also to backers of Ross Perot, the potential independent candidate. Like random interviews with voters upstate and down in the days before the balloting, the actual returns painted a tableau of sharp dissatisfaction.
"The turnout numbers -- low -- and the Tsongas numbers -- high -- mean trouble," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in a telephone interview. "The campaign isn't working. There's no clear message. The voters hear the captain and officers and the crew squabbling, and they aren't impressed with our ship."
Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who went through all this in 1984, said in an interview from New Orleans, where he was making a speech, that Mr. Clinton's performances in New York, Kansas and Wisconsin "aren't decisive enough to end this nightmare."
"Brown is a battering ram, not a nominee, but he may be able to make the nomination worthless," he said. "Clinton is still our likely candidate, but all we're doing is beating him up, not giving him time to rest, polish his program and raise money. Here we go again. There's got to be a lot of joy in the White House tonight."
But it is also true that Mr. Clinton, determined if battered, won 40 percent of New York's delegates yesterday, about the same share of Wisconsin's, and most of those chosen in Kansas. If he keeps doing that well -- and there is not much reason to think he will do worse -- he will arrive at the convention with something over 1,700 pledged delegates. And in the normal course of events he would pick up the rest of the 2,144 he needs from superdelegates, who are top elected Democratic officials and other party dignitaries.
Mr. Clinton brushed aside the negative aspects of his showing, including his tight battle with Mr. Brown in Wisconsin. Last night, in a victory statement, he spoke as if he were already the nominee -- indeed, already the President -- talking about his differences with Mr. Bush and how he planned to change life in the United States.
 
What About Brown?
 The case is harder to make for Mr. Brown, even though he came closer to Mr. Clinton than anyone had thought possible before he won the Connecticut primary two weeks ago. New York was where he had promised to prove his insurgent effort an irresistible force, and he worked much harder here and spent far more on television than anywhere else. Still, he could not defeat Mr. Clinton here in New York; in fact, he could not even overcome the ghostly semi-candidate, Mr. Tsongas.
Only in Wisconsin, where he reassembled some elements of the old LaFollette Progressive coalition, did the combative Californian live up to his own expectations.
Ever resilient, Mr. Brown insisted that his remained "a powerful movement" that could still reshape American politics. Like Mr. Clinton, he said he would soon join workers on the Caterpillar picket lines in Peoria, Ill., in a clear bid to increase his support among trade union members and other blue-collar voters. Mr. Tsongas, who opposes legislation that would bar hiring permanent replacements for strikers, would find such a trip difficult.
Much of the attention will turn in the next few days to the superdelegates. Among them are many lawmakers on Capitol Hill who fear for their political lives because of the anti-incumbent mood in the nation and because they worry that the name at the top of their ticket will be weak. So there will be many more meetings like the one last week in the office of Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona in which he and other lawmakers discussed what if anything could be done about the Presidential situation in their party.
A group of top party fund-raisers, including Nathan Landow, the Maryland chairman, who has supported Mr. Tsongas in the past, were among those planning to confer later this week.
Of the many options under discussion, a draft of Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas is perhaps the most frequently mentioned, on the ground that he is at least known to the nation as the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1988. For his part, Mr. Bentsen continues to say that drafts are something that happen every year in the National Football League and seldom in politics.
The reality is that the nascent Anyone But Clinton movement lacks a horse that is eager to run.
Those who hope for a deadlocked convention that would turn to someone else, because they consider Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown unelectable, must persuade many of the superdelegates to withhold their support. And to do that, they must make the case that their party could actually win with a nominee who sidestepped the primaries and lacks the legitimacy of voter approval.
Unless, of course, Mr. Tsongas gets back into the race, which one of his advisers said last night was "at least a 70-30 shot," and somehow manages to do better than he did before he dropped out. But surveys in New York showed the same weakness among blue-collar voters in this state that crippled him in Michigan and Illinois.
Furthermore, a revived Tsongas campaign would be short on money for television advertising, which matters in big states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and California, whose primaries lie ahead. The former Senator would also be handicapped by his lack of effective organizations in the key states.
But Ted Van Dyk, a Democratic strategist who is urging Mr. Tsongas to re-enter the contest, insisted that "the New York results show that there's a will in the party to reject Bill Clinton, if they show anything at all." Mr. Tsongas himself, speaking shortly before midnight, sounded uncertain despite finishing an astounding second in New York.
The next major test comes in Pennsylvania, which has voted a lot like New York in past Democratic primaries. The news media are not so brash, the ethnic mix is not so rich, but the parallels are there.
Mr. Clinton hired as his chief strategist James Carville, the man who helped Senator Harris Wofford upset a Republican in Pennsylvania last year in the race to succeed the late Senator John Heinz. Mr. Clinton leads in the early polls, and under the proportional system the Democrats use to allocate delegates, he most likely will get a healthy share of the state's 169 delegates even if he should lose in the April 28 primary.
But in Pennsylvania as in New York, there is serious dissatisfaction.
Gov. Robert P. Casey has expressed considerable displeasure with Mr. Clinton's campaign, and a few days ago he told The Associated Press, "Bush is trying to hand us the election, and we're trying to hand it back."
Mr. Brown will try to tap the resentment of unemployed workers in the Allegheny and Monongahela valleys near Pittsburgh, as he appealed to threatened auto workers in Detroit. Because there are relatively few Jewish voters in Pennsylvania, he will not have to face there the conundrum he faced in New York, where his endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson as a possible running mate appeared to help him among blacks and hurt him seriously among Jews.
Looking farther down the road, the Brown campaign believes it can continue to live off the land, spending comparatively little and figuring to peak in California's primary on June 2. The seriousness of the threat he poses in that state, with its huge prize of 348 delegates, is suggested by reports that Phil Angelides, the state chairman, would like to have his organization break precedent by endorsing Mr. Clinton to avoid another punishing battle.

HEADLINE: Iran's Candidates Share Theme: U.S. Is the Enemy

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, April 7

 BODY:
In a fluorescent-lighted mosque down a dark, narrow alley in the midst of the greengrocers' stalls of south Teheran, three candidates for Parliament are campaigning. They do not kiss babies or shake hands or make promises. Rather, they sit cross-legged on a cold, damp floor covered with dusty carpets, sipping tea and fielding the questions from a group of 30 men who have come to hear them.
"What about all we hear about the luxurious lives of some Government officials?" said one man, asking a question often raised in a country where reports of official corruption are spreading and the unofficial inflation rate is 50 percent. Without mentioning names, the questioner asserted that Hojatolislam Mehdi Karudi, Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, had spent 200 million rials -- close to $150,000 -- on his daughter's wedding. 
 "It burns me," the young man said, "when I don't even have 100,000 rials to get married."
 
Parties Banned in '87
 The candidate's answer was predictable, if a bit off the point.
"The United States is the enemy which wants to destroy us all and dishonor the leaders of the revolution," replied Mohammed Hassan Rahimian, who is running on the Rouhanioun, or Clerics', ticket. As for the wedding, he said, "I was at that wedding, and there was no more than a plate of rice and a bowl of stew."
It is a curious kind of Persian-style revolutionary democracy. Throughout Iran, 2,050 candidates are struggling for name recognition in eight frenzied days of campaigning for elections to 270 seats in Iran's Parliament. As Friday's election gets closer, the various factions, bound more by family and tribal loyalties than by policy platforms, have stepped up attacks against their opponents -- and against the United States -- in sermons, debates, rallies and newspaper commentaries.
The verbal jousting is protracted for the Parliament, the place where elected representatives come to settle the revolution's remaining ideological battles, lobby for pork-barrel projects back home, block enemy legislation and sling mud. In the 12 years since it was created, the Parliament has immersed its members in a kind of nationwide group therapy whose lengthy sessions are broadcast on radio and television.
Not that Iran's parliamentary system is democratic by Western standards. Iran banned political parties in 1987 and politicians whose views veer too far from the mainstream may find themselves languishing in prison. And certain points of view, like criticizing the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, would never be tolerated.
 
Slow Legislative Process
 But with the exception of Israel's Parliament, Iran's legislative body has proven to be the liveliest Parliament in the Middle East, so lively that at one point a couple of years ago, two deputies threw their shoes at each other during one debate. As Iranians are proud to tell the dozens of foreign journalists invited in for the occasion, none of the Persian Gulf countries has such a representative body, and the National Assembly in neighboring Iraq is nothing more than a rubber stamp.
Under Iran's Constitution, Parliament is charged with approving Cabinet appointees and formulating and passing legislation. But Parliament's decisions are subject to long reviews by the Council of Guardians, a watchdog group of six clerics and six laymen that has often vetoed or simply ignored pending legislation, particularly when it appeared to violate the rights of private property and profit-making permitted by Islam.
In 1988, Ayatollah Khomeini added another layer, creating a 13-member Expediency Council to settle disputes between the reform-oriented legislators and the conservative Council of Guardians.
Parliamant also has the power to paralyze. It took the elected body nine years to pass comprehensive labor legislation and it has yet to pass an extensive land-reform bill. It has purged Cabinet members, muzzled debate on contentious issues like relations with the United States, and consistently urged a militant foreign policy.
 
Spiritually Correct Choices
 President Hashemi Rafsanjani can count on controling only about 100 of its 270 members, while about 80 to 90 members consistently vote against him and the remaining 80 to 90 are swing voters. Although the current Parliament has accepted his five-year plan and this year's budget, President Rafsanjani has been repeatedly frustrated by its maneuvers to block his efforts to revive Iran's crippled economy and to open up to the West.
Parliament also provides a forum for the venting of complaints of the nation, a time-consuming process that often prevents it from acting on more crucial business. In a debate last month, for example, a deputy from Abadan, which was badly damaged in the Iran-Iraq war, called the money allocated to repair damaged homes "insignificant and trivial," and called on the President and his ministers to "direct more of their kindness to the condition of the people."
A deputy from Khuzestan Province called the taxes imposed by the city halls "intolerable," and demanded economic relief for his constituents.
In an effort to take control of the legislature in these elections, Mr. Rafsanjani in effect took control of the slate of candidates. Last month, the Council of Guardians, which strongly supports him, announced that only the spiritually correct could run for office and that it would determine who they were. In the process, it disqualified a number of sitting legislators.
 
'Limited Field' Assailed
 Among its victims were Sheik Ali Khalkhali, who earned the nickname "Hanging Judge" for his summary trials and death sentences during the 1979 revolution, and Hadi Ghaffari, a cleric who used to carry a Kalashnikov assault rifle and who has been accused by his enemies of massive embezzlement of Government funds.
Three candidates representing the Students Following the Line of the Imam, the group responsible for holding the Americans hostage for 444 days, were also banned.
Traditional Western-educated liberals and hard-line Islamic-oriented politicians have criticized the limited slate of candidates.
 
An Ayatollah's Support
 In a recent letter to the Ministry of the Interior, Mehdi Bazargan, the 85-year-old engineer who served as the revolution's first Prime Minister, sent an open letter to Iran's Interior Ministry, demanding that his banned party and magazine be allowed to operate again and asserting that the Council of Guardians had no constitutional right to choose candidates.
"Within the framework of the existing Constitution, clubs, associations, political gatherings and the press must be free so that the people can understand the viewpoints of the candidates," said the letter, which was distributed discreetly to foreigners but not published in Iranian newspapers. He said the campaign period was much too short if there were to be "free and unrestricted campaigns and political associations so that the people can choose."
On the opposite side, Ali Akbar Motashemi, a deputy who promoted exporting Iran's revolution as Minister of the Interior and who is a bitter rival of Mr. Rafsanjani, suggested that the country was moving toward dictatorship.
But Mr. Rafsanjani enjoys the unflinching support of Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said in a recent sermon that the Parliament did not need members "who insult the nation" or those "conspiring against our popular President."
The Government's biggest worry is that voters will stay away from the polls. Indeed, many Iranians, disillusioned that the prosperity promised them at the end of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war in 1988 has eluded them, do not feel as if they have a stake in the Parliament.
"None of these candidates, all of whom have had key posts within the Government, care about the future of this country," said Maryam Barazandeh, a homemaker. "They do nothing to improve our standard of living, nothing to control inflation. Why should we vote?"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Clinton;
Buoyed by a New York Victory, Clinton Calls It the Turning Point

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

 BODY:
When Gov. Bill Clinton waded into the jubilant crowd at his victory party last night, 100 video screens flashed behind him and the speakers at the Ritz pounded with the strains of Steve Winwood's rock hit "Roll With It Baby."
After weeks of New York primary campaigning that the candidate said felt "like a ride on the Coney Island Cyclone," Mr. Clinton is ready to be on a roll. 
 The Clinton campaign had been hoping for such a party for weeks but had only begun to count on it during the last few days of a trying New York primary campaign.
As the potential for a significant victory in New York became more likely in recent days, campaign strategists and Mr. Clinton himself began to relax visibly. And as the proportions of the night's victory became clear, Mr. Clinton and his aides said it was a testament to the strength of his message of economic revival, personal responsibility and middle-class relief.
"We proved that all kinds of people were aching to come together again," Mr. Clinton said. "When the vote is in tonight in New York, it will show that Americans want to be together again, black and Hispanic, Jew and gentile, man and woman. They're all voting for the same things in life."
Clinton aides breathed their first sighs of relief late last week after their own surveys of New York voters began to show that their support had solidified while Mr. Brown's had begun to soften.
"In the future, people will look back upon this week and this campaign as a turning point, not for Bill Clinton, but for the Democratic Party and for America," he told his cheering supporters.
Even when Mr. Clinton was forced to deal with new questions in recent days about his Vietnam draft status and his wife's outspokenness, he and his aides seemed far removed from the crisis mode with which they had greeted earlier setbacks.
This was partly because the campaign staff had become almost accustomed to dealing with bad news. It was also partly because of a growing confidence among Clinton forces that they could use their newly honed survival skills to best President Bush in the fall.
"It's mathematically impossible for Brown to get the nomination, and it would take Tsongas about 90 percent of the remaining delegates to win," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's deputy campaign manager. "So lightning would have to strike. But we're going to keep our sneakers on, just in case."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Sidelines;
Tsongas Says Vote Reveals a Powerful Force

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., April 7

 BODY:
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts said tonight that his strong showing in today's New York primary, in which he did not campaign but finished second, represented power that the Democratic Party -- and particularly Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas -- would have to deal with.
 
'There's Power There'
 On March 19, Mr. Tsongas suspended his bid for the party's Presidential nomination after losing a series of primaries to Mr. Clinton. Tonight he refused to say whether his showing today would lead him to re-enter the race. 
 He said he would ponder the matter for several days then announce a decision by the weekend.
"When you get this kind of vote not having campaigned, there's power there," Mr. Tsongas said in a news conference late tonight on the lawn in front of his home here. "What I have to figure out basically is how to take this power in a constructive manner. Bill Clinton will have to worry that so many people didn't come out to vote and someone who didn't campaign as well as I did."
Mr. Tsongas called today's primary results "extraordinary, something that's never happened before in this country," and he asserted that the campaign message he delivered before suspending his campaign "survives and lives."
His message focused on the nation's economic woes, and while voters, particularly those in hard-pressed New Hampshire, initially found that appealing, voters in other states were less responsive.
Mr. Tsongas indicated tonight that his deliberations over the next several days would focus on whether larger numbers of voters were now ready to embrace his message or whether he simply had become a focal point for voters to express dissatisfaction.
But he said that whatever conclusion he reached, he would in no case become a disruptive, spoiling force in the campaign. "I'm not in this business to be a spoiler," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Recognizes 3 Yugoslav Republics as Independent

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
The United States, which for months held out for a unified Yugoslavia, announced today that it was recognizing the independence of three of that country's secessionist republics.
President Bush said in a statement that he would move immediately to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, the three republics that have been recognized by the European Community. 
 The American declaration came nine months after a civil war broke out in Yugoslavia, following the independence moves of Slovenia and Croatia. The conflict has smashed the foundations of the federation of six republics that had arisen under Communist rule at the end of World War II. Bosnia and Herzegovina announced its independence last month and the European Community tendered formal recognition on Monday.
 
Split in 5 Parts
 This means that on the territory of what once was the six-republic nation of Yugoslavia, there now are five separate entities. These are the three independent countries, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina; the remnants of the Yugoslav state, made up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro; and the secessionist republic of Macedonia.
The independence of Macedonia has not yet been officially recognized by the European Community or the United States out of deference to Greece, which already has a region named Macedonia and is concerned that an independent Macedonia would make claims to Greek territory.
The Administration action was intended to bring United States policy into line with that of the European Community. The community recognized Croatia and Slovenia in January.
 
Vance Mediation Effort
 The United States held back then because the United Nations envoy, Cyrus R. Vance, a former secretary of State, was engaged in negotiations to end the fighting in the region and senior United States officials believed American recognition might set back the chances for the United Nations to arrange a solution. A United Nations peacekeeping force has now been approved and initial forces have arrived in Croatia to take up positions between Serbs and Croats.
The Bush statement issued by the White House said the United States would also "work intensively" with the European Community toward concurrent recognition of Macedonia. Joint recognition of Macedonia is not expected before early May, in the hope that Greece and the Macedonian secessionists will be able to negotiate their differences.
In addition it said the Administration would discuss with Serbia and Montenegro their plans to remain together "in a common state known as Yugoslavia."
The Bush statement underscored the Administration's intent, in recognizing the three republics, to promote the United Nations effort, and to help negotiations among the warring parties that are continuing under the auspices of the European Community.
 
U.S. Voices 'Some Concern'
 But the statement took no note of the clashes in recent days in Bosnia and Herzegovina pitting ethnic Serbs against Croats and Mulsim Slavs that have left scores dead in that republic. A White House spokeswoman said in response to a question that "there has been some concern" about the latest fighting.
The Administration said that in recognizing the three republics that have been the scenes of the fiercest battles of the civil war, the United States "accepts the pre-crisis republic borders as the legitimate international borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia."
This obliquely referred to the desire expressed last year by both Serbia and Croatia to alter the borders of their republics and at some point, to divide up Bosnia and Herzegovina between them. The fighting by Croatian and Serbian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina appears to be aimed at carving out enclaves of Serbs and of Croats in that republic.
 
Lifting of Sanctions
 The Bush statement said that as a result of American recognition, the Administration would lift sanctions against Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia. The sanctions, involving both economic aid and trade benefits, were applied to all of Yugoslavia last December.
The Administration said these sanctions would be lifted from Serbia and Montenegro as soon as those two republics ceased blockading commerce with Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On a day when the House Foreign Affairs Committee drafted a resolution pressing for United States recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, the Administration took pains to explain its rationale for delaying such action.
 
Baker Opposed Secession
 A year ago, when Slovenia and Croatia were threatening to secede, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d strongly urged against such a move and sought to hold together the Yugoslav federation. And Washington fruitlessly sought to delay the European Community recognition when it was pushed by Germany at the end of last year and accomplished in January.
Judy Smith, the White House spokeswoman, said, "The reason why we did it was because now we feel that it can contribute to the peace process." Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, pointed out that Mr. Vance had warned repeatedly against "moving precipitously," and noted: "We took very seriously what the former Secretary of State said."
At the White House, a senior official said, "We have felt that for the United States to have proceeded with selective recognition -- that is, of Croatia or Slovenia -- before now would not have served the purpose of containing and ending the conflict."
 
U.S. Indifference Denied
 The official rejected suggestions that the United States had distanced itself from the Yugoslav conflict or remained relatively indifferent to it. "We did not simply wait," he said. "We took advantage of the continued influence that we did have," particularly with regard to the intensified combat in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He said that after a referendum on March 1 endorsed independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Administration had pressed the European Community to recognize the sovereignty of the government in Sarajevo, saying, " 'We think that it's critical that you move with us with regard to Bosnia, because if we don't, we may have stopped a war in one location, we may now see a war, perhaps an even worse war, in the other.' So, we think we've accomplished that as well."
The official said it was not yet clear whether the United States would accept the proposal of Serbia and Montenegro to be regarded as "Yugoslavia." He said that would depend on "questions like the disposition of assets, diplomatic representation and, as important as anything, the conduct of Belgrade and its policies and the Yugoslav National Army."

HEADLINE: This Long Island Industry Is Beating the Recession;
Demand Remains Strong for Alarms and Security Systems to Keep Burglars Away

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SYOSSET, L.I.

 BODY:
Don't get jumpy if you think that something is watching you.
Lots of things are. 
 Wandering around the thick maze of unprepossessing buildings occupied here by the Ademco Security Group is not for the paranoid. The low-slung, stark complex is amply outfitted with passive infrared motion detectors and control communicators. There are wired and wireless alarm systems. It is small wonder that no one can remember the last time there was a break-in.
Ademco happens to be the world's largest manufacturer of security and alarm devices, and along with Napco Security Systems in Amityville, it is part of an industry that is something of a Long Island secret.
To many people, manufacturing on Long Island means the beleaguered military contractors (some people think it simply means Grumman). And, in fact, the three largest manufacturers on Long Island are companies that make fighter planes and other weapons of war. But next in line is Ademco.
While many manufacturers have been rudely bruised by the recession, Ademco says it has managed to hold its own and grow a bit, albeit slowly. The company employs some 1,400 people and does 80 percent of its manufacturing in its sprawl of buildings here; the other 20 percent is done in Mexico.
Napco, with 900 employees, is smaller than Ademco, but it, too, is holding its own, said Kevin S. Buchel, the company's vice president for finance and administration.
 
Managing to Stay Ahead
 "The economy is still floundering," he said, "and yet we are managing to stay even or a little ahead of where we have been." Napco was founded in the 1970's in Farmingdale.
A third alarm company is also prospering on Long Island, National Security Systems of Manhasset, which has 27 employees and supplied the security system for the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City.
John W. Walter, the company's president, said his company was the Ferrari of the security systems industry -- small, fast and expensive. Ademco is the industry's General Motors, he said, and Napco it's Ford.
In its complex here, Ademco makes just about any sort of intrusion sensor known to thieves -- sensors that detect a door opening, sensors that pick up motion, sensors that go off at the sound of glass breaking, floor mats that squeal if someone walks over them, shock sensors that are touched off at the jolts created when someone pounds a sledge-hammer against a wall.
The company was founded in Brooklyn in 1929 by Maurice Coleman. Back then, it made very elementary mechanical alarm systems, the kind that would trigger a loudly clanging bell in the event of a break-in. In the early days of alarm services, "runners," when an alarm sounded, would hurriedly scamper to a house to see what was amiss.
Ademco is now owned by the Pittway Corporation, a billion-dollar enterprise based in Northbrook, Ill., that also makes hair sprays and deodorants, publishes trade magazines and provides delivery services.
 
Selling to the Russians
 Even the Russians find Ademco's products of some interest. The company said it recently signed an agreement with Ohrana, the security agency, to sell alarm systems to the Russians, who appear to be more interested in security products because of rising crime fomented by the economic upheaval. But Ademco's chief executive officer, Leo Guthart, a former Harvard Business School faculty member, is dubious about how much business may result in the immediate future. "There's an economic question," he said. "Can they pay for anything?"
Ademco behaves emphatically like a security company. When queried in certain areas, Mr. Guthart gets extraordinarily bashful about information.
"What are Ademco's sales?"
"I can't divulge that."
"How about its profits?"
"I can't say."
"What is its market share?"
"I wouldn't know."
After a certain amount of polite fencing, Mr. Guthart grudgingly concedes that Ademco does hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business and has a market share that approaches 35 percent.
Ademco has lived through radical change in alarm technology. Earlier intrusion sensors were disturbingly imprecise. They were generally ultrasonic motion sensors that had difficulty differentiating between a fluttering curtain and a fearless burglar. The cat could bring the police.
Today, infrared sensors that pick up body heat are commonly used, and they are arranged in "point identification" systems, in which every window and every door becomes a separate point that is guarded. Thus the systems can determine that someone just crawled in through the second window in the den, has moved across the room and is now standing by the expensive stereo in the living room.
 
False Alarms
 The improvement has substantially reduced the spate of false alarms, always a rankling issue in the industry. Security services and the police are never enthusiastic about dashing to a home to find nothing more menacing than a fluttering drape.
In its efforts to outsmart burglars, Ademco's focus, applied with near missionary fervor, is to rid security systems of wires and telephones. For most of its existence, the alarm business has deployed wire to connect sensors to a control, which is the brain of a system. Then the telephone has been relied on as the means of communication to a security monitoring station.
Wire requires expensive skilled labor to install. And the telephone has its vagaries and weaknesses. A storm can topple telephone poles. A thief can slash the wires. Ademco likes to point out familiar escapades like a phone call to report a burglary being greeted with the recorded message, "I'm sorry, all circuits are busy. Try again later." Or the time burglars stole $2 million from a Chicago jewelry maker after cutting the cables linking the alarm system to a Wells Fargo Alarm Services office.
Ademco prefers radio. Rather than run wires through attics and walls of a house to connect sensors, Ademco encourages the use of sensors equipped with radio transmitters. And then, rather than have those sensors communicate to a security company over telephone lines, it makes systems that broadcast radio signals.
In the early 1980's, Ademco acquired a cluster of Federal Communications Commission licenses to gain access to unused radio frequencies and then set up a cellular network so it could privately broadcast news of burglars sneaking into houses to security companies.
Wireless systems are now the fastest growing portion of the alarm business. Not that any system is truly impenetrable. There are ways to interfere with radio signals in a wireless system. But people in the alarm business prefer to brush aside the subject. "We don't like to talk about defeat," Mr. Guthart said. "Listen, the C.I.A. system could be defeated by the K.G.B. if it put enough effort into it."
Basically, money buys comfort. A decent but simple home system today runs in the neighborhood of $1,000 to $1,500, though you can also spend several times that. In addition, there are monthly fees to alarm companies.
Lasting success in the alarm business is a matter of hustling and wrangling. Steadily cheaper prices are instrumental. Smoke alarms have plummeted in cost from about $200 in 1970 to as little as $3.99 today. People expect the same of burglar alarms.
"Nobody wants to buy an alarm system," said Steven Winick, a vice president of Ademco. "They buy it because they're afraid of something. So whatever an alarm system costs, it costs too much."

HEADLINE: Wirth of Colorado Is 7th Senator To Decide Against Running Again

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, April 7

 BODY:
In the latest sign of discontent in Congress, Senator Tim Wirth, a respected Democrat who had been an important voice on environmental matters, announced today that he would not seek re-election.
The move, which threw the Colorado race into disarray, came without any sign of real trouble in the campaign of Mr. Wirth, a 52-year-old politician known for hard work and a genial manner. 
 In a written announcement, Mr. Wirth, who served six terms in the House before winning a seat in the Senate six years ago, cited the frustrations of working in Congress. He becomes the seventh member of the Senate who will not seek re-election.
"The reasons are complicated; life is complicated and political life is doubly so," Mr. Wirth said. "Economic mismanagement and partisan pettiness" he added, have "reduced the work of our Government."
 
'Relentless Maneuvering'
 "The President shirks his duty to lead," he said, adding that Congress was stymied by "relentless maneuvering" for short-term political gain.
Cal Jillson, chairman of the political science department at the University of Colorado, said: "This comes as a great surprise. That a respected person in the middle of a very successful Senate career would throw it over -- that really says something about what's going on in Washington."
Mr. Wirth had opposition, but did not appear to be in grave political danger.
"Nothing is chasing Tim Wirth away from his seat," said Mr. Jillson. "He would simply rather pursue opportunities that will be more pleasant and fruitful."
Until now, the Republican front-runner for the seat has been Terry Considine, a conservative State Senator, and his party had regarded the race as one of its best chances to gain a Senate seat. The prospect of an open seat could encourage other Republicans to enter the race.
The shape of the Democratic race was hazy. One person who might seek Mr. Wirth's seat is Representative Pat Schroeder, who is highly popular in Denver but would have a tougher time among voters in the rural western part of the state. Another possible contender, Representative David E. Skaggs, would have to overcome negative publicity about his overdrafts at the House bank.

HEADLINE: Anguish Among Caterpillar Strikers as Jobs Are Offered to Others

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., April 7

 BODY:
For Dennis Hussenann, the toughest part of being on strike is having to explain to his three children that they cannot buy new clothes, that they cannot have money to go to any of the new films they want to see and that there will be no frills at dinner time.
"We've been eating a lot of beans and noodles," said Mr. Hussenann, a 44-year-old gauge mechanic who has worked at Caterpillar Inc. for 26 years and has been on strike for five months. "This has really been a strain for all of us. We're really trying to scrape together whatever we can just to have a halfway decent meal." 
 The strike of 12,600 workers here at the world's largest maker of construction machinery has clearly taken an anguishing toll of the strikers. In the face of a company order this week to return to work or risk having their jobs filled by permanent, nonunion workers, nearly all of the strikers have stayed out.
The company began advertising in local papers today for skilled workers to replace them, and it said the response was so great that the telephone equipment became overloaded.
 
Strikers Taking Gamble
 Of course, any worker striking any company confronts financial difficulty and emotional stress. But the Caterpillar strikers, unlike most, see their decision to remain on strike as a dangerousgamble because it may forever cost them their jobs -- and the relatively good wages they have enjoyed.
Jobs for skilled blue-collar workers have dwindled rapidly during the years these people have been at Caterpillar, and the strikers fear they are sampling a bitter taste of the future by living on their $100 a week in strike benefits.
Moreover, some say they are troubled by the obstinacy not only of Caterpillar but also of their union, the United Automobile Workers. Many insist that the issues that divide the two sides could probably be resolved if the two sides were not posturing so diligently for their respective objectives.
"The company has certainly been good to me," said Betty Mathews, a clerk in the tool room in the East Peoria plant. "I've been through nine strikes since I came to Caterpillar in 1944. But this one is different. I think both sides have put us on the spot this time. They should get together and settle this thing."
The issues that divide the company and the union center on a practice known as pattern bargaining, under which unions negotiate similar contracts with a several companies within the same industry. In the Caterpillar dispute, the U.A.W. is seeking terms similar to those the union reached last year with Deere & Company of Moline, Ill., which makes farm equipment.
Deere workers would have their top minimum wages reach more than $40,000 a year by the end of their contract in 1994. That compares with the $35,000 salary of top Caterpillar workers now and the $39,000 annual salaries Caterpillar workers would receive by 1994, under the contract rejected by the union.
The workers never voted on the contract itself, as they had voted to give the local union's leadership the authorization to call a strike if a satifactory contract could not be obtained.
The union also seeks to maintain its current health care plan, which offers full benefits to workers regardless of what hospital they go to for treatment. The company wants to pay full health care benefits only at one specific hospital in Peoria.
Workers are also objecting to Caterpillar's plan to initiate a two-tier wage system, paying newly hired employees less than current union members.
Caterpillar officials say pattern bargaining is a relic of the days when companies like theirs did not have to worry about foreign-based competitors. They say Caterpillar, much more than Deere, depends on export business and therefore cannot simply duplicate the Deere contract.
Today, the U.A.W. picket lines drew thousands of strikers along Washington Street in East Peoria, where the company manufactures a variety of parts for its tractors. Company officials said that 400 strikers crossed the picket lines today, up from 300 on Monday, the first day of Caterpillar's threat to bring in replacement workers.
Union officials and strikers keeping vigil on the picket lines said those numbers were grossly inflated. Union members have been pointing their video cameras at each plant gate, recording the license numbers of all who enter the plant. Union officials have declined to give specific figures on the number of its members who have crossed the picket lines, but those on the gates say the numbers given by the company are far too high.
 
Big Response Is Reported
 The company's ads for replacement workers began appearing in newspapers here and in Decatur and Aurora, where Caterpillar has other plants. "Our phones have been ringing all day long," said Gilbert C. Nolde, a Caterpillar spokesman. "People in these communities have really been responding."
Federal legislation that would prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements for strikers, organized labor's top priority for the 102d Congress, was passed by the House of Representatives in July. But the margin, 247 to 182, was far short of the two-thirds majority required to override the veto President Bush has promised.
A similar bill emerged from the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee last June on a party-line vote. But the measure has not been brought to the Senate floor for a vote, and there is no scheduling on when it may come up.
Senate Democrats are not sure they even have the 60 votes needed to break a likely Republican filibuster.
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who sponsored the measure, said today, "We hope to move it after the recess." The Senate will recess for Easter at the end of this week and return on April 27.
The eagerness of others in this economically ravaged industrial area to fill the strikers' positions has added to the frustration of those who have remained loyal to the union.
"My daughter is a sophomore in junior college," said an assembler with 25 years' tenure with Caterpillar, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Yesterday, she complained that her classmates are criticizing her for having a father who would turn down good money when so many others are out of work. It really gets to her, and she feels she's being persecuted."
Indeed, local radio talk shows here have been filled with local residents, complaining that they would happily take any Caterpillar job, even if their salaries were lower than those proposed by the company.
Many union members say that they are still weighing whether to cross the picket line, and add that they are waiting for a few more days to pass or even a few more weeks in the hope that the two sides will resume the negotiations and settle the strike. The company has said it will take the strikers back as long as their jobs have not been filled. But time is running out, and most jobs will be gone by May 1, Caterpillar says,
Still, most strikers remain defiant. "If they break this union, it won't be the only union that will be broken," said Steven Desmat, a 41-year-old machine operator who has worked for Caterpillar for 18 years. "We have to stand firm. I just hope it will be worth it for both sides."

HEADLINE: Port Authority Pulls Back From Sale of Waterfront

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Responding to outrage and the urging of a leading adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Port Authority agreed yesterday to step back from its plan to sell a strip of prime Brooklyn waterfront to developers.
The move, proposed by Vincent Tese, head of the Urban Development Corporation of New York, would give local residents time to complete a public development plan. 
 Mr. Tese, who is also vice chairman of the Port Authority, wields considerable influence as Governor Cuomo's chief economic adviser. Mr. Tese announced the agreement yesterday, less than a week after the Port Authority angered many Brooklynites by making plans to sell its 64 acres of Brooklyn Heights waterfront, which includes several piers and has a sweeping view of Lower Manhattan.
 
'More Than Happy to Do'
 Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority's executive director, said yesterday that he welcomed the request to delay the sale, as well as a proposal that the pier development be managed by a subsidiary of the Urban Development Corporation.
"Frankly, it's something that I'm more than happy to do," Mr. Brezenoff said. "The priorities for us involved here are that the property be put to good use, that it not be a drain on our budget and that our capital expenditures be reimbursed."
Included in the agreement is a plan to repay the Port Authority for capital costs required to fix up Piers 1, 2, 3 and 5. In a letter received by Brooklyn officials last week, Mr. Brezenoff wrote that his decision to sell the waterfront property had been spurred by economic pressures.
Efforts to negotiate with local community groups had failed to produce a viable plan, he said. Recent inspections, meanwhile, had found one pier needed $5 million in immediate repairs to prevent its collapse onto an underground subway tunnel. And structural problems with the other piers would require an additional $3 million to $5 million to repair over the next five years, he said.
"At the point that I sent that letter out, my only hope was to sell that property," he said. "But this is as good, and in some respects, it is even a better alternative. I'm really pleased that Vince Tese and the U.D.C. are able to do this."
Mr. Tese said in a statement yesterday that the community groups and local officials who have fought to preserve the land for public use will have 45 days to prepare "a document that might lead to a public-private approach to pier development."
Anthony A. Manheim, co-chairman of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Coalition, said the state officials "have become persuaded that our public-use concept can work" and were only now taking a close look at the ideas proposed by his organization, which represents more than 38 neighborhood, arts and business groups.
Mr. Tese said yesterday that while the community groups and local officials might have agreed in principle on a plan, the Port Authority's threat to sell had served as a catalyst in this final agreement.
"We've been working on this for the last couple of years," Mr. Tese said. "And I guess they thought that now the time was right to come together."
Mr. Tese said he became convinced that Brooklynites were sufficiently united to move forward on the waterfront development after he received calls from several local officials and met with Representative Stephen J. Solarz and Assemblywoman Eileen C. Dugan, both Democrats of Brooklyn, and several community members yesterday.
He also said the corporation hoped to get about $10 million with the passage of an $800 million bond act. Money from that bond issue and from rental fees could be used to reimburse the Port Authority for fixing the piers.
"What's important now is that we sit down quickly and hammer out a memorandum of agreement to allow this partnership to move forward," said Marilyn Gelber, executive assistant to Mr. Golden.
 
Modifying Their Stance
 Though many residents had initially said they wanted the entire site preserved as parkland, they modified their stance in recent years, saying some small restaurants or boutiques -- or even a hotel -- would be acceptable. The Port Authority had initially said that it wanted to space used for a profitable commercial venture, like office space.
The development near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway would involve a total of 72 acres, including parcels owned by the city and private owners as well as the Port Authority.

HEADLINE: Report Criticizes U.S. Plans For Improving Car Mileage

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
A panel of the National Research Council has found room for significant gains in automobile gas mileage, but has criticized both the Federal Government's current way of setting standards and the main legislative proposal for increasing fuel efficiency.
The panel's report, released today, said new incentives should be considered for consumers, beyond simply requiring the auto industry to meet efficiency targets. By increasing gas taxes, or by imposing fees on gas-guzzlers and paying subsidies to those who buy efficient cars, the current regulatory approach could be strengthened or replaced, the panel suggested. 
 The research panel, completing a two-year review, estimated that the technology already existed to increase the average fuel efficiency of passenger cars -- now 27.5 miles a gallon, about that of the popular Ford Taurus station wagon -- to as much as 33 by 2001 and 37 by 2006.
But it said practical considerations, like the cost of adopting the changes, might reduce the potential for improvement. What is technically possible might not be politically correct, it said.
The National Research Council is an arm of the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering, which examine technical issues on behalf of the Federal Government. The panel's chairman was Richard A. Meserve, a partner in the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling, and it drew its members mainly from university and industry engineering laboratories.
Both sides in the debate contended that the report supported their positions.
"This is clearly a major defeat for the Naders and the Bryans," said Jerry R. Curry, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which sets automotive performance standards. He was referring to the consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, sponsor of a measure calling for setting gas mileage standards at 40 miles a gallon by 2001.
William Noack, a spokesman for the General Motors Corporation, called the report "a valuable contribution." He said it supported the auto maker's contention that "if fuel economy is to be regulated, it should be done as flexibly as possible," and preferably by Mr. Curry's office, not by Congress.
But David Hamilton, a spokesman for the United States Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy group, called the study "a vindication for all the people who have been saying that significant improvements in fuel economy are possible."
A spokesman for Public Citizen, an organization founded by Mr. Nader, said the group was pleased by the report, especially because it played down suggestions that fuel efficiency could be obtained only by compromising vehicle safety.
For its part, the panel said that neither the agencies that set current standards nor the Congressional committees contemplating changes had enough information available for making sound decisions.
"It is inescapable that Congress and the governmental agencies are attempting to regulate an industry of tremendous importance to the U.S. economy in the absence of sufficient information from neutral sources on which to base such regulation," the panel's report said.
And it warned that if the standards were set impossibly high, serious damage could be done to the already unhealthy auto industry.
 
Citing 'Serious Defects'
 The report said the existing system for setting standards, which averages the mileage of each manufacturer's cars and requires them to meet an annual target, has "serious defects," chiefly that it disregards the fact that many people do not want to buy smaller cars or otherwise pay for costly improvements in fuel efficiency. But it said that Senator Bryan's proposal was "perverse" and "could be unfair" because it seeks percentage improvements that set the highest efficiency standards for those manufacturers that already produce the most fuel-efficient cars.
And in the end, the panel, dodging the very question it had been commissioned to answer, put squarely back into the Government's hands the divisive question of just how efficient cars should become over 15 years.
"The determination of the practically achievable levels of fuel economy is appropriately the domain of the political process, not this committee," the panel said.
 
The Committee's Role
 Two years ago, the committee was instructed to make its best judgment of what level of fuel economy was both technically feasible and otherwise practical. The Bush Administration repeatedly denounced efforts in Congress to legislate big efficiency increases, urging lawmakers to await the academy's report.
Today Mr. Curry, the Transportation Department official in charge of setting fuel efficiency standards and otherwise regulating the auto industry, said putting this burden on an independent panel had been a "cowardly approach."
He endorsed the main findings of the committee, including its criticisms of the current regulatory approach, which he has long criticized, and said the findings were consistent with his views that only modest gains in efficiency could be made without sacrificing other goals.
Addressing one of the most contentious issues, the panel said its estimates of efficiency gains could be achieved with only small costs in safety. The auto industry and the Administration have said that cutting weight to achieve greater fuel efficiency would make cars less safe, but the panel said average weight reductions would be less than 10 percent.
The Coalition for Vehicle Choice, a lobbying group sponsored by automotive and other groups, said the report supported the group's argument that consumers would not support more stringent fuel economy rules.
The report estimated that adopting all currently available fuel-saving technologies would cost $500 to $2,500 for each passenger car, depending on the model.

HEADLINE: Message From G.M.'s Board: Cut Losses Fast

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 7

 BODY:
The historic overthrow of General Motors' president leaves Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, in a fight for authority over his company.
In the two years since he took office, Mr. Stempel, who is 58 years old, has moved slowly, even deliberately, in paring down the world's largest auto maker to bring it into line with its diminished market share. 
 But now, outside directors of the General Motors Corporation, led by John G. Smale (rhymes with mail), the retired chairman and chief executive of the Procter & Gamble Company, sent him an unambiguous message: slow and deliberate is not fast enough. The board made it clear that the company's losses, amounting to $7 billion in North America last year, were unacceptable, and that Lloyd E. Reuss, the G.M. president, who was in charge of domestic operations, had to go.
 
Stempel's Awkward Position
 By ordering Mr. Reuss's demotion, the board also wounded Mr. Stempel and diminished his authority in the eyes of subordinates, experts in management and the auto industry said.
But, they added, if he reacts with anger or disappointment, he may be committing a fatal error. Instead, he must find a way to align himself with G.M.'s board, forge an alliance with the new president, John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., and carry out the board's command to manage more aggressively, thereby restoring his credibility as a leader. Otherwise, the entire G.M. organization may become paralyzed.
"No aggressive manager will take any kind of risk when there is a sense of disunity at the top," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor of management at Emory University in Atlanta. "It's too easy to hitch your wagon to the wrong star."
 
Holding Executives Accountable
 If the auto maker fails to respond to the board's signals, Mr. Stempel's strength as a leader could be further compromised, paving the way for Mr. Smith to replace him. Meanwhile, the displacement of Mr. Stempel as chairman of the executive committee, a post that is now Mr. Smale's, clearly signifies that the outside directors will hold executives strictly and directly accountable for their performance, a condition that has not existed at G.M. since the 1920's.
The G.M. board's executive committee, traditionally run by the chairman, consists of the chairmen of the board's committees. Until this week, the full power of the board resided in the committee between the 10 full board meetings each year. That changed on Monday, according to a G.M. spokesman, when Mr. Smale took charge of the committee -- removing Mr. Stempel -- and the committee's focus shifted to advising the company's management.
Since announcing in December that it would close 21 plants and eliminate 74,000 jobs, G.M. has identified only a dozen plants, leaving tens of thousands of workers to worry about their fate. Many Wall Street analysts said the quickest way for Mr. Stempel and Mr. Smith to improve G.M.'s financial position would be to close unprofitable North American operations quickly, to stop artificially inflating G.M.'s market share by producing too many vehicles and then paying hefty -- and costly -- rebates to sell them, and to reduce the work force to a size consistent with the number of vehicles being sold.
The person now in charge of making these things happen is Mr. Smith, who carried out a similar task in the mid-1980's in Europe, where G.M. is now quite profitable.
By yanking Mr. Reuss as president, as well as Robert T. O'Connell as chief financial officer, the directors also broadcast a message to the rest of G.M. "Just keeping out of trouble isn't good enough anymore," said a senior G.M. manager who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The board wants results."
Elmer Johnson, a former G.M. executive vice president who specializes in issues of corporate governance, said that forcing all managers to be more accountable for their performance would benefit the American economy. "You make G.M. competitive and you'll make this country competitive," he said.
G.M.'s managers must understand, he said, "the higher you rise in the organization, the tougher the standards of performance are going to be." He added: "That's a very good message to send out when you are eliminating 74,000 jobs. You can't have the moral authority to make those decisions unless there is accountability."
 
Smith's Record in Europe
 An unpretentious man who would show up at company picnics in blue jeans, Mr. Smith caught the eye of G.M.'s outside directors for the way he presided over the turnaround of the European unit, which had been unprofitable. Soon after arriving in 1986 as an executive vice president of European operations, Mr. Smith began concentrating on ways to reduce costs.
"He was interested in everything: the way we dealt with suppliers, how we worked internally and with our dealers," said Ken Levy, a G.M. spokesman in Europe. Mr. Smith was promoted to president of G.M. Europe in 1987 and returned to the United States in 1988.
Mr. Smith, who is 54, supervised the closing of an assembly plant in Antwerp, Belgium, and the consolidation of a second G.M. plant there, where schedules were adjusted to expand production to 20 hours a day. Production at a plant in Zaragoza, Spain, was increased to 21 hours.
Because of cost-cutting and the rising popularity of its models, G.M. Europe began making money in 1987 after several years of horrendous losses. The company has since been profitable, toting up more than $8 billion of profits in the last five years.
One of Mr. Smith's new partners will be William E. Hoglund, a G.M. executive known for his friendly, gregarious nature. He replaced Mr. O'Connell, who was an executive vice president as well as chief financial officer, and was regarded by many as a rival of Mr. Smith.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Expects Growth in '93

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund expects the industrial world to record solid economic growth next year after a lackluster performance in 1992, monetary sources said today.
They said the I.M.F.'s latest economic forecast, discussed by its board this week, foresees growth in the industrial world of about 3.25 percent next year after just 2 percent in 1992. 
 "They're looking for a strong pickup next year, but I'm afraid they may be too optimistic," said one monetary source.
Back in October, the I.M.F. predicted that industrial countries would record growth of 2.8 percent this year. But it has been forced to slash that forecast as the United States recovery has proved slower than expected and growth in Germany and Japan has decelerated faster than anticipated.
Monetary sources said the I.M.F. expects the United States to lead the world recovery next year, with growth picking up to 3.25 percent in 1993 from about 1.5 percent this year.
I.M.F. staff also look for faster growth in Europe and Japan.
In Bonn, the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said it was optimistic that a solid recovery would emerge in the second half in light of positive indicators from the United States.
But Jean-Claude Paye, O.E.C.D. Secretary General, said O.E.C.D. ministers would review and possibly lower its 1992 growth forecast of 2.2 percent at a meeting in Paris on May 18-19.

HEADLINE: 1992 Pulitzer Prize Winners and Their Works in Journalism and the Arts

 BODY:

GENERAL NONFICTION
 
Daniel Yergin
"The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power"
Half-historian and half-energy expert, Daniel Yergin seems perfectly cast to write about the 20th-century addiction to oil, and many reviewers have already said that his latest work, "The Prize," deserves to become the standard work on the subject. Mr. Yergin's intention was not to break new ground, but rather to make sense out of a tremendous amount of hard-to-understand data, hidden forces and complex personalities. Mr. Yergin mourns the dependency that has so distorted international relations and harmed the environment. Mr. Yergin is president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy consulting firm.
 
FICTION
 
Jane Smiley
"A Thousand Acres"
In "A Thousand Acres," Jane Smiley weaves together the themes of farm and family. In an update of "King Lear," an Iowa farmer decides to divide his land among his three daughters, unleashing a family tragedy. The family is a rich and familar territory for Ms. Smiley. She offers intimate, closely observed portraits of family life in the novella and short stories that make up "The Age of Grief" (1987), and in "Ordinary Love and Good Will" (1989), which comprises two novellas. Ms. Smiley was born in Los Angeles and grew up in St. Louis. She received a bachelor's degree at Vassar College and a Ph.D. in medieval literature and languages at the University of Iowa. She lives in Ames, Iowa, where she teaches at Iowa State University.
 
POETRY
 
James Tate
"Selected Poems"
James Tate won for "Selected Poems," culled from nine of his previous books. He first came to prominence at the age of 23 when "The Lost Pilot" won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award in 1967. Energetic, surreal and humorous, the verse has poured out in a torrent ever since in such works as "The Oblivion Ha-Ha" (1970), "Hints to Pilgrims" (1971), "Absences" (1972), "Hottentot Ossuary," (1974), "Viper Jazz" (1976), "Riven Doggeries" (1979), "Constant Defender" (1983), "Reckoner" (1986) and "Distance from Loved Ones" (1990). Mr. Tate grew up in Kansas City and attended the University of Missouri, Kansas State College and the University of Iowa.
 
DRAMA
 
Robert Schenkkan
"The Kentucky Cycle"
Robert Schenkkan, 39 years old, won for his two-part, 6-hour 40-minute dramatic work that has been described as miniseries theater. An epic 200-year history of Kentucky's Cumberland Plateau performed by 20 actors, it traces seven generations in the lives of three interrelated families. At times intermarrying, they battle for domination of eastern Kentucky from 1775 to 1975. Mr. Schenkkan received a B.A. from the University of Texas at Austin, and a master's degree in theater arts from Cornell. He has worked as an actor and writer on Broadway, Off-Broadway and in regional theaters.
 
HISTORY
 
Mark E. Neely Jr.
"The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties"
Mr. Neely, who is the director of the Lincoln Museum in Fort Wayne, Ind., and author of "The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia," studied over 10,000 cases of the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War. He brought to light one of the most troublesome chapters of the Lincoln Administration. "I guess my conclusion," he said yesterday, "was that we have forgotten what it was like for all kinds of people to become captives of military power when a war was being fought on our own soil." He was born in Amarillo, Tex., in 1944 and graduated from Yale, where he received a doctorate in American history in 1973.
 
BIOGRAPHY
 
Lewis B. Puller Jr.
"Fortunate Son: The Healing of a Vietnam Vet"
This book is "a dark and corrosive autobiography," in the words of William Styron, who reviewed the book for this newspaper. It is the work of a man who, as an American soldier in Vietnam in 1968, stepped on a land mine and lost both his legs. Mr. Puller is the son of Gen. Lewis B. (Chesty) Puller, who became the most decorated Marine in the history of the corps, serving in World War II and the Korean War. Mr. Puller was born in Camp Lejeune, N.C., and attended local schools in Tidewater, Va. He served as a combat platoon leader in Vietnam until he was wounded and evacuated. He was awarded the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts. Mr. Puller has a law degree from the College of William and Mary. He is a senior attorney in the Office of the General Counsel of the Department of Defense.
 
MUSIC
 
Wayne Peterson
"The Face of the Night, The Heart of the Dark"
Wayne Peterson, a 64-year-old composer and pianist, lives in San Francisco, but is currently a visiting professor of composition at Indiana University in Bloomington. His orchestral work, "The Face of the Night, the Heart of the Dark" is a two-movement score that lasts about 19 minutes. Mr. Peterson described his style as "fairly dissonant," but added, "In this particular piece, the lines are much longer than in previous works I've written, and there is a re-emerging tonal element." Mr. Peterson studied at the University of Minnesota and the Royal Academy of Music, in London. He was a professor of music at San Francisco State University from 1960 until his retirement last year.
 
PUBLIC SERVICE
 
Tom Knudson
The Sacramento Bee
Tom Knudson describes the Sierra Nevada, which stretch along 400 miles of California's eastern border, as "one of North America's most majestic mountain ranges." But as Mr. Knudson's five-part series, "The Sierra in Peril," pointed out, those mountains have also been ravaged by air pollution, overdevelopment and overpopulation. The series, which ran in The Sacramento Bee last June, won Mr. Knudson his second Pulitzer Prize. Mr. Knudson, 38 years old, joined The Bee as a staff writer in 1988 and has since covered various topics related to natural resources. He graduated from Iowa State University in 1980 with a degree in mass communications and journalism, and worked at The Des Moines Register and The New York Times. He won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting for a series in The Register about safety and health problems in agriculture.
 
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
 
Lorraine Adams and Dan Malone
The Dallas Morning News
Lorraine Adams and Dan Malone spent over two years meticulously documenting civil rights violations by law-enforcement officials throughout Texas. "We had guns pointed at us and our lives were threatened," Ms. Adams said yesterday after their 20-part series on police misconduct won a Pulitzer. "We found the kind of human-rights abuses you would expect to find in a third-world country," she added. A prosecutor and a police officer who were among the subjects of the series have since been indicted, Ms. Adams said. Ms. Adams, 32 years old, who conceived the series, is a general-assignment reporter at The Morning News, where she has worked since 1984. Mr. Malone, 37, joined the paper in 1985 and was named Fort Worth bureau chief in February.
 
SPOT NEWS REPORTING
 
New York Newsday
The New York Newsday staff was awarded the prize for spot news reporting for its coverage of the derailment of a New York City subway in Manhattan on Aug. 28, 1991, in which five people were killed and more than 200 injured. The motorman's blood was found to contain twice the legal level of alcohol. More than 70 staff members, including 35 reporters, worked on the paper's first-day coverage, producing stories that ran to 16 full pages. Don Forst, New York Newsday editor, said the award was particularly gratifying because the paper had devoted considerable effort to covering the city transit system, and particularly its subways, which Mr. Forst called "possibly the most all-encompassing thing in New York City for most people."
 
INTERNATIONAL REPORTING
 
Patrick J. Sloyan
Newsday
Patrick J. Sloyan, senior correspondent for Newsday, was cited for reporting on the Persian Gulf war, done after the war had ended and the pool system that had restricted journalists had disintegrated. Among other things, he revealed that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had been buried alive by American tanks. Mr. Sloyan, 55 years old, served as Newsday's European-Mideast bureau chief from 1981 to 1986, when he became the Washington bureau chief. He graduated from the University of Maryland in 1963 with a degree in economics. While stationed in West Germany, he worked as a public information officer for the 10th Infantry Division and as a reporter for "Hell on Wheels," a newspaper for the Second Armored Division.
 
NATIONAL REPORTING
 
Jeff Taylor and Mike McGraw
The Kansas City Star
Jeff Taylor and Mike McGraw won their prize for their critical examination of the United States Department of Agriculture in a seven-part series published in December. Mr. Taylor, 30 years old, who joined The Star in February 1990, said he had wanted for some time "to look at a government agency, explain how it works, how big is the bureaucracy, where the money goes -- and the Department of Agriculture was a natural for this farming area." The project took 16 months, as the reporters traveled around the country, interviewing farmers and government employees and waiting for the agency to provide information, Mr. McGraw said. "We filed 70 requests under the Freedom of Information Act and never got all the information," said Mr. McGraw, 43, who joined The Star in 1989.
 
BEAT REPORTING
 
Deborah Blum
The Sacramento Bee
During her eight years as a science reporter at The Sacramento Bee, Deborah Blum says she has been both fascinated and troubled at the ethical choices faced by scientists who experiment on animals. Last November, her four-part series, "The Monkey Wars," focused on the questions surrounding experimentation on primates. Ms. Blum, 37 years old, joined The Bee in 1984. She received a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Georgia in 1976. She also holds a master's degree in science journalism from the University of Wisconsin.
 
FEATURE WRITING
 
Howell Raines
The New York Times
Howell Raines, who was born in Alabama in 1943, won for a personal essay, a reminiscence about his friendship with Grady Hutchinson, his family's black housekeeper when he was growing up in Birmingham, and an account of their meeting more than three decades later. He wrote the piece, he said yesterday after learning of his award, because "I realized that my lifelong interest in race relations and civil rights had its deepest roots in my relationship with Grady Hutchinson." Mr. Raines, who is Washington editor and chief of the Washington bureau of The New York Times, has a long history of writing about racism and civil rights, dating from the 1960's. "The piece was an homage to Grady," Mr. Raines said, "for being the first person I heard talk honestly about racial prejudice, and to my parents for having the kind of home where racism was not taught."
 
COMMENTARY
 
Anna Quindlen
The New York Times
Anna Quindlen's column, "Public & Private," which appears on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times and is syndicated throughout the country, has been a twice-weekly argument that public issues have an impact, both philosophical and visceral, on individual citizens. "I think of a column as having a conversation with a person that it just so happens I can't see," Ms. Quindlen said yesterday. "It's nice to know that my end of the conversation was heard." A graduate of Barnard College, Ms. Quindlen, who is 39 years old, joined The Times as a general assignment reporter in 1977. She has been a City Hall reporter and the deputy metropolitan editor. She has also written two other columns for the paper, "About New York" and "Life in the 30's."
 
EDITORIAL WRITING
 
Maria Henson
Lexington (Kentucky) Herald-Leader
Maria Henson, 31 years old, an editorial writer for The Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky, won the award for the more than 30 editorials she wrote from December 1990 o December 1991 on the problems of battered women in Kentucky. The series, titled "To Have and to Harm," produced many reforms, including the State Legislature's recent passage of measures intended to broaden and improve the legal protections for men and women battered or threatened by their spouses or companions.
 
EDITORIAL CARTOONING
 
Signe Wilkinson
Philadelphia Daily News
Signe Wilkinson is the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize in this category. Zachary Stalberg, editor of The Daily News, described her work as "social comment on contemporary themes." Her cartoons include a wide variety, from date rape to United States aid to the Kurds. Ms. Wilkinson devoted much comment to the confirmation hearings on Judge Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. Ms. Wilkinson joined The Daily News as editorial cartoonist in 1985, from the San Jose Mercury News in California.
 
FEATURE PHOTOGRAPHY
 
John Kaplan
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
The Herald (Monterey, Calif.) for Block Newspapers
John Kaplan, a 32-year-old photojournalist, won the feature photography award for a series of seven photo essays depicting how 21-year-olds live across the United States. All the essays, each accompanied by 9 to 12 photos, were published by The Post-Gazette, and some have been published in other newspapers of the Block chain, the Toledo Blade in Ohio and The Herald in Monterey, Calif., where he is currently based. Mr. Kaplan is founder and director of Media Alliance, a journalism consulting group in Pittsburgh.
 
SPOT NEWS PHOTOGRAPHY
The Associated Press staff
For the second straight year, The Associated Press was given the spot news photography award, this time for its photos of the attempted coup in Russia and the collapse of the Communist regime. Boris Yurchenko, one of the agency's photgrphers in Moscow, who turned 55 yesterday, said, "I didn't even know that a citizen of the former Soviet Union could win the prize." The other Associated Press photographers cited are Liu Heung-Shing, Olga Shalygin, Alexander Zemlianichenko and Czarek Sokolowski.
 
EXPLANATORY JOURNALISM
 
Robert S. Capers and Eric Lipton
The Hartford Courant
Robert S. Capers and Eric S. Lipton were part of a team of reporters that discovered in 1990 why a mirror crucial to the Hubble Telescope was flawed. They followed up that story with this four-part prize-winning series, which used the bungled telescope to illustrate problems endemic to the American space program. Mr. Capers, 42 years old, and Mr. Lipton, 26, spent five months reporting the series, said Lawrence Roberts, the specialty beat editor. Mr. Capers joined The Courant in 1978 and has served as assistant state editor and specialty beat editor, among other posts. Mr. Lipton covers the city of New Britain. "I believe it's his second job in journalism," Mr. Roberts said. "I told him he might as well retire."
 
SPECIAL AWARD
 
Art Spiegelman
"Maus"
Art Spiegelman won a special Pulitzer award. He is the founder and editor of Raw, a magazine of avant-garde comics and graphics. He wrote two comic books, "MAUS I: My Father Bleeds History" and "MAUS II: And Here My Troubles Began," which explored the experiences of his father, Vladek, a Holocaust survivor. One critic said Mr. Spiegelman's portrayal of Jews as mice and the Nazis as cats did not end up trivializing the event, but served to goad the reader into looking at the event anew. Mr. Spiegelman lives in SoHo with his wife, Francoise Mouly, and their daughter.

Town Faces Its Ghosts Without Anger

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IOWA CITY, April 7

 BODY:
She cannot rage against the student who senselessly shot her and five other people at the University of Iowa last November because she cannot fill her lungs with enough air to scream.
But in a voice barely above a whisper, Miya Rodolfo-Sioson says she would not scream even if she could. 
 "There's really nothing to be angry at," said the 24-year-old, her eyes full of life though her body is paralyzed. "The guy is dead. It was nobody's fault."
Ten minutes of horror on a snowy Friday afternoon last Nov. 1 have forever changed this solidly middle-American university town where backdoors really do go unlocked and random violence once belonged to another world. And perhaps more than anything else, Ms. Rodolfo-Sioson, who is recovering and plans to apply to graduate school and resume classes next fall, represents the spirit of acceptance, no anger, that this place uses to deal with what happened.
The facts of the shootings are now well known: Gang Lu, a Chinese graduate student enraged because he had not received an award, shot and killed three professors in the physics department, a rival who had won a prestigious award and the university's associate vice president for academic affairs.
In letters he left behind, Mr. Lu had praised Clint Eastwood and other movie actors for knowing how to even a score with a gun. He named all his victims except Ms. Rodolfo-Sioson, who was working as a temporary receptionist-secretary in the academic affairs.
No one knows why Mr. Lu shot Ms. Rodolfo-Sioson before fleeing the office and shooting himself. But that random bullet immediately paralyzed her from the neck down.
Recovery has been hard. For a time she was hooked to a ventilator to help her breathe and strapped into a head brace with metal pins screwed into her forehead.
"In late November she was sobbing, "Mommy, I can't do it, It's too hard," said her mother, Sonya Rodolfo-Sioson. "She asked legal questions about removing the ventilator."
But she had too much to live for, had been through too much already. Born in the Philippines, she lived most of her life in Ames, Iowa, where her father taught mathematics at Iowa State University when he died of cancer in 1969.
Before the shooting, Ms. Rodolfo-Sioson, a global studies and Spanish major, danced with a Palestinian folk group and poured her soul into activities for the people of El Salvador, which she had visited three summers and where she planned to live someday.
Now she spends her days flat on her back or in therapy that could enable her to use a mechanized wheelchair and personal computer controlled by sips and puffs on a straw.
Her dreams are more ambitious. The first thing she did upon her return from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago was to attend a fund-raising event for a Salvadoran health-care project.
"I try to put my injuries into perspective," she said. "If I didn't think about the people in Central America, I'd feel sorry for myself all the time. Now I feel sorry for myself just half the time."
Her courage has inspired this town. Donation cans for Ms. Rodolfo-Sioson's recovery were passed around at basketball games, and people from the city and the university have formed the November First Coalition to press for handgun control.
On the surface, most everything seems normal. Classes are even held again in the room where Mr. Lu shot himself. "It's not something you think about every day because it's not something you expect to happen again," said Scott D. Garney, a senior economics major.
But something has changed. Professors are more sensitive to students' gripes. Staff members are jumpier and townspeople anxious.
"I grew up in town and married a farmer, thinking this was a good place to raise a family," said Anne Spencer, a member of the coalition. "Now I realize that violence is a part of life, even here, and it's time to do something about it."

Choice for Labor Post A Man of Strong Views

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
While Marvin H. Kosters has moved into the usual no-comment mode for people about to undergo the Senate confirmation process, there is no lack of information as to what he really thinks. That is a marked difference from Janet L. Norwood, who most recently held the job of Commissioner of Labor Statistics, the post for which Dr. Kosters has been selected by President Bush.
He regards raising the minimum wage as bad policy, for example, and has been dubious about assertions that Reagan-era tax and economic policy have caused a significant increase in inequality of incomes. Neither view, expressed in a host of articles and in public comments over the years, is likely to endear Dr. Kosters, the 58-year-old director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, to the Labor and Human Resources Committee headed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, which will hear his testimony in the confirmation process. 
 Yet the professional economists who know him best do not believe that Dr. Kosters's confirmation to a four-year term in the Government's top statistical job, from which price and productivity figures as well those on employment are issued, is in any jeopardy. They describe Dr. Kosters as not only a master in collecting, analyzing, presenting and explaining data, but also as impeccable in refusing to "bend" them to support ideology.
Dr. Kosters, born in South Dakota, was graduated from Calvin College in Michigan and received a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago while working for the Rand Corporation, where one subject to which he applied his economic training was nuclear proliferation.
He then followed a career in various Government jobs, including stints as associate director of the Cost of Living Council and senior economist on the President's Council of Economic Advisers, which alternated with periods at the American Enterprise Institute, where he became widely known for his work on regulation.
Dr. Kosters, who is married and has three grown children, is an avid bicyclist. He says he has pedaled across Iowa either three and a half or four and a half times -- he can't remember which -- in The Des Moines Register's annual July ride.

HEADLINE: Renegade Researchers Offer Rebuttal: U.S. Schools Are Better Than Many Say

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
Forget all the bad news about American schools. There is no crisis in American education, say a number of renegade researchers whose ideas have touched off a bitter debate with broad implications for education policy in an election year.
By falsely claiming that almost all American schools are failing, these critics charge, the Bush Administration and others divert attention and money from the real crisis: poor inner-city and rural schools. 
 The debate itself reveals how little Americans know about their schools' performance and how far away the country is from defining just how good its schools should be.
The defenders of American education wave a batch of surprising statistics: test scores and dropout rates have held steady for at least 15 years, the percentage of top-scoring students is roughly the same as it was 15 years ago, and comparisons that show American students trailing those in nearly every other country are distorted by faulty methodology.
 
Improvement Since 1981?
 "Most schools in America are better than they were in 1981," said Harold Hodgkinson, director of the Center for Demographic Policy, a research organization in Washington. "I'm interested in a focus on the worst kids in the worst schools. Given the fact that everyone agrees that the bottom third of our kids are awful, they get very little spent on them."
But the purveyors of bad news are regrouping, charging the renegades with complacency and fighting them statistic by statistic. Even if schools over all are not much worse than 15 years ago, they say, they are nowhere near good enough, and they still trail America's competitors.
"The critics are wrong in saying the schools are just as good as they ever were," said Diane Ravitch, an Assistant Secretary of Education. "That is deeply damaging; it inspires complacency and a false sense of self-esteem. To say we do as well today as we did 20 years ago -- our kids today are not going to be competing with their parents, but with children being educated in other countries."
Although most Americans probably believe that schools are worse than ever, the defenders of American schools argue that they are as good or even better than before. Many indicators -- test scores, dropout rates, the performance of the top-ranked students -- have varied little in the past 15 to 20 years, they say.
They believe that whatever declines do exist have occurred because schools now, unlike those of a generation or two ago, are trying to educate everybody -- more immigrants, more minorities, more students who once would have dropped out and gotten good jobs on the assembly line. And they say international comparisons are flawed because American students as a whole are being compared to other countries' elites.
For example, the number of 17-year-olds who complete high school rose from 10 percent in 1910 to about 75 percent in 1965 and has stayed at about that level since, said Gerald W. Bracy, an educational consultant and former researcher for the National Education Association, who cites as his source the National Center for Education Statistics. Even that figure understates the number of students who eventually receive a high school diploma or its equivalent, he says; 91 percent of the class of 1980 had done so by 1986, according to a Department of Education study.
Not only are more children staying in school, but more are going to college, and so it makes sense that scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test would dip somewhat, said Mr. Bracy and a report by the Sandia National Laboratories of Alburquerque, N.M., which is financed by the Department of Energy.
Since the 1960's, they argue, more white students with lower grade-point averages and lower ranks in class and more minority students who historically have not scored well on the tests have taken S.A.T.'s. This accounts for the 5 percent decline in average S.A.T. scores in the last 20 years, the Sandia report said. Even so, Mr. Hodgkinson said, S.A.T. scores of 31 states actually rose between 1980 and 1990.
Moreover, children are scoring at about the same level on the most reliable standardized tests -- the federally financed National Assessment of Educational Progress, widely known among educators as the nation's report card. Reading scores are about the same as they were 20 years ago. Math scores have held steady since 1973. Science scores are somewhat lower than they were in 1969, but scores of 9- and 17-year-olds have improved steadily during the 1980's. Both these tests and S.A.T. tests show that scores for minorities have also risen.
Mr. Bracey and Mr. Hodgkinson contend that America's top-scoring students do as well as ever. Scores on the Graduate Record Examinations, required for graduate school, have risen even though more students have taken them. Average scores on tests required to attend business schools also rose. The percentage of students scoring above 600 points (out of 800) on the S.A.T. math and verbal scores fell until 1975 but has held steady since.
Yet for virtually every statistic the researchers produce, critics of American schools offer a rebuttal. Scores on the "nation's report card" tests may have stayed about the same for 20 years, but they are stuck at low levels, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Department of Education.
 
Still Not Good Enough?
 While American schools still produce some brilliant students, Ms. Ravitch argues that even at the top there is reason to fear. The percentage of students who scored above 600 on the verbal S.A.T. may have stabilized since 1975, she says, but go back only three years, to 1972, and the numbers will show a drop of 35 percent in the last 20 years.
Many scholars argue that the researchers are right to say that schools have not gone downhill, but are drawing the wrong conclusions.
"It's true, but it's irrelevant," said Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a Rochester research center. "Doing as well or slightly better than we used to do is doing appallingly badly relative to the rest of the world."
Here, too, the renegades contest conventional wisdom. Iris C. Rotberg, a senior social scientist at the Rand Corporation, argues that international science and mathematics comparisons are flawed because Americans are compared to other countries' elites, and curriculum differences are not weighed.
 
Strong in Research
 Although the tests indicate that, on the average, Americans trail all other students, comparisons from 1991 show that the top 10 percent of American students tested well compared with the top 10 percent of other countries. American scientists, Ms. Rotberg says, still account for one-third of all research papers -- far more than any other country.
While it may be true that existing international comparisons are imperfect, there is every reason to believe that America's major economic competitors are educating more of their students to a higher standard, said Ms. Ravitch, Mr. Tucker and a number of other scholars.
Some countries may have included only their elite students in math and science tests, but several of the United States' most important economic competitors, like Japan and South Korea, keep virtually all their students in school through age 16. Even if those countries tested only students in elite high schools, other researchers have found that Asian children are ahead of Americans in math as early as first grade.
Harold W. Stevenson, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, and his colleague, James W. Stigler, compared children's math performance in Japan, Taiwan and the United States over a 10-year period. They found that Asian children's scores were better in first grade, and that the older the children got, the further behind the Americans fell. Nor were many American children among the highest scorers, Mr. Stevenson said, so it was not just a question of the lesser students' bringing down the Americans' average.
"I'm convinced there's really a serious problem," said Mr. Stevenson, co-author with Mr. Stigler of "The Learning Gap," the new book about their study published by Summit Books.
 
A 'Triage' in Education?
 The debate, both sides say, has crucial implications for education policy. The revisionists argue that exaggerating the crisis in all American schools distorts policies that should be focused on poor schools where children are really failing.
"The top are doing as well as they need to," Mr. Hodgkinson said. "The middle are going to take care of themselves better than the lower third will. It's triage."
By contrast, the Bush education plan assumes that all schools must do better. "To say the only problem we have is inner-city schools is misleading," Ms. Ravitch said. "There are lots and lots of good suburban schools where kids have not gotten a good education. It's not the inner-city kids who are dragging us down."
A debate about which schools are in trouble, Mr. Tucker said, misses the point. "Our competitors haven't made these choices" between the best and worst students, he said. Instead, they teach most of their citizens the skills they need to find productive jobs and lead full lives. For example, Mr. Tucker said, the top 2 percent of American students perform as well on math tests as the top 50 percent of Japanese students.
In the end, he said, what this debate reveals is how few answers there are to the important questions -- how well are schools and students doing compared with other nations, and how will Americans know when their schools are good enough?

HEADLINE: Kentucky Presses Crackdown on Local School Mismanagement, Charging 4 People

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
In a continuing crackdown on mismanaged school districts, Kentucky education officials have charged school board members and a superintendent in four school systems with neglect of duty, influence peddling and misconduct.
The charges, filed by the Office of Education Accountability, an investigative arm of the State Legislature, will be reviewed Friday by the State Board of Education in Frankfort to determine whether the local school officials should be removed. 
 The actions are part of Kentucky's effort to overhaul its school systems and make them more accountable. Under a five-year legislative plan now in its second year, tougher curriculum and teacher standards have been mandated and schools have been given an additional $600 million in the first two years to meet the higher standards.
In return, schools must produce results, and the legislation gives state education officials authority to oust local school officials for failing, through mismanagement, to meet the new standards.
 
Money as Incentive
 Although 16 states have passed legislation giving state officials the authority to take over school districts and remove local school officials, Kentucky has moved more aggressively than other states to rein in errant school boards, largely because of its financial investment.
 
4 Rural Counties Involved
 "The public is saying we are putting a lot of money into public education at time when the economy is not doing very well," said Connie Bridge, director of the Institute of Education Reform at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. "We expect these school officials to be accountable to us, and when they aren't, they need to go."
This tougher stance has met mixed reactions across the state. In Harlan County, residents bitterly criticized the state after Thomas C. Boysen, the State Education Commissioner, in January removed three Harlan County school board members on charges of mismanagement.
The most recent charges, representing a variety of infractions, were filed against school board members in Hart County, Elliott County and Letcher County and the superintendent in Floyd County. All of the counties are rural.
One school board member was charged with misconduct after he and a high school teacher got into a fight at a basketball game over a disagreement about hiring a new superintendent, according to the Office of Education Accountability.
Another was charged with neglect of duty and immorality after several convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol and carrying concealed weapons.
The third board member was charged with misconduct after the Office of Education Accountability said he used his position on the board to steer school business to a coal delivery concern in which he has a financial interest.
And Ronald L. Hager, the superintendent of Floyd County Schools, was charged with filing fraudulent financial statements for the school district for the 1989 and 1990 fiscal years, according to the Office of Education Accountability. Mr. Hager declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Dow Loses 61.94 in Concern on Tokyo Fall

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks took their biggest dive of the year yesterday, as traders feared that a sharp 3.5 percent drop on the Tokyo Stock Exchange could have repercussions on Wall Street.
The Dow-Jones industrial average fell 61.94 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 3,213.55. It was the biggest loss for the widely watched Dow since a 120.31-point downturn on Nov. 15. Secondary issues fell even more sharply. The Nasdaq index lost 2.46 percent, or 14.68 points, to close at 581.61. 
 "There is great cause for concern about Japan," Cummins Catherwood, managing director of Rutherford Brown & Catherwood, said. "Everyone is apprehensive. They are losing some serious value over there."
Before the market opened, the 225-share Nikkei average plunged 644.82 points to close at 17,791.55, its lowest level in five and a half years. Market analysts fear that the continuing losses in Tokyo could force Japanese investors, who have substantial holdings of American equities, to sell some of their shares here to raise cash.
 
G.M. Up on Shake-Up
 Some issues bucked the trend, to be sure. Among active issues on the Big Board, General Motors rose 1 1/4, to 37 7/8. John Casesa, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, called the shares attractive after the company's outside directors forced a management shake-up on Monday.
Traders also said that a recent surge in oil prices above the $20-a-barrel level had raised concern about inflation, although crude oil prices backed off a bit yesterday, with the May contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange closing at $20.23, down 22 cents from Monday.
Stocks were down only modestly at midday, but fell steadily in the afternoon as computer-driven selling programs kicked in.
Analysts said the change of direction for oil could presage a change of direction for the Dow, and particularly of oil companies. Texaco eased 1 1/4, to 59 3/4. Exxon lost 1 1/8, to 56 5/8. Transportation stocks were also hard hit because of fears about rising fuel prices. The Dow Transport index fell 41.11 points, or 3 percent, to 1,312.22.
 
Further Losses Seen
 The analysts added that the market remained vulnerable to further losses. They said the Dow industrials could find support at the 3,200 level but that it was likely to be temporary.
"If the Japanese crisis blossoms out into being a major break from these levels, you will get a major effect on the United States market that could bring another sharp intermediate-term correction down to the 3,100 level," Dick Stein, vice president of MKI Securities, said.
The loss in the over-the-counter market, home to many high-flying technology issues, was the biggest of the year.
"People got out of a lot of positions today," said Patrick Davis, chief over-the-counter trader at Salomon Bros. "Some people were worried about the Japanese market getting crushed again."
Among technology stocks, Intel lost 1 5/8, to 56 1/4; Novell lost 2 5/8, to 53 1/2, and Apple Computer fell 3 1/2, to 57 1/4. Right Management dropped 9 1/2, to 8, after the company issued a disappointing forecast. Adobe plunged 5 1/2, to 43, although the company denied a Wall Street rumor that it was cutting prices on typefaces.
Advanced Micro Devices was off 1 1/4, at 17 5/8, despite a company report of continued high demand for its chips, and Telefonos de Mexico dropped 1 5/8, to 54 3/8.
A California-based retailer, Gottschalks Inc., fell 6 1/8, to 12 1/2, after posting lower-than-expected earnings of $2.86 million, or 27 cents a share.

HEADLINE: Major Issues to Address As Legislators Wind Up

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 7

 BODY:
More than a dozen major legislative proposals that would touch almost every Connecticut resident remain unresolved as the General Assembly heads into the final four weeks of its regular spring session.
The bills include a sweeping overhaul of the welfare system, a restructuring of how the tax system treats manufacturers and cuts in aid to education. Lawmakers say the fate of most, if not all, of the plans will be determined in closed party caucuses and deals made out of the public eye. 
 "It's a very strange session," said Senator Judith G. Freedman, a Republican from Westport and a ranking minority member of the joint Appropriations Committee, which ended its work on Monday without even trying to vote on the most divisive issues. "The system has definitely broken down at this point," she said.
Lawmakers, many of whom are still haunted by recollections of last year's budget battle over a state income tax, which kept the House and Senate in session for two and a half months after its spring adjournment date, say that this year's problems are different, but in some ways just as intractable.
 
Variations and Motivations
 "It's a very complex mosaic," said Senator George Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford. Last year, for example, Mr. Jepsen said there were essentially two directions to go: income tax or no income tax, with variations between those two poles. "This year there are a lot more affected groups," he said.
And different motivations. Mr. Jepsen said that some members of his party believe the deep cuts in social programs proposed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. are simply bad policy, while others view the situation through the prism of hard-headed politics.
"You will be judged on Election Day in part by how much you are able to save for your town," Mr. Jepsen said.
Liberals, in particular, have all but declared that they will hold the budget hostage, refusing to support bills to stimulate business until some of Mr. Weicker's deepest cuts in social spending, especially a proposed six-month cap on general assistance welfare relief, are eased.
 
'Cutting Heart of Safety Net'
 "All of it is worth doing; the state is in a major recession," said Representative Miles S. Rapoport, a Democrat from West Hartford, referring to the business package. "But we also have to realize that we can't leave individual victims of the recession drowning without a life raft," he added. "I'm for those things, but I'm not going to do it while we're cutting the heart out of our safety net."
The bills at issue can be divided into three groups: those that would cut state spending immediately, those that would try to restrain the growth of long-term state spending and those that would cut business taxes.
The main bills stuck in limbo include:
*A $113 million reduction in the state's general assistance welfare program. The plan was the centerpiece of Mr. Weicker's welfare proposal announced in February and opponents have now made it a central target. One of their proposals would lengthen the time that a person could stay on general assistance to nine months; current law has no limit, and Mr. Weicker has proposed a six-month cap.
*A "redefinition of manufacturing." This package of bills would extend sales-tax exemptions for manufacturers, and would give corporate income tax credits for money that companies spend on training, research and development. A related bill would give property-tax breaks to business in areas -- mainly the cities -- where property taxes are above the statewide average.
*An overhaul of the state laws on how salary and health benefits are calculated for municipal workers. One example: Under current law, if a local police officer develops hypertension, state law automatically assumes in figuring health or disability benefits that the condition is job-related. The revision would give the towns an opportunity to rebut that assumption, perhaps by showing that the officer had a poor diet. That bill is linked to a $163 million cut in aid to towns and cities for education.
 
Pressure to Find Answers
 Lawmakers say the possible permutations of which elements become law and which do not are vast, but the growing pressures to find answers are already producing strains. The Democratic Party's chairman, Edward L. Marcus, a moderate who has done battle with his party's liberal wing before, said today he believes the public wants action on the economy, and has pushed the development of a package of pro-business proposals that he said would be unveiled perhaps later this week.
"The overriding issue is the economy," Mr. Marcus said. "That overrides any issue the legislature is faced with."
A coalition of state employee unions, seeking to head off talk of state worker layoffs, held a news conference to say they hoped to be at the table in finding a budget resolution, not just on the menu.
"Our fear is that no one has knocked on our door yet," said Michael Ferrucci Jr., a spokesman for the unions. "We should not be looking to reduce the work force."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Short-Term Treasury Issues Gain

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The sharp drop in stock prices yesterday helped to push up prices of short-term Treasury bills and notes as investors leaving the equity market sought a liquid haven in Government securities.
Intermediate to long-term securities also posted gains, but traders said there was little activity in maturities of longer than five years. 
 And even though bond prices rose yesterday, dealers said that upward pressure on long-term interest rates may start to appear soon.
Beginning today, with an auction of $9.75 billion of new seven-year Treasury notes, credit market participants are looking at a six-week period when the amount of new Government securities being issued will be heavy.
In addition, an expected $1 billion offering today or tomorrow of long-term bonds from the Tennessee Valley Authority could also push long-term interest rates higher, traders said.
But the focus during yesterday's session was on stock markets around the world.
Continued erosion in share prices in Tokyo helped push Treasury prices higher during overnight trading. The trend accelerated once stocks began their steep slide on the New York Stock Exchange.
Economic and political instability in Japan and major European countries could prove to be a boon for the Treasury market over the next few weeks or months, some analysts say.
"We have serious problems of our own, but relative to what is going on in the rest of the world investing in the United States has not looked as attractive in the last two years as it does right now," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 13/32, up 6/32, to yield 7.87 percent, compared with 7.88 percent late Monday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 29/32 up 10/32, to yield 7.36 percent. And the 5 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/8, up 5/32, to yield 5.27 percent.
In advance of today's seven-year note auction, the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.07 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell sharply, to their lowest levels since mid-February.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.85 percent, down 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.95 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 12 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.09 percent.
A number of new issues were priced in the corporate bond market.
By far the largest offering was a $350 million sale 10-and 30-year securities securities for Telecommunications Inc.

The remaining $150 million of 10 1/8 percent 30-year debentures were priced at $100, or par, 2.24 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021.
Both parts of the issue are noncallable for life.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the offering. The securities are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Sprint Corporation offered $200 million of 30-year debentures through an underwriting group led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The 9 1/4 percent securities were priced at $98.505 to yield 9.40 percent, 1.50 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB- by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues had risen by about an eighth of a point in fairly active trading.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities said prices of most widely quoted bonds had also improved by about an eighth of a point.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Grains and Soybeans Fall After Winter Wheat Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Grain and soybean futures prices tumbled yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid profit taking prompted by a Government report that showed the winter wheat crop's condition to be in line with expectations.
Wheat for May delivery dropped 5 1/4 cents to settle at $3.64 1/2 a bushel; May corn fell 4 3/4 cents, to $2.57 1/4 a bushel; May oats fell 3 cents, to $1.38 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans fell 7 1/2 cents, to $5.70 1/2 a bushel. 
 Analysts said the decline mainly reflected selling by commodity funds after the Agriculture Department, late on Monday, rated the soft red winter wheat crop 67 percent poor to very poor in Indiana and 43 percent poor to very poor in Illinois.
 
Frost Damage in the Midwest
 The department said the overall winter wheat crop had been in mostly fair to good shape as of Sunday. Nothing in the report startled the wheat market, which had already factored in significant frost damage to the Midwestern crop from a hard freeze in early March.
"We had talked up some deterioration in the wheat areas, and the report confirmed it," said Don Roose, grains analyst with U.S. Commodities Inc. in Des Moines.
The selling began in the wheat pit after a slightly higher opening and spread to the other grain and soybean markets in the afternoon as commodity funds liquidated their holdings.
"It all came to a climax near the close," said John Frazier, director of agricultural trading for Gerald Inc. in Chicago. "There was more selling in the corn pit than I've seen for a long, long time."
He said the corn and soybean markets were also under pressure from expectations that farmers with severely damaged wheat would plow up those fields and replant them with corn or soybeans.
Yesterday's 61.94-point drop in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fueled further selling of grains and other commodities, analysts said.
 
Crude Oil Futures Decline
 Crude oil futures retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising in five of the six previous sessions.
"Oil has been moving higher and higher for a couple of weeks here, so a correction certainly wasn't unexpected," said Randolph Donney, chief of commodity research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Crude oil for May fell 22 cents, to $20.23 a barrel; May heating oil rose 0.51 cent, to 55.45 cents a gallon; May unleaded gasoline fell 1.15 cents, to 62.32 cents a gallon; May natural gas fell 3 cents, to $1.285 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in a Broad Decline While Gold Is Also Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against all major currencies except the Japanese yen, and many dealers said trading was cautious in the absence of any significant economic news.
Gold was lower, with an ounce for current delivery closing on the New York Commodity Exchange at $338.70 a troy ounce, down $1.70. A late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $338.30 an ounce, off $1.45. 
 Currency analysts said the dollar drifted throughout most of the session, with no new economic reports to influence its direction. A 61.94-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average led to mild selling of the dollar late in the session, said Kevin Lawrie, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston.
 
Rumors of Cut by Fed
 Mr. Lawrie said the dollar also declined after market speculation that the Federal Reserve could move to lower the short-term interest rates if tomorrow's money-supply report showed weakness. Lower interest rates would make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
The dollar started the session higher after another brisk selloff in the Japanese stock market, said Bob Near, vice president for corporate sales at the Bank of New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to close at 133.35 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.25 yen. At closing in New York, the dollar was trading at 133.10 yen, up from 132.90 late Monday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7490, from $1.7500 late Monday. At closing in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.7505, up from $1.7480 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6235 German marks, down from 1.6250; 1.4900 Swiss francs, down from 1.4925; 5.4950 French francs, down from 5.5040; 1,224 Italian lire, down from 1,227.00, and 1.18795 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18855.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, were: 1.6250 German marks, up from 1.6210; 1.4910 Swiss francs, up from 1.4885; 5.4505 French francs, down from 5.4920; 1.8289 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8255; 1,225.50 Italian lire, down from 1,226.50, and 1.1879 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1875

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Choreographing The Deficit Dance

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
EVERYBODY knows that a bigger budget deficit would be bad news.
Everybody, that is, except the 100 heavyweight economists (including six Nobel winners) who last week urged Washington to douse the recession with some old-fashioned Keynesian pump-priming. And Robert D. Reischauer, the widely respected director of the Congressional Budget Office, who last week warned that penny pinching on the deposit-insurance bailout would increase its ultimate cost while adding only cosmetic improvements in deficit finance. 
 Confused? Read on at your peril. The rationales for taking the deficit figures with a grain of salt are many and varied. And the very latest contribution to the debate, a clever way of looking at fiscal policy called generational accounting, challenges the very logic behind deficit arithmetic.
Part of the problem is that deficits are only part of The Problem. Most of those 100 would-be pump-primers worry a lot about the consequences of deficit finance, but worry more about the costs in waiting for the economy to recover on its own.
Others point out that all deficits are not created equal. An extra billion invested in education to make sure Johnny can read by the time he graduates from junior college is not the same as, say, an extra billion in tax cuts to help families pay their heating bills. In a better world, they say, the Government would keep separate books for capital and current expenses.
Consider, too, Mr. Reischauer's rationale for taking deposit insurance out of the deficit equation. The half-trillion dollars needed to make good on deposit-insurance claims is real money. In the most immediate macroeconomic sense, though, the transfer from the Treasury to depositors' accounts has no consequence: The cash is unlikely to affect the total demand for goods and services because the depositors receiving the cash never thought they had lost it.
But none of these qualifications touch the issue addressed in "Generational Accounting," a new book by the Boston University economist Lawrence Kotlikoff. Developed by Mr. Kotlikoff along with Alan Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania and Jagadeesh Gokhale of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, generational accounting is a radically different way of calling fiscal balls and strikes.
The core objection to deficit spending for consumption today is that it comes at the expense of consumption tomorrow -- that today's taxpayers are racking up bills that future generations will be obliged to pay. Mr. Kotlikoff agrees, but puts a very different spin on the conventional wisdom.
This year's deficit, he suggests, is only a snapshot of fiscal events in motion. Government spending and taxes -- notably, big-ticket items like Social Security -- create a stream of benefits and an offsetting stream of financial obligations that differ from age group to age group. And what ought to count in measuring generational equity is not who gets what in 1992, but how fiscal policies affect each age group's lifetime balance of benefits and obligations.
Seen in this light, black often becomes white and white, black. In the 1950's, for example, a period of seeming fiscal prudence, Washington voted to increase Social Security pensions without taxing the likely recipients. Then in the 1980's, a period of apparent fiscal profligacy, Congress stripped down the future pension benefits of workers while dramatically raising their payroll taxes.
Mr. Kotlikoff would replace static deficit calculations with generational accounts showing how much, in "present value" terms, each age group (as well as generations unborn) can expect to pay and expect to receive from government. A sample accounting for the year 1989 shows that 20-year-olds can, on average, expect to be net losers to the tune of some $169,000 over their lifetimes. But 65-year-olds, who have paid most of their lifetime tax bill and are about to receive Social Security, are in the black by $32,000.
How to measure generational neutrality? One might wish the newly born to pay no more than they get back. Or one might compare the net payment expected from the just-born with the payment from those yet unborn.
In the 1989 calculation, newborns will shell out $74,000 more in taxes than they can expect in benefits, while the unborn will be left footing a bill of $90,000. The sum of current spending and taxing policies, it seems, favors the mature over the young, and the living over those yet to come.
A big problem with generational accounting is that much of the benefit stream, such as the flow of services from military defense, is hard to apportion. Mr. Kotlikoff's solution, simply leaving out such intangibles, begs the issue.
But there is little doubt that generational accounting, especially year-to-year changes in the accounts and changes associated with specific policy decisions, says something important -- something that cannot be captured in the standard deficit arithmetic.

HEADLINE: THE WINE REGIONS: SOUTH AFRICA;
Long History of Wine Emerges From a Cloud

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

DATELINE: STELLENBOSCH, South Africa

 BODY:
SOMETIME in the next few days, a container filled with South African wine will arrive at Savannah, Ga. It is the first South African wine shipped to the United States since sanctions were imposed on the South African Government in 1986 because of its policy of racial segregation.
Wine makers in this verdant southwest corner of Africa have been looking forward to this first shipment since the sanctions were lifted last July, looking forward with joy and apprehension. Will the Americans like their wine? Will the deep-seated American revulsion toward apartheid linger on in the form of antipathy toward their products? Will it persist even though, they say, the tide has turned in the long fight here against institutionalized racism. 
 "We know it will take time, perhaps a long time," said John Platter, a wine grower and author of a definitive guide to South African wine. "But we are proud of our wines and we are proud of what we have done to bring South Africa back into the family of nations."
Like most white South Africans, the winegrowers of the Cape hailed the referendum on March 17 in which an stunning 68.7 percent of the white voters called for continued negotiations with the country's blacks toward a new majority government. South Africa has about five million whites and 30 million blacks.
South Africa is a very old wine-producing nation. In fact, South African wine makers know the exact date that their history began: Feb. 2, 1659. On that day, Jan Van Riebeck, who had led the first Dutch settlers ashore seven years earlier, wrote in his diary: "Today, praise be to God, wine was pressed for the first time from Cape grapes."
In the 18th and 19th centuries, South African wines, especially Constantia, were among the most famous wines in the world. According to the English writer Nicholas Faith, when the wine cellar book of Louis XVI was discovered many years after his death, it showed that he owned some Burgundy, almost no Bordeaux and many thousands of bottles of Constantia from the slopes of the Cape of Good Hope.
The first vines were planted not by the Dutch, but by the second group of immigrants to the Cape, French Huguenots, who brought vine cuttings with them from Europe. Their traditions live on in the lovely Franschhoek Valley, 40 miles east of Cape Town, where the wine makers call themselves vignerons and wineries bear names like Clos Cabriere, La Motte and Haute Provence.
From the earliest days, the white settlers strove to distance themselves from the blacks they found here. To insure the division held, the whites imported workers -- slaves, actually -- from Southeast Asia to toil in the vineyards. Intermingling between the Malays, as they were called, and the white settlers produced the ethnic group known as the Cape colored, who continue to provide most of the farm labor in the western Cape.
Indeed, under the byzantine laws of apartheid, especially the Group Areas Act, the western Cape was designated as a preferential area for the Cape colored. This meant, in effect, that blacks were barred from the region. Blacks work in the Cape now, but the Cape colored predominate, particularly in agriculture.
The history of South African agriculture, like that of sharecropping and mining in the United States, is one of exploitation. Workers usually lived in housing provided by the farmers, with rent and food costs deducted from their wages. The system gave rise to a practice called the tot, in which overtime, and sometimes a part of regular wages, was paid in cheap wine.
The tot, which kept workers drunk and in debt, has disappeared from most wineries and vineyards but persists in outlying areas, on many small farms that supply grapes to the industry but make no wine themselves. "It's a terrible practice," Mr. Platter said, "but it is still around."
Even the practice of housing workers on the vineyards and farms is coming into question. Most wineries are proud of their worker housing and are eager to show the little cottages to visitors. Many are building additional or larger worker homes. But one of the area's oldest -- and newest -- wineries, Vergelegen, in Somerset West, will have no on-premises housing for workers when its current rebuilding is completed.
"That's the wave of the future," said Francis Wilson, a professor of economics at the University of Cape Town, who has written extensively on rural poverty on South African. "Agricultural workers are getting better wages; many have cars. It's a different life now."
One of the most persistent advocates of change in the wine country has been Mr. Platter. With his wife, Erica, he owns and operates Clos du Ciel, a winery and vineyard on a mountain slope south of Stellenbosch, about 25 miles east of Cape Town. Previously, he owned Delaire Vineyards, in the hills west of town.
But most of his energy has gone into the regular revision of his book, "John Platter's South African Wine Guide," and to agitating for reforms in the South African wine industry.
Beginning in the mid-1980's, he led a small group of wine makers who dedicated themselves to ending exploitative industry practices that stemmed, the group believed, from the Government's racist policies.
They drew up what they called the Winelands Committment, a statement in which they pledged to end racial discrimination and unfair labor practices in their business. They were, the statement said, "dedicated to the constant improvement of South African wines, recognizing our objectives cannot be properly achieved in a country dominated by issues of race and inequality."
They said they were committed to "the principle that all land and vineyard ownership be opened unconditionally to all races, and that the Group Areas Act be removed," as it has been; to "freedom of association for all our colleagues and employees," and to "the ending of apartheid policies in South Africa."
When the Winelands Committment was first made public, in 1989, only four winegrowers would sign it: Simon Barlow, whose family owns Rustenberg, one of the oldest estates in Stellenbosch; John Younghusband, at Haute Provence in Franschhoek; Tim Hamilton Russell, whose vineyards are at Hermanus, about 40 miles east of Cape Town, on the coast, and Mr. Platter.
As the country moved toward an end to official discrimination, more wine makers signed up. Still, Mr. Platter keeps a file of letters from colleagues who agreed with the Winelands Committment but felt it might not be wise to say so publicly.
The conservative side of the wine industry is represented by the Cooperative Winegrowers' Association, commonly known by the abbreviation of its Afrikaans name, K.W.V.
The K.W.V., with some 5,000 members, is a uniquely South African body that exercises immense power over what wines are made and who makes them. It was organized in 1918 when the industry was depressed by weak markets and overproduction.
The association produces nearly 80 percent of all South African wine and spirits aside from beer. But beyond that, it has been given regulatory powers by the Government to set quotas based on grape tonnage that apply to all growers, whether K.W.V. members or not.
Thus, when Mr. Hamilton Russell wanted to plant his vineyards near Hermanus, he could not because he had no grape quota. He had to wait until he could buy someone else's unused quota. When he produced his first Burgundy-style pinot noir, he found that the K.W.V. forbade the use of any foreign grape names on wine labels. So he called the wine Grand Vin Noir. That rule was rescinded, but he still cannot mention Burgundy in his literature or on his labels.
Under the production quota system established by the association in 1957, grape-growing was banned outside the existing hot-climate regions, where high yields of grapes were normal. When a new breed of wine makers wanted to plant the more delicate fine-wine grape varieties in cooler regions, they discovered that there were no quotas for those areas, so no planting was permitted. They found, too, that the noble varieties they had hoped to plant, like chardonnay and pinot noir, would have to undergo 10 years or more of testing for diseases by the association before they could be used commercially.
Despite the bans, vines were smuggled in, and eventually the K.W.V. relented and permitted their use.
"The K.W.V. system is to pay for high yield," Mr. Hamilton Russell said. "It's outmoded -- soul-destroying, actually -- for serious wine makers."
The ban on French names was part of deal struck with the French Government in the 1930's. France agreed to import South African lobsters if South Africa would ban the use of French names for its wines. Grape types and French geographical references were barred from the labels.
Some of South Africa's most prominent wineries have regularly paid enormous sums to permit them to go over their quotas. Pieter Malan, whose family owns Simonsig, a famous Stellenbosch winery that is often fined for overproduction, has taken the association to court over its statutory right to review all his winery records.
K.W.V. officials defend their restrictions, noting that they brought order and relative prosperity to a business that was degenerating into chaos earlier in the century. They agree that the fine wine business has different criteria, note that restrictions have been eased and hint that even more changes are imminent. The word among the winegrowers is that even the despised quota system may be on its way out.
South Africa's problems are far from over. With the lifting of the Group Areas Act and two Lands Acts in 1990, blacks were free to move anywhere in the country. Some 500,000 headed for the Western Cape because of its relative prosperity. A handful found jobs; the rest did not. They live in a vast squatters' camp stretching eastward from Cape Town for almost 20 miles.
Somehow, they must be absorbed into the region's economic mainstream. Few will find work in the vineyards. In spite of the challenges facing the region, the wine makers remain optimistic. "Changes are coming," Mr. Malan said. "We don't know what all of them will be, but they are long overdue and we welcome them."

Five Days to Platinum
Record retailers are rubbing their hands together with glee: five albums released last week have created a real burst of buying. Three of the albums -- Bruce Springsteen's "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" and Def Leppard's "Adrenalize" -- were predictable successes. But the other two -- Wynonna Judd's "Wynonna" (Curb/MCA), her first since the breakup of the Judds, and "Totally Krossed Out" (Columbia), a debut album by a young black pop group called Kris Kross -- were a surprise. 
 "Wynonna" has been almost shockingly successful. MCA reported sales of more than a million copies in the first five business days of the record's availability, and in some markets it has been out-selling Mr. Springsteen's albums.
"I've been involved in platinum albums before, but to achieve it in five days is pretty remarkable," said Bruce Hinton, president of MCA- Nashville. "Certainly no prior Judds' album had that sort of impact in the first week."
MCA originally shipped out 600,000 copies of the album, and within two days virtually every record chain came back for more. Mr. Hinton said that the Musicland chain started on Tuesday with 28,000 copies, ordered 15,000 more on Wednesday, 44,000 on Thursday and on Thursday afternoon ordered 11,000 more.
In "Wynonna," Ms. Judd moves toward Bonnie Raitt territory: spare and clean pop music with a Southern accent. Industry observers say the album probably has the power to keep on selling.
"I trust Tony Brown, who produced the record," said Ms. Judd. I wanted so badly to improve and change, but not go too far. I knew what I didn't want, and on several tracks I'd change things around, usually taking out instruments or making a track rely on piano instead of guitar. I've always believed that the voice is the main instrument, and I wanted it heard. And I wanted a live feel to it. I've always believed that if you can't do something live, don't do it on record."
Ms. Judd started the album last May, in the middle of the Judds' farewell tour. It took her 10 months to make.
"I had to ask myself 'Do you want to be the Entertainer of the Year or do you want to make the Album of the Year?" she said. "I went back to the time when I first discovered music and tried to figure out what I liked. Tony Brown and I went to publishing houses looking for material, and I was frustrated because I was walking in as if I were new, and they didn't know what I wanted. So it took a long time to get songs. But we finally worked it out, and each one of the tunes strikes a chord in me now. I really live these songs. I bleed them."
 
A Family Affair
 Not too many pop groups can get their audience to speak in tongues, though most probably wish they could. The Winans, who are appearing at the Beacon Theater for three shows this Saturday, can do just that. The group, pop's foremost pop-gospel band, tears the house up, putting on a show that, if it weren't for the preaching and the references to Him, acts like a classic soul group. Pleading and crying and shouting, the singers turn the audience into a frenzied mass.
The group, made up of the brothers Marvin, Carvin, Michael and Ronald, is part of a larger entity, the entire Winans family from Detroit. The family, comprising 10 children and the elder Winanses, Dolores and David, will be performing at the Beacon. The three-hour show features spots for two of the Winans daughters, BeBe and CeCe, who have a flourishing career of their own.
"This is something we'd talked about for years," said Marvin Winans. "God's made all things beautiful; it was time to do it. So far, everywhere we go it's been sell-out or near sell-out crowds. It's a great commentary that in these economically depressed times this country needs to see a family that's functioning. That needs to be seen. Our faith isn't a hobby, and we hope it's something that imparts inspiration."
That faith comes across in concert, where the brothers do some preaching. But it also comes across in the singing, which displays a passion rarely heard in secular music. The group is one of the great live shows working in American music today.
"I think live is what we do best," Mr. Winans said. "You're able to get that spontaneity that exists with a live audience. They give and you give back to them. We want people to have a great time because we have a great time. We want people to know that Jesus is real. We want people to know that you can be a church and have a blast, have a great time. Music is spiritual; it's uplifting music, very, very powerful. It moves you to change."
 
Diamanda Galas on Record
 The singer Diamanda Galas has just released a new album, "The Singer" (Mute/Elektra), that features blues and gospel tunes from Screaming Jay Hawkins's "I Put a Spell on You" to "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot." The versions aren't precisely faithful. Ms. Galas screams and contorts her voice until the tunes haven't a shred of idiomatic consistency; instead, they're anguished.
"The gospel stuff is cries in the dark," said Ms. Galas. "It's consistent with what I've been doing a lot of -- work related to AIDS, for example. I could say I'm reappropriating that music for what's happening in my community, the AIDS community. Gospel music is military music in the sense that the people doing it are in the front lines; they stay alive in the face of despair and overwhelming oppression. And it's the music of ecstasy."
The blues pieces are a little less dire. Ms. Galas, who accompanies herself on piano, knows the material well (she played piano in her father's dance band when she was a teen-ager in San Diego) but she redoes the melodies, keeping some of the words. There's a real attempt to make over the tunes to fit her own needs.
"All of that music, I understand from personal experience," said Ms. Galas. "I've never done love right. I get the music right, but when it comes to love I'm a total failure."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Showalter Gives Short Notice, but Yanks Deliver

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
The season opener game was an hour away and Buck Showalter still did not have a Yankee lineup. Was the rookie manager kidding himself? Roger Clemens would soon be pitching for Boston, so this was no joke. Decisions had to be made.
Showalter made them when he was ready. He waited for updated reports on two injured players, then cobbled together a lineup that rapped Clemens for three runs in the sixth inning to thrust the Yankees to a 4-3 victory over the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. 
 It was only one game in the standing, but it included the glamour of opening day and the rare conquest of Clemens, so the Yankees had reason to rejoice.
When it was over, before 56,572 fans had spilled out into the Bronx, Showalter, the new decision-maker, did not leave the dugout. He savored his first victory by sitting back and watching his players congratulate one another. He might have been pondering the odyssey that took him from being unemployed to being manager, or he might have been thinking about his father's recent death, but he would not say.
 
Going My Way?
 "That was their moment," said Showalter, when asked why he did not join the celebration. "I had nothing to do with the way they played. Besides, I knew they had to pass by me to get to the clubhouse."
And Showalter had several hands to shake when the players reached him. There was Roberto Kelly, who embraced the third spot in the order by driving in three of New York's four runs. There was Randy Velarde, who neatly replaced the injured Mike Gallego at shortstop, batted leadoff and scored twice. There was Scott Sanderson, who pitched six stellar innings and baffled Boston with off-speed pitches. And there was some spirit.
"There were things we did right today that we wouldn't have done last year," Sanderson said. "We had a little bit more of a fighting attitude. Believe me, that starts from the top."
It was actually the top of the 11th hour lineup that lifted the Yankees back from a 2-1 deficit in the sixth. Velarde bounced a single to center to open the inning and moved to third on Don Mattingly's tricky single by third baseman Wade Boggs. Mattingly slapped at a pitch, the ball spun toward the line and Boggs seemed to tangle his feet as he moved to the right in hopeless pursuit.
Mattingly's single set up the pivotal inning as Kelly followed with a double that rolled to the wall in left center field. That double gave the Yankees a 3-2 edge and gave Kelly a confidence boost.
"I want them to expect a lot from me because I do too," Kelly said. "When there is a situation like that, I want to be the guy they look to."
Kelly advanced to third on a groundout and scored the inning's third run on another strange hit. With the infield playing in to reduce Kelly's chances of scoring on a grounder, Danny Tartabull fisted a broken bat, 100-foot looping single that bounced in front of second base and barely eluded Boston's infielders to make the score 4-2.
"Things were pretty bizarre in the sixth," Clemens said. "They found a way to get things in there."
Tartabull almost did not play because of a sprained right wrist and declined to speak to reporters before the game because he was confused about his status. Then the player who is being paid $5.1 million to drive in runs poked one of the cheaper run-scoring hits he will ever manage.
 
Taking a Firm Stand
 "I thought it looked great," said Tartabull, who is 6 for 36 in his career against Clemens, with a deadpan expression.
Boston, which had taken its 2-1 lead on home runs by Phil Plantier and Mo Vaughn, scored once in the seventh and forced the Yankees to stave off a comeback bid in the ninth. This time Steve Farr and Mattingly snuffed out the rally. After Tony Pena singled, the Red Sox attempted to sacrifice him to second, but Mattingly rushed forward to grab Luis Rivera's well-placed bunt and nail the lead runner at second. Then Farr finished the game by striking out Boggs looking on a 2-2 fastball and getting Jody Reed on a foul pop.
That's when Showalter relaxed and remained in the dugout, suspending himself in the joyous moment and then dismissing the victory like a veteran. He knows there are 161 games left. Plenty of time to lose a few.
"It was a great afternoon for the organization and the club," said Showalter, "but I don't want to make too big a deal out of it."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 MIKE GALLEGO was placed on the 15-day disabled list before the opener because of a bruised right heel. The transaction is retroactive to March 28, meaning he is eligible to return on Sunday. Utility infielder ANDY STANKIEWICZ , a six-year minor leaguer, assumed the roster spot. . . . Yankee Stadium ushers, who also provide security, picketed outside the park before the game and Mayor DAVID N. DINKINS did not attend the game, refusing to cross the line, according to a spokesman for the Mayor.

HEADLINE: FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
$1.4 Billion in Debentures Are Priced by Fannie Mae

 BODY:
The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, priced for sale a total of $1.4 billion in debentures, equally divided between 5-year and 10-year maturities, through various securities dealers.
For the five-year issue, the interest rate is set at 7 percent and offered at a price of 99.875 to yield 7.03 percent, or about 28 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. 
 The interest rate for the 10-year isssue is set at 7.9 percent and offered at 99.875 to yield 7.918 percent, or about 51 basis points more than comparable Treasury securities.
Fannie Mae says the five-year debenture is callable on or after April 10, 1995, while the 10-year is callable on or after April 10, 1997. Both issues begin making interest payments on Oct. 10 this year.
In a separate development, the agency also announced that it planned to provide Great Western Bank of Beverly Hills, Calif., with up to $6 billion in mortgage financing money, by purchasing mortgages from the bank for cash.

HEADLINE: The Man With the Ball

 BODY:
Almost everyone could find some comfort in yesterday's Democratic primary results.
Republicans could relish the complex new evidence that the Democrats seem never to tire of finding ways to tarnish their chances for victory in November.
Paul Tsongas supporters were entitled to a genuine "Wow! What a moral victory!" Their man wasn't even running, yet he ran twice as well as expected in New York. They are alive with hope that the announcement he promises for this morning is that he's getting back in the race. 
 Jerry Brown supporters could say, "Hey, look how far we've come!" Only weeks ago, the only number they could count on began "1-800." Now, with almost no money and no organization, the former California Governor has gone from nowhere to winning about a quarter of the vote in New York and about a third in Wisconsin.
And even people who favor None Of The Above, who hope to manipulate the entry of a new candidate in a brokered convention, could say: "Look -- Six voters out of ten voted against the front-runner. That proves we need someone else if we're to beat George Bush in November."
Even so, once all sides have put their particular spin on the results, those results need to be calculated -- not in moral victories, momentum or restless dissatisfaction but rather in the inescapable arithmetic of wins, losses and delegates. And almost any way one slices the results, Bill Clinton won.
Yesterday did not give him the clarity or acceleration he must have hoped for. Dismayingly, half the New York Democratic voters told exit poll-takers that they doubted he had the integrity to serve effectively as President. Even among those who voted for him in New York, half did so with reservations.
The new results are so muddy that he'll have to slog through Pennsylvania three weeks hence and then on and on till the closing California and New Jersey primaries in June.
Still, once all yesterday's calculations are complete, Governor Clinton will have won something like 1,300 of the 2,144 delegates needed for nomination, and will have a strong start on winning many of the rest. He may not be winning cleanly; each win leaves its scars. But he's the man with the ball. Even his foes acknowledge his endurance and organization.
Those may, finally, be Bill Clinton's decisive qualities, more important than his intelligent program for the country. His endurance is likely to mock the easy pirouettes of people eager for a brokered convention that can anoint some unblemished, irresistible savior.
Abdicating to such a choice would be like ordering the fullback, muddy and bruised after driving the ball close to the goal line, to hand it over to someone, uniform still sparkling, who wasn't willing to get in the game from the start.
Paul Tsongas, who preached his own sound economic sermon for months before dropping out, deserves more consideration than that. Bill Clinton, who has resolutely stayed in and surmounted one obstacle after another, surely does.

HEADLINE: Come to Kiev. Listen to Ukraine.

BYLINE: By Volodymyr Lanovoy; Volodymyr Lanovoy is Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy of Ukraine.

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has been determined to become a full member of the world community. But in the West, Ukraine is seen as unpredictable and unreasonable, particularly in its dealings with Russia.
We are often charged with reckless nationalism but the claim is seldom examined. Ukraine has been losing the propaganda war, creating unwanted and unnecessary dangers for everyone.
A principal explanation for the misperception is that news accounts and expert opinion in the West have a pro-Russian bias. For example, the $24 billion Western program of assistance announced last week was reported as aid to Russia, with little attention to Ukraine's share in it.
The explanation for this tilt is that the West has long had strong contacts with Moscow and poor contacts with Kiev. The former Soviet Government and Communist Party funneled everything through Moscow; the Government and party are gone, but the funnel remains.
The U.S. Government's presence in Russia is substantial, but not in Ukraine, which is the size of France. Hundreds of members of the international press corps are permanently stationed in Moscow, but only a handful are found in Kiev. Western business and academic ties have been almost exclusively with Russia.
There is alarm in the West when Ukraine questions the fate of tactical nuclear weapons that are being removed to Russia. But Western accounts never ask if Ukraine's questions have merit. What is happening to the weapons? Are they being destroyed, as agreed, or simply being relocated in Russia?
It surprises Ukrainians that the West, with its history of demands for verification in arms control, finds such concerns surprising. Western representatives talk only with officials in Moscow about removal of the weapons. If the West does not talk with officials in Ukraine, aren't Ukrainians right to raise their own alarms?
The West parrots the charge that Ukraine wants to create an army of 400,000 troops. It would be easy to talk with Ukrainians and find out that this would mean a more than two-thirds reduction in troops now in Ukraine. Such a rapid reduction will create enormous problems. The difficulty of finding work and housing for the former soldiers is the principal reason that the immediate reduction cannot be greater. The long-term plan is to have an even smaller army.
Western press reports have repeated the propaganda that Ukraine was unwilling to carry its share of the debt of the former Soviet Union. Anyone who has visited Kiev knows that Ukraine has always agreed to pay its share of the debts. But Ukraine also demands its share of the assets.
Nonetheless, the West cooperates when Russia takes all the assets. The Soviet seat on the U.N. Security Council is now the Russian seat. Possibly the seat could not be divided. But is this true for Soviet embassies that are now Russian embassies, for Soviet hard-currency earnings that are now Russian, for Soviet gold -- and for the Black Sea fleet, over which Boris Yeltsin reasserted control yesterday.
Perhaps the most revealing complaint associated with the Western misunderstanding of Ukraine involves its plan to replace the ruble with the hryvna, the new Ukrainian currency.
Those few Western experts who have been to Kiev and have listened are convinced that everyone, including Russia, will be better served if Ukraine moves quickly to a new currency that can support its economic reforms. Introducing a new currency is not reckless nationalism; it is responsible and necessary in order to preserve trade and develop economic relations with other countries, including Russia.
Russia must understand that it has truly independent countries on its borders. The challenge Ukraine faces is to act as responsibly as possible and to strengthen contacts with everyone, including Russia and the West, while it transforms its economy, politics and society.
The challenge for the West is to work at strengthening ties with new countries like Ukraine. Just four months ago, Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence. Ukraine won't go back. Neither can the West. Throw off old habits, come to Kiev and talk with Ukrainians about Ukraine.

HEADLINE: What's Right With Brown's Proposed Flat Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Mr. Brown's Flat Tax: Tilted" (editorial, March 27) is itself tilted. As a practicing certified public accountant in New York more than 35 years, I have long been in favor of a flat tax. We accountants have much better things to do than continue to account for the ploys of politicians who change the tax code for their constituents' special interests; for the unions, the Government employees and all the rest who would derive advantage from loopholes.
The Robert Hall-Alvin Rabushka plan you favor is a poor solution. Once you start to have exemptions, credits and progressive rates, you again start the ball rolling for complexity and change. I find that taxpayers, generally, would much prefer to know there is one set rate with an unchangeable code to rely upon, rather than a constantly changing code, continually amended. 
 The rich would not be able to shelter a dime (particularly if a flat tax is at the source, on gross income); the poor and middle classes could depend on a constant rate.
You, like most economists and politicians, have yet to define a middle-income taxpayer. When my father was working three jobs in the 1950's, for an income of $40,000 to $50,000, we thought we were a typical middle-income family. Now, 35 years later, people still consider figures of $25,000 to $50,000 a year as middle income. If that is so, how would it have been possible for me to attend college for $5,000 to $7,500 a year in those days, and for today's "middle-income" parents to afford $18,000 to $22,000 a year for the same schooling?
Finally, a value-added tax, much in use in Europe, and much like a national sales tax, would, to me, put the burden on the rich, who are the big spenders. One might exempt the V.A.T. on the staples of life, food, clothing and shelter. To these I'd even add one additional staple -- education.

HEADLINE: What's Right With Brown's Proposed Flat Tax;
Increase Savings

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The tax law changes that the Bush Administration and the Democrats propose address short-term voter appeal. The tax packages do not focus on a way to increase savings, which will allow for long-term capital investment in production and for rebuilding infrastructure.
Inflation devalues our savings, and then savings are taxed as income. A deduction should be allowed for the yearly average rate of inflation from our gross earned income. And it is time for our elected representatives to remove the taxes on income derived from savings accounts. This is seed money for investment in a more productive future. 
 It will encourage our dwindling middle class to embrace the ideal of thrift again.

HEADLINE: Bank Yields Are Mixed Once Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were mixed for the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor. It was the third straight week of mixed results.
"With the demand for loans down at banks, there is no pressing need to pull in more cash," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. "In fact there is a bountiful amount of money, and the lending institutions are awash with cash." 
 "Low interest rates and the lack of borrowers have placed banks in a hard place," Mr. Heady said. "Rates show no sign of snapping up, since there doesn't seem to be a need to replenish funds."
 
Busy Time of Year
 April is traditionally a month high in rollovers of certificates of deposit, and low interest rates may cause some erosion in banks' customer base as depositors seek higher yields elsewhere.
Yields at New York area banks slipped, with the average yield on a money market account at 3.63 percent, down 5 basis points, and three- and six-month certificates, down a basis point, to 3.65 percent and 3.80 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Among commercial banks, the slippage was not as great, with money Market accounts down an average 3 basis points, to 3.37 percent, and six-month certificates down a basis point, to 3.55 percent. Three-month certificates, however, were up 2 basis points, to 3.48 percent.
At savings insitutions everything was down, with money market accounts off 7 basis points, to 3.89 percent, and three-month certificates at 3.85 percent, down 2 basis points. The six-month certificiate dropped a basis point, to 4.05 percent.
The biggest movers this week in the New York area included Emigrant Savings Bank, which cut 50 basis points off its money market account, to 3.5 percent, and Chemical Bank, which raised the rate on its three-month C.D. by 31 basis points, to 3.4 percent. The Bank of Tokyo in New York cut 22 basis points off its six-month certificate, to 3.4 percent.
For 20 large banks outside the New York area, yields were up for a six-month certificate and off only slightly on money market accounts. The average money account was down a basis point, to 3.56 percent, and a six-month C.D. rose 4 basis points, to 3.95 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly bill auction on Monday, interest rates slid further, with the average rate of three- and six-month bills at 3.95 percent and 4.02 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: Peru's Maoist Drug Dealers

SERIES: Second of two articles

BYLINE: By Stephen G. Trujillo; Stephen G. Trujillo, a former Army Ranger and Green Beret, is writing a book about his work for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Peru. The views expressed in this article are his own.

 BODY:
Some well-meaning analysts still ignore the truth about Shining Path, the Maoist revolutionary movement terrorizing Peru. While the guerrillas may be ruthless, those who romanticize them claim they are untainted by the drug trade that poisons Peruvian society. This is a myth.
I know from my experience working for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Peru that the guerrillas are systematically involved in all levels of the drug trade in the Upper Huallaga Valley, where most of the world's coca is grown. 
 This state of affairs is important for the U.S. to keep in mind as it re-evaluates its policy toward Peru in light of this week's military-backed crackdown. The Peruvian military, itself implicated in drug corruption, has argued that fighting Shining Path is the key to stabilizing Peru. The U.S., which temporarily suspended assistance on Monday, has emphasized the war on drugs. As we will see, the two fronts are intricably linked.
On July 2, 1990, I was advising a detachment of the Peruvian drug police southwest of the village of Nuevo Progreso in the Upper Huallaga. We torched a drug laboratory owned by a Shining Path cell called Los Tigres.
Plates of rice on the table were still warm, the cocaine base residue in the drying filters was moist, and there were fresh notations on Maoist lesson plans left in the house. More important, ledgers were found with up-to-date payments to coca farmers and income from Colombian-dominated trafficking organizations. The guerrillas escaped into the jungle.
I have direct knowledge of other labs and secondary knowledge of many more. This and other evidence directly implicates Shining Path in the Peruvian cocaine industry.
Its control of coca cultivation in the Upper Huallaga is such that it can force farmers to plant the crop. Other peasants, called cocaleros, are ordered to grow less or more coca or to plant other crops altogether. The farmers defy the rebels at their peril.
Evidence about the guerrillas' links to the middle tiers of the Peruvian cocaine industry -- notably, the traffickers -- is more oblique. The Upper Huallaga town of Uchiza, the cocaine capital of the world, is dominated by the Peruvian Army during the day, but is surrendered to Shining Path after nightfall. The guerrillas have respected Uchiza's status as an army town, but only after they made the point that they can enter it at will and punish "enemies of the people." Traffickers who export from Uchiza's airfield and other army-controlled airstrips, give both military officers and Shining Path cadres sizable sums of money.
The local police pose no obstacle to this arrangement. One night in March 1989, the guerrillas attacked the Uchiza police post and publicly beheaded its corrupt police commanders. The police station remains vacant today. The commanders there had unwisely cheated the drug traffickers, who appealed to the only other source of justice in the Upper Huallaga Valley -- Shining Path.
Whether through arrangement or cowardice, the Peruvian Army unit about a half-mile down the road did nothing, though the soldiers must have heard the echoing gunfire and jeers of the hundreds of Uchiza citizens who gathered to watch.
The Colombian cocaine syndicates prefer dealing with the Peruvian Army, because, unlike Shining Path, it does not complicate its corruption with ideology. But the narcos have to deal with the rebels, who decided nearly a decade ago to align themselves with coca farmers and regulate drug commerce in areas they control.
Indeed, Shining Path has succeeded in intimidating the Colombian-dominated drug mafias, or firmas. The rebels have enforced limits on the number of Colombian narcos working in Upper Huallaga and imposed strict rules of behavior. The guerrillas kill those who displease them, as they did in late 1988 when they butchered 19 Colombian narcos.
Upstart revolutionary rivals have been similarly treated. Shining Path fought a rare pitched battle with elements of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement outside Tocache in July 1987. Shining Path's victory banished the smaller revolutionary movement to the Northern Huallaga.
Shining Path's domination of the firmas enables it to tax all levels of the cocaine industry in the Upper Huallaga: subsistence farmers, speculators, middlemen and lab owners, firmas and Colombian traffickers. In addition, the rebels process and refine cocaine in their own drug labs.
It is clear that Shining Path is financing its revolution with cocaine. According to conservative estimates, the rebels' annual revenue ranges from $15 million to $35 million. One Pentagon source thinks the amount might be as much as $100 million.
Revolutions are expensive, and very little foreign money reaches Shining Path, which is highly xenophobic. Yet the revolutionaries manages to finance "people's committees," which supplant legal government in many Peruvian villages and city neighborhoods, as well as the its armed component, the Guerrilla Army of the People. It can mobilize thousands of sympathizers with little notice. Without cocaine revenues, the inexorable growth of the movement would have been slower.
Shining Path's involvement with drugs is opportunistic. The rebels, unlike the military factions, are not corrupted by greed. And they will turn on the cocaine mafias one day.
Cocaine is crucial to the Peruvian economy, which is essentially bankrupt. It accounts for a conservative 35 to 45 percent of export earnings. The central bank is estimated to take in $4 million to $5 million daily in narco dollars from the streets of Lima alone.
Given Shining Path's control of drug commerce in the Upper Huallaga, the rebels could precipitate the collapse of the country's economy. The gross domestic product shrank by 22 percent from 1988 to 1990, and catastrophic inflation has wiped out what legal income the country has.
Yet Peru has not missed one payment on its international debt since the summer of 1990, when Alberto Fujimori was elected President. Even the resumption of foreign aid to Peru may not have accounted for its return to solvency. Many experts believe the country's creditors are being paid in narco-dollars, a prospect that inevitably undermines counternarcotics efforts in Peru.
We must anticipate the impact a possible Peruvian economic collapse may have on its Andean neighbors, not to mention its creditors. In Peru, such a catastrophe could presage a seizure of power by the rebels. The Shining Path is undoubtedly the most ferocious revolutionary movement in the world, and it controls the valley producing most of the world's most lucrative cash crop.
There are some people who think that the military-backed state of siege declared this week in Peru is the only way to fight Shining Path. But it is clear that a regressive military approach will not work. In 1983 and 1984, the Peruvian military killed thousands of suspected guerrillas in Ayacucho, the cradle of the revolution, and declared a victory. But Shining Path simply went underground and migrated up the Andean spine of the country. After only a brief period, the rebels had managed to infiltrate most provinces.
Today, the Peruvian military may make the mistake of unleashing a new regional "dirty war." The United States, as it weighs what to do next in Peru, must realize that the war on drugs, as it has been waged, may only abet this repression.

HEADLINE: Aid for Yeltsin and Russians: A Package with Loose Ends

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE with THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
The Russian aid package announced last week by the Bush Administration and some Western allies is less concrete and less complete than many officials made it seem, interviews with Administration officials, American lawmakers and senior officials in Europe, Japan and Canada indicate.
The officials said eagerness to show support for President Boris N. Yeltsin before his crucial encounter with the Russian Parliament this week accounted for the hasty announcement. 
 There is still considerable confusion among the allies about what the final package will contain, who will pay for what and precisely how much of the money goes beyond pledges previously made. For instance, many Group of Seven officials, saying they are uncertain how the $24 billion figure announced by the White House will be reached, are still counting on other nations, especially those in Scandinavia, to contribute.
 
'We Are in Midair'
 British officials say the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations will provide $6 billion of the package, German officials say those organizations will provide $5.5 billion, and American officials say they will contribute about $4.5 billion. Some allies, particularly the Japanese, are still chafing that the package was announced before there was final agreement on all the details.
"All the figures that the United States has provided are hypothetical," said an official in Japan's Finance Ministry.
A British Treasury official said, "If you take a snapshot, at the moment we are in midair, about three-quarters through our double spin."
When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d went to Brussels on March 11 for arms-control discussions, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev of Russia informed him that at a Congress of People's Deputies scheduled for this week there would be a real campaign by "old thinkers" to attack Mr. Yeltsin's reforms. Mr. Kozyrev said if there was ever a time for the West to give Mr. Yeltsin a strong signal of support, it was before that Congress.
While that conversation was taking place in Brussels, former President Richard M. Nixon was circulating a memo describing the Administration's aid efforts as pathetic.
For weeks President Bush had shied away from foreign-aid inititives as Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican Presidential candidate, attacked him for paying too much attention to foreign affairs. But after Mr. Nixon's memo received wide attention, Mr. Bush for the first time acknowledged publicly that he was ready to consider a large-scale aid package. In many ways, the package seemed to be intended to shore up two Presidents: President Bush and President Yeltsin.
"Nixon did not hurt," said an Administration official. "But we wanted to get it out before Yeltsin's meeting so that the impact would sink in and give him several days to take advantage of it. He needed some time to work the crowd over there."
Officials say President Bush also rushed to announce a package before the leading Democratic Presidential contender, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, criticized him for foot-dragging on Russian aid. Mr. Bush announced the package at a White House news conference last Wednesday, moments before Mr. Clinton delivered his foreign-policy address in New York.
"Of course one sees the electoral logic of the day he chose," said a German official about the timing of President Bush's announcement.
Indeed, some of the lingering confusion over the aid package and where the money will come from may stem, at least in Washington, from the Administration's reluctance in an election year to be clear about exactly what taxpayers will have to contribute.
The Bush Administration had been considering various aid programs for Russia since September, but it vastly sped up its efforts in recent weeks to meet Mr. Yeltsin's deadline.
 
New U.S. Attitude After Failed Coup
 While acknowledging that many of the numbers in the aid package are rough, Administration officials underline that the Group of Seven -- the world's seven leading industrial nations -- has made a commitment to meet the $24 billion in financing that Russia is estimated to need this year. They also say that while little of the $24 billion requires new authorizations by Group of Seven governments, much of the money will be new aid as far as Russia is concerned.
By some estimates, about $10 billion of the $11 billion pledged in bilateral aid has already been announced by Group of 7 nations, while other estimates put that figure at $6 billion. According to the Treasury Department, the aid includes a $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble, $2.5 billion in debt rescheduling, about $4.5 billion from international organization and the remainder in bilateral aid.
The Administration's attitude toward Russian aid has come a long way since July's economic summit meeting in London, when Washington opposed aid to Moscow, arguing that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was not committed to serious reforms.
But the Administration warmed up to the idea after the August coup in Moscow, when the United States and other Group of 7 countries began looking for a way to bolster Mr. Gorbachev's shaky rule by discussing a plan to reschedule the huge Soviet debt.
In the fall, Secretary Baker, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, visited Moscow and discovered that the country was rapidly running out of hard currency to pay its debts and finance crucial imports.
At the Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, in October, Mr. Brady threw his weight behind efforts to help Russia with its debt burden, but he remained frustrated that the Russians were not providing enough data to determine how much aid they needed.
 
Large-Scale Aid And I.M.F. Role
 After Mr. Yeltsin effectively took power in December, discussions about aid became more serious. During Mr. Baker's visit to Moscow in late December, Mr. Yeltsin appealed to the Secretary of State for any advice he could give on how to garner more Western aid.
Mr. Yeltsin informed Mr. Baker that he was developing a serious economic plan and intended to remove state price controls. American officials were inclined to help but were still dubious, having heard such promises before.
Still, on Jan. 3, Treasury Secretary Brady announced that the Administration had changed its mind and now supported Russia's becoming a full member of the International Monetary Fund, which includes virtually all the industrialized democracies. In late January, the Group of Seven finance ministers seconded that call, believing that the global fund should spearhead the Russian aid effort because of its expertise on economic reform.
They agreed that large-scale aid would flow once Russia joined the fund and once the fund gave its seal of approval to Moscow's reforms. Their hope was that Russia could become a member when the fund held its spring meeting in Washington in late April.
On Feb. 2, President Bush and Mr. Yeltsin met at Camp David in early February, and Mr. Bush and the Treasury Department became more convinced of Mr. Yeltsin's seriousness about economic reform. Secretary Brady also came away impressed with how eager Mr. Yeltsin's chief economic adviser, Yegor T. Gaidar, was to press ahead with reform.
 
A Financing Scheme With a 60's Fund
 Mr. Yeltsin was clearly disappointed that President Bush was not ready to give any firm promises on aid after the meeting. When Mr. Yeltsin went to Canada that evening, he grumbled about unspecified countries that "talk and talk" but "for the past five months we have been asking for help, and it hasn't happened."
"Camp David was a pivotal time," said a senior Treasury official. "It was clear that Yeltsin was putting a real program into place."
It was about that time that American officials started thinking that aid should be not just debt rescheduling, but also aid to help finance crucial imports like medicine, machinery and spare parts.
A few days later Secretary Baker, while heading for Frankfurt for a Western airlift of food and medicine for Russia and other republics, tentatively broached the idea with reporters that the State Department was exploring support of a fund to stabilize Russia's economy. Administration officials say Mr. Baker, who had been the most forward-leaning on helping the Russians, floated the idea to prod the the White House and the Treasury. But Treasury officials say they were already working hard on Russian aid and needed no prodding.
On Feb. 27, the Group of 7 deputy finance ministers held a crucial meeting in Germany, where they began sketching details of an aid package that Russia would receive after joining the global lender. At the meeting, the Americans proposed a novel way of financing the $6 billion ruble stabilization fund the Russians had asked for.
In the 1960's, 10 major industrial countries set up a fund now having $23 billion -- known as the general arrangements to borrow -- that they could draw from to help stabilize their currencies, and the Americans proposed that $6 billion from that fund be used to stabilize Russia's ruble.
 
Tokyo Criticizes 'Rough Numbers'
 The Group of Seven embraced that plan because Washington, Bonn and Tokyo were not hungering to appropriate $6 billion in new funds to underwrite the risky currency.
The momentum for a package picked up in March. In addition to the Nixon memo and Secretary Baker's meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister, the American Ambassador to Moscow, Robert Strauss, returned to Washington to lobby Congress and Mr. Bush to provide large-scale aid. And several key Senators pressed Mr. Bush to move aggressively on such aid.
All those factors seemed to finally spur the Administration into action. Mr. Baker had the State Department begin drafting a legislative package that would combine all of the American contributions, those already committed and some new ones.
Behind the scenes, the Group of Seven finance ministries were working feverishly to put together an aid package before Mr. Yeltsin confronted Parliament. They finally got the monetary fund and Russia to provide some data on how much for balance-of-payments support Russia needed to finance its debt service and crucial imports like medicine and spare parts. The monetary fund said Russia needed a minimum of $12 billion in aid, and perhaps as much as $18 billion.
On March 27, the Group of Seven's deputy finance ministers met in Paris, where they spent a whole day discussing a Russian aid package. They discussed terms for Russia's joining the monetary fund and they approved the $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble. They also tallied up how much direct aid each of the seven nations would contribute
According to figures provided by Group of Seven officials, Bonn is to provide $3 billion of the $11 billion in bilateral aid, Washington and Tokyo will provide $2 billion each, Italy $1.2 billion, Canada $1.1 billion and Britain $400 million. That comes to $9.7 billion before including France's contribution, which has not been disclosed.
 
Japan's Reluctance And Island Dispute
 Group of Seven officials say that at the meeting, the Germans and Americans said that they would announce aid packages a few days later to give Mr. Yeltsin some support before the Russian Parliament met. Bonn and Washington said the aid package should also be timed to the monetary fund's endorsement of Russia's reform plan, which the fund announced on March 31.
Nonetheless, once President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany made the packages public, Japanese officials said that the announcement was premature because, in their view, not all the details were hammered out.
American, German and British officials suggest that Japan does not want to appear as if it is being pushed into backing Russia. Tokyo has been reluctant to grant huge aid until Russia agrees to return the Kurile Islands that the Soviet Union seized toward the end of World War II.
"To a certain extent, everyone is addressing their domestic political audience," said a British official. "They are addressing the gallery."

After hard-won primary victories in New York, Wisconsin and Kansas, Governor Clinton found the Democratic Presidential nomination within his reach but not yet in his pocket. Many voters said they had backed him reluctantly, and party leaders feared that further campaign combat before the convention would play into President Bush's hands. A1

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
Heard by Few, Clinton Speech Shows Candidates' Quandary

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
About 12 minutes into his victory speech in Manhattan Tuesday night, Gov. Bill Clinton exhorted a crowd of cheering supporters: "Tonight when you go home, when the celebration stops, when you finish looking at the numbers and reveling in the success, in the quiet moments before you go to bed, remember that nothing has yet been done to change the lives of the people, and our battle has just begun."
With this exhortation, and indeed, with his entire 14-minute prepared speech, Mr. Clinton seemed to be trying to chart a more high-minded course for the next phase of his campaign, reviving the themes of hope and hard work with which he began the race six months ago. 
 But except for several hundred supporters and the throngs of reporters who attended his victory celebration at the Ritz, very few people actually heard the Arkansas Governor's remarks. Four minutes into his speech, only the Cable News Network and C-Span still had their cameras trained on Mr. Clinton. Five minutes after that, only C-Span was left.
The clipping of Mr. Clinton's speech into progressively smaller sound bites, until on NBC's "Today" show it was reduced to "I love Wisconsin and Minnesota and Kansas, and I really love New York!" is illustrative of the difficulties that Presidential candidates face in communicating a sustained thought to voters.
 
Chances Are Few
 Some of the most revealing coverage of the campaign has come from those forums, like the novel one-on-one debate staged by Phil Donahue on Monday, in which the two main Democratic Presidential candidates were simply allowed to rattle on uninterrupted. But it is rare that the candidates have the chance, either on the air or in print, to speak to the voters for a sustained time in their own voices, unless those voters happen to be C-Span junkies.
For those die-hards who did tune in to C-Span's post-primary broadcast Tuesday night or the rebroadcast at 7 A.M. yesterday, both Mr. Clinton and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California demonstrated a grace and eloquence that often seemed to be missing in the rancorous New York primary.
Mr. Brown used his concession speech, which was broadcast live by WABC as well as the two stations that carried Mr. Clinton's speech, to explain in a more compelling way than he had during the rest of the New York campaign just what he was doing in the Presidential race.
"I want to reiterate this is not about one person," Mr. Brown said. "It is not about a candidate reaching for some brass ring of ambition. It's about ordinary people taking back what belongs to all of us, and that's our democracy, it's our country, it's our dreams, it's our ideals."
"A woman in Laconia said it better than -- Laconia, New Hampshire -- said it better than anything I could say," he continued. "She said to me, as I walked out of the door of her house, she said: 'Governor, you know how the system works. You have a voice that can be heard. You have to speak for me. Will you promise me that?' And I told her -- I looked her right in the eye, and I said, 'I will speak for you, and I will speak for people like you who don't have a voice that can be heard.'
In his speech, Mr. Clinton spoke in the tones of a man who believed himself to be the Democratic nominee. He used his address to reach out to those Democrats who had voted against him, praising opponents he had just recently ridiculed and stressing their unity of purpose.
"Tonight every person who voted in the Democratic primary -- every person -- voted for change," he said. "Every vote for Jerry Brown was a vote that recognized the power of technology through his first-derided and now respected 800 number that the power of technology can give dignity to ordinary people and can give the average voter a say."
"Every vote for Paul Tsongas tonight was a vote for change," he went on. "A vote that respected his courage in getting into this race when George Bush was at over 70 percent in the approval polls, a vote that recognizes these are serious economic problems we face that require a serious response.
"Tonight I ask you to reach out to those who did not vote for me but voted for change. We want to be their campaign, too. From Manhattan, Kansas, to Manhattan Island, people said tonight: 'We want Americans to be able to earn a decent living, to walk on safe streets, to educate their children and to have them do better than they did. We want our country to win again and to be one again.' "
Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein Barone Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, was watching ABC's primary special Tuesday night when Mr. Clinton appeared live before a giant flag and started his speech. Mr. Kalb said he saw that the Governor, in an uncharacteristic move, was reading from notes.
"I assumed this was a significant statement -- something that had resonance," he said.
But, Mr. Kalb complained, he never had a chance to find out. After about three minutes, the station cut away from the speech to more analysis of the primary results from New York, Wisconsin and Kansas. Yesterday morning's papers made only brief mention of the speech. Mr. Kalb said he called his cable television company yesterday and added C-Span to the list of stations he received.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Pennsylvania;
Quirky State Is Setting For Next Primary Battle

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 8

 BODY:
The Presidential candidates are now turning their attention to Pennsylvania, the next state to hold primaries, and one that has a cranky, pessimistic and unpredictable electorate.
This is the state, after all, that just last November elected its first Democrat to the United States Senate in 30 years. Harris Wofford, a relatively unknown state official when he was appointed to fill the seat of the late John Heinz, rode a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment in a special election to defeat former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, a Republican closely linked to President Bush's domestic policies. 
 The engineers of Mr. Wofford's upset victory, James Carville and Paul E. Begala, are also top strategists for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. That team also ran Gov. Robert P. Casey's two successful campaigns here in 1986 and 1990.
The primary is scheduled for April 28, but there is a possibility that it may be postponed as a result of litigation carrying over delays associated with the court-ordered remapping of Congressional districts. A Federal court held a hearing here today on the issue.
 
Tsongas as Wild Card
 Mr. Clinton and his main rival who is actively campaigning, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, have just begun to vigorously court Pennsylvania. But former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts is also on the ballot, and political experts say he could be influential if he re-entered the race.
"Tsongas is really the wild card here," said Michael L. Young, a professor of politics and public affairs at Pennsylvania State University at Harrisburg, "but I don't think he will be a serious factor unless he actively campaigns."
The conservative cast of the Democratic electorate may help Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas, he said.
But it was here -- in front of the Liberty Bell -- that Mr. Brown announced his candidacy last October, and some analysts say he still has a chance to do well in Pennsylvania, which prides itself as being independent.
 
Fond of Protest Votes
 "We like to stage protest votes at the end of the primary process," Professor Young said. He noted that in the state's 1980 primaries, Pennsylvanians voted for Senator Edward M. Kennedy and George Bush after Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan had all but clinched their parties' nominations.
Pennsylvania, the nation's fifth-most-populous state, has a conservative-leaning electorate of 5.3 million registered voters. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by 330,000, but Republicans have been narrowing that margin for years, and many registered Democrats vote for moderate Republicans. In surveys, half of the voters identify themselves as conservatives, one of three call themselves liberals and the rest call themselves moderates.
The issues of most concern to Pennsylvania voters, according to survey data, are jobs and unemployment, the economy and health care, which, poll takers say, is an issue that captures specific concern about health care costs as well as a general uneasiness about the economy. The recession had hit the state hard; Pennsylvania's unemployment rate in March was 7.2 percent, slightly less than the national rate of 7.3 percent.
The lingering recession has increased frustration with incumbent politicians and any candidate who sounds like the incumbents. "We're still seeing a very strong anti-incumbent feeling, perhaps because Pennsylvania voters, by a three-to-one margin, think their own financial situation will worsen next year," said G. Terry Madonna, director of politics and public affairs at Millersville University of Pennsylvania in Lancaster.
Mr. Madonna, who polled 673 likely primary voters over the last weekend, also found that Mr. Clinton has a 13 percentage point lead over Mr. Brown but that 31 percent of the voters remained undecided. Mr. Tsongas was not included in the survey. The statewide poll, sponsored by Millersville University and WHTM-TV in Harrisburg, was conducted by telephone from April 2 to 4; it has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
The two big voting blocks here are labor union members, with about 22 percent of the voters, and the elderly, with about 20 percent of the voters. Blacks make up about 9 percent of the voters and Jews about 3 percent; both groups are overwhelmingly registered as Democrats.
Mr. Brown appears to have attracted more labor support than Mr. Clinton, who is meeting with local A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials here tonight, but none of the major unions have made endorsements yet.
As for Pennsylvania's Republicans, they consistently give Mr. Bush a higher approval rating than he receives nationally. In last weekend's survey, Republican respondents gave Mr. Bush a 66 percent approval rating, compared to a 26 percent approval rating for Patrick J. Buchanan. "This is Bush country," Mr. Madonna said.
In the last decade, Pennsylvania Democrats gave primary victories to Michael S. Dukakis over the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1988, to Walter F. Mondale over Gary Hart in 1984 and to Senator Kennedy over Jimmy Carter in 1980. But in four of the last five Presidential general elections, Pennsylvania helped elect Republicans. This is an old tradition for Pennsylvania, which, for example, was the only big state that stuck with Herbert Hoover over Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.
The tilt in voter registration toward the Republican Party may reflect a shift in the Pennsylvania economy. The state may conjure up images of coal or steel, but Pennsylvania now has more jobs in research and high-technology areas than it does in manufacturing. And agriculture is the largest industry in the state, with 3.7 million of its 11.8 million people living in rural areas.
In the 1988 primary, Mr. Dukakis defeated Mr. Jackson by 67 percent to 27 percent, but Mr. Jackson carried Philadelphia, where a quarter of the state's Democrats live. Mr. Brown, who has said he would like Mr. Jackson as a running mate, could benefit from Mr. Jackson's popularity.
At stake in this month's primary are 110 Democratic delegates and 63 Republican delegates. But Pennsylvania, which has many media markets at some distance from each other, is a hard place to campaign. "Candidates end up spending a lot of money," said David L. Buffington, publisher of a political newsletter in Harrisburg, "for a relatively small number of delegates."


GRAPHIC: All figures are for 1990 except where indicated. Pennsylvania's population in 1990, excluding people living abroad, was 11,881,643 or 4.8 percent of the U.S. total. It ranks fifth among the states in population.

HEADLINE: Editors Take On Conflicts of News Staff Diversity

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
The nation's newspaper editors, a group overwhelmingly white and male, got some unusually frank instruction today in the complex task of communicating effectively with their increasingly diverse staffs.
"Diversity is at the soul of what we are all about," said David Lawrence Jr., publisher of The Miami Herald, who is president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which includes about 900 active and retired daily newspaper editors. 
 But today's program at the group's annual convention, "Face to Face: Race and Gender Communication in the Newsroom," marked a new candor in addressing the frustration, resentment and inadvertent miscommunication that diversity of race, sex and sexual orientation can create for editors and reporters.
Tom Kochman, who wrote "Black & White: Styles in Conflict," (University of Chicago Press, 1983) said the dialogue between a new black reporter and a white editor could easily be predicted because of different starting assumptions.
Mr. Kochman said the black reporter would probably assume the editor was racist unless the editor proved he was not; the white editor would probably assume he was not viewed as racist unless he proved himself to be.
Without understanding each other's assumptions, an editor and a reporter can inadvertently be deeply offensive to the other.
The society has reported that 9.4 percent of the nation's newsroom employees are black, Hispanic, Asian American or American Indian journalists, as against 8.7 percent last year and 4 percent in 1978.
Such an increase at a time when there was an overall decline in newsroom jobs because of the recession indicates the importance of minorities at many of the nation's newspapers in recent years. But more than half the newspapers, mostly smaller papers, have no minority staff members.
While the increased presence of racial minorities, women and homosexuals in a newsroom may have broadened a newspaper's grasp of its community, the editors acknowledge that the internal communication problems have been largely unaddressed.
 
Problems Raised Anonymously
 As part of the program, editors from around the country were invited to raise questions anonymously about the problems they face in their newsrooms that in many cases they feel cannot be directly broached.
The 38 questions, which were distributed to the editors to fuel further discussion in their own newsrooms, included a black female news editor's complaints about Hispanic journalists and a gay Hispanic city editor's demand to know how long homosexuals "are doomed to second-class lives" at newspapers.
One of the two questions taken up came from someone identified only as a white male editor in Pennsylvania. He said: "I know the sad racial history of our country and I want to do what I can to fix what's broken. But why is it that many black journalists are so defensive when we try to help them improve their work? Editors are supposed to critique the work of reporters. But at our paper, if you do it with a black reporter you can get accused of racism. All the editors are walking on eggs. Blacks say, 'Look, just treat us like everyone else.' But when we do, we get hammered. What can we do about this?"
Dorothy Gilliam, a black columnist at The Washington Post who was part of a panel, said the black reporters would probably not feel threatened by criticism if the editor had demonstrated in other ways he was not racist.
Mr. Kochman said that airing the conflict between the editor and the reporter would probably be much more unsettling for the white than for the black. He said blacks, culturally, are accustomed to such verbal conflicts whereas "anglos," who he described as the descendants of Anglo-Saxon ancestry, usually avoid them lest they be denounced as racist.
Deborah Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University who wrote "You Just Don't Understand: Women & Men in Conversation" (William Morrow & Company, 1990), said that men and women, blacks and whites, and many other diverse groups have difficulty communicating because of deep cultural differences that can easily be misunderstood.
"You are told, 'How dare you treat me different, I'm the same as you; How dare you treat me the same, I'm different from you,' " Ms. Tannen said, characterizing the double bind editors sometimes face.
She added, "In some cases, it is true that anything you say can be offensive."
But Robert J. Haiman, the program's organizer who is president of The Poynter Institute, a journalism education organization in St. Petersburg, Fla., said that open, even angry, discussion was essential if there is to be real progress.
"Unless we raise the questions, there is little chance to get the problems resolved," Mr. Haiman said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Chip Makers Stem the Tide In Trade Battles With Japanese

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 8

 BODY:
American semiconductor manufacturers, the bedrock of the nation's high-technology industry, have stopped the Japanese erosion of their competitiveness and might be poised to make a comeback after a decade of decline, according to a growing number of industry executives and analysts.
The new assessment represents a sharp contrast from the prevailing view five or six years ago, when many executives and analysts were saying that the American producers of silicon chips were in danger of being driven to extinction by the Japanese. 
 That prospect raised concern among Government and industry officials because semiconductors are critical for national defense, given their use in advanced electronic weaponry. And since chips are the basic building blocks of computers, telephones and robots, there was concern that if the American chip industry faltered, it would weaken the entire electronics industry, one of the nation's largest employers.
For now, the American share of the world semiconductor market has leveled off at just under 40 percent, up from recent levels but down from more than 60 percent in the 1970's. For the first time in years, there was even a gain in 1990. And some executives expect to see gains for 1991 and 1992 as well, although preliminary figures for 1991 do not show this. Meanwhile, the Japanese share of the world market peaked at 51 percent in 1988 and has dropped a bit since.
 
Equipment Makers Gain
 American companies that make the equipment used in semiconductor production also appeared to be making a comeback. Today in Washington, Sematech, the semiconductor industry consortium, and VLSI Research Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., announced that leading American makers of such production equipment registered an increase in 1991 worldwide market share to nearly 41 percent from 38 percent in 1990.
The big question now is whether the American semiconductor industry can actually gain ground or whether, after a hiatus, it will begin sliding again. Many executives and analysts say they expect a stalemate, with neither the Japanese nor the American producers gaining much ground.
Still, even that would be good news, given the trouble some other industries, like consumer electronics and automobiles, have had in stemming a slide.
"I don't consider it a comeback, it's a stabilization," said Andrew S. Grove, president of the Intel Corporation, a major American chip producer. Still, he added, "I think the auto executives would kill for this."
Indeed, the playing field today seems vastly different than in the middle 1980's, when Japanese companies had driven most American companies out of the business of making the most widely used chip and when even the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that the American industry could not compete in its present form.
The American resurgence stems partly from a shift in the economics of the business in a way that favors products that the American companies specialize in. Also, American chip quality has vastly improved. And Government programs to help the industry, such as the Sematech consortium and the semiconductor trade agreement with Japan, have played some role as well.
But the main factor appears to be a victory of sorts of brain over brawn, as American companies have continued to lead and even increase their lead in cleverly designed and highly profitable chips. These include microprocessors that serve as the central calculating chips in personal computers, as well as chips that specialize in displaying images on a computer screen, processing sound and video signals for computers and transmitting information.
The Japanese companies have surged to dominate the market for memory chips, which store information in computers. But they require huge investments and produce little profits. Surprisingly, the Japanese have not been able to follow up their success in that business by moving strongly into others kinds of chips.
Instead, the Japanese find themselves overly dependent on the market for memory chips. The result is that many Japanese companies are believed to be losing money in their semiconductor operations and may no longer be able to maintain their high investments.
"It is possible to build a case now that you couldn't make five years ago -- that the American semiconductor industry is in a better position than the Japanese," said Michael Borrus, an industry expert at the University of California at Berkeley.
 
Difficult Future Is Still Forecast
 But others say danger still lies ahead. Ian M. Ross, chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors, said the recent rise in American market share and fall in Japanese share stemmed largely from declines in the prices of memory chips, which hurt Japanese companies disproportionately.
In a report issued in February, the committee, which was formed to develop a national strategy to help the industry, concluded that the American industry "continues to be under intense pressure from its international competitors."
The report also said that Japanese companies continued to heavily outspend American producers on research and capital equipment, an indication that the Japanese could surge ahead again in the future. Moreover, the primary customers of the American chip companies, the American makers of computers, telephones and other electronic equipment, have been losing market share.
Even when they are successful in selling chips, many American companies, particularly the smaller ones, do not make them. Rather, they contract out manufacturing -- often to the Japanese. In the last half of the 1980's, American employment in the semiconductor industry dropped by 27,000 jobs, or about 10 percent.
But even the most pessimistic say the situation is not as bad as six or seven years ago, when most American companies were abandoning the market for the main type of memory chip, the dynamic random access memory , or D-RAM, and it seemed the Japanese were unstoppable.
Back then, the American Government, prodded by the industry, took several steps to try to help. In 1986, it signed a trade agreement with Japan intended to raise prices of Japanese chips and help increase sales of American chips in Japan. The next year, the United States Government agreed to contribute $100 million a year to Sematech in a move to improve the manufacturing skills of the American industry. And in 1988, Congress formed the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors to draft a comprehensive strategy for the industry.
 
Government Help: Some Falls Short
 None of these programs have fulfilled all of their goals. Sematech is credited with helping to make chip makers more competitive. But the consortium got off to a slow start and a couple of members are now dropping out. Sematech, they say, does not satisfy their needs.
The trade agreement has also fallen short of insuring that 20 percent of the chips sold in Japan come from American and other non-Japanese companies. And virtually none of the recommendations of the advisory committee has been carried out.
T. J. Rodgers, president and chief executive of the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation in San Jose, said the American industry had stabilized itself through its own efforts and that Government assistance was neither necessary nor effective.
"Nobody does anything because of the U.S. Government and Sematech," Dr. Rodgers said. "You do it to survive."
Indeed, he said, most of the sharp decline in American market share ended by 1985, before Sematech was formed and the trade pact signed.
Still, the trade agreement has helped raise the American share of Japan's market from 8.5 percent in 1985 to 12.5 percent in 1991. That 4 percent gain is equivalent to nearly $1 billion in sales.
Similarly, the trade agreement, while setting floor prices for certain Japanese chips, came too late to keep most American companies from dropping out of the D-RAM business but it was not too late to help American companies that were making another type of chip, known as Eprom's, which stands for erasable programmable read-only memory.
Indeed, after declining for several years, American market share in Eprom's began rising precisely in 1986, the year the agreement was signed. Some experts say that the trade agreement may have also had a more subtle effect in persuading the Japanese to be less aggressive.
To some extent, the decline of the American industry was always overstated. That is because the market share figures do not include the International Business Machines Corporation, which is probably the nation's largest chip maker for its own products. The market share figures also measure sales in dollars, and the yen has about doubled in value against the dollar in the last decade. If a constant figure were used to convert yen to dollars, the gains in Japanese market share would not be as great.
 
An American Edge In Innovative Design
 The main reason analysts are hopeful about the prospects for the American industry is that it has maintained the edge in innovative designs of chips for computing, displaying graphics and transmitting data.
Most significant has been Intel, which is by far the leading producer of microprocessors, the central calculating chip in personal computers. Intel has declined to license its most advanced designs to others. Its semiconductor sales have increased from $1 billion in 1986 to about $4 billion in 1991, a gain that alone is responsible for the American market share being about 5 percent higher than it otherwise would be.
American companies have also pioneered in several new fast-growing markets. Intel has more than 80 percent of the market for flash memories, a new, fast-growing type of memory chip that could one day replace computer disk drives. Another fast-growing product area is chips that users can program themselves. These field programmable logic chips are pioneered by Silicon Valley start-ups such as Xilinx Inc. and the Altera Corporation, both in San Jose.
Clever design and management is helping some small American companies make up for lack of size. LSI Logic in Milpitas, Calif., a maker of customized chips, said that it could now produce chips smaller than those produced by the Japanese. LSI uses computer simulations, rather than huge production runs, to hone its manufacturing techniques.
Cypress Semiconductor, which competes in high-speed memory chips, gives factory managers an ownership stake in the factory. That gives them a financial incentive to economize.
Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho, is managing to remain profitable in the D-RAM business, the Japanese bastion. The secret is that Micron designs its chips to be smaller and to require fewer manufacturing steps than those of its competitors.
Japanese companies, meanwhile, have by and large been unable to move into some new areas, although it is too early to count them out. They have remained mainly producers of memory chips, as well as some simpler microcontrollers used to control cars and consumer appliances.
"The Japanese don't know where to go," said Lane Mason, an analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose. "They have not been able to follow the new markets."
 
Koreans Duplicate The Japanese Leap
 A big part of the problem is that Korean companies are now duplicating what the Japanese did a decade ago, building huge plants and competing by offering low prices in a bid to gain market share.
Samsung, the leading Korean company, came from nowhere to become one of the largest suppliers of D-RAM's in the world. It is the leading D-RAM supplier in the United States, according to Victor de Dios, who runs the D-RAM Market Advisor service in Newark, Calif. Mr. de Dios estimates that in the American market, Japanese suppliers saw their share of the D-RAM market drop from 52 percent in the first quarter of 1991 to 45 percent by the fourth quarter.
Dr. Rodgers of Cypress said the Japanese companies once enjoyed a huge lead on American companies in terms of the percentage of working chips on a wafer of silicon. While these figures, known as yield, are closely guarded secrets, Dr. Rodgers estimated that in the early 1980's, 75 percent of the chips produced by Japanese companies might have worked, compared with only 25 percent for American companies. That meant that an American company would need a $300 million factory to produce the same number of working chips that a Japanese company could produce in a $100 million factory.
That edge was multiplied by the fact that Japanese companies could raise money at 4 percent interest rates while American companies were paying as much as 12 percent. Now, he said, American company yields are nearly as high as those of the Japanese. And the difference in the cost of capital has dissipated as Japanese interest rates have risen and American rates have fallen.
"I'm not sure we can recover the lead," Dr. Rodgers said. "But are we going to be better off in the semiconductor industry at the end of the 90's than we are at the beginning? I truly believe we are."

HEADLINE: G.M., Missing $436 Million, Accuses L.I. Dealer of Fraud

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT JEFFERSON, L.I. April 8

 BODY:
Life in this Suffolk County village hasn't been quite the same since sheriff's deputies began removing 700 new cars from John McNamara's sprawling dealership on Friday and General Motors accused him of fraud in obtaining hundreds of millions in loans from the company.
As a car dealer, developer, newspaper publisher, Republican Party insider and philanthropist, there was no one to match Mr. McNamara, the "Mr. Big" of this community and a quintesentially American small-town entrepreneur. 
 "Everybody is abuzz," said Frank Frasca, the village's Mayor. "There are rumors flying all over the place, but nobody really knows what is going on."
 
A Court Order
 For now, all that is clear about Mr. McNamara's problems can be found in papers filed in civil court by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, which charged him with obtaining loans to finance cars that did not exist, falsifying documents and failing to divulge his business dealings.
General Motors said Mr. McNamara owes it $436 million, and it obtained a court order from State Supreme Court in Hauppauge to have his dealership, McNamara Buick-Pontiac, shut down and 700 cars and trucks in his lot, worth $13 million, removed.
Neither Mr. McNamara, 52 years old, nor his lawyer, J. Timothy Shea, returned repeated telephone calls today seeking comment.
The case, however, may raise as many questions about the world's largest auto maker as it does about its dealer here.
In its court papers, the company said that Mr. McNamara had presented it with false documents saying he had shipped new cars overseas but that the cars were never delivered to anyone. G.M. declined today through a spokeswoman in Detroit, Lynda Koskinski, to say why such a vast amount of credit had been extended to a single dealer.
It was unclear from the company's court documents how the huge debt that G.M. said Mr. McNamara owes had piled up. If the money had been borrowed recently, it could have financed more than 20,000 vehicles.
Even among the nation's largest car dealers, "that amount of outstanding credit is extraordinary," said Ted Orme, a spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group. Normally, he said, credit subsidiaries of the large auto makers extend loans to their dealers only for the purchase of cars to be delivered to customers, and sometimes for improvements for new shops, showrooms or other properties related to the business.
People in Port Jefferson and the surrounding communities that meander along Long Island's North Shore can only wonder what will come next. Some compare the drama to the plot of "It's a Wonderful Life," the Frank Capra film in which Mr. Potter, a malevolent tycoon who owns most of a small town, forces its savings and loan association, run by a beleaguered but honest man played by Jimmy Stewart, into insolvency.
"I'd say John McNamara comes closer to the personality of Jimmy Stewart," Mayor Frasca said. "I'm sure he is a shrewd businessman, but I've never seen him take advantage of anybody."
 
Favored Project
 No one denies that Mr. McNamara has been a leading light in Port Jefferson philanthropy. In his favored project, officials here say, he has been the chief contributor to Hope House Ministries, a home for wayward boys. He has made large cash contributions and been the host of an annual fund-raising cocktail party.
But unlike the plot of "It's a Wonderful Life," in which an adoring citizenry comes to the aid of its business leader, chipping in dimes and dollar bills, the case here seems unlikely to reach a simple, heartwarming end.
Whatever the outcome, Mr. McNamara's encounter with the law comes after a decade in which he invested huge amounts outside the automobile dealership, which he took over from his father in the early 1980's. He accumulated a portfolio of holdings that checker the Suffolk landscape.
As a real-estate investor and developer, he is the largest owner of stores, apartment houses and condominiums in Port Jefferson, and applied to build more than 5,000 condominiums in the town of Brookhaven, which includes Port Jefferson, during the 1980's.
Though most of the condominiums have been built, Mr. McNamara postponed construction of many when the real-estate market sank into deep recession, starting in 1988. "I just can't see any major impact" of his legal problems on the area's real-estate market, Mayor Frasca said, adding that Mr. McNamara "doesn't have much of anything in the pipeline."
Mr. McNamara's battles with conservation groups in Suffolk County are still smoldering, however.
Critics say he has used his political influence, enhanced by generous campaign contributions to most of the Republican Party's elected officials in Brookhaven, and his business clout to gain approval for his projects.
"There was always the strong indication he used undue political influence," said Richard L. Amper Jr. executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, one of several environmental groups that have battled Mr. McNamara over his real-estate development proposals.
Some here are still angered by his purchase in 1986 of The Port Jefferson Record, the village's weekly newspaper, and The North Shore Record, a sister publication. Mr. McNamara sold the newspapers last year after an unsuccessful effort to expand the publishing venture to nine separate weeklies in Suffolk, and in the face of widespread criticism that he was using his newspapers to promote his pro-development policies.
"To my knowledge, there was no effort to influence" the news coverage of the papers by Mr. McNamara, said Kathren Schmoller, managing editor of The Port Jefferson Record, who worked as a lower-ranking editor while Mr. McNamara was publisher.
During the peak of the region's real-estate boom in the mid-1980's, Mr. McNamara won approvals for projects that were opposed by officials in Suffolk County and endorsed by those in the town of Brookhaven. They include Rocky Point Meadows, a 450-unit condominium project adjacent to a state nature preserve, and another major condominium complex, next to the Grucci fireworks plant in Yaphank.
Spokesmen for both the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Manhattan and the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn said they would not comment on a report in Newsday today that they had initiated a criminal investigation into Mr. McNamara's affairs. The Suffolk County District Attorney, James M. Catterson Jr., said his office was not now investigating the case, saying it had received no complaint from General Motors or others to warrant a criminal investigation.
And in Detroit, Ms. Koskinski of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation said the company would adhere "to a long tradition of not violating the confidential relationships we have with our dealers."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Sidelines;
Tsongas II: Ex-Senator Ponders Revival

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas was pondering a re-entry yesterday after his surprising second-place finish in New York's Democratic primary, but many Democrats said they were hard put to see how a revived Tsongas candidacy could wrest the nomination from Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
As a result, some of Mr. Tsongas's aides said yesterday that they expected the former Massachusetts Senator to decide against re-entering the race, although they cautioned that he is known for last-minute and closely held decisions. 
 There was a spirited case being made for Tsongas II, with some of his allies arguing that a revived campaign could further his influence in the party and keep the former Senator well-positioned in the event of a Clinton collapse.
Mr. Tsongas is expected to announce his decision at a news conference today.
Despite the strong showing of his sidelines campaign this week, Mr. Tsongas would face numerous obstacles, many Democrats said yesterday. His campaign is carrying a debt of about $400,000, according to his campaign manager, Dennis Kanin.
And before Mr. Tsongas suspended his campaign on March 19 he was decisively defeated across the South and in Illinois and Michigan, suggesting more serious flaws in his candidacy than a simple lack of money.
For example, while Mr. Tsongas often ran well with affluent, educated suburbanites, he had difficulties with core Democratic constituencies like blacks and organized labor, which will play an important role in the coming contest in Pennsylvania.
On top of all this, Mr. Clinton is leading Mr. Tsongas in delegates by better than 2 to 1, with only 17 primaries and caucuses remaining and with party rules of strict proportional representation that make it extremely difficult to overcome such leads.
Mr. Tsongas has been given those particular facts of life by many Democrats, including Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman, who spoke to him Tuesday night.
 
'Mathematical Realities'
 "I did talk to him," Mr. Brown said, "about the mathematical realities of this thing, which are that Bill Clinton's got about 1,400 delegates; that it's certainly impossible for anyone not in the race to accumulate sufficient delegates, and that it's virtually impossible for anyone in the race, other than Bill Clinton, to accumulate a majority before the convention."
Mr. Brown, who has long said that an early end to the nominating battle would be a big plus for his party in November, asserted that his conversation "wasn't an attempt to encourage or discourage" Mr. Tsongas, but rather "a good, open conversation about the lay of the land."
David Wilhelm, the Clinton campaign manager, said there were "no behind-the-scenes negotiations" between his camp and Mr. Tsongas's, but added: "We try to keep the lines of communications open. Typically, it takes the form of friends talking to friends."
Mr. Wilhelm was taking a careful but cordial tone yesterday. "We respect him and we're not going to thrust ourselves into the middle of that very personal decision," the Clinton campaign manager said of Mr. Tsongas.
But Mr. Wilhelm added, "It's definitely true that if he were to get into the race, it would prolong a process that I believe would ultimately lead to a Bill Clinton nomination nevertheless."
 
'Spoiler' Role Debated
 When Mr. Tsongas left the race last month he said he had no desire to be a "spoiler" by pressing a doomed crusade for the nomination that would only end up helping President Bush in the fall. Mr. Kanin, the Tsongas campaign manager, suggested last night that much of the internal debate revolved around that issue.
"I think you've got to decide what being a spoiler means," Mr. Kanin said. "If you have the view -- and I'm not saying Paul has this view -- that the reservations the electorate has about the most likely nominee make it unlikely that this person would win the election, perhaps you're not being a spoiler by making it possible for the party to choose someone else."
This argument reflects the concern among many in the party about Mr. Clinton's image among the electorate, including the doubts and reservations about his integrity that many polls have found.
Mr. Kanin added that while this argument had been made to Mr. Tsongas, "I'm not sure that's an argument he subscribes to."
Mr. Tsongas is hearing other rationales for reviving his campaign. Some of his allies assert that he could return with a scaled-back campaign that would, at the very least, carry his message forward.
The former Senator campaigned as a "pro-business liberal" who combined the party's liberal stance on social issues with such economic measures as support for a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment.
 
Power to Shape the Party
 Nathan Landow, the state Democratic chairman in Maryland, a prominent fund-raiser and a Tsongas supporter, said he believed that returning to the race would increase Mr. Tsongas's power to shape the party "at the negotiating table in New York," where the Democrats will hold their national convention in July.
Ted Van Dyk, an adviser to Mr. Tsongas, said he had urged the former Senator to consider a re-entry, but added: "He's got to be committed; it would be painful. It would be a knock-down, drag-out battle."
He said his impression was that Mr. Tsongas was most worried about seeing his message fade away.
Mr. Brown, the Democratic chairman, said he had told Mr. Tsongas that "I didn't think we could win without him and his supporters," and wanted to see the former Senator take an active role "in the fall campaign and in the convention."
Amid all the political maneuvering, Tsongas aides said he was simply trying to analyze Tuesday's vote. There were signs that much of it in New York was rooted in protest: 48 percent of the Tsongas voters categorized themsleves as disliking the other candidates, compared to 24 percent who said they liked their candidate but with reservations, and 27 percent who said they strongly favored their candidates.
Jim Ruvolo, a Democratic national committeeman from Ohio, said: "There will always be a significant vote for somebody else, and Tsongas is more palatable than Jerry Brown, so his vote may be higher. But it will not stop Clinton's march to the nomination -- he doesn't have the money or the time."

HEADLINE: France Suspends Its Testing of Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 8

 BODY:
France announced today that it was suspending its 32-year-old program of nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific until the end of this year and suggested that it would extend the moratorium in 1993 if other nuclear powers followed suit.
In his first address to Parliament since taking office last week, Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy said President Francois Mitterrand had written to leaders of the other nuclear powers urging them to conclude their strategic disarmament negotiations and halt nuclear testing.
He added that France would retain its independent nuclear deterrent as "the keystone of our defense policy," but would continue to press for global arms reductions. "In 1993, we will see if our example is followed and if common sense has advanced," he said. 
 While the French decision is a direct result of the end of the cold war, the announcement was immediately interpreted here as a move by the Socialist Government to court two fast-growing environmental parties, which have long opposed France's nuclear testing policy.
In regional elections last month, the two parties, the Greens and Generation Ecologie, won 13.9 percent of the vote against just 18.3 percent for the Socialists. The Government's defeat prompted Mr. Mitterrand to dismiss Edith Cresson as Prime Minister and name Mr. Beregovoy in her place.
With parliamentary elections 11 months away, the main conservative coalition currently looks likely to win a big victory. But political experts say they believe that the Socialists have a small possibility of retaining power if they can form a coalition with the two environmental parties.
With an eye to next year's elections, Mr. Beregovoy also pledged today to give priority to fighting unemployment, currently running at 9.9 percent of the work force, and he reduced the sales tax on luxury goods from 22 percent to 18.6 percent to help the auto industry.
Aware of public disenchantment with the country's political class because of several corruption scandals, the new Prime Minister further announced plans to legislate against conflict of interest and to require officials to disclose their wealth.
The decision to suspend nuclear tests was predictably welcomed by the green parties as well as by Greenpeace, the international environmental group. "It's fantastic," Lena Hagelin, a Greenpeace director, said. "Now we hope to be able to work together to convince the remaining countries to follow France's example."
While Russia suspended its nuclear testing for one year last October, the United States and Britain have not adopted a similar policy. France, which exploded its first nuclear device over the Sahara in 1960, has carried out 196 nuclear tests in French Polynesia since 1966.
Over the last 17 years, all tests have taken place underground, with successive governments arguing they were needed to maintain France's nuclear deterrent. In recent years, an average of six tests have been held annually.
But the policy proved costly in diplomatic terms. France's relations with New Zealand touched rock bottom in 1985 after French agents sank a Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior, in Auckland harbor as it prepared to travel to Muroroa atoll to protest a scheduled nuclear test.

HEADLINE: Union Leader Takes Case To Caterpillar Shareholders

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., April 8

 BODY:
The management of Caterpillar Inc. engaged in a tussle of words with a top official of the United Auto Workers at the company's annual shareholders meeting here today. And by the end of the tense meeting, it seemed as unlikely as ever that the two sides would sit down soon to try to resolve a five-month-old strike by 12,600 union members that may cost them their jobs.
Bill Casstevens, secretary treasurer of the union, appeared at the meeting, seeking to address the stockholders in response to a long presentation given by the company on the labor dispute. 
 Caterpillar's chairman, Donald V. Fites, repeatedly asked Mr. Casstevens to sit down when the union leader tried to speak. Ultimately, Mr. Casstevens, who is a company shareholder, was allowed to have the floor during a question-and-answer period.
Mr. Fites, who has relegated the day-to-day statements regarding the strike to other company officials, repeatedly said that Caterpillar was not trying to break the union and that the company would still like to see a negotiated settlement to the strike. He said the company would be willing to review a union proposal if one were submitted.
 
Replacement Workers
 "Breaking this union is the last thing we want to do," Mr. Fites said.
Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, announced last week from its headquarters in Peoria, Ill., that it would start to replace striking union members if they failed to return to their jobs by April 6.
The company has asserted that more than 400 of the striking workers have crossed the picket lines since then and, according to Mr. Fites, newspaper advertisements about the job openings have attracted about 47,000 telephone calls from people seeking information.
Caterpillar executives said that more union members crossed the picket lines today to return to their jobs but that the company would no longer give figures on the number of workers who cross the picket line.
"We think that it would be counterproductive to do so," Mr. Fites said.
But the United Auto Workers, whose members are keeping vigil at each entrance to the company's plants throughout the Midwest, said that the company figures had been far too high.
About 100 members of union surrounded the hotel in downtown Wilmington that was the site of the shareholders meeting carrying picket signs reading "Will Rogers Never Met Don Fites" and other slogans. Security was tight, with a team of security guards hired by Caterpillar surrounding the ballroom at the Dupont Hotel, where the meeting was held.
 
'Our Side of Story'
 Mr. Casstevens, speaking to the shareholders, complained that the company was seeking to provide far less generous health care and retirement benefits than Deere & Company workers had recently won and that the company had unfairly portrayed the terms of the offer and the course of the negotiations.
"Why don't you let us tell these shareholders our side of the story?" he yelled at Mr. Fites from the middle of the audience, as the chairman implored him to be seated.
In Washington, a group of 15 Senators today asked Labor Secretary Lynn Martin to intervene in the labor dispute. The 15 Senators, including two Republicans, cautioned that hiring non-union workers to replace the strikers would lead the strike to become "a far more contentious struggle," adding that the existence of the company could become an issue.
"Surely the experience at Eastern Airlines, Greyhound and the New York Daily News and countless other, less publicized disputes has shown that the introduction of permanent replacements is counterproductive," the Senators said in a letter to Ms. Martin.
In a news conference after the annual meeting, Mr. Fites said he had kept the Labor Department informed of the company's activities in dealing with the union. However, he added that "we don't see a role for them to play in this process at this time."
Both at the press conference and at the annual meeting, Mr. Fites continued to attack what he called the union's insistence on pattern bargaining, under which a union seeks similar agreements from a number of companies in the same industry. He complained that the U.A.W.'s demand that Caterpillar match a labor pact reached last year with Deere, would render the company uncompetitive with the foreign makers of machinery against whom Caterpillar competes.
Mr. Fites denied that the strike had crippled the company's production, saying that demand had dropped sharply from the economic recession in the United States and the slowdown in the economies in other parts of the world. "We have not lost a single sale, as far as we can tell, as a result of this strike," Mr. Fites said. "Our problem isn't supply, it's demand."
He said that Caterpillar executives have discovered that they could operate their plants with 10 to 15 percent fewer workers, as a result of efficiencies that have been gained from upgrading the company's operations. The company's plants are now being operated by 4,000 salaried personnel.
 
'Gone Overboard'
 During the two-hour annual meeting, several shareholders expressed confidence in the company's handling of the labor dispute. One shareholder said that he considered the company's proposed contract too generous to the union. "I'm concerned that you're pricing yourself out of your competitive position," said the shareholder, Harry W. Craig, a dealer of Caterpillar products. "I urge you to consider that maybe you've gone overboard."
But several Caterpillar workers were among the shareholders and they complained that the company had not treated workers fairly in the contract negotiations.
"You've laid out a lot of things that are false," Mr. Casstevens said in a thunderous voice early in the meeting before he was finally allowed to speak. "You've told your side. They're entitled to hear the other."
Mr. Fites shouted back: "This is not a debate and it is not a bargaining session. It is not a press conference."
The annual meeting dealt principally with the routine affairs of the company: the election of directors, voting on various resolutions and a report on the company's profitability. But the strike was at the center of most shareholders' interest.
After the meeting, Mr. Casstevens met with reporters and said that there were no plans to present Caterpillar with a contract proposal. "They said their offer is final," he said. "But we are willing to sit down and negotiate with management as long as they agree that there are no preconditions," meaning that the company would first have to withdraw its most recent offer, which the union has rejected.

HEADLINE: Bush Fights Long-Term Change in Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today opposed Congressional efforts to make permanent changes in the unemployment insurance system and urged instead prompt enactment of a third temporary extension of benefits to the long-term jobless.
Labor Secretary Lynn Martin called for the extension, under which jobless workers could collect up to 59 weeks of benefits. She called for bipartisan efforts to move the legislation quickly and wrote Congressional leaders, "I am prepared to work immediately with you and your colleagues in the Congress to develop and enact an extension." 
 But at the same time she declined to testify at a House hearing on the issue scheduled for Thursday. A spokesman for Secretary Martin, Steven Hofman, said she had a schedule conflict and would be unable to appear when a Ways and Means subcommittee would be considering a bill to make it easier for workers to get extra benefits than it is under the current arrangement.
A long-term change is supported by most Democrats and many Republicans because it would remove the need for repeated emergency benefits measures during a recession.
 
Mending vs. Fixing
 Ms. Martin said, "Action should not be delayed by consideration of controversial structural reforms this year." Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who heads the subcommittee, replied: "We have dramatically learned throughout this recession that the unemployment insurance system is broken and needs to be fixed. If we do not do this now, then when does the Bush Administration think is the right time?"
Under emergency measures enacted last November and again in February, extended benefits are paid by the Federal Government after a jobless worker exhausts the basic 26 weeks of compensation most states provide. Jobless workers can get 26 weeks of extra benefits or, in states with especially high unemployment, 33 weeks. Benefits, which are taxable, average about $170 a week nationally but vary greatly from one state to another.
After President Bush killed two earlier versions, the emergency measures were enacted because few workers ever qualified for the 13 weeks of extended benefits allowed under permanent legislation. Last year, only eight states had the required conditions -- high unemployment plus a sharp increase in a particular state's joblessness. Mr. Downey's bill would make those extended benefits much more readily available.
Ms. Martin proposed an extension of the emergency benefits through Dec. 31 of this year. Mr. Downey's bill would continue the emergency benefits at least until next February, when Congress would be in session to continue them longer if necessary.
 
Timing Is Questioned
 Some Congressional Democrats grumbled that the Administration proposal was timed to get the issue out of the way before the election, a charge Mr. Hofman denied. He also said that as the economy improved "we're hopeful that people won't need the extension" being proposed today.
The Administration's stand was also criticized by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee. He said: "There's little doubt we'll extend it again, for the third time in less than a year. What I'm interested in doing is making some permanent changes to end some of the doubts and ease the minds of unemployed Americans. I also want to know how the Administration plans to pay for this."
Ms. Martin's statement and letter said the extension should be paid for without increasing the Federal deficit and without raising taxes. Mr. Downey's proposed legislation would raise payroll taxes to pay for making extended benefits more readily available.
The payroll tax to pay for extended benefits is now eight-tenths of 1 percent of a worker's first $7,000 in earnings, or a maximum of $56 a year. Under Mr. Downey's proposal, the rate would drop but the taxable wage base would be raised. Under his bill the tax would go to three-tenths of 1 percent of the first $27,000, or a maximum of $81 per year.
Mr. Downey would pay for his extension of the current emergency benefits program by continuing tax benefit provisions for some high-bracket taxpayers now scheduled to be phased out in 1996 and 1997.
With unemployment nationally at 7.3 percent, workers in 18 states and Puerto Rico are now eligible for 33 weeks of extended benefits. Elsewhere workers are eligible for 26. The unemployed in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are eligible for 33 extra weeks.

HEADLINE: Senators Question Proposal to Cut Reserves

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
In the first political skirmish over a Pentagon plan to cut 140,000 military reservist positions this year and next, senators today criticized the proposal as ill-conceived, unfair and a threat to each state's ability to respond to natural disasters.
Forgetting for the moment Congressional calls for reductions in military spending, Republicans and Democrats on a Senate Armed Services subcommittee criticized two senior Defense Department officials over details of a plan that the Pentagon announced March 26 that would eliminate or shrink 830 National Guard and service Reserve units in all 50 states. There are a total of 1.2 million reservists. 
 The Guard and service Reserves are among Congress's most sacred political cows, partly because of the economic benefits that constituents reap from part-time salaries and armories.
 
'No Rationale Behind It'
 The Defense Department expected Congressional criticism, but the officials seemed ill-prepared today in a subcommittee hearing to explain in detail both assistance to reservists who lose their positions and reliance on reservists in the future military, as well as how specific reserve units were selected for cuts.
"All we saw was a list of cuts and no rationale behind it," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, which would lose 805, or 6 percent, of its reservist positions.
Over the next five years, the Pentagon wants to eliminate 234,000 reservists positions, at a savings of $20 billion, a move that Congress would have to approve. Last year, Congress approved only about one-third the reductions the Pentagon requested, and a senior Defense Department official said only "about half" of the request for 1992 and 1993 was likely to win approval.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and his senior military advisers say that Guard and Reserve units must be reduced to balance cuts made in the active-duty armed forces. The Pentagon plans to reduce the active military to 1.6 million troops in 1995 from 2 million now, though some Democrats are pressing for deeper reductions.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel, Christopher Jehn, said today that 80 percent of the units to be eliminated supported active-duty forces in Europe that were being phased out.
Stephen M. Duncan, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, said the military services tried to balance the reservist cuts to avoid hurting one state more than another. But six states lost more than a quarter of their reservists while 12 others lost less than 5 percent.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the Pentagon plan "offers haphazard cuts that devastate the Guard in some states, while leaving others virtually untouched." Massachusetts stands to lose 8,473 reservist positions, about 31 percent of all reservist positions in the state.
 
Effect on States
 New York State would lose 9,685 reservist positions, about 18 percent of all reservists in the state; New Jersey would lose 4,725, or 20 percent, of its reservist positions, and Connecticut would lose 2,836 positions, 27 percent of reservists there.
The Army National Guard accounts for about 50 percent of all the reservist positions cut. The President can activate the National Guard during national emergencies, like the Persian Gulf war, but in peacetime the states' governors rely on the Guard for tasks like disaster relief and controlling riots.
Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee's Manpower and Personnel Subcommittee, said that under the Pentagon plan the Ohio National Guard would lose 82 of its 103 helicopters, potentially undermining the Guard's effectiveness in civil emergencies.
The Defense Department and Congress have devised assistance plans for active-duty service members whose military careers are being shortened by early retirement. But lawmakers criticized the Pentagon for failing to take similar steps to protect retirement or education benefits of reservists who have served 10 or 15 years.

HEADLINE: Gay Rights Groups Take Aim at Restaurant Chain That's Hot on Wall Street

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITHONIA, Ga.

 BODY:
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. offers "good country cookin' " in its 118 restaurants and giftware made to look like antiques. On Sundays, particularly, families wait in line for dishes like "country ham n' biscuits n' taters" for $4.89, while many tables stand empty at nearby Burger King and McDonald's restaurants.
And on more and more Sundays, other people have been showing up at Cracker Barrel outlets and have been arrested for various forms of civil disobedience. On a recent Sunday, 90 people occupied a Cracker Barrel near Fredericksburg, Va., and 50 picketed the restaurant here off Interstate 20, just east of Atlanta. 
 The demonstrators say Cracker Barrel is refusing to hire workers who are gay. The company has said various things in response, but if it is discriminating against homosexuals who want work, it is within its legal rights. No Federal law protects gay people from such discrimination, and only five states and about 100 municipalities have such statutes.
 
Push for Public Scorn
 Like the civil rights activists of the 1960's, most of the nation's homosexual-rights organizations are trying to string a noose of public scorn around companies that discriminate.
And Cracker Barrel -- which has traded on traditional values to become a hot stock on Wall Street -- is their No. 1 target.
Half the demonstrators here wore raven-black T-shirts imprinted with a large electric-yellow Q, the emblem of an advocacy group known as Queer Nation. "We're here!" they chanted. "We're queer! Get used to it!"
A mother, hurrying from the restaurant with her husband and two children, said: "It's sad. It's sad the kids have to listen to it."
 
Chants and Arrests
 As if on cue, the protesters, marching along the road 50 yards in front of the restaurant, chanted, "You're teaching your kids to hate! You're teaching your kids to hate!"
The management had the police arrest five demonstrators for criminal trespassing after they set foot briefly on the edge of the parking lot. A few days later, a DeKalb County jury dismissed similar charges against 10 men and women who were arrested after picketing the same restaurant last June.
Increasingly, heterosexuals are joining these rallies. One here was Geri Allen, a shop steward for Local 3204 of the Communications Workers of America in Atlanta. "Civil rights for all," her sign said. Another was Emily Nussbaum of a group called Straight but Not Narrow. "This is everybody's issue," she said.
 
Companies Enact Gay Rights
 Over the past few years, many prominent companies, like American Telephone and Telegraph, International Business Machines, Citicorp, Eastman Kodak, Digital Equipment, Pacific Gas and Electric, Levi Strauss, General Motors and Disney have adopted policies opposing discrimination against homosexuals in hiring and promotions.
Some companies encourage the formation of homosexual employee associations. A leading computer software company, the Lotus Development Corporation, permits homosexual employees to include their companions in their company insurance plans.
But in most of industry, discrimination in hiring and promotion is "very widespread and very subtle" when people are perceived to be homosexual or are open about it, said Tim McFeeley, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign Fund in Washington, a lobbying organization for gay men and women.
"People face it every day," he said. "It has a chilling effect that causes people to stay in the closet, so its very hard to measure."
The advocacy groups say that individuals have sued many employers for discrimination but that only Cracker Barrel has become a target because of company-wide policies.
 
'Blatant Case of Bigotry'
 "Usually companies try to hide what they're doing," said Representative Barney Frank, the openly homosexual Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts. "This is as blatant as any I've heard of. It's a blatant case of bigotry. They'll take money from homosexuals, but they won't give any back."
Early last year, Cracker Barrel dismissed 10 or more workers -- no one outside the company knows the actual number -- because they were homosexual. In a public notice, Cracker Barrel stated that it would no longer employ people "whose sexual preferences fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values which have been the foundation of families in our society."
In the outcry that followed the Cracker Barrel dismissals, the company said it had rescinded the policy. The vice president for human resources who announced the policy has left the company, for what reason the company will not say. It said then that a few dismissed employees would be offered their jobs back.
But none are known to have been rehired. Cheryl Summerville, 34 years old, a Cracker Barrel cook for nearly four years, was one of those dismissed. She was handed a termination notice that read: "This employee is being terminated due to violation of company policy. The employee is gay."
Then, she recalled, she was invited to reapply, not once but twice. "Then I'd get back home," she said, "and they would call and say they changed their mind."
Samuel E. Hare, 25, had worked his way up at an outlet in Charlotte, N.C., to the point where he was training new workers and was in line for promotion to management. "I went in to look at my schedule for the next week," he said, "and I wasn't on it. I went in to see the general manager. 'Obviously there's a mistake,' he said. He said, 'Come in tomorrow, we'll put you on.'
"I went in and the district manager was there. They took me into an office. The general manager said, 'We have a new policy. Cracker Barrel no longer employs homosexuals. Are you gay?' I said yes. I never deny being gay. That's like denying yourself. He said, 'If you're gay, you're fired.' I asked for a pink slip with a reason. I've never gotten one."
George Frisbee, 26, was training new workers as well, at a Cracker Barrel in Tallahassee, Fla. He said he had an argument with a waitress about his homosexuality.
"She said I was going to burn in hell," he said. "I said, 'I don't have to listen to this.' "
On his next day off, Mr. Frisbee said, the general manager asked him to come in. The manager and another manager were waiting in the parking lot.
"One of them said, 'It has recently come to my attention that you are a homosexual, and since it is against our policy to hire them, we're going to have to terminate you,' " Mr. Frisbee said, adding: "There's absolutely no legal recourse. What they did is perfectly legal."
Cracker Barrel routinely refuses to comment about the issues. "I think that we would decline an offer to speak with anyone here," Ellen Cozark, director of employee relations, said. She refers inquiries to the last official statement of the company's chairman, Dan W. Evins, at the annual meeting in November.
"Let me state once and for all for the record," he said. "Cracker Barrel Old Country Store is an equal opportunity employer that adheres to the letter and the spirit of the law regarding non-discrimination in the workplace. We hire and promote men and women solely on the basis of their qualifications and performance."
But homosexual groups say Mr. Evins has merely camouflaged the policy. Federal civil rights law, they note, protects women, racial and ethnic groups, religious groups, older workers and the disabled from workplace discrimination, not homosexuals. Of the 15 states where the company has opened restaurants, none include the five -- Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Hawaii -- that have banned discrimination against homosexuals.
Mr. Evins has also ignored an appeal from a major investor, the pension funds of the City of New York, which hold more than $6 million in Cracker Barrel stock.
Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York City Comptroller, and Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's Finance Commissioner, wrote to him in March 1991 asking for the company's policy concerning the sexual preference in employment. Mr. Evins answered that the earlier policy had been rescinded and that the company had apologized. "We have no morally discriminating policies in this company," he said.
Ms. Holtzman and Ms. O'Cleireacain wrote twice more seeking an unequivocal statement that the company prohibits discrimination and asking what remedial steps it had taken for the dismissed employees. Mr. Evins did not answer either letter. They have now submitted a resolution, to be voted upon at the company's annual stockholders' meeting in November, that would mandate a nondiscriminatory policy.
"This is a classic example of why we need some kind of Federal protection against this kind of discrimination," said William B. Rubenstein, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. "It's not that Cracker Barrel is saying they're not good employees, just that there's a societal dislike of them."
 
Legislation Before Congress
 Legislation to extend Federal civil rights protection to homosexuals has been introduced in the House of Representatives, with 115 sponsors, and the Senate, with 15, but no one expects it to be enacted anytime soon.
Whatever the company's strategy, it has not hurt growth. Last year, amid the recession and demonstrations at the restaurants, Cracker Barrel's sales climbed to $300 million from $226 million and its profits to $23 million from $15 million. Unlike the stock market routs that public relations nightmares caused the Dow Corning Corporation after the controversy over silicon breast implants or the Exxon Corporation after the oil spill of the Exxon Valdez, Cracker Barrel's stock has marched right along with its ever-growing business.
"The feedback they get from their customers might be in favor of not hiring homosexuals," said Steven A. Rockwell, a securities analyst at the Alex Brown & Sons brokerage firm.
Indeed, many customers at the store here seemed sympathetic with the company. Bill Copeland of Loganville, Ga., who was going in for lunch with his mother and his children, said: "It tells us in the Bible homosexuality is a sin. It's unnatural. I support Cracker Barrel. As a Christian, I believe in God's laws, and God's laws do not provide for immorality."
A Cracker Barrel executive who would not give his name stood beside the row of oak rocking chairs selling for $99.99 in front of the store here and said: "The only comment I would make is, you see all these cars here? They're going to continue to support this business."
Some people in gay advocacy groups speculate that the Southerners who run Cracker Barrel have a masterful grasp of finance and marketing but are baffled by the outcry over equal rights for homosexuals. To keep growing, the company, with headquarters in Lebanon, Tenn., is heading north and west -- opening stores this year in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio -- where it might find police departments and courts more reluctant to apprehend and punish the protesters.
"They don't understand it," said Teresa Nelson, executive director of the Atlanta office of the A.C.L.U. "They don't understand they're doing something wrong with this type of discrimination. They're so confused now."

HEADLINE: An Emotional Ashe Says That He Has AIDS

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
Arthur Ashe, the former United States Open and Wimbledon champion and a pioneer in sports and social issues, said yesterday that he had contracted AIDS, apparently from a blood transfusion, and that he had known about his condition for more than three years.
Although he had told several close friends about his condition, Ashe said he decided to disclose his illness publicly only after learning that a newspaper was preparing an article about it. 
 Accompanied by his wife, Jeanne; Mayor David N. Dinkins, a close friend; three physicians, and his attorney, Ashe told reporters at an emotional news conference in midtown Manhattan that doctors informed him that he had the disease after he underwent brain surgery in September 1988.
The surgery was performed in an effort to determine the cause of a sudden paralysis in one arm. A biopsy revealed the presence of toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that often indicates an AIDS infection. Blood tests confirmed Ashe was infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
The infection and the test results, together, led to a diagnosis that Ashe had AIDS.
Ashe had previously undergone cardiac-bypass operations in 1979 and again in 1983. He said yesterday that the virus had been transmitted through blood transfusions, most likely after the second operation.
 
Cites 'Rumors and Half-Truths'
 Reading from a three-page statement, Ashe alluded to "rumors and half-truths" he felt existed about his health for the last several years.
"Beginning with my admittance to New York Hospital for brain surgery in September 1988, some of you heard that I had tested positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. That is indeed the case," said Ashe, who won the first United States Open in 1968, captured Wimbledon in 1975 and became the most prominent black male tennis player in history.
Ashe, 48 years old, said he decided to make the announcement yesterday after a reporter from USA Today called to ask about rumors that he was suffering from the disease. And while not blaming the newspaper, he said he was angered about what he considered to be an intrusion into his privacy.
"I am angry that I was put in the position of having to lie if I wanted to protect my privacy," said Ashe, who works for HBO and ABC Sports as a tennis commentator. He also writes occasional columns for The Washington Post.
"Obviously, I operate in the role of press myself, so I understand it," he said. "Still, I didn't commit any crime. I'm not running for public office. I should be able to reserve the right to keep things like that private. After all, the doctor-patient and lawyer-client relationships are private."
 
Second Major Sports Figure
 Ashe's disclosure marks the second time in five months that a major sports figure has publicly stated that he has been infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Magic Johnson announced his retirement from professional basketball last November, saying he had become infected through heterosexual intercourse. Johnson's doctors say he has not developed the actual disease. However, Ashe and his doctors said yesterday that the former tennis champion is suffering from AIDS itself.
Ashe said that he had chosen to conceal the disease from all but a close circle of family members and friends because "any admission of H.I.V. infection at that time would have seriously, permanently and -- my wife and I believe -- unnecessarily infringed upon our family's right to privacy.
"Just as I'm sure everyone in this room has some personal matter he or she would like to keep private, so did we," Ashe said. "There was certainly no compelling medical or physical necessity to go public with my medical condition."
In a conversation earlier in the day, Ashe said he felt a number of reporters who cover tennis, as well as players and officials, knew or suspected he had AIDS but did not press the subject.
"What I came to feel about a year ago was that there was a silent and generous conspiracy to assist me in maintaining my privacy," he said, still reading from the statement. Then speaking about his wife and 5-year-old daughter, he said, "This has meant a great deal to me and Jeanne and Camera."
At this point, Ashe began to weep. After several seconds, his wife, who had moved to his side, completed the thought, saying: "Arthur and I must teach her how to react to new, different and sometimes cruel comments that have very little to do with her reality."
Charles Pasarell, a former top-ranking American player and one of Ashe's closest friends for more than 35 years, confirmed that Ashe had told him he had contracted AIDS shortly after being given the AIDS diagnosis in 1988. Another longtime friend and former player, Cliff Drysdale, also said he knew.
"He knew then that his time was limited, but on the positive side, he wanted to keep writing and traveling and felt he could do that with more focus if things were handled this way," Drysdale said from Amelia Island, Fla.
Drysdale said he had talked with Ashe about whether to disclose his illness.
"We talked about it again after Magic Johnson's announcement, and Arthur was closer but still not prepared to go public," Drysdale said.
 
A Phone Call From Reporter
 Ashe, known for his unflappable demeanor as a player and as someone who had spoken out on a variety of subjects ranging from apartheid to academics to athletics, said he received a call on Tuesday from a USA Today reporter. He said the reporter was seeking to confirm a tip that Ashe was suffering from AIDS.
Ashe said that as a result of the call he fully expected to see an article in the paper yesterday.
Gene Policinski, managing editor for sports of USA Today, said yesterday that the paper had compiled information indicating that Ashe was "very ill" and that he had assigned the paper's tennis writer, Doug Smith, to check the story.
Policinski said he also talked with Ashe Tuesday afternoon for about 20 to 30 minutes. "I asked him if it was true," Policinski said. "He said, 'Could be,' but he did not confirm nor deny it." The editor said he told Ashe that "USA Today does not print unconfirmed stories from unattributed sources, but in the absence of a hard denial, or confirmation, the information seemed credible and we would continue to pursue the story."
By 11 P.M. Tuesday, the editor said, he decided there was insufficient information to print the story.
In the meantime, though, Ashe assumed that the article would in fact run and started calling friends and family and arranged for yesterday's news conference.
"I'm not picking on USA, it could have been anybody who had received this call in the middle of the night," he said. "Somebody just called and ratted on me. And so USA Today felt, journalistically, that they had to follow up and I was the victim. I did not want to have to go public now because I'm not sick. I can function very well and I plan to continue being active in those things I've been doing all along -- if the public will let me."
Since learning he was infected with the virus, Ashe has done extensive scholarship on blacks and athletics, the highlight being a three-volume work on the history of black athletes called "A Hard Road to Glory."
He has written papers and appeared in numerous forums in connection with academic reform in intercollegiate athletics. A longtime crusader against apartheid, Ashe recently visited South Africa and remains opposed to that country's readmission to the Olympic movement.
Ashe said he received a phone call from President Bush this morning, wishing him and his family well.
Ashe said he he would become involved in the President's commission on AIDS. But he said he had not felt compelled to come forward in order to help the cause of AIDS awareness.
"I knew even before Magic that if I wanted to go public I could possibly help," Ashe said. "But I wasn't ready to go public with it because I had some things that I wanted to do, unfettered, so to speak. I knew that with the public still learning about AIDS, that would have been impossible, once you go public."
"The crisis period was yesterday afternoon, from 3:15 to 2 A.M. it was nonstop. I thought something would be in the paper this morning; I was convinced I would wake up this morning and see some announcement about this in USA Today. To the extent that they did not do it, I thank them."
Ashe said that he did not ask to have the hospital blood supply checked before his 1979 and 1983 operations, nor was he advised to. He said he had no plans to sue. Standard testing of blood donated for transfusion to detect evidence of H.I.V. infection began in mid-1985. "It's something that never came up," Ashe said.
Ashe has played a monumental role in tennis. In 1968, with the nation divided by riots fueled by economic racial tensions, Ashe, at the time a 25-year-old Army lieutenant, won both the United States Amateur and then the Open. His Open victory marked the first time a black male had won a Grand Slam event.
In recent years, he has vigorously crusaded against the exploitation of college and high school athletes. He was instrumental in forming a New York-based sports organization aimed at high school athletes.
Dr. Stephen Scheidt, Ashe's cardiologist at New York Hospital, said yesterday he was optimistic over how Ashe would deal with yesterday's revelations.
"Anyone who gets to win the U.S. Open has seen more pressure than any of us can imagine," he said. "He is the most calm, collected, introspective, marvelous person you could imagine. If there's anybody who can handle pressure, it's Arthur Ashe."

HEADLINE: Arbitration Considered By M.T.A.

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said yesterday that it would seek arbitration to obtain a new contract with the transit workers' union if labor leaders continued to press for financial concessions.
The threat came after the two sides briefly resumed negotiations for a new contract. The meeting -- the first since the union's 32,000 members decisively rejected a tentative contract three weeks ago -- lasted about an hour. 
 Afterward, Peter E. Stangl, the M.T.A. chairman, said in a statement that the transit agency had no money to sweeten its offer. "Unless the union comes to its senses and recognizes the intense financial pressure that our mass transit network is under, I cannot see how continued bargaining may result in a settlement," he said.
 
Seek New Benefits
 The tentative agreement reached by the union's leaders and transit officials in January called for a raise of 4.5 percent this year and an additional 2 percent next year. It included a $1,000 payment to cover inflation since the old contract expired last May but called for no retroactive raise.
In endorsing the January agreement, leaders of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union said they had obtained the best contract they could from the financially pressed agency. But the union's members disagreed, rejecting the proposal by a 2-to-1 ratio.
Sonny Hall, the union's president, said that he asked M.T.A. officials yesterday for a larger wage offer and that he had sought elimination of a worker-productivity agreement included in the tentative pact. He also said he had asked for the creation of a union-management committee to study parental leave and child care; union members recently criticized Mr. Hall for not pushing for such new benefits.
 
Wants More State Aid
 Mr. Hall said in a statement that transit officials should join the union in lobbying in Albany for more state mass-transit aid to finance a better contract. He also proposed using money from the M.T.A.'s capital budget to increase transit workers' salaries.
But Mr. Stangl said, "There is no more money available." He added that he had told union leaders that unless they withdrew their demand for additional increases in salary and benefits, he would invoke state law and seek to have the dispute settled by arbitration.
Under the Taylor Law, either side can ask the State Public Employment Relations Board to declare that talks have reached an impasse. The board appoints a mediator to determine whether an impasse has been reached. If the mediator and the state board decide that additional negotiations are fruitless, the board will submit the dispute to binding arbitration.

HEADLINE: Where You Are What You Wear;
At the Sunglass Hut, Selling Image and Status by the Pair

SERIES: Modern Mecca -- Fourth in a series of occasional visits to a regional shoppinf mall.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn.

 BODY:
A stylish woman swept past Kristian Matz at the mall.
"Christian Dior, $275," he said.
He meant the sunglasses.
He would. 
 Malls have given a whole new meaning to the term "specialist." There are stores that sell only shirts. There are sneaker shops, jeans joints and pocketbook parlors. Each is staffed by people who cultivate an unusually narrow expertise and tend to get distracted by particular passing body coverings.
At the dawn of the consumer age, Vance Packard's 1957 book "The Hidden Persuaders" detailed how automobile dealers peddled hope, status and sexual image. In the day of the mall, the new persuaders are places like the specialty shop where 21-year-old Kristian Matz works: Sunglass Hut.
The Hut, in some 540 mall locations from coast to coast -- including two here at the Danbury Fair Mall -- decrees that shades are the "health product of the 90's." It seems to scream that, sags and bulges notwithstanding, anyone can look like Tom Cruise (in "Rainman," L.A. Eyeworks, Botta, $120) or Susan Sarandon (in "Thelma & Louise" L.A. Eyeworks, Cornu, $150) or, should the need arise, Arnold Schwarzenegger (in "Terminator 2," Persol Wraparounds $198).
"Our goal is to make sunglasses like owning shoes," said Jack B. Chadsey, the president of the Sunglass Hut Corporation, which is based in Miami. "Men could have four to five pairs. You tell me how many pairs women could have."
If the Hut fails to make sunglasses essential, it will not be for lack of trying, recent visits to Danbury Fair proved. From the bottom of the organization, to the top, the sunglass mantra rings.
"Sunglasses are mysterious. They're sexy. It's a fun product," said Steve Lemack, the Sunglass Hut regional director, whose territory includes the Danbury Fair stores.
At the Danbury mall, Kristian Matz and the other sunglass sales associates, whose average age is 21.8 and who all look as though they just came in from the beach, can deliver a sunglass spiel in person that is nearly as convincing as the ones Mr. Chadsey and Mr. Lemack made over the telephone.
They analyze the "function" and "fashion" components of sunglass desirability. They explain the relationship between the depletion of the ozone layer and the need for sunglasses. And they provide fashion advice. But with the accent on the positive.
There is the occasional double-chinned customer, just sliding toward middle age, who is intent on the surfer's specs (like Bausch & Lomb's Killer Loops with polycarbonite lenses, $89). Such a prospect, Mr. Matz said, is likely to receive the advice that a tamer pair might look, well, better with his features and skin pigmentation.
"You don't want to put down your product," Mr. Matz said.
 
Different Perspectives
 All the attention on sunglasses, some of the Hutmen admitted, does slightly skew their view of the world. Leo D. Mueller, an earnest 23-year-old who is the manager of both of the Danbury Fair's Sunglass Huts, recently went to Florida on vacation. Along the route, he said, he stopped at other Huts just to visit. And on the beach, he said, "You look at 'em. Everyone's got 'em on. 'He's got $200 ones on; she's wearing cheap ones.' "
Edward Wheeler, who is, at 25, the oldest of Danbury Fair's Hut salesmen, says Leo Mueller sometimes gets carried away with his sunglass zealotry. "He likes 'em," Mr. Wheeler said of his young boss. "He wants you to like 'em. 'Everyone has sunglasses? The world is great,' " according to Leo, Mr. Wheeler said. "I can't get that worked up about them"
Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Mueller, it is true, do not have much in common.
For one thing, Mr. Wheeler has a college degree in economics and says he is working at Sunglass Hut "in between" jobs as a junior accountant. Mr. Mueller has temporarily suspended his college studies and is "shooting," he said, to be the president of a company like Sunglass Hut someday.
 
Different Specs
 For another, Mr. Wheeler wears Revo's modified cat's-eye style graphite sunglasses, while Mr. Mueller has Revo's Shapes Combo Round in mock tortoise shell with orange lenses.
Despite this gulf between them, however, when tested, Mr. Wheeler showed a true Hutster's ability to discern the link between personality and sunglass preference.
Behind the counter at the Hut's lower level location at Danbury Fair, called Sunglass Place, even though it is really a Sunglass Hut, Mr. Wheeler looked down at the selection. In the display case, where an ordinary person might see only plastic and glass, Ed Wheeler saw much of the human condition.
To him the Serengeti graphite goggle represented "an older guy, whose looks aren't primary, conservatively dressed." The Ray-Ban Clubmaster: "That's going to probably be a lady in her late 20's, who's fairly well-off." The 60's retro-look wire rims, like one manufacturer's John Lennon line, brought to Mr. Wheeler's eye this picture: "Late teens, early 20's. Jeans. Sweatshirts. Flannel."
But, despite the Hut's carefully crafted health pitch, another point of common ground between Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Mueller is their experience that something other than ozone-layer anxiety is the real persuader. "The No. 1 factor: Looks," Mr. Wheeler said.
Mr. Mueller agreed. "We have a lot of girls," he said, "who come in and say, 'What would make a guy look at me in a car?' "
Back when Vance Packard was writing, car dealers had a way of exploiting people's secret yearnings. They would, he wrote, put buffed convertibles in their windows. One study he cited said men were drawn into the showrooms by this "possible symbolic mistress," though most ended up buying practical, clunky sedans.
Sunglass Hut has its own version of the '57 red Cadillac Eldorado convertible with the big fins.
Always glowing in the display cases of the Danbury Fair's Sunglass Huts, are the shields of Oakley's Mumbo Heaters ($135) that come in Blue and Red Iridium and other electric colors. Mumbos are the M-shaped wraparound high-tech shades ("effective against wind, rain, mud, snow and thermonuclear explosion," according to their maker) that are favored by the speed-skater Bonnie Blair, who wore them in the Olympics, and the skier Glen Plake, who sometimes adds iridescent colors to his shoulder-length hair.
"Your introvert will not get a pair of Mumbos," Mr. Wheeler has concluded.
 
A Dose of Hut Reality
 Yet, all day long at the Danbury Huts, the Heaters' Plutonite lenses draw people willing to try on danger. They even draw people who are not in the Hut's prime demographic target group, which consists, according to Mr. Chadsey, of relatively young, white-collar people with "a strong fashion sense."
Tino Sinap, 15, from Brewster, N.Y., went for the Heaters right away the other day. "It goes with good hair," he said. "On the beach, you see guys with lots of muscles wearing 'em."
When Tino was finished, a man who had been spending a good deal of time around the Hut finally stepped up to the counter to take the Heater challenge. The man had come to think of himself as part of the Hut's target demographic group.
Leo Mueller put the Heaters on the counter.
Then, he put out a much tamer pair.
The man tried them both.
Leo Mueller studied him.
Then came the dose of Hut reality. The tamer pair, Leo Mueller said, looked, well, better with the man's features and skin pigmentation.
Defeated, the man put the Heaters with the Blue Iridium lenses back on the counter. He had really thought, until then -- even though he remembered when John Lennon was a Beatle and not a line of sunglasses -- that he was still young enough to be a Mumbo man.
But he did not say anything.
Until now.

It described the mall, in Danbury, Conn., as one of the region's new "town squares," a place that draws people not only to buy, but to stroll and to meet friends, a place where some succeed and others fail. The second article, on April 1, told of a woman who became a successful drapery saleswoman at the mall after her husband lost his job. The third article, on April 5, described the young people who have made the mall the center of their social life.

HEADLINE: 73.4% of New Jersey School Budgets Win Approval

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

 BODY:
In a striking retreat from their revolt against school spending in 1990 and 1991, New Jersey voters approved 73.4 percent of local school budgets on Tuesday, the highest rate of passage since 1987.
The returns, which surprised even the most optimistic state education officials, may be a sign that anti-tax sentiment is mellowing in New Jersey. But some school superintendents suggested that the anti-tax fervor, which has gripped the state's politics since Gov. Jim Florio pushed through a $2.8 billion tax package nearly two years ago, remained, with voters were content to focus their anger on politicians -- not school systems. 
 "I'm delighted, obviously," said New Jersey's Education Commimmissioner, John Ellis. "The taxpayers responded admirably to school needs, especially in light of the recession. It's a very positive message for education in New Jersey. Thank you, New Jersey, for caring about kids."
In a statement, Governor Florio praised school officials, teachers and board members for what he called living within their means. "We need to build on this success by making sure we keep on delivering the best education at the most reasonable cost," he said.
 
Some Sharp Swings
 Dr. Ellis's office reported that 405 of the 552 school budgets were approved. The passage rate exceeded 60 percent in all but two of the state's 21 counties. In Middlesex, a growing suburban county in north-central New Jersey and a hotbed of resistance last spring, 11 of 22 budgets were approved; in Hudson, a blue-collar urban county, 2 of 6 budgets were approved.
Only 56 percent of local school budgets were approved last year, and only 52 percent were approved in 1990. On the eve of the vote, there were few signs of a significant change in the taxpayers' mood.
But some counties showed sharp swings from 1991's anti-spending atmosphere. Bergen County's voters approved nearly 62 percent of its budgets after rejecting 66 percent last year. Monmouth, like Middlesex a hotbed of tax protest, approved nearly 76 percent after rejecting nearly 63 percent last year.
Robert E. Boose, executive director of the New Jersey School Boards Association, expressed surprise.
"School boards recognized citizens' concerns about taxes and the economy and generally responded with lean budgets," he said in a statement. "At the same time, school district personnel are becoming increasingly adept at explaining the budget and its impact on educational programs and taxes to their communities."
Dr. Ellis and other officials attributed the results to three factors: School districts tightened spending in the face of growing taxpayer hostility since 1987; the state imposed limits on increases in local school budgets, and the Florio administration provided $341 million in extra state aid for the 1992-93 school year by revaluing the assets of state pension funds.
That new money, which still must be approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature, improved the financial picture for scores of districts. Without it, 304 districts would have faced cuts in state aid for the next school year. Now, 153 will have reductions.
The spending limits, or caps, restrict budget growth to between 5.6 and 6.8 percent for all but the 30 poorest districts. Those caps were created by the Quality Education Act, the Governor's controversial two-year revision to the state's school spending formula, which shifts millions in aid from the richest suburban districts to less wealthy systems.
The caps have forced districts to become more frugal, helped cut salary increases for teachers and consequently reduced annual tax increases.
Teacher contracts for 1991-92 that were negotiated before 1991 provided an average annual pay increase of 9.04 percent, the school boards organization said. The increases negotiated in 1991, however, declined steadily through the year -- from 8.7 percent in contracts settled in the first quarter to 7.63 percent in those negotiated in the fourth quarter, the association said.
Some superintendents believe the taxpayers are satisfied with the program cutbacks made in the last two years. In Ridgewood, a wealthy district in Bergen County, the $35.6 million budget was approved by 76 votes. About 2,500 residents voted, about half the number that turned out last year when Ridgewood's budget was overwhelmingly rejected. The budget grew by 4.6 percent, well below Ridgewood's cap of 5.9 percent, and it will increase school taxes by $185 on the average $308,000 home. That increase is the lowest in five years, the superintendent, Frederick J. Stokley, said.
To keep the increase that low, Ridgewood eliminated 16 teaching jobs and 8 administrative posts, ended courses in Japanese, Russian and Chinese, canceled a camp for sixth graders, reduced science electives, increased high-school class sizes and hired private companies to operate its cafeteria and buses. It is hoping to save as much as $1 million more by hiring janitors from a private company.
"People are getting concerned about reductions," Dr. Stokley said. "I think they may feel enough is enough and let's get on with providing a quality education."
In Bogota, a blue-collar district in Bergen, voters approved the budget for the first time in a decade after the board voted to close one of its three elementary schools to save about $400,000 in staff costs and keep the increase in the 1992-93 budget of $5.9 million to about $500,000.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Hallmark to Sell Its Univision TV Group

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 8

 BODY:
Hallmark Cards Inc. said today that it had agreed to sell Univision Holdings, the nation's largest Spanish-language television network and station group, to a group headed by A. Jerrold Perenchio, a Hollywood producer, for $550 million.
The deal includes the Univision network, which is carried by local affiliates and cable systems nationwide, and 13 Spanish-language broadcasting stations, including WXTV, Channel 41, in the New York area, and KMEX-TV, Channel 34, in the Los Angeles area. 
 If approved by the Federal Communications Commission, the deal would end Hallmark's five-year involvement in Spanish-language broadcasting, a business that analysts have said has tremendous potential for growth but that has proved financially problematic in the last few years for Univision and its main competitor, the Telemundo Group.
Hallmark has spent well over $550 million in acquiring and running Univision. The company paid $286 million in 1987 to acquire five Spanish-language stations and another $265 million the next year to acquire the Univision network. It also spent tens of millions of dollars acquiring smaller stations and on new broadcasting studios and programming.
Hallmark, which is a private company, declined to say whether the network and the stations were profitable. But a spokesman for Hallmark, Steven Doyal, said it would post a "modest loss" on the sale.
Hallmark said Univision Holdings had revenues exceeding $200 million last year. Mr. Doyal said the broadcasting operation's cash flows had remained level since being acquired by Hallmark, a performance that he said was below the company's expectations.
Mr. Doyal said Univision and the stations had been hurt by the recession and the resulting weakness in advertising sales, the need for continuing investments in programming and equipment and increasingly stiff competition from Telemundo.
Mr. Perenchio, who is leading the group buying Univision and the television stations, is best known as the former partner of Norman Lear in producing such hit shows as "All in the Family" and "The Jeffersons." At different times, he has also owned small Spanish-language stations in New York and Los Angeles.
Mr. Perenchio's group includes Venevision, Venezuela's largest broadcaster, and Grupo Televisa, Mexico's largest broadcaster. Federal regulations prohibit foreign companies from controlling television stations in the United States.
A spokesman for Mr. Perenchio, Brian Regan, said the deal would be structured to avoid foreign control of the stations. He said Mr. Perenchio would have a 75 percent equity stake in the stations, with the foreign partners holding the remainder. A spokeswoman for the F.C.C. said the regulations allowed foreign owners to hold a stake as large as 25 percent.
Mr. Regan said Mr. Perenchio would own 50 percent of the Univision network, with the two foreign partners splitting the remainder.
"The U.S. Hispanic marketplace is growing dramatically and is ready to support the highest quality in television entertainment, news and public affairs and cultural and children's programming," Mr. Perenchio said in a statement.
Mr. Perenchio's group declined to say what changes it might have in mind for Univision's operations and programming. But the presence in the investor group of Venevision and Televisa suggested that Univision could buy more programming produced by those companies for their home markets, slowing the trend toward greater use of programming made in the United States.
"Hallmark has done an excellent job of developing Univision's resources, which are its superb talent and outstanding management," Mr. Perenchio said. "Now, with the investor group, we have an even broader range of capabilities to support the next stage in Univision's development."
Univision can be seen in 90 percent of the nation's Hispanic households, making it larger than Telemundo, which is seen in about 84 percent of homes. Although Telemundo's ratings are strong, Univision remains the ratings leader and produces the nation's most popular Spanish-language program, "Sabado Gigante," a variety and game show.
Like Univision, Telemundo has been hurt by the soft television advertising market. Telemundo, which is 80 percent owned by Saul P. Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings Inc., missed a debt payment in January and is currently in negotiations with bondholders to restructure its debt.

HEADLINE: Export Curbs Will Ease, Official Says

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin said today that in her first month on the job she had begun a push to ease American controls on exports and planned to lift controls on 11 types of products, including some computer chips.
Ms. Franklin, a management consultant and Republican fund-raiser tapped by President Bush in December, said the White House was in the final stages of reviewing her export control plan. 
 A final decision, which could eventually allow up to $3 billion a year in additional American exports to former Communist countries, may be reached by the end of this week, she said.
 
No Plans for Reorganization
 In recent years, the Commerce Department has lost much of its influence over trade policy to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. But Ms. Franklin said she had no plans to reorganize her sprawling department and expressed no enthusiasm for proposals made in Congress and by the late Malcolm Baldrige, the Commerce Secretary from 1981 to 1987, to rebuild the agency as a Department of Trade and Industry.
Ms. Franklin criticized the draft agreement reached last week with the European Community that would limit but not abolish Government subsidies to commercial aircraft makers. She said it should not be a model for future agreements because it would reduce but not eliminate subsidies.
By a voice vote, the Senate adopted a resolution today condemning subsidies and implicitly criticizing the deal with the European Community.
The office headed by the trade representative, Carla A. Hills, negotiated the pact. Ms. Franklin has known Mrs. Hills for years and served for six years on one of the trade office's private-sector advisory committees.
Ms. Franklin has had a slow and sometimes difficult start in her job, including a Senate confirmation process that featured strong criticisms of her competence from Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia.
During a short press briefing last week on commercial relations with the former Soviet republics, she repeatedly showed little awareness of such basic issues as the status of trade agreements.
But this morning, in her first interview since President Bush nominated her on Dec. 26, Ms. Franklin took pains to demonstrate a detailed knowledge of her huge department. She had on her Government-issue walnut desk a copy of the highly technical agreement on aircraft manufacturing subsidies, and said she had been reading it earlier in the morning.
 
Likes Moratorium on Regulations
 Ms. Franklin also said this morning that the Administration's 90-day moratorium on the issuance of new regulations should be extended and that export promotion policy should be reviewed at the Cabinet, not the sub-Cabinet, level.
Ms. Franklin, who used to sit on the audit committees of several large corporations, said she would urge the Financial Accounting Standards Board to consider the effects on American competitiveness before changing accounting rules. She expressed particular concern about the board's decision to begin forcing companies to recognize as a liability the eventual cost of retirement health benefits for current employees.
But American companies have already fought that battle and appear to have lost. I.B.M. and many other corporations have already made the move, which results in a charge against earnings although no cash is actually set aside.
In discussing the aircraft manufacturing accord, Ms. Franklin said the pact should have forced the European Community to eliminate subsidies entirely. The pact limits cash advances from governments to 33 percent of the cost of developing an aircraft, and requires that the money be paid back with interest as planes are sold.
"I don't want a precedent for the future out of this agreement," she said.
A separate provision limits indirect subsidies to aircraft manufacturers through military contracts and other government deals. An informal understanding on limits for these subsidies broke down this week, and secret negotiations continued today as American and European Community officials tried to resolve their differences.
Senator John C. Danforth, the Missouri Republican who sponsored the nonbinding resolution condemning subsidies today, said he hoped the new round of talks "totally breaks down."
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said he would schedule a hearing on subsidies in aircraft manufacturing and other industries. Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the subcommittee on international trade and has often supported the Administration, said that last week's deal signaled to foreign trade negotiators a new American willingness to compromise.
Ms. Franklin also said that she would be overseeing some trade issues involving auto parts even though her husband, Wallace Barnes, heads a large auto parts company. Only issues affecting specific products made by the Barnes Group will be off limits, she said.
Two thick metal springs for engine valves sat on the coffee table in Ms. Franklin's office; four more, painted blue and red, were perched on the edge of her desk.

O.E.C.D. Fails on Ships
 WASHINGTON, April 8 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- The United States and other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have failed to negotiate an agreement that would eliminate government subsidies to shipbuilders.
The O.E.C.D. members concluded negotiations today without an agreement, according to an announcement by Michael H. Moskow, a deputy United States Trade Representative. The United States also declined to commit to future negotiations at this time, the release said.
The negotiations foundered on "differences over a number of key elements," the United States trade office said in the announcement, which did not elaborate on the sticking points.
Japan, South Korea, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the countries of the European Community participated in the negotiations with the United States. Together these countries cover about 80 percent of world shipbuilding production, the United States trade office said.

HEADLINE: Progress Reported in Talks On North American Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTREAL, April 8

 BODY:
The United States, Canada and Mexico have narrowed differences on issues ranging from autos to energy in negotiations on a North American free trade area, ministers of the three countries said after three days of meeting here. The Bush Administration is hoping for a pact before November.
Despite reports from Washington that the Administration is getting cold feet because an agreement might give capital to political opponents, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said today in a meeting with reporters that the President wanted to "complete negotiations as soon as possible." 
 "I think we could complete our negotiations and initial an agreement and subsequently sign it by November," she said.
 
Progress in Technical Areas
 With Mrs. Hills were Canada's International Trade Minister, Michael H. Wilson, and Mexico's trade minister, Jaime Serra Puche. All three spoke of progress in narrowing differences in technical areas.
While they took a generally optimistic tone, the negotiators declined to provide evidence of emerging accords on specific industries, emphasizing that nothing was final until everything was agreed.
One contentious issue relates to the way rules defining North American content are worked out for automobiles, computers, textiles and other products.
In autos, the United States wants Canada and Mexico to accept a 60 percent content rule -- which means that at least 60 percent of the value of a car would have to be produced in North America for it to avoid tariffs.
In the existing United States-Canada free trade accord, 50 percent was agreed on. Canada and Mexico both want the 50 percent maintained, arguing that at 60 percent the United States would take Asian investment away from them.
Washington is also seeking to open parts of Mexico's energy industry, which was nationalized in 1938 and is protected as part of the national patrimony in Mexico's Constitution.
While Mexico does not want to be seen giving away control of oil to the United States, its oil industry needs huge sums to modernize and increase output.
Negotiators are looking for ways to allow for foreign investment and other participation in the industry without touching off a domestic political storm.
 
The Political Consequences
 Mrs. Hills said she thought the political consequences of an agreement could be positive. "Those voters who believe that it is good for the region to find ways to become more competitive globally will mark that as a plus," she said. "Those who are resigned to the belief that a free trade area is not in their best interest will mark it as a minus."
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the front-runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination, has expressed support for North American free trade, but some political analysts say he could make any accord negotiated by the Bush Administration an issue by promising to renegotiate to get a better deal.
Edmund G. Brown Jr., who is fighting Mr. Clinton for the nomination, has said he would delay a North American trade deal until he had a job protection strategy in place.
Some experts say the agreement will provide more jobs in the United States, but it could create some dislocation for a number of lower-skilled workers in sectors in which the United States competes with Mexico, like agriculture and apparel.
A recent study by the Institute for International Economics found that the free trade agreement would create 600,000 jobs in Mexico and 130,000 jobs in the United States. Canada would undergo a net loss of 4,000, the study said.

Lucasfilm Subsidiary Loses Chief Executive

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The Lucas Arts Entertainment Company said yesterday that R. Douglas Norby had resigned as president and chief executive. A wholly owned subsidiary of Lucasfilm Ltd., Lucas Arts has products and services that include visual effects, sound and sound effects, television commercials, licensing, computer-game software, audio systems and educational multimedia products. Lucas Arts is based in San Rafael, Calif.
Mr. Norby, who is 56 years old, was not available for comment. The company said only that he had determined that it was "an appropriate time to pursue other professional challenges." 
 But Mr. Norby is the second executive to resign in recent months, following Scott Ross, who managed Industrial Light and Magic, the special-effects unit, and Skywalker Sound, which provided sound recording for both Lucasfilm and contract customers.
"I appreciate Doug's dedication to the company during the past seven years and wish him the best in his future endeavors," George Lucas, Lucas Arts' chairman, and founder of Lucasfilm, said in a statement. "I'm tremendously proud of the accomplishments Lucas Arts has achieved under Doug, and I am committed to preserving its innovative spirit and maintaining its creative and technical excellence."
Lucas Arts said that a search for a successor to Mr. Norby was under way, and that he would continue to serve on the company's board and assist in the transition. In the interim, the board appointed Gordon Radley, 45, as acting chief operating officer. Mr. Radley joined Lucasfilm in 1985 and for the last two years has served as group vice president of Lucas Arts responsible for business affairs, legal, finance and accounting.
Mr. Norby's departure follows a year of achievements for the various divisions of Lucas Arts. Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound garnered eight Academy Award nominations and won three Oscars for visual effects, sound and sound-effects editing.
Mr. Norby came to Lucasfilm in 1985 from the Syntex Corporation, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer based in Palo Alto, Calif., where he was chief financial officer. He created the Lucas Arts subsidiary in 1989 and oversaw its growth into new businesses such as software and educational materials. But he said recently that Lucasfilm was not immune to the economy or competition and predicted a period of slower growth.
Mr. Radley began his career in the entertainment industry in 1973 as a business lawyer. Before joining Lucasfilm, he served as senior business and legal counsel at 20th Century Fox for its theatrical and television divisions.

Taxable and Tax-Free Funds Post Mixed Yields in Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed in the last week.
After posting gains the week before, tax-exempt money fund yields reversed direction and fell significantly. However, analysts noted that even with the decline, tax-exempt yields were still about 25 to 30 basis points, or hundredths of percentage points, higher than they were about a month ago. 
 The seven-day compounded average yield for tax-exempt funds fell 12 basis points, to 2.92 percent, with the simple yield down 11 basis points, to 2.88 percent. The 30-day compounded average tax-exempt yield and simple yield were both up 9 basis points, to 2.81 percent and 2.77 percent, respectively.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of tax-exempt securities held in portfolios remained unchanged last week, at 51 days.
According to Donoghue's statisticians, assets of tax-exempt funds for the week grew by $2.3 billion, bringing total assets to $98.6 billion.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable-equivalent yield of the current seven-day compounded average tax-exempt yield is 4.05 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket is 4.23 percent.
 
The Best Performer
 Among the tax-exempt funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Market Fund, frequently among the best performers, showed the top return for the week. The fund posted a yield of 3.90 percent, down 5 basis points from the previous week.
Among taxable funds, the average seven-day compounded yield was up a basis point, to 3.81 percent, with the simple yield also up a point, to 3.74 percent. The 30-day compounded and simple taxable yields remained unchanged, at 3.80 percent and 3.73 percent, respectively.
Assets of taxable funds grew $13.7 billion, to $495.6 million, regaining much of the cash outflow from the week before, Donoghue's said.
Like the previous week's outflow, the bulk of the inflow in the most recent week was attributed to institutions, which placed $11.4 billion into taxable funds last week.
 
Influence of Jobs Data
 Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, said institutions were influenced by last week's employment numbers, which showed only a nominal increase in jobs and raised expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
However, Mr. Frank said that "expectations that we may be getting action from the Fed is premature." He added, "The Fed will need more evidence than it now has that the recovery is stalling before making any further moves."
Among the taxables, the Fidelity Spartan Money Market Fund was the best performer last week, with a return of 4.39 percent.
By comparison, the average yield of bank money market accounts, prime competitors of money funds, was at 3.71 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.

HEADLINE: Japan's Troubles Contribute to Declines Around the World

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stock markets around the world fell sharply yesterday, with analysts saying that the spillover from this week's plunges in the Japanese and American markets unsettled investors.
The worst fall was in France, where an index of 40 blue-chip stocks dropped 3.4 percent. Blue-chip indexes also fell more than 1 percent in Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland. The leading Hong Kong index was off 2 percent and markets in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand also fell, some hitting their lowest levels since last fall. 
 British blue chips fell just under a half of a percent, but they had already fallen about 7 percent since an election was called March 11. Investors have worried that the Conservatives may lose in today's balloting.
But analysts also said they had yet to see signs signaling that the falls in Japan and the United States will spread around the world.
 
Local Factors Important
 One reason is that the declines in many markets also resulted from local factors, including the British election and the recent electoral setbacks for the ruling parties in France, Germany and Italy. Disappointment in the maiden speech of the new Prime Minister of France, Pierre Beregovoy, was also a factor there.
Another reason is that many markets do not follow Japan's lead. Although the Nikkei index of 225 leading shares plunged 17.4 percent in the last four weeks, its decline had little impact elsewhere, even in the United States, until this week. But the 2.9 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial average over the last two days, after it had held fairly steady all year, is a little more worrying.
This is because stock markets, especially those in Europe, follow the American market more closely, particularly when the daily moves are quite volatile. And if the United States is seen to be reacting to Japan, then the Japanese falls can take on more signficance.
 
U.S. Trend Watched Closely
 "In terms of contagion, the United States has been more significant," said Sushil Wadhwani, the international strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company in London. "No one really has paid any attention to Japan until this week."
But he argued that if the Dow settled down, then European stock markets, outside of Britain, should be able to recover. The British outlook depends on the election, with some analysts arguing that the Financial Times Index of 100 leading stocks could fall to the 2,200 level if the Labor Party wins. The index closed down just 11 points yesterday at 2,393.2, recovering from a steeper fall on rumors that a last pre-election poll would show the Conservatives in the lead.
In France, the market was hit by both the falls in Japan and the United States and Japan and local problems. Christian Picot, the head of equities for Paribas Capital Markets in New York, said disappointment in the first important speech by Prime Minister Beregovoy helped send the market down about 1.7 percent, half of the day's fall, at the end of the session. The CAC 40 index closed down 67.90 at 1,907.48.
Investors, he said, were hoping for more positive information on a savings proposal similar to the American system of individual retirement accounts and more details on the Government's effort to accelerate plans to sell state-owned or -controlled companies to the public. But there were no such details.
 
Time to Sink In
 But Mr. Picot also said the effect of the falls in New York and Tokyo had plenty of time to sink in and undermine the market. He noted that French brokers, as well as others in Europe, end their day with the news of what has happened in the United States and begin the next one with news from Japan, and that has been bad all week.
In Germany the DAX index of 30 leading shares fell 1.1 percent, or 19.41 points, closing at 1,720.01. Traders said they were relieved that the market had not fallen further. But trading ended before New York opened and the Dow fell 32.2 points, or 1 percent, which means that Germany could fall further today.
Like other countries, Germany has local problems that already made the market vulnerable. One is new inflation numbers that may delay a cut in interest rates there even into next year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Retreat

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Weak demand at an auction of new seven-year Treasury notes and a slight recovery in stock prices from their lows for the day helped to push down prices of Treasury securities and force up interest rates yesterday.
The $9.75 billion of new seven-year notes were sold at an average yield of 7.11 percent. 
 The rate was well above the average yield of 6.40 at the last seven-year note sale in January, but dealers said the higher rate failed to attract any real interest from institutional accounts. The only source of demand was from arbitragers, and it was tepid, the dealers said.
The selloff came on the heels of stronger prices during the morning, as market participants bought securities when the Dow Jones industrial average moved sharply lower. Treasury securities were also purchased overnight in Tokyo as Japanese equity prices slumped.
Traders and some analysts said the steep slide in the Japanese stock market was casting a pall over Treasury bond traders.
Even though Japanese investors have been net sellers of Treasury securities over the last few years, they still own significant amounts of 30-year bonds, some analysts said.
"The Japanese could do some significant damage if they decided to sell out and take their money back to Japan," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "As long as that threat is there, it has a negative effect on long-term Treasury securities."
But others said those fears were overblown, adding that other markets were far more vulnerable to Japanese selling than the Government securities market.
For the first three quarters of last year, Japanese were net buyers of American stocks and of mortgage-backed securities, said Louis v. B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm.
The pace of buying fell off abruptly in the fourth quarter, and in the first two months of 1992 the Japanese were net sellers of equities and mortgage-backed issues, Mr. Crandall added.
"The American bond market has been used to the flow of securities back to Japan for a couple of years now," he said. "But for other markets it is more of an abrupt shift. As a consequence, the Treasury market actually stands to lose less than some of the others."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 1012/32 , down 10/32 , to yield 7.90 percent, compared with 7.87 percent late Tuesday.
 
10-Year Notes Are Off 1/4 Point
 Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10021/32 , down 1/4 point, to yield 7.40 percent. The 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 5/8, down 5/32 , to yield 6.72 percent. And the 5 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/8, down 1/32 , to yield 5.27 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates inched a bit lower, as investors leaving the stock market continued to buy these highly liquid debt instruments.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.83 percent late yesterday, down two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. And six-month bill rates dipped by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 3.93 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as lead manager on an offering of $250 million worth of subordinated notes from LKB, a German finance agency.
The 7 7/8 percent 12-year notes were priced at $99.27, to yield 7.971 percent, 55 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Chicago Finance Authority offered $170.07 million worth of bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Prudential Securities won the bonds.
Serial bonds reoffered to investors carried yields from 3.50 percent on securities maturing in 1993 to 6.50 percent in 2007.
A 6 1/4 percent term bond maturing in 2009 was priced to yield 6.55 percent.
The bonds are backed by insurance from the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, and are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues slipped by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
By contrast, municipal bond traders said the slide in stock prices had stimulated demand for tax-exempt securities. Prices of most widely quoted issues were up by about 1/2 point, the traders said.

Platinum at 2 1/2-Month Low As Japanese Stocks Slide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices sank to a two-and-a-half-month low yesterday as speculators viewed plunging Japanese stock prices as a sign of sagging demand for the precious metal.
Platinum investment and jewelry demand is centered in Japan, where the metal has the same cachet as gold in the United States. 
 Platinum for April delivery fell $7.10, to $342.10 a troy ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the lowest daily settlement for near-term platinum deliveries since Jan. 17.
Several analysts agreed the retreat was tied to yesterday's 3.5 percent plunge in the Nikkei stock average, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index, to its lowest level in five and a half years.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, the widely followed measure of the United States stock market, dropped about 32 points yesterday after tumbling nearly 62 points on Tuesday.
Platinum's drop was "pretty much a knee-jerk reaction to the Japanese stock market," said Tom Griffo, metals analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. in New York.
"The popular theory is that when that goes down, platinum goes down," he said.
He said platinum's decline mainly reflected speculative selling of futures rather than sales of physical platinum.
The Nikkei's steepening decline and the drop in the Dow raised fears that the recent recovery of the United States economy might stall, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York. That would result in weaker industrial demand for platinum, which is a key component in car pollution-control systems.
Economic fears were also behind yesterday's 2.05-cent drop in April copper deliveries on New York's Commodity Exchange to $1.0010 a pound, said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York.
Gold for April delivery fell 80 cents, to $337.90 a troy ounce, on the Commodity Exchange; May silver rose 0.5 cent, to $4.088 a troy ounce.
Crude oil, meanwhile, reached a new high for the year on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders responded to shrinking United States supplies and more Middle East tensions.
Crude oil for May delivery rose 39 cents, to $20.62 a barrel; May home heating oil rose 0.81 cent, to 56.26 cents a gallon; May unleaded gasoline rose 0.39 cent, to 62.71 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies Late in Day But Drops Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies except the Japanese yen in busy trading yesterday after a late technical rally made up the dollar's losses earlier in the sesson.
Most of the action in the foreign exchange markets focused on the relationship between the dollar and the yen. Rumors that the Japanese were aggressively selling dollars for yen dominated trading for much of the day. 
 Stephen Flanagan, a vice president and currency dealer at Mitsubishi Bank, said the reports of Japanese dollar sales had encouraged others to sell the dollar. But he added: "Those yen repatriation rumors really are unfounded. The magnitude of the Japanese repatriation flows are considerably overstated."
The dollar was also undermined by another weak performance by stocks on Wall Street and nagging worries about the economic outlook.
A sense is spreading in financial markets that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates sometime soon to stimulate growth. Lower rates reduce returns on dollar-denominated holdings and tend to curb demand for dollars.
But after several hours of trading in New York, the sentiment shifted and buyers flocked to buy dollars. The buyers reportedly included short-coverers who had bet the dollar would drop in value. They were buying to pay back dollars they had borrowed then immediately sold in hopes of buying the dollars back later at a lower exchange rate.
The dollar got off to a weak start in world trading. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 132.75 Japanese yen, from 133.35 yen at Tuesday's close.
Later, in London, it fell to 132.60 yen. By the time trading was done in New York, the dollar was quoted at 132.65 yen, down from 133.10 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling, meanwhile, continued to be weighed down by political concerns ahead of the coming British election. A pound fell in London to $1.7480, from $1.7490 late Tuesday. At closing in New York, the pound fetched $1.7500, compared with $1.7505 on Tuesday.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with Tuesday's late levels, were: 1.6270 German marks, up from 1.6235; 1.4950 Swiss francs, up from 1.4900; 5.5110 French francs, up from 5.4950; 1,227.00 Italian lire, up from 1,224.00, and 1.18925 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18795.

Dow Jones and Media General Profits Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Dow Jones & Company said yesterday that its first-quarter profit climbed 58 percent from a year ago and Media General Inc. reported a 15.1 percent increase. Both media companies cited improved earnings from their newspapers.
Following are the details of the two companies' results:
 
Dow Jones
 Dow Jones said its results reflected higher advertising volume at The Wall Street Journal, lower interest expense and improvement at its community newspapers and its electronic financial information service, Telerate Inc. 
 Earnings of the New York-based company rose to $28.4 million, or 28 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, from $18 million, or 18 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 4.7 percent, to $436.1 million, from $416.6 million a year earlier.
Michael Ellman, who follows Dow Jones for Wertheim Schroder & Company, said the linage gains hadbeen driven by the improvement in Wall Street's performance, a trend that has been in evidence since last fall. "That precipitated a flurry of ads for initial public offerings and mutual funds advertising," he said, adding, "I suspect that image advertising and classified ads are under pressures, consistent with other companies."
He said that Dow Jones had worked very hard on the cost side, at least in terms of reducing its payroll.
"My reservation is that linage clearly was negative in March, and that for the third consecutive quarter, the information services sector, led by Telerate, reported sluggish earnings," Mr. Ellman said.
Operating income from business publications including The Journal and Barron's more than doubled, to $24.6 million, as revenue rose 8 percent, to $186.6 million.
Ad volume at The Journal rose 9.2 percent in the quarter, which included one more publishing day than the year before. Operating income was up 4.5 percent, to $40.3 million at the information services segment, including Telerate, as revenue rose 2.2 percent, to $196.3 million.
 
Media General
 The Richmond-based media company earned $2.7 million, or 11 cents a share, in the three months ended March 29, up from $2.4 million, or 9 cents a share, a year ago, even though revenue slipped 2.7 percent, to $141.7 million, from $145.6 million a year earlier.
Media General said its results reflected improved earings from its daily newspapers, continued strength in its cable TV systems and cost controls.
But it added that its TV stations "have yet to realize any significant strengthening in advertising revenues, which typically accompany an improved economy."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
He's Offering Some Hope To Agencies

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
DESCRIBING himself as "positive, in a cautiously optimistic way," Alex Kroll said he believed that the advertising industry's severe recession was ending.
And that is largely because "the industry's leadership has righted itself and gotten back to its fundamental mission," Mr. Kroll, the outgoing chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, said in an interview before the group's 74th annual meeting opened yesterday in Naples, Fla. 
 That mission was described by Mr. Kroll, the chairman and chief executive of Young & Rubicam Inc., as "the brand-building power of advertising," the ability of ads to create consumer loyalty to a client's product. He offered thoughts on that subject and others as he reflected on his year as chairman of the Four A's, as the national trade association is known.
As planned, at the end of the annual meeting on Saturday Mr. Kroll will be succeeded by Robert L. James, chairman and chief executive of McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York.
Mr. Kroll's cautious optimism comes amid a growing sense among industry executives that they are slowly beginning to climb out of the slump into which their business fell in 1989, a year earlier than the rest of the economy.
One statistic being greeted with hope: about as many people are expected at this year's meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Naples, as at last year's gathering at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., when 420 attended. This indicates a leveling off after last year, when attendance plunged by a third from 1990.
During an interview last week at his New York office, Mr. Kroll said that agencies and their clients had been distracted from "the classic partnership necessary to build brands" by the "financial preoccupations" generated by the spate of mergers and acquisitions that dominated their businesses in the 1980's.
Then came what he called "the first 10-month year in the history of advertising," as the Persian Gulf war put the nation into suspended animation during January and February of last year.
Case studies of the advertising budgets for about 20 products over three decades, adjusted for inflation, demonstrate the decreasing emphasis on brand-building, he said. A study of this "underspending" trend will be presented at the meeting today.
"Advertisers don't put as much pressure behind brands as they used to," Mr. Kroll said. "It's perfectly hideous."
But "that period of distraction is over," he asserted. "Agencies and clients are beginning to realize how essential they are to each other." One way to hasten that process, he said, is to re-establish the identities of individual shops, which were blurred by the agency agglomerations of the 80's.
Mr. Kroll spoke approvingly of recent remarks by John E. O'Toole, the president and chief executive of the Four A's, longing for "the days when agencies were individual brands."
Those were the not-too-distant days of "Bill Bernbach, saying advertising is an art," Mr. Kroll said. "There was Rosser Reeves, saying that the worst thing about advertising is that it's an art. And David Ogilvy was saying it's a science." The references were to the diverse creative legends at, respectively, Doyle Dane Bernbach, Ted Bates and Ogilvy & Mather.
"Each one of them stood for something," Mr. Kroll said, "and clients had their choice of competing philosophies. It is my hope that agencies will again deal with things in more individual ways."
Another topic concerning Mr. Kroll during his term as chairman has been political advertising. For the current Presidential primary season, the Four A's has joined the League of Women Voters and the Markle Foundation to test Project Run Fair, which has enabled voters to call a "900" telephone number to register objections to negative political ads.
But the first test, in New Hampshire, was plagued with problems, from a dearth of public-service messages in local media to publicize the project, to what Mr. Kroll termed the "barrier" of the $1.15-a-minute charges for the calls. Details were modified for a second test, in the Wisconsin campaign that ended Tuesday, and Mr. Kroll hopes it will continue "beyond my leadership, if it proves to be useful."
The Four A's board of directors voted yesterday on leaders for the 1992-93 year. In addition to Mr. James, who was vice chairman, being elected chairman, Roy Bostock, chairman and chief executive of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York, was elected vice chairman. That places Mr. Bostock in line to succeed Mr. James in 1993.
In brief remarks following his election, Mr. James told the meeting that "we have a long hard year ahead of us," adding that there can be a "great future for this business only if we make it so."
He is scheduled to deliver a speech today sounding a theme he plans to address often during his term as chairman: the need for agencies to convince marketers of the importance of advertising in selling their products, rather than diverting ad dollars to promotional programs aimed at retailers.

Promotion Industry Salaries Are Rising

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Salaries paid to executives who work in the promotion industry show little sign of being affected by the recession, according to the industry's third annual salary survey by Promo magazine.
Respondents reported salaries last year averaging $69,434, compared with $66,500 in 1990, and pay increases averaging 9.8 percent, compared with 7.8 percent in 1990. 
 The survey was conducted for the magazine by Gallup & Robinson in Princeton, N.J., which mailed questionnaires to 4,000 readers at consumer-product manufacturing companies, promotion agencies and marketing services companies.

HEADLINE: WHERE TO FIND IT;
Yes, You Can Get a Toaster Repaired

BYLINE: By Terry Trucco

 BODY:
BUSINESS has been good lately at Riverside Housewares in Manhattan, and Stanley Stern, the owner, cannot decide whether the recession or concern for the environment is the reason. Mr. Stern, in business for 45 years, repairs small appliances like toasters, percolators, hair dryers, blenders, vacuum cleaners and fans.
"I think the use-it-and-throw-it-away philosophy is changing," he said, standing by a shelf of rehabilitated waffle irons from the 1940's and 50's. "People are more willing to have old things repaired." 
 By old things, Mr. Stern can mean really old things. His specialty is finding and restoring kitchen gadgets that date from the 1930's. Sometimes the touches are cosmetic -- new pot handles, new whistles for tea kettles, new suction cups for a meat grinder. He will also remove asbestos wiring in older appliances.
It does not pay to fix all home appliances, Mr. Stern said. "If the motor goes on a can opener, we don't bother." But a $10 or $15 repair can often be worthwhile for a $50 or even $30 item, particularly if the customer is fond of it.
Appliances made of metal, like fans or cannister-style vacuum cleaners, are almost always worth fixing, Mr. Stern added. Most old motors were built to last longer than the newer ones, he said, patting a rehabilitated metal table fan. "I'll sell that for $100," he said.
Typical repairs entail new switches or new wiring. Mr. Stern has an inventory of parts, including glass tops for percolators. The store also sells vintage Pyrex glassware.
 
The Unusual, Too
 "A lot of people don't realize they can get their appliances repaired," said Stan Benson, an assistant manager at Solomon's Appliance Repair in Brooklyn.
In business for more than 40 years, Solomon's is a factory service center for about 100 companies, including Black & Decker, Braun, Dirt Devil, Kitchen Aid, Norelco and Waring. Besides obvious products, like shavers, vacuum cleaners and toaster ovens, the company repairs unusual items, like contact-lens sterilizers and mobility carts for the elderly. There's also a knife sharpener on staff.
Items need repairs for all sorts of reasons, Mr. Benson said. "The owners put coffee in the water compartment of the coffee maker, or they immerse the entire coffee maker in water to clean it." People also drop appliances, and some items just wear out.
For products under warranty, there is no repair charge if the customer provides a receipt. Other repairs depend on parts and labor. A new switch on a Hamilton Beach 10-speed blender, for example, costs around $13.
 
Don't Throw It Out
 A large part of George McNally's business is parts and accessories for small appliances. "It's silly to throw the whole coffee maker out because you break a glass decanter," said Mr. McNally, who has owned Electra-Craft, a Manhattan appliance repair shop, for seven years. New decanters can range from about $8 for a four-cup Mr. Coffee to $18 for a Braun.
Electra-Craft, a licensed service center for close to 40 manufacturers, stocks parts for appliances made by Braun, Hamilton Beach, Mr. Coffee, Proctor-Silex, Sunbeam and Waring, among others. The company repairs items both in and out of warranty. Many of the appliances Mr. McNally repairs develop problems because owners did not care for them properly. Blender blades, a common repair, go bad because the unit is not cleaned correctly or because they sit in liquid too long. "Milk can act like an acid on blades," he said.
Others simply get too much wear. Cords on irons frequently fray, he said. To repair them costs around $14.
Mr. McNally accepts items when the cost of repair is 50 percent or less than the replacement cost of the item. "You should really buy something new if it's more," he said.
Old appliances can also be difficult to repair, particularly if parts are not available. "We prefer that customers with antique appliances call before bringing them in," he said.

HEADLINE: Essay;
How to Save Russia

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Hastening to beat Bill Clinton to the foreign-policy punch, President Bush proposed to assist democracy in the former Soviet republics with a package that not even James Baker could price or explain.
As it stands, the Bush-Kohl-I.M.F. proposal seems to be a project by an international bureaucracy to prop up the Russian Government in its hour of need. The payoff to us, under this theory, is that our aid will produce a less dangerous Russia, which will let us save money on defense. 
 That's the governmental way to think and a negative way to sell.
Our purpose should be both more idealistic and more practical: to help root private enterprise in the new republics and to encourage their prosperity. The payoff to us is in expanded trade and a stable world economy, which in turn will provide incentives for peace and limit wasteful arms spending.
You might expect that the first American President who once headed an oil company in Texas would zero in on the resource the new nations have in abundance: oil. Their oil reserves are their money in the bank.
Their current crisis is caused largely by their inability to get their oil and gas out of the ground and onto the sea lanes and pipelines. Twenty thousand wells capable of producing hundreds of thousands of barrels per day stand idle for lack of parts. Once in production, along with the development of new fields already identified, this resource would produce hard currency that would dwarf any foreign assistance now contemplated.
The central economic question of the year: How do we help the new republics get oil out of the ground and to market? For them, the right answer means the salvation of nascent democracy; for us, as Gary Hart points out, it also means the end of the OPEC cartel's ability to inflict inflation on the West.
The answer: a bit of "industrial policy," the use of government coordination to direct free enterprise toward a global economic goal.
A few of our major oil companies are held back by the influence of Saudi Arabia, but most oil importers are eager to invest in joint ventures with Russians, Kazakhs and the rest. Daniel Yergin, who just won a Pulitzer for his book on oil, says, "the former Soviet Union is the best bet going to add to reserves."
From the Caspian Sea to Sakhalin, the future of cheap non-nuclear fuel is in the land mass that is presently down on its luck. There's money to be made and jobs to be had for owner, developer, seller, transporter, buyer and user.
What's obstructing development? The vestige of Communism is one obstacle. The old apparatchiks at Pravda denounced "White Nights," a Siberian joint venture of a Russian company and the U.S.'s Phibro Energy, for "plundering Russia's underground riches." Former Communists see only a zero-sum game.
The reformers have been slow to make decisions about contracts and ownership, and Boris Yeltsin blundered by imposing an oil export tax instead of encouraging exports.
President Bush has been half-hearted and uncoordinated. His Energy Department was helpful in setting up January meetings between U.S. and Russian oilmen, but not until last week did the State Department sign an agreement that gives some impetus to the kind of investment incentive that will get new wells drilled.
Now the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC, not OPEC) is authorized to make loans and sell risk insurance to U.S. companies that establish ventures in Russia. OPIC's Fred Zeder contends that 200 companies have registered interest in investing $7 billion so far, many of them centered on oil and gas.
That's one way to start profitable enterprises in the U.S. interest when risks of expropriation or tumult are otherwise too great. OPIC's loss ratio is less than 1 percent, and it adds needed official coloration to meetings between U.S. businessmen and overseas public officials. "We don't lend money to governments," says Mr. Zeder. "That's how you lose your shirt."
The only way to help the new republics build free markets is to stimulate private investment. The main magnet is oil. The White House and the Kremlin should set up a joint task force to focus on this and start the wells and hard-currency profits pumping.

'Time for a Change'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The message coming from the Democratic primaries could not be clearer. It is a cry of discontent -- of anger -- with things as they are. The voters are saying, "It is time for a change."
People coming out of the polling booths in New York were asked whether they agreed with "Jerry Brown's criticisms of the political system"; 70 percent answered yes. It was a clumsy question, because voters would have very different understandings of what "Jerry Brown's criticisms" were. But the overwhelming answer surely showed a high level of discontent. 
 The question is whether Bill Clinton, the now almost certain Democratic nominee, can channel that discontent into a constructive and persuasive vision of change in this country. I think it is going to be the crucial question of the campaign.
Americans are troubled by many things these days: by the way the rich have grown richer while most people have lost ground, by the arrogance of Congress members and Presidential aides in their enjoyment of perks, by the sense of falling behind other countries economically, by fear of illness without adequate health insurance . . .
A people so troubled may come to think that the whole system is rotten and must be overthrown. That is what Jerry Brown essentially stands for.
Nihilism can be appealing in painful times. It appealed to many in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when the established politicians had produced -- and most continued to defend -- the irrational horror of the Vietnam War. But "burn, baby, burn" was not a solution.
We are not today in an emotional crisis like that of the Vietnam period. But public disaffection from government is profound. Americans in large numbers think the system is incapable of solving the problems that are grinding them down. They see in Washington a Government that barely even pretends to deal with the hard issues of investment, unemployment, education, health and the rest.
The challenge of leadership is to make people believe again that government can make a difference. That is what Franklin Roosevelt did in far darker times: He offered not specifics but hope, and the feeling that someone in Washington was listening.
Voters are skeptical now, resistant. But they are far from writing off the system. After all, 70 percent in New York may have said they agreed with Governor Brown's criticisms of the system, but 70 percent voted for candidates who argue that government can work: 41 percent for Bill Clinton, 29 for Paul Tsongas.
Can Governor Clinton offer voters a believable vision of change? Can he persuade people that we can have effective government again, within the constitutional system that has kept us free for 200 years?
The answer turns in part on whether the press and television will allow Mr. Clinton's message to get through. Journalism has seemed lately to be in a competition to see who can produce the most frivolous, distorted, out-of-context attack on his "character." But that is another subject.
It is up to Mr. Clinton, in any event, to get a message across. There is no question of his intelligence or his ability to function in the give-and-take of politics. Other governors, Republican and Democratic, considered him the most capable in their ranks.
What remains to be seen is whether he can convince Americans that he offers hope. He can and should talk about economic growth and medical needs and political spending and other particulars. But the underlying question is belief in government.
Few of us are naive enough anymore to think that any President, any government, can quickly transform our society. The problems are beyond instant solutions.
But government can make a difference. The President of the United States can face up to the environmental dangers menacing the world, or he can hide from them. He can try to ameliorate our racial differences, or he can agitate them for partisan reasons. He can choose as judges men and women of varied backgrounds and politics, learned in the law, or he can pick judges from a narrow ideological caste.
If and as Bill Clinton works free of the mudslinging, he will have to make Americans believe again in the possibilities of government.

HEADLINE: Japan Fears Decline in Stocks Will Undermine Its Economy

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, April 10

 BODY:
The plunge in share prices here has grown so unnerving in the last week that a number of Japan's top Government officials and business leaders have begun to say the market's deepening malaise may soon start dragging down the Japanese economy and weakening the financial system.
It has long been an article of faith here that the stock market ultimately hewed to the dictates of powerful Government bureaucrats, and that the heart of the economy, manufacturing and industrial corporations, was little influenced by market ups and downs. 
 But the failure of a Government effort to halt the nose dive last week, and then the sudden fall here again late Thursday, just when it seemed to bottom out, have shattered that confidence. It is now clear, financial experts said, that the Government and leading banks simply do not have a means to arrest a decline that has wiped out more than 50 percent of the market's value since it peaked at the end of 1989.
The market soared today, however, aided by a rally in American markets. When the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates in the United States, that also heartened Japanese investors, analysts said today. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks closed today at 17,850.66, for a gain of 1,252.51 points of about 7.6 percent
But welcome as this news was, analysts said it would take more than one rally to erase the damage done to confidence here over the last two weeks. In addition, they said the market would probably have to recover about 25 percent of its value, putting the Nikkei well over 20,000, before the pressure on the economy and banks would be relieved.
"There are still reasons to be nervous," said Liam Newberg, a senior analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan.
If the market merely stabilizes or rises slightly, experts warn that the harm to the economy will persist and the blow to confidence will not be forgotten.
"We have been thinking about nothing else for several days, but there is nothing we can do," said a senior Finance Ministry official. He conceded that the Government's forecast for moderate economic growth this year was based on the assumption that stock prices would be at least 20 percent higher than they are now.
"If the stock market does not recover quite dramatically, we will have to reconsider those figures," he said.
Especially discouraging to many here was the way the market was whipsawed here on Thursday. After a tentative rebound, the Nikkei index turned, and ended down 577.38, or 3.4 percent, at 16,598.15. The close was the lowest since October 1986, and left the Nikkei down 10.6 percent this week.
Tokyo's plunge contributed to the big drops on Wall Street and in other world markets earlier this week. Those declines resulted in part from concerns that weakened Japanese financial institutions might be forced to sell holdings of foreign shares and that foreign investors who own Japanese shares might be forced to liquidate their holdings in the United States and elsewhere to cover big losses in Japan.
All this comes against a backdrop of signs that the Japanese economy has been slowing steadily in recent months after a five-year boom.
"I continue to believe in the fundamental strength of the Japanese economy and that it will rebound," said Hideo Ishihara, deputy president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, one of the country's most powerful financial institutions and architect of a stock market rescue plan after a crash in the 1960's. "But there isn't much we can do for the market now. I feel very helpless."
A deeper slowdown in the Japanese economy will clearly be felt in the United States and elsewhere. Slack demand in Japan is likely to crimp imports and increase exports. That could force Japan's already record trade surplus to soar and hurt American manufacturers exporting goods here. It could also worsen trade tensions with Washington.
 
Fear Feeding on Itself
 One reason for the new attitude is that most say the market appears to be responding not to economic factors, but to a frightened psychology that is feeding on itself.
The market began to slide in early 1990 when the Bank of Japan was raising interest rates. It then tumbled further after Iraq invaded Kuwait later in 1990, which threatened Japan's oil supplies.
No such factors are at play now. If anything, the economic outlook has brightened slightly after the Bank of Japan slashed interest rates last week as part of a stimulus package.
"I can't say precisely at what point it happened, but there was a point recently when the psychology of the market just changed," said Yasuhiko Jinza, manager of the stock investment department at the Nippon Life Insurance Company, the largest stockholder in Japan with 3 percent of all the shares here. "People just began to think prices would fall further because of all the fear, so they would sell."
Another sign of this psychology is a campaign by some brokers and Government officials to blame foreign securities houses for the depth of the decline. Some have claimed that program trading involving the use of stock index futures contracts have accelerated the downward trend. The foreign brokers here are among the most active program traders.
No one has produced evidence yet that this computer-assisted trading is responsible for the market swings, but there has been speculation that the Government will halt or dampen stock index futures trading. A number of Japanese portfolio managers have admitted that they are also heavy users of these securities.
Small investors have generally watched the decline from the sidelines, brokers say, with some who have borrowed heavily being forced to sell at big losses. The manager of a branch for a major securities house said his business had been drying up. "Some people are calling but most are just not coming in," he said. "They are astonished and frightened. They don't know how long they can afford to watch this without being forced to sell."
 
Making Consumers Cautious
 There are several ways the falling market may affect the economy, analysts say. The simplest is that by worrying consumers it causes them to be more cautious. There are already signs of a slowdown in consumer spending, particularly on imported luxury goods.
More important is the effect the market can have on banks. Japanese banks are permitted to own up to 5 percent of the stock in industrial and other companies. The unrealized gains on these shares, often acquired several decades ago, can be counted as part of the banks' capital, the cash cushion banks use to cover loan losses.
But the severe drop in the market has slashed the value of those portfolios and thus reduced capital. That makes them more vulnerable to problems from loan losses -- at a time when bankruptcies are running at a record level -- and slows their ability to provide new loans. A slowing of credit to the economy could squelch a recovery.
In addition, there are widespread expectations that the market's tumble is likely to force a number of second- and third-tier brokerage houses to cut back sharply or even shut down. There have even been rumors that one of the largest firms might be facing financial difficulties.
"We've already started seeing signs of these problems," said Yasuhiro Oshima, chief of one of the stock portfolio management groups at the Bank of Tokyo, a big investor. "They haven't fully emerged yet, but if the market stays at this level just a few weeks, financial institutions will suffer potentially severe difficulties, that is for sure."
Mr. Oshima added: "I've thought about, but I can't find the precise words to describe what this market feels like. It's scary. There's no precedent in Japan."
In addition, the weak market has made it impossible for industrial corporations to raise capital by selling new shares. The Tokyo market was a fountain of capital during the late 1980's, helping to finance a heavy wave of investment by corporate Japan in new plants, more efficient equipment and new technology.
 
Investment Budgets Cut
 With that source of funds closed down, corporations are reducing capital investment budgets, another factor in the slowdown in demand for goods in Japan.
One irony is that some features of the financial system that were meant to create confidence in the past are now undermining it. For instance, Japanese banks disclose few of the financial details that American banks are required to provide to investors.
Regulators in the Finance Ministry have argued for years that such information would only frighten the public, which they say does not know how to evaluate the information accurately. However, many market experts are now saying that the lack of clarity is spooking the market.
"Because people don't know for sure, they are assuming the worst-case scenario" about the level of banks' loan losses, said Akio Mikuni, president of Mikuni & Company, a credit rating agency here.

HEADLINE: Fed Moves Again to Spur Growth And the Markets Respond Briskly

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Amid concern that the economic recovery remains dangerously weak, the Federal Reserve moved today to stimulate growth by pushing down an influential interest rate.
The Fed pumped more money into the nation's banking system to reduce the Federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend each other money overnight -- to 3.75 percent from 4 percent. 
 "The Fed has to be worried about keeping the little recovery we have going," said Allen Sinai, economic adviser to the Boston Company. It cannot afford to have a 'triple dip' or anything like that."
 
Dow Gains 43.61
 The cut surprised and cheered the financial markets. In the stock market, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.61 points, to 3,224.96, regaining almost half of the 94 points it lost on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the credit market, long-term bond yields fell and short-term interest rates plunged to their lowest levels in nearly 20 years. [Pages D6 and D15.]
Nervous that the sluggish economy could hurt their election chances this November, the White House and many Congressional Republicans and Democrats have in recent weeks urged the Federal Reserve to cut rates again. They repeatedly said that one reason the weak recovery that began last spring petered out last fall was that the Fed had moved too slowly to lower rates.
"This being a Presidential election year might explain why the Fed didn't want to run the risk of doing nothing, because that could abort the recovery," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist, at the PNC Financial Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based bank holding company. "But at the same time, the Fed might have learned something from what happened last year."
The cuts in the funds rate could help bring down rates for consumer loans, adjustable-rate mortgages and loans to companies as banks pass on to consumers the lower rates they pay for money.
"Today's cut in the Federal funds rate implies a reduction in short-term interest rates across the board," said Hugh Johnson, chief economist for the First Albany Corporation, a New York-based brokerage.
Economists also said that a small increase of two-tenths of a percent in March producer prices that was announced today helped pave the way for the rate cut by reducing fears that inflation would ignite as the economy grows.
And some analysts speculated that an aim of today's action was to calm domestic investors shaken by the effect on American markets of Japan's plunging stocks. But a Fed spokesman said, "The Japanese stock market had nothing to do with today's action."
Over the last two months, the Administration and many economists have voiced optimism that a recovery is taking hold based on a pickup in retail sales and housing starts. But analysts said today that the Fed had apparently become alarmed when it discovered that for the second straight week the money supply had fallen sharply. Economists say the Fed is concerned that the weak money supply numbers could push up interest rates and hamper the already fragile recovery.
 
Money Supply Cited
 "The primary motivation in my view was their increasing worry about the weakness in the money supply," said Robert Giordano, chief economist for Goldman, Sachs. "It's really the Fed's need to demonstrate that they're on the job more than a genuine sign that the weakness in the money supply means the recovery was in deep danger."
Today, the Fed reported a sharp $7 billion drop last week in the most closely watched measure of the money supply, which followed an even steeper drop of more than $10 billion the previous week.
Economists said the central bank was no doubt also concerned about the lack of growth in employment in March that the Labor Department reported last Friday.
The Fed's most recent rate cuts came last Dec. 20, when it drastically lowered the Federal funds rate and the discount rate -- the rate at which it lends money to banks. It lowered the discount rate a full percentage point, to 3 1/2 percent, from 4 1/2 percent, and the Fed funds rate by a half percentage point, to 4 percent from 4 1/2 percent.
 
Some Added Insurance
 In recent months, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has often said he thought the cuts announced on Dec. 20 would be enough to insure a recovery, but today's move signaled that the Fed had become convinced that some additional insurance was needed to protect the recovery.
"It is a preventive, pre-emptive move to support this fledgling recovery," said Mr. Sinai, the economist. "The danger that another failure in the recovery would have to confidence, psychology, the economy and world markets is great."
Today's move could also strengthen the American economy by helping to weaken the dollar and thus spur exports, economists said. Lower interest rates discourage demand for dollars, but a weaker dollar then encourages foreign purchases of United States goods. The export sector has been one of the strongest sectors in the economy, but economic slowdowns in Europe and Japan are threatening export growth.
Some economists also suggest that today's move was designed to help Japan's central bank lower interest rates further to buoy Tokyo's falling equity markets. The Fed's rate cut reduces fears in Japan that the yen will plunge if the Japanese central bank cuts rates.
"For a whole bunch of reasons," said Mr. Hoffman, the economist, "the Fed decided to take out another insurance premium in the form of lower rates."
 
Meeting in March
 Economists said today's move was probably approved at the March 31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the central monetary policy group composed of the seven members of the Federal Reserve board and five presidents of Federal Reserve districts.
The central bank does not announce changes in the Federal funds rate, but the Fed added money to the banking system this morning, making clear that it was cutting that rate.
Some economists said it was understandable that the Fed would insist that today's move had nothing to do with Japan's markets. They said that if today's rate cut was construed as trying to support domestic markets -- which would be a highly unusual move for the Fed -- some investors might say the Fed must think the situation was extraordinarily grave.
In addition, if the Fed's move wasviewed as seeking to buoy American markets against Japan's shocks and if the American markets continued to fall, then it would appear the Fed was weak and had wasted its ammunition.

Canadians Cut Prime
 TORONTO, April 9 (Special to The New York Times) -- Three major Canadian banks announced today that they were cutting their prime rate by one-quarter percentage point, as the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, signaled further relaxation of its monetary policy.
The Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia said they were dropping the rate they charge their most creditworthy customers to 8 percent, from 8 1/4 percent, where it has been since early March.
The Bank of Canada set its bank rate today at 7.21 percent, down from 7.41 percent last week and the lowest since Jan. 23. This rate is set each week one-quarter percentage point above the average yield on 90-day Treasury bills sold at auction to financial institutions.
"These moves are designed to address economic weakness," said Robert Palombi, economist with MMS International, "and could alleviate some of the selling pressure in the stock market."
Toronto stocks have been depressed in recent weeks by uncertainties related to the real estate and resources empire of Olympia & York Developments Ltd., which is expected to present a plan to restructure its debts at a meeting of nearly 100 creditors in Toronto on Monday.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Gives the Nikkei a Break

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, April 10

 BODY:
The rally on Wall Street appears to have given the Japanese stock market a respite. Share prices soared today after two weeks of relentless declines.
The Nikkei index of 225 stocks ended the week at 17,850.66, up 1,252.51 points, or 7.6 percent, on the day. Volume was about 380 million shares. For the week, the index fell 709.05, or 3.8 percent. 
 Reuters credited the day's gains to a huge amount of index-linked buying and bargain hunting.
Analysts and traders said they were heartened by the rebound, but said it had not yet ended the possibility of further declines. They attributed much of the enthusiasm to a spillover from the New York rally set off by the Federal Reserve's move to lower interest rates. In turn, Japanese interest rates dropped, contributing to a rally in bonds here.
"We think the bloodbath is over, but there is certainly a possibility that we could go down to 16,000," said Alan Bell, deputy head of research at Baring Securities here. "We just think it is likely to be more orderly from now on."
A move Thursday by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in the United States sparked that rally. In turn, the Fed's action helped push Japanese interest rates lower early today, contributing to a big rally in the Japanese bond market, analysts said.
The market here also jumped up on rumors that the Finance Ministry and other authorities might change rules that permit investors to bet on a falling market. The process is called selling short, and it involves selling borrowed shares in the hope of profiting by replacing them with shares bought later for less.
According to the unconfirmed rumors, the authorities would ban investors from borrowing the shares they want to sell short. This rumor started heavy buying by investors with short positions.

HEADLINE: The Noriega Verdict;
'Appalling Chapter' Ends for Panama

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, April 9

 BODY:
President Guillermo Endara of Panama said today that the conviction of Panama's former strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, on drug-trafficking charges "closes an appalling chapter in the history of Panama."
But many other people here gave only passing attention to the outcome of the trial in Miami. 
 President Endara, who was sworn in as President hours after the United States sent troops to Panama on Dec. 20, 1989, to capture General Noriega, also said today's verdict in Miami was "a call to reflection."
"The only way to govern is according to the law and in favor of the people," he continued. "Those who don't follow that path will encounter the fate of the Noriegas."
 
'Crime Doesn't Pay'
 As news spread here of the outcome of the seven-month trial, radio interviewers began to gather comments from a number of people who played a role in the events leading to the trial.
The Rev. Javier Villanueva, the priest who picked up General Noriega after the general decided to seek asylum in the Vatican Embassy on Christmas Eve 1989, said the verdict was evidence that "crime doesn't pay."
Several public figures expressed anger that the murder and corruption charges still pending here against General Noriega in about 30 cases had not moved forward with the same speed as the Miami trial even though Panamanian law permitted trial and conviction in absentia.
The Panamanian cases that have received wide publicity involve accusations that General Noriega ordered the 1985 killing of Dr. Hugo Spadafora, a prominent political opponent, and the executions of about a dozen members of the Panamanian Defense Forces who tried to overthrow him in the rising political tensions here in 1988-89.
 
'Various Cases' Pending
 Attorney General Rogelio Cruz said in an interview on Wednesday that some of the pending cases were still being investigated while others were already in the courts. He said that "various cases" would be resolved before the end of the year.
While Panamanians widely accept that it is unlikely General Noriega will ever be brought back here to stand trial or to serve a sentence, political leaders and legal experts said convictions here would help to amass information to use against his collaborators and to demonstrate that the justice system in Panama was improving.
While Panamanian news organizations -- now freer and more informative than at any time in modern memory -- have given daily coverage to the Noriega trial, with several sending correspondents to Miami, most people appear to view General Noriega and his era as being over and done with.
Although President Endara said last week that if General Noriega was acquitted of all charges in the United States, Panama would bring him home and prosecute him, most Panamanians saw that as unlikely.
Ricardo Arias Calderon, the Christian Democrat who leads the opposition to Mr. Endara but who was his ally in opposition to General Noriega, said having General Noriega here for trial and possible imprisonment would "stir up things" while Panama is trying to rebuild the economy and build democracy.
"Panama today is concerned with the present and the future," he said. "Noriega being here would mean having to worry with the past."
Mr. Cruz, noting that General Noriega had made the decision to give himself up to the United States for trial instead of the new Panamanian authorities after he sought asylum in an embassy, said the former strongman "didn't want to confront the ire of the people."
"Up there, in Miami, he was allowed to dress as a military man," the attoreney general said, "and wrap himself in the flag of nationalism and pretend to be a war prisoner. Here, he wouldn't have been allowed to do that."
Other people today generally praised the outcome, but some complained about the fact that he had been removed from Panama for trial.
 
Thoughts Under the Sun
 A group of construction workers near one of the numerous high rise buildings going up in Panama City paused under the intense afternoon sun and one of them said that while he had not approved of the way General Noriega ran Panama he wondered "why, if a Panamanian does something wrong here, they have to come get him and send him up there to be tried."
The Endara Government, which has said it believes that most of General Noriega's wealth is deposited or invested outside of Panama, has also initiated a number of civil suits in the United States and one in London in an effort to recover some of that wealth.
One seeks to recover $20 million estimated to be impounded in Florida from the bankrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International, where General Noriega is said to have deposited many millions of dollars.

HEADLINE: Bush and Baker Press Aid to Russia but Meet Worries About Costs

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
The Bush Administration began a campaign to win public and Congressional support for its aid package for Russia. But some lawmakers, who weeks ago had been urging the Administration to do more for Russia, expressed worries today about the costs of the program.
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d used separate public appearances to make their most spirited and forceful argument yet in favor of American taxpayers' helping Russia achieve a free-market democracy, with Mr. Bush terming it "the most important foreign policy opportunity of our time." 
 Many of the lawmakers pressed Mr. Baker to detail what the package would cost the American taxpayer, something that he has never really done. In part, this is because the Administration apparently is not anxious in this election season to have a specific price tag associated with the plan -- at least until it has the stamp of approval of the Democratically controlled Congress.
And in part it is because of the complex nature of the aid -- a combination of credits, loans and cash programs, in the form of new money and old money -- which makes coming up with a single price tag complicated. A rough calculation, though, suggests that the package involves between $3 billion and $4 billion in potential outlays.
The overwhelming reaction of lawmakers whom Mr. Baker addressed in an appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could be summarized as supportive but wary, with several senators arguing that they would have a lot easier time selling Russian aid to taxpayers if the Administration were doing more at home.
"Let me suggest that for an awful lot of people in this country, defining moments are happening every day," Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said after Mr. Baker told the committee that this was a defining moment in relations with Russia.
"I've introduced legislation to deal with cities -- far less than what we're talking about here over five or six years," added Mr. Dodd, who is running for re-election this year.
"I'll guarantee you that there'd be no rush to deal with legislation by July or August to provide some assistance and encourage economic development in the Bridgeports, the Hartfords, the Detroits or San Franciscos. I would guess public support for this is not very high, because people are disappointed that we're not doing enough on the domestic agenda."
Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, said at the outset of Mr. Baker's appearance, "The American people are fed up with foreign aid, and they want to know what the American people get out of it."
Many other senators, though, including Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, Nancy L. Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, and Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, expressed more unreserved support for the Administration's efforts, or as Mr. Biden remarked: "I suspect everyone else here intends to work energetically with you to enact this program. I think it's going to go through here like a hot knife through butter."
Both Mr. Baker and President Bush, who spoke to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, urged Congress to pass the Administration's contribution to the $24 billion allied effort to aid Russian democracy in time for Mr. Yeltsin's Washington summit meeting with Mr. Bush on June 16 and 17. The Administration today also gave a green light for Mr. Yeltsin to go to Munich for a meeting with the Group of Seven major industrial democracies, after their summit meeting there on July 6.
 
How Russia Fits Vision
 In their appearances today, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker, sought for the first time to counter opposition to Russian aid, and press their agenda, by sketching a vision of America's role in the post-cold-war world, and how aid to Russia fits into that vision and enhances basic American strategic and economic interests. This comes after months of either garbled or very low-key support for Russian assistance.
Echoing themes of Administration critics, including Gov. Bill Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and former President Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Bush argued that passage of the Freedom Support Act, as the American-Russian aid package is known, would be the keystone of a post-cold-war American effort to "build a democratic peace" with all the former Communist lands.
The peace in the cold war, Mr. Baker argued, "was not a genuine peace at all," but rather "the avoidance of war was achieved only through confrontation, tension, and the haunting shadow and threat of nuclear holocaust."
Today, he added, "we face a wholly different and novel situation, a chance to build a genuine peace based on common democratic values, to build a democratic peace with Russia and Eurasia. A democratic peace would be a genuine peace; it would not be just the absence of war. That is a purpose that is worthy of the American people, and that is a purpose that we think all Americans will be willing to support."
Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker offered several arguments, including the notion that "real democracies" do not go to war with one another and that the growth of democracy and free markets in Russia and Eurasia can be a new source of trade and investment for American businesses.
 
Warning of a 'Dark Future'
 "The success of reform in Russia, and Ukraine, Armenia and Kazakhstan, Belarus and the Baltics will be the single best guarantee of our security, our prosperity and our values," Mr. Bush said. "The failure of the democratic experiment could bring a dark future, a return to authoritarianism or a descent into anarchy."
When pressed for the bottom-line American contribution to the package, Mr. Baker said it consisted of "old money" -- that is, funds previously requested by the Administration by not yet approved by Congress -- and "new money" requests. The old money is $620 million in technical and humanitarian assistance and $3.75 billion in credits for the former Soviet republics to purchase American grain, which have already been spent.
Also in this old-money category are $12 billion in loan guarantees for the International Monetary Fund, which have also been requested by the Administration before, but not forcefully. The I.M.F. will be supervising the overall international aid effort, and this $12 billion would be used to help finance imports to Russia at a time when it is short of hard currency.
Mr. Baker said the new-money requests in the package consist of $1.1 billion in new grain credits, $1.5 billion as the United States share of the $6 billion currency stabilization fund, and about $500 million to $1 billion in expanded authority for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Export-Import Bank to underwrite American businesses wishing to invest in the former Soviet Union.
Some of these funds are hard dollars and others are simply credits or loan guarantees that will have a big impact for the Russians, but cost the American taxpayers little. For instance, the $12 billion for the I.M.F. actually involves the United States' extending a line of credit for this amount to the fund. The fund would then loan this amount to Russia and would be responsible for overseeing the debt.

HEADLINE: DISTRUST OF U.S. HINDERS IRAN CHIEF

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, April 9

 BODY:
The boulevards are no longer clogged with demonstrators tramping over American flags and the vitriolic condemnations of United States foreign policy in the press have lost some of their sting.
But distrust, even fear, of the United States run deep in Iran, sentiments that have slowed the efforts of President Hashemi Rafsanjani to expand trade ties and foreign investment and perhaps even to open a political dialogue with Washington. 
 A visitor returning to Iran after a decade found that many Iranian officials and ordinary citizens are still seized with the image of the United States as an overwhelming superpower bent on humiliating Iran and dominating the region.
Why is it, they want to know, that the United States pinned a medal on the captain of the ship that shot down an Iranian airliner, killing 290 people, during the Iran-Iraq war in 1988? And was it just a coincidence that the State Department announced a few days later that Iran would remain on the list of nations supporting terrorism?
 
A Double Standard Is Seen
 They accuse the United States of a employing a double standard on democracy because of America's refusal to embrace a popular Islamic movement in Algeria, and they find it inconsistent that Washington justified its invasion of Panama but went to war over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
They do not understand why the Bush Administration was poised to intercept a North Korean ship carrying Scud-C missiles to Iran, while at the same time it is preparing to sell advanced F-15E fighter planes to Saudi Arabia. And it is difficult to convince even Iranians sympathetic to the United States that the Administration did not purposely leave President Saddam Hussein in power in Iraq.
They cite statements by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d during a recent visit to Central Asia that new predominantly Muslim republics of the former Soviet Union should look to Turkey, not Iran, as a model, as proof that the United States wants to dominate the region through what they call its "puppet ally" in Ankara. And they bemoan the United States military presence in the Persian Gulf, particularly now that the Soviet Union no longer exists -- a situation, a diplomat said, "that genuinely frightens them."
Perhaps the biggest frustration faced by Mr. Rafsanjani and his group of supporters is trying to figure out why they received what they regarded as a small return for helping to free American hostages being held by Iranian-backed terrorist groups in Lebanon.
"All along, the American Government told Iran that the hostages were the main obstacle to an improvement in relations, so Iran helped free them, and then nothing happened," said a Western diplomat who refused to be named. "In a way, its diplomacy backfired, because the United States turned around and said, 'See, they were in control of the hostages all the time.' "
Mr. Rafsanjani personally intervened to help win the release of the last American hostages, expending not only political capital but, according to United States officials in Washington, also spending about $1 million for each hostage released. But he had little to show for his efforts.
 
Inconsistent Statements
 "How could he make another move?" said a Foreign Ministry official who deals with the United States.
Since becoming President in August 1989, Mr. Rafsanjani has shifted signals on future relations with the United States, depending on the domestic political winds. In March of last year, he said Iran was ready to improve relations with the United States as soon as it abandoned its "hostility toward Iran." Two months later, he told the seminary at Teheran University, "Iran is not thinking about restoring relations with the United States."
Foreign diplomats in Teheran are convinced that if Mr. Rafsanjani could have his way, he would move to improve ties, particularly if it helped Iran to acquire much-needed economic aid and foreign investment.
But discreetly and slowly, Iran has already moved closer to the United States. In 1991, Iranian imports of American goods totaled $527 million, a nearly ninefold increase from just two years before. American-made goods are creeping back into Iran -- from Pontiac Firebirds in the streets to Marlboro cigarettes in the shops.
It has been left to Mr. Rafsanjani's supporters to go further. Mohammed Javad Larijani, a senior presidential adviser running in parliamentary elections Friday, last year suggested "a marriage of convenience" without a resumption in formal ties.
 The issue of contacts with America is so sensitive, however, that Mahmoud Vaezi, the Deputy Foreign Minister for Europe and the Americas, found himself on the defensive after he met with Cyrus R. Vance, a United Nations special envoy and former American Secretary of State, during a trip through Azerbaijan and Armenia this month.
Mr. Vaezi successfully deflected the criticism, calling the meeting "absolutely correct," and adding: "It was nothing important, just a quick hello."
No one is talking about a warming of relations with Washington during the current campaign for the Iranian Parliament, or Majlis. In the weeks leading up to the elections, Mr. Rafsanjani has avoided the subject. His opponents, however, have used the current campaign to accuse him of straying from the goals of Ayatollah Khomeini's revolution and to voice their fierce opposition to a reconciliation between Iran and the United States.

HEADLINE: House Adopts Major Changes in Its Management

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
After hours of partisan wrangling, the House tonight approved Democratic proposals to put its day-to-day administration under new management, with Republicans given an unheard-of veto on the hiring of two new high-ranking officials.
Republicans, seeking to exploit Democrats' embarrassment over the House bank scandal and charges of drug-dealing at the House post office, said these concessions were not enough and refused to agree on a package drawn up by a bipartisan study group. 
 They demanded that Democrats not only make further concessions on administrative matters but also on legislative rules changes intended to give them a more effective voice when the House and its committees consider bills on the floor and in committee.
On two party-line votes, the House adopted the Democratic plan, 269 to 81, with 64 Republicans voting present, after defeating the Republican measure, 254 to 159. On that vote, no Democrats voted for the proposal and no Republicans voted against it, although there were 22 absentees. On the second, 16 Republicans and three Democrats voted with the other party.
The tone of the debate was unusually bitter, even for a session that has been marked by intense, personal divisive controversy since it began in January, and which has produced almost no legislation that will end up on the statute books.
The House minority leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, scoffed at the Democrats' claims of generosity in sharing power. " 'Unprecedented' isn't enough," he said. He said the Democrats were adopting half-measures "out of panic." He promised that if the Republicans won control of the next Congress, they would adopt all the concessions he asked from the Democrats tonight.
The majority whip, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, argued "Republicans are not really interested in reform at all." He said "Stop the hypocrisy. Stop the posturing. Stop the political games and let's get on and do something about the Republican recession."
 
Administrative Changes
 The major changes in the Democratic package would create a director of nonlegislative and financial services, to run such activities as pay and benefits for members and staff, internal mail and office furnishings and supplies, and establish an inspector general with wide auditing responsibilities.
Both of those posts would be filled only on unanimous agreement of the Speaker and the majority and minority leaders -- a sharing of power with Republicans that would have been unimaginable before the scandal at the House bank was disclosed.
The Republican proposal created similar offices under slightly different conditions, and called for sharing more administrative powers between the parties.
But the major thrust of their substitute was on legislative matters, seeking to get more Republicans on the Rules Committee and other committees, reduce committee staffing and prohibit voting by proxy in subcommittees and committees. Proxy voting is not permitted on the House floor. The Republicans also sought to prohibit franked mailing outside a member's district, a provision included in the campaign finance bill that the House passed earlier today over their solid opposition.
Renewing complaints they have made steadily all year, Republicans argued that 38 years of Democratic control of the House had produced corruption, and, as Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of upstate New York, said, "breakdown of the legislative process and growing procedural unfairness."
But Democrats argued that the Republicans' problem was that they could not win enough elections to control the House. Though power may corrupt, said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, "The absence of power can make people very cranky." He added, "With a lack of power comes irresponsibility."
Speaker Thomas S. Foley defended the Democratic plan as "the most far-reaching reforms of the non-legislative administration of the House of Representatives" in history.
But Representative Tom Ridge, Republican of Pennsylvania, insisted that the auditing powers of the new inspector general were so hamstrung that he or she would be "a lap dog." Instead, he said, the House needs "a pit bull."
Both the Democratic plan and the Republican plan promised an end to perks for House members. One lonely voice defended such privileges as parking and franked mail. Representative James A. Traficant Jr., Democrat of Ohio, said he did not want to leave his car in the Reflecting Pool. He needed franked mail, he said, because "town criers don't cut it any more."
But most of the evening was devoted to snarling exchanges.
Representative Craig T. James, Republican of Florida, said the Democratic plan amounted to a "continuing coverup."
Representative Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, accused junior Republicans of "McCarthyism."
Representative Jerry Lewis of California, the third-ranking House Republican, assailed the "corrupt administration" of the House.
And one Republican after another assailed proxy voting as "ghost voting."

HEADLINE: Mother Is Bludgeoned to Death

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
In the 10 years that he lived with his mother in a spacious Washington Heights apartment, Darren Lee was an unobtrusive, if familiar presence, best known to his neighbors for swaying to the silent beat of his headphones and toting a large valise he said carried his artwork.
But Wednesday night in a rage that stunned residents of his well-kept building at 330 Wadsworth Avenue, the 25-year-old man bludgeoned his mother, Gloria Lee, 53, to death with a hammer in the apartment they shared, the police said. Mr. Lee was charged with murder yesterday. 
 Detective Joseph McConville, a Police Department spokesman, said Mr. Lee had a history of mental illness and had been treated at Harlem Hospital as recently as last month.
Stephanie Mack, deputy executive director of Harlem Hospital, said she could not confirm whether Mr. Lee had been treated at the hospital because of patient-confidentiality rules.
Lieut. Joseph Reznick of the 34th Precinct said Ms. Lee made an urgent telephone call to another son, Martin, around 9 P.M. on Wednesday, saying she was having problems with Darren. When Mr. Lee arrived several minutes later, he found his mother dead in her bedroom, Lieutenant Reznick said. Ms. Lee had been struck numerous times in the head with a hammer, which was recovered at the scene, the police said.
Relatives told the police that Darren Lee was unemployed and had been treated in city hospitals for mental illness, the lieutenant said. He said there was no evidence Ms. Lee had called the police in the past to complain about problems with her son.
Neighbors said Ms. Lee moved into a five-room, second-floor apartment in the Wadsworth Avenue building, at West 190th Street, in 1982 and raised her four children there by herself.
Three of the children later moved away, but Darren, the youngest, stayed with his mother. Described by neighbors as a short, stocky man who walked with a boxer's swagger, Mr. Lee told the building's porter, Felix Ramos, that he was attending art school. But the police said there was no evidence he was in such a school.
Mr. Ramos observed, "He never, never threatened anybody."

HEADLINE: Dow Rebounds 43.61 on Rate Move by Fed

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded yesterday, as anxiety eased, at least for a day, over a market downturn and weakness in Tokyo. After the Federal Reserve moved to ease interest rates, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered nearly half the 94 points it lost the two previous days.
The Dow drifted upward at the opening, and suddenly vaulted more than 30 points just before noon. It floated to a peak at 2 P.M., and remained well above 3,200 for the rest of the day, closing at 3,224.96, up 43.61, or 1.4 percent. 
 Analysts and money managers voiced concern, however, that the day's rebound might not prevent a further fall in the near future.
"I don't think this market is yet out of the woods," said Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "What happened in Japan was more of a catalyst than anything else. The market was responding to its own problems."
Yesterday's surge was accelerated by computer-driven program trading that was touched off when news hit the market that the Fed had cut its target for the Federal funds rate to 3.75 from 4 percent. The bank does not announce such shifts, but economists saw the change.
The sudden rise "was a pretty broad movement, involving about 950 stocks," said Philip Smyth, an analyst at Birinyi Associates.
Trading was heavy, at 232.3 million shares, down slightly from Wednesday's 249.2 million. Gaining issues outpaced losing ones by 1,280 to 523.
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 13.07 points, or 2.28 percent, to 586.75, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 6.14 points, to 400.64. The American Stock Exchange index rose 5.04 points, to 385.94, while the Russell Index of 2,000 stocks went up 3.20 points, to 196.23.
"A lot of it was pure bounce from the last two days," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Mutual Funds. "People are getting used to buying on a dip."
Trude Latimer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, warned that further declines might follow. "It may take more than a day or two to bring back confidence," she said. "The bears in this market are not going to be convinced after just one day."
One of yesterday's most active stocks was First Data, which was one of the market's largest initial public offerings ever, with 44 million shares sold. First Data began trading in midafternoon at 22 1/8, and closed up only 1/8, at 22 1/4, with more than five million shares traded on the day.
That price was well below the $24 to $26 originally forecast by the stock's underwriting group, led by Lehman Brothers, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Transport stocks rose sharply, pushing the Dow Jones transportion average up 36.99 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,338.56.
AMR, the holding company for American Airlines, rose 3 1/8, to 71 7/8, after announcing new fares that the company said would add $300 million to $350 million to its annual revenue. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, also rose 2 1/2, to 133 1/4. Delta Air Lines went up 1 1/2, to 60 3/4, and Airborne Freight rose 2 1/8, to 23 7/8.
In other areas, Molecular Biosystems rose 3 3/8, to 27 1/4, after the company announced that it had received a positive Food and Drug Administration evaluation for Albunex.
Brokerage stocks, which have fallen sharply in recent sessions, also gained some lost ground. Morgan Stanley went up 1 7/8, to 50 5/8; Merrill Lynch rose 2 1/4, to 51 3/8, and Salomon Brothers climbed 1 7/8, to 28 7/8.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Many Fears Of the Electorate

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THOUGH the recession appears to be ending, the voters remain anxious and angry, as this week's primaries showed once again. What explains their mood?
Daniel Yankelovich, president of the Public Agenda Foundation, said in an interview that the unusually high level of voter anxiety stemmed not from current economic conditions but from fears about the economy's future. Usually, he said, the American people look at a recession like a traffic jam; they expect that as soon as the jam is broken they will soon be speeding along the highway as before. But this time, people are afraid that something has gone terribly wrong with the system, and their future and their children's future are in real trouble. 
 High on their worry list is a shortage of savings, especially among the baby-boom generation. Young families have most of their savings, if any, in the equity value of their homes. While the boom was on in the 1980's, their "savings" were rising year by year, as housing prices went up. Now, with real estate values falling, they see their life savings disappearing.
And people are worried about the security of their jobs. In this recession, they have seen not just blue-collar, factory or construction jobs wiped out, but also white-collar jobs, positions in middle management and in services. And they are afraid the jobs will not come back, under pressure of technological change and foreign competition. Job worries spill into worries about health care; people are asking, Mr. Yankelovich said, "What do we do if I lose my job and somebody in the family gets sick?"
A recent survey sponsored by the private, bipartisan Council on Competitiveness, a group of business executives, labor leaders and university presidents, documents these anxieties. Of 1,094 people polled nationwide, 60 percent said the standard of living of the average American family was "getting worse."
Eighty-one percent said job security among older workers was "just fair," "not so good," or "poor." And 80 percent also said job opportunities for young people who are starting out were "just fair," "not so good," or "poor." Nearly three-fourths of those polled said the challenge to America posed by foreign economic competition was "still ahead," while only 18 percent said it was behind us.
What does this mood of public anxiety over the economic future mean for America's political future? The historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. contends that American politics runs in "generational" cycles, with anti-government, laissez-faire waves giving way to pro-activist government waves over a 30-year span.
In an interview in the November-December issue of Challenge magazine, he contends that the tide is now turning toward a demand that Government play an activist role in solving a list of problems "impressive in scope and breadth." These include "the widening disparities in income and opportunity; the multiplication of the poor and the underclass; the slowdown on racial justice; the decline of heavy industry before competition abroad and the microchip at home; the deterioration of education; the pollution of the environment and the decay of infrastructure; the rotting away of the great cities; the health crisis; the mounting burden of public and private debt; the spread of crime and violence."
Indeed, so formidable is the list of problems that it leaves voters in a state of skepticism, even cynicism, that the politicians can tackle and solve them. Thus far, the Presidential candidates, racing from primary to primary, have sought to convince voters that they do know the names of the problems and have plans (but they do not mention money) for solving them.
Even apart from the costs of servicing the debt, most of what the Government takes in through the existing tax system is committed to entitlement programs, military programs, and the costs of bailing out the savings and loans, with little left over for major new initiatives.
The no-tax-increase commitment of President Bush, which has been reinforced during the campaign by the taunt of Patrick Buchanan that the President had gone back on his word, leaves the Republicans in a box from which there appears to be no escape -- except by deep cuts in expenditures, which they are loath to make with the economy moving so sluggishly out of recession.
The Democrats, facing an electorate that in its anti-government, anti-politician mood does not want to fork over higher taxes, are in much the same bind as the Republicans. Jerry Brown tried to escape by a combination of a flat tax and a value-added tax. But once its regressivity and burdens on the poor and aged were understood, he was forced to run for the hills before the political dam broke over his head, which it now seems to have done anyway.
The radical change in the generational political cycle toward an activist government may be living a kind of shadow existence. With voters distrusting the politicians at the same time that they are angry with them for doing nothing to solve the problems that have been accumulating for a generation, the political cycle may be stuck in its anti-activist-government phase. But that could change after the election, as happened after 1932 and 1960.

HEADLINE: North Korea Assembly Backs Atom Pact

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 9

 BODY:
After six years of delay, the North Korean Parliament ratified an agreement today to allow international inspectors into nuclear installations, starting the clock on a 90-day deadline to open up the plants where the Communist Government is believed to be developing atomic weapons.
Parliament's action, reported today by North Korea's official news agency, came with an assurance from Choe Hak Gun, the Minister of Atomic Energy Industry, that his country will now "accept nuclear inspection without delay." 
 Nonetheless, the agency said Parliament had attached a condition to approval, saying inspections would be permitted only if no other country threatened North Korea with nuclear attack.
It was not clear whether that condition would be invoked to try to slow an initial survey of the country's nuclear apparatus. A senior official of the International Atomic Energy Agency, however, said today that he believed that there would still be several roadblocks to overcome before inspectors are allowed to visit Yongbyon, the nuclear complex near Pyongyang, the capital.
 
Agency Awaiting List
 "We are still awaiting a complete list from North Korea of its facilities so that we can make the inspections," said the official, who said he was still fearful that North Korea might try to hide key nuclear installations. "If the list does not appear complete, then we can turn to the United Nations Security Council for help."
The official said the Atomic Energy Agency "fully expects" to have the list by the end of May, in time for its next full meeting, which is scheduled for June. Hans Blix, the agency's chief, is expected to travel to North Korea in the next few months.
North Korea signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty six years ago, but never approved an inspection plan for its nuclear installations. It long maintained that it would not allow inspection until the United States removed all its nuclear weapons from bases in South Korea. At the end of last year, Seoul announced that the American forces South Korea had done that and said its soil was nuclear-free.
In recent months international pressure on North Korea has grown rapidly. Japan has refused to consider a restoration of diplomatic relations, much less deep economic ties, until North Korea dismantles its nuclear installations.
 
Satellite Evidence Cited
 Satellite evidence gathered by the United States and shared widely with its allies suggests that North Korea is near completion of a large nuclear fuel-reprocessing plant. When complete, the plant could produce weapons-grade plutonium, which in turn could then be fabricated into nuclear weapons. The size and configuration of the heavily guarded plants at Yongbyon suggest that most of the elements that President Kim Il Sung would need to assemble a bomb are in place.
But little is known about North Korea's technical talents, and there is a raging debate in Washington -- pitting the State Department, the Defense Department and the intelligence agencies against one another -- over how much time is left before the first weapon is within reach. Recently Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, told Congress that North Korea could produce a weapon in a number of months, but the more commonly accepted estimate is one to three years.
North Korea has denied that it is trying to build weapons, arguing that the scare over a North Korean bomb is being fabricated by the Bush Administration. In its dispatch today, Pyongyang's news service quoted Mr. Choe as reiterating that denial and saying North Korea simply planned to step up development of nuclear power plants.
The Atomic Energy Agency's inspection would be separate from a series of inspections between North and South Korea that the two countries agreed to in principle in December. But talks on setting up those inspections have only sputtered along.

HEADLINE: Peoria Journal;
Dreams and City's Image Are Threatened in Strike

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., April 9

 BODY:
From the barbershops and health clubs to the banks and bowling alleys, the talk of this quiet Midwestern city has been the Caterpillar strike.
Everyone, it seems, in this city of 113,000 people, knows someone who is walking the picket line at Caterpillar Inc., the construction machinery company whose workers have been on strike since November. 
And while every resident seems to have an opinion on who is to blame and what it will take to resolve the crisis, all seem to agree that the conflict is tarnishing the image of a city that had been busy trying to build up its self-esteem.
"We were listed in U.S. News and World Report two years ago as one of the boom towns of the United States," said James A. Maloof, the city's 72-year-old Mayor. "We had worked so hard to make this a city with the image of having a cohesive relationship between labor and management, a place that people should think about expanding their businesses or opening new ones. Now comes this strike, which is going to damage our reputation."
To some, the strike has damaged more than Peoria's reputation. For the strikers, of course, there are the lost dreams of new cars, larger homes and college educations for their children. Along with that has come the emotional duress of not knowing if their jobs are forever lost in the aftermath of the company's vow to replace strikers with nonunion permanent workers.
But the sense of discomfort here is even more widespread than that. The 12,600 workers at Caterpillar, most of them in the Peoria area, account for about a tenth of the city's work force. That is down from 25 percent two decades ago, but more than enough to tamper with the steadiness of the city's fragile economy.
For a city in which people still occasionally speak to each other while walking down the street, everyone seems affected in some way by the strike. "I have friends who are Caterpillar workers and I feel so bad for them," said Dianne Richardson, manager of the Crossroad Bowling Alley, near the city's mall. "They have to decide if they're going to lose their jobs or stick by the union."
Discussions of the strike is virtually incessant at Rafferty's barber shop, near Bradley University in the center of town. "From college students to retired judges, it's simply what everyone is talking about these days," said Bill Rafferty, the 51-year-old owner who has run the barber shop for 23 years. "It's a difficult situation for everyone because many of these people at Caterpillar are our friends. It's tough on us here."
The Caterpillar labor dispute seems to be considerably less tough on Peoria's economy than when members of the United Auto Workers Union struck for 207 days in 1982. That strike, retailers and city officials say, caused spending and housing purchases to plunge and led some businesses to close.
Mayor Maloof said the 1982 strike led a group of businesses and unions to form an organization to seek ways of promoting better relations between the two groups. "We thought that this organization would help promote the image of Peoria being a place where labor and management could work together," he said, referring to the Peoria Area Labor Management. "And now we're stunned by this."
Some economists and retailers say they have seen some slippage in Peoria's retail sales, to varying degrees.
Many here are fearful that the worst may yet lie ahead. Even if there are replacement workers to fill the jobs of striking Caterpillar union members, that will leave thousands of those strikers with lost jobs and insufficient resources to pay mortgages, to buy clothing, let alone go to movies. "We don't see any great sweeping decline in our economy yet," said James F. Bubert, chairman and chief executive of the First National Bank of Peoria. "But some people wonder if it's coming."
Fred Carrell, a manager of Mr. Steak Restaurant, near the city's mall, said: "Our business is off 10 to 15 percent from before the strike. You could shoot a cannon through the mall on some nights and not have anyone get hurt.
"I see the union's side in this and I see the company's side and I don't think either is 100 percent right or wrong. I think it's already creating a disaster economically. And like everyone else, I just want it to end."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Sidelines;
TSONGAS DECLARES HE WON'T RE-ENTER DEMOCRATIC RACE

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 9

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas announced today that he would not re-enter the 1992 Presidential race, despite his surprisingly strong showing in the New York primary Tuesday.
The former Massachusetts Senator, who pulled out of the campaign three weeks ago after losing to Gov. Bill Clinton in Illinois and Michigan, said he believed he could have raised enough money and reassembled a big enough staff to have resumed a limited campaign. 
 But ultimately, he said, he had to face Mr. Clinton's commanding lead in delegates and the strong possibility that a renewed Tsongas campaign might do more to destroy the Democratic Party than to slow Mr. Clinton on his winning way.
 
Rejects Spoiler Role Again
 Mr. Clinton's victories in the primaries Tuesday, Mr. Tsongas said, "removed the argument that my re-entry would rescue this party."
"Indeed, Bill's winning took me back to the option I rejected three weeks ago -- the role of spoiler," Mr. Tsongas said. "I reject such a role. It is less than worthy."
But he said his pro-business message had continued to win support among the voters.
If the Democratic Party does not now embrace his pro-business message wholeheartedly, he said, President Bush will be re-elected in the fall, along with many other Republican candidates.
"Hear me well: Do not turn your back on this great energy field," he said in a news conference here after 36 hours of pondering the results of the voting Tuesday with advisers, friends and party leaders.
"There were very strong feelings as to what I should do," he said. "But there was absolutely no consensus."
In the end, he added, he reached his decision without cutting any deals with Mr. Clinton, of Arkansas, or former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, the two remaining Democratic contenders.
"I talked to Bill," he said. "He congratulated me and I congratulated him and we said we'd meet again some time down the road."
Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager, said the former Senator had talked with "dozens and dozens" of people throughout the country before making his announcement today. He declined to name any other than former President Jimmy Carter, a Clinton supporter. "I don't think Mr. Carter tried to push him one way or the other," Mr. Kanin said. "They just discussed options."
Mr. Tsongas urged his supporters to discontinue efforts to draft him back into the fray.
"To hope that I will re-enter is a false hope," he said. "I will not re-enter. Preserve the message, yes. But we must heal the party as well. Both are noble purposes and I hope to be part of bringing both into reality."
Some of his supporters who came to hear him speak were unpersuaded.
"We want Paul! We want Paul!" they chanted.
"Hey," he shouted back, flashing his crooked grin. "You can't keep doing this."
 
He Encourages Support
 But while he said he would not re-enter the race, he pointed out that one way his supporters could continue to keep alive the Tsongas message was to vote for him in the remaining primaries.
"My name will remain on future ballots," he said.
Mr. Tsongas said he was not turning his back on those who had urged him to resume the campaign he abandoned three weeks ago when, out of money and poorly organized, he was faltering under the political onslaughts of Mr. Clinton.
Asked whether he would like to be the Vice-Presidential nominee, since he had ruled out any further Presidential effort, Mr. Tsongas answered that he would "defer" addressing that because he did not expect such a bid.
In any event, he continued, he plans to support the Democratic Presidential nominee in the fall, "with enthusiasm," but he said he would not endorse a candidate under the nominating process is over.
Mr. Tsongas, the first major candidate to get into the 1992 race, won the New Hampshire primary and fared well in some of the other early primaries and caucuses, despite his low-key, self-deprecating campaign style that left some voters wondering what manner of politician they had met or heard. But however unconventional his style and delivery, his message of economic growth and fiscal discipline found ready ears in economically depressed states like New Hampshire.
Still, as the primary season wore on and he began to offer more details of what he had in mind, many voters began to turn away, particularly blue- collar workers, blacks and organized labor. Those constituencies would have played an important role in the next primary, April 28, in Pennsylvania.
Members of these constituencies said his message seemed aimed more at the well-off and the well-educated than the hard-hit working class. He began to falter and, after finishing poorly in a series of primaries in the South and Midwest, he pulled out on March 19. Mr. Clinton is leading Mr. Tsongas in delegates by better than 2 to 1, with only 17 primaries and caucuses remaining and with party rules of strict proportional representation that make it extremely difficult to overcome such leads.
Since Mr. Tsongas dropped out, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown, for all the successes they have enjoyed, have also shown serious weaknesses, particularly in the negative ratings many voters give both.
Those weaknesses were never more apparent than Tuesday, when Mr. Tsongas, without any campaigning, finished a second in New York and Kansas. He finished third in Wisconsin.
Immediately, many of Mr. Tsongas's friends and supporters began urging him to get back into the race to provide an alternative to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown.
Many of those supporters felt that Mr. Tsongas probably would not get the nomination himself but would perhaps force a brokered convention. Others believed his strong showing on Tuesday gave him leverage, at the least, to affect the campaign dialogue and the writing of the party's platform.
But however he chose to use his leverage, most of his friends and advisers said, it would carry little or no force unless he was back in the race. And if he re-entered, they warned, he should be prepared for particularly bitter and battering political experience.
Further, they said, there not only was no guarantee of success but he could end up deep in debt, one of the fears that originally drove him from the campaign. His campaign is currently carrying a debt of about $400,000, Mr. Kanin said. The advisers also warned, as did Mr. Clinton's supporters, that if he re-entered the race he risked going down in political history as a sore spoiler who refused to help heal an already badly fragmented Democratic Party.
"I told him all this and I also told him I thought he should get back in," said Ted Van Dyk, a Tsongas adviser. "I told him there would be money problems and organizational problems and all the stuff he had to deal with before he ever got out. And I told him it would be worth it all if he was really committed."

HEADLINE: Congress Getting Cold Feet About Cutting Weapons Programs

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
After pressing the Bush Administration to make deeper cuts in military spending after the cold war, Congress is now having second thoughts about immediately canceling costly weapons like nuclear-powered submarines and fighter jets.
The pressure to hold the line against job losses in the weapons industry during a recession-plagued election year is intertwined with the military's needs, declining Pentagon budgets and a growing debate over preserving the design and construction skills to build America's complex weaponry. 
For instance, members of Congress eager to delay layoffs in Southern California have softened their opposition to spending more than $2 billion each for four more B-2 bombers built by the Northrop Corporation of Los Angeles. And the Texas Congressional delegation wants to reverse plans to end production of the F-16 fighter, a program that employs 16,000 General Dynamics workers in Fort Worth.
Republicans and Democrats have voiced concern over the increasingly volatile political issue in House and Senate hearings in the past two weeks. A House panel took a preliminary step today to keep financing for one of two Seawolf submarines the Pentagon wants to cancel.
"This is a national security issue, an industrial base issue, a jobs issue and a budget issue," Senator William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican who is a member of the Armed Services Committee, said last week.
But no program better illustrates this quandary than the Navy's Seawolf attack submarine, which is assembled by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Conn. President Bush said in January that the Pentagon would reap $17.5 billion of $50 billion in proposed military savings through 1997 by canceling the submarine after the first one was built.
Many lawmakers initially applauded the decision on the Seawolf, which was originally intended to hunt advanced Soviet submarines. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney asked Congress to rescind about $3 billion that lawmakers approved in earlier years.
But Congress is agonizing over unemployment. And lawmakers are growing more and more nervous that the country's ability to retain the technology and expertise to build nuclear submarines could wither and die during a seven-year gap between production of the last Seawolf and Los Angeles class submarines, and the Navy's next submarine, the Centurion, a smaller and cheaper version of the Seawolf scheduled for production in 1998.
To address both problems, lawmakers are considering buying the second and third Seawolf submarines, which Congress had already paid for, or continuing to build attack submarines of the earlier Los Angeles class. The bulk of the Seawolf program would still be canceled, yielding more than 80 percent of the savings Mr. Bush proposed.
The House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for military spending voted in closed session today to keep more than $2 billion for the second Seawolf, which the Pentagon wanted rescinded. The vote was a preliminary step that needs several more approvals in the House and Senate to take effect.
"The major question for Congress is whether the nation's submarine industrial base can survive the gap between the end of the Seawolf and the beginning of the Centurion," Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who is a member of the Armed Services Committee, said at the panel's hearing.
In addition to today's House panel vote on the Seawolf, there have been other indications in the past two weeks that members might be getting cold feet about deeper cuts. The House soundly rejected a proposal to shift nearly $7 billion in military savings to domestic programs. And the Senate Budget Committee also narrowly defeated a plan last week to double the cuts President Bush has proposed for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
General Dynamics says that building the second and third submarines will bridge the production gap and preserve the engineering expertise until the Centurion program starts.
Although the Defense Department officially endorses canceling the Seawolf, some Navy officials have challenged their bosses. In an unusual public break with President Bush and Mr. Cheney over the submarine's future, Adm. Bruce DeMars, the Navy's director of nuclear propulsion, said at House and Senate hearings this week and last that it would make more financial sense to build the next two Seawolf submarines and then end the program.
 
Question of Bottom Line
 Roger E. Tetrault, the general manager of Electric Boat, said in an interview that even before the Seawolf cancellation, the company was planning to cut its work force in Connecticut and Rhode Island to about 10,000 by the end of the decade from the current level of 21,500 employees. Mr. Tetrault said that if the Seawolf was canceled the work force would drop to 5,000 employees by 1997.
The Seawolf's bottom line may ultimately tip the balance. At last week's Senate hearing, the Navy's senior acquisition official, Gerald A. Cann, said that contract-cancellation fees and money already spent on the Seawolf program totals $1.8 billion.
By spending about $2.5 billion more, Congressional and Navy officials say, the Administration would not only buy two more submarines, but also preserve the future production ability, as well as saving thousands of jobs.
Mr. Tetrault said the two additional submarines might cost only $1 billion to $2 billion more than paying the cancellation fees.
The Defense Department is sticking to its decision. "There is no revival being considered for the Seawolf program," the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said last week.

HEADLINE: A Hard Sell: Students Try to Market Themselves;
5,000 Attend City University Job Fair With Their Hopes High and Expectations Low

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Michael Pollicino had a crisp new gray suit on, 60 freshly copied resumes stashed in a bright blue folder and very low expectations as he stood 16th in line yesterday afternoon to talk to representatives of McGraw-Hill at a job fair run by the City University of New York.
Asked what kind of job he was hoping to get, he paused. "Some type of editorial kind of work, I guess." Another pause. "Actually, I guess whatever they'd want me to do." 
 Traditionally, the City University system has been a gateway to a better life for the sons and daughters of blue-collar workers and the immigrant poor. "About two-thirds of all of our students are the first in their families to go to college," said Jay Hershenson, City University's vice chancellor for university relations.
 
Interviews With Radio Shack and the C.I.A.
 Mr. Pollicino, who is 21 years old and works part-time in a delicatessen to help pay for his education, was one of some 5,000 college seniors and recent alumni at the university's Big Apple Job Fair who bombarded representatives of 81 companies and government agencies, from Radio Shack to the Central Intelligence Agency, with resumes and questions. Mr. Pollicino, an English and journalism major who will graduate in June from Brooklyn College, said his long-term goal was to have "a nice job, a nice wife and a family."
The event in the Gold Ballroom of the Ramada Hotel in midtown Manhattan provided a fast-forward glimpse of the bruising rite of spring performed by college graduates around the country. As the students' hopes of putting their educations to work went head-to-head with the reality of the job market, the results were not always pretty.
Behind Mr. Pollicino was William Levis, 23, who graduated from Queens College in January with a degree in history. "I've already put out 350," he said of the number of resumes he had distributed. "I've had 30 to 35 written responses. Interviews: two. And they were for mail-room jobs."
He said he was doing no better yesterday. "All that economy-is-turning-around bull is just part of the election," he said. "When I went back for my bachelor's, I was hoping for some sort of upper-middle-class status. I don't know what that is anymore."
Christopher Lynch, 26, had the same complaint. "People come here with high expectations after going to school and working hard and expecting to be able to work, and they can't," he said. "I look at a bachelor's now as the same as a high school diploma." Mr. Lynch, who has a master's degree in clinical psychology from Hunter College, said that one advertising company at the fair had said it would consider him for an opening -- as a secretary.
 
Making an Impression
 In general, jobs are not parceled out at the fair. Instead, the event gives students a chance to pick up information about different companies, drop off resumes and in the bedlam, hold out the eternal hope of making a good impression. The encounter with the man from the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the representative of the Museum of Modern Art may have been brief, but the briefcase-toting, suit-wearing students, who waited in lines for up to a half-hour, prepared carefully and let no opportunity slip by. Several asked a reporter if his newspaper had any openings.
In the lobby, dozens gathered around a television screen that played a video on "How to Make a Job Fair Work for You."
"You have to be proactive to make it work for you," said the narrator. "Dress appropriately. Maintain good eye contact. Have a firm handshake."
Sidney M. Sussan, assistant director of the division of banking supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, said he was impressed with the students who lined up to meet him. "Good eye contact," he said. "Good handshake. Good first three sentences." He said that the Federal Reserve was looking to hire several types of workers, including communications analysts, electronic data processing auditors and litigation and regulation attorneys.
 
'We'll Get Back in Touch
 After waiting in line 20 minutes for a handshake and a one-minute talk with a McGraw-Hill representative, Mr. Pollicino said he had gotten the same response he received from other publishing companies: "All right, we'll get back in touch if any editorial positions become available."
"I think it went O.K., though," he added with a shy grin.
Thomas L. Thomas, president of City University's Career Counseling and Placement Association, said that about 35 percent of the students who responded to surveys distributed at previous job fairs had found work through the events. He said many students, apprehensive about the job market this year, were considering graduate school or adjusting their expectations to aim for what he called "back-office-type-jobs."
"Look, you have to make yourself marketable," he said. "You have to entertain different fields."
Laura Caminito, 22, who will graduate this July from Baruch College, did not sound too particular about the kind of work she wanted. "Hopefully in the research area of marketing," she said. But Ms. Caminito, 20th in line to talk to representatives from Tribune New York Radio, Inc., said the one company she had visited so far was not hiring.
A fellow applicant returning from the front of the line said: "If you want, you can just drop off your resume. She said there has not been a job available in two years."
Ms. Caminito then asked no one in particular: "So what are we waiting for? I guess this one isn't going so good either."
Ten minutes later, she was still waiting.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Short-Term Interest Rates Plunge

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The decline in the important Federal funds rate yesterday surprised and delighted skittish financial markets. Prices of long-term bonds rose and short-term interest rates fell to their lowest levels in nearly 20 years.
The move by the Federal Reserve Board was its first effort to cut interest rates since Dec. 20 and came in the wake of recent reports suggesting to some analysts that the economic recovery, which appeared to be building during the winter, was losing momentum. 
 "I am a little surprised, but taking out a little insurance is not a bad idea," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation, shortly after the Fed sent a signal to the bond market that it had pushed its target for the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market to 3.75 percent, from 4 percent previously.
 
'Very Risky Business'
 "It is very risky business for the Fed to risk failure on the recovery," said Allen Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc. "And recent reports suggest the momentum on the economy is negative."
The Fed moved forcefully on Dec. 20 to help the economy by slashing its discount rate, which it charges on loans to banks by a full percentage point and lowering the funds rate by half a point.
Since then, some reports on retail sales and housing construction have suggested the economy is beginning to recover. But concern about the pace of recovery began to mount last month, as auto sales figures remained at low levels. Last week the Labor Department reported that outside the public sector, employment growth was extremely weak during March. And for the last several weeks the nation's money supply has declined, following rapid expansion in January and February.
That trend continued yesterday, as the Fed reported that all three monetary aggregates fell in the week ended March 30. The $7.1 billion drop in M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, was in line with market expectations. The drop in M-2 left its growth at the low end of the Fed's 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent target range for the year.
 
Impact on Prime Rate
 By itself, the cut in the funds rate was not large enough to have an impact on key lending rates like the prime rate.
But Mr. Sinai and others said the Fed might need to push the funds rate down further. And another quarter-point cut in the funds rate would almost certainly prod commercial banks to bring down their prime lending rate, currently at 6 1/2 percent.
Coming on a day when the Government reported that producer prices rose a scant two-tenths of a percent last month, the Fed's move could not have been timed much better, analysts said. But some questioned whether the cut in rates, the 17th since December 1989, would have much of an impact.
"No one can say they are fanning inflation," Mr. Beck said, "because the inflation numbers are good and are expected to stay that way."
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation, said the sluggishness currently enveloping the economy could not be easily cured by ever-lower interest rates.
"There is a lack of credit extension" by banks and other lenders, he said, "and there is a restructuring going on in labor markets. These things tend to keep conditions sluggish, and monetary policy is not a tool meant to fight those restraints. This cut in rates doesn't change my view of the economy one iota."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10122/32 , up 5/8 point, to yield 7.85 percent, compared with 7.90 percent late Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 7/32 , up 18/32 , to yield 7.31 percent. The 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 101 10/32 , up 21/32 , to yield 6.56 percent. And prices of the 5 3/4 percent two-year notes rose by 3/8 point, to 101 1/4, to yield 5.07 percent.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.65 percent late yesterday, down 18 basis points, or 18 one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 20 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.73 percent. And one-year bill rates plunged by 21 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.89 percent.
The big day in the government market overshadowed the first sale of a 50-year bond in the investment-grade corporate bond market since 1988, and the first ever issued by a Government agency.
The $500 million worth of 50-year bonds was part of a $1 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
The bonds, which mature April 15, 2042, are callable in 20 years. The 8 1/4 percent securities were priced at $96.935 to yield 8.515 percent, 58 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021.
The most recent 50-year bond was sold in 1988 by Swedish Export Credit, a Swedish Government export agency.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are not rated by either Moody's Investors Service or by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Despite the length of the maturity, the 50-year bonds sold out quickly.
"We didn't buy it because we are bullish on interest rates," said Greg Smith, a partner at Brinson Partners Inc., a Chicago money management firm with $7 billion in fixed-income assets under management. "We bought it because it looks like good value to us."
The strong rally in the Treasury securities market helped to push up prices of corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds outstanding.
Corporate bond traders said prices of most issues rose by 3/8 point to 1/2 point.
Meanwhile, prices of widely quoted tax-exempt municipal bonds rose by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.

Mexican Stock's Underpinnings

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE largest construction company in Mexico became a hot new stock issue in the United States yesterday, largely on the basis of profits that will not be realized for many years, if ever, but that were reported as having been earned last year.
Empresas ICA Sociedad Controladora went public at $17 per American depository share. That was above the range of $14 to $16 that the company said it would seek when it filed to go public last month, but it did not begin to describe the investor interest in the company, commonly known as ICA. The shares traded as high as $20.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading, before dropping back to $19.75. 
 Big Board volume in ICA came to 6.8 million shares, or nearly as many as the 8.4 million shares that were sold in the American offering. A total of 25 million shares were offered, with 8.3 million sold in Mexico and the remainder in other countries. The lead underwriter of the United States portion was Morgan Stanley & Company.
For buyers, the deal was a chance to get into an established company in Mexico, where the stock market has been booming and where the economy is growing at a steady clip. ICA's closing price yesterday was 16 times reported earnings of $1.22 a share last year.
ICA has been in business since 1947, but its recent boom in revenues began in 1990, when revenues, as measured in pesos adjusted for inflation, leaped 79 percent. Then last year they soared another 34 percent, to the equivalent of $1.4 billion. Reported net earnings in 1991 were $92 million, nearly 10 times higher than in 1990.
That surge in revenues and profits reflects the Mexican Government's innovative way of getting public-works projects built. It puts out for competitive bids such projects as highways and bridges, and awards concessions to companies that agree to build them and then charge tolls, until the construction costs and reasonable profits have been recovered. Then, ownership of the road will revert to the Mexican Government.
Rather than wait until the tolls roll in to post the profits, ICA reports them as soon as it spends the money to build the highway. Last year, 44 percent of the company's reported profits came from such earnings. The company's accountants approved that treatment because the tolls are set by Government regulators, under a contract with the company.
The potential problems with such contracts concern cost overruns and the possibility that toll revenues will not be up to forecasts. In such cases, the company must go back to the Mexican Government to try to get a revised deal, effectively allowing it either to charge higher tolls or to charge them for a longer period of time.
So far, the company has completed two construction projects under such deals, and in each case there has been problems. "Construction of the Plan de Barrancas Highway involved substantial cost overruns as a consequence of difficulties with the terrain not contemplated by the specifications," the company's prospectus states. At a highway designed to bypass Tampico, the cost overruns were blamed on "design adjustments necessitated, in particular, by pressure from conservation groups."
Those overruns are substantial. Costs exceeded budget by 73 percent on the Plan de Barrancas Highway and 51 percent on the Tampico bypass. Those overruns did not damage reported profits. On all its concession business in 1991, the company reported profits that came to 39 percent of revenues, a far higher profit margin than on other construction business.
In addition, fewer travelers than expected have paid the tolls on each road.
ICA "currently is seeking to renegotiate these concessions to have the Mexican Government provide the additional funds necessary to permit the company to recoup its cost overruns and to grant the company an extension of the original terms of these concessions," the prospectus states. It does not detail the financial repercussions of a failure to get a new deal.
Concessions are far from the largest part of ICA's business, which ranges from owning Sheraton and Radisson hotels to building the Mexico City subway, but they have recently provided a big piece of the reported profits. Buyers of the stock are clearly betting that the Mexican Government will continue to be friendly in negotiating and renegotiating concessions, and will not decide to take a hard line regarding who should pay for cost overruns.
Notwithstanding the fact that the company has already booked the profits, ICA does say that things could go wrong. "There can be no assurance," the prospectus states, "that the company will be able to realize its anticipated return or recover its equity investment."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up Modestly Again

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
The prices received by American producers edged up two-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month in March, suggesting that inflation remains under control, Labor Department figures showed today.
The results, which meant that the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods advanced in the first quarter at an annual rate of just seven-tenths of 1 percent, appeared to contribute to a move by the Federal Reserve to further ease monetary policy to try to solidify an economic recovery. 
 Another Government report, meanwhile, showed that the number of newly laid off workers making trips to unemployment offices fell 24,000 in the last week of March, to 432,000. The drop from the previous week was somewhat bigger than had been expected and followed two straight weekly increases. The improvement was led by Michigan, which reported that unemployment claims fell by 7,500 as a result of fewer layoffs in the auto industry.
In a third report, the Commerce Department said businesses planned to increase spending for new plants and equipment by 4.6 percent this year, down from 5.4 percent reported in the previous survey.
The March rise in producer prices reflected a five-tenths of 1 percent decline in food costs, as the price of vegetables retreated after a surge in February because of floods in Texas and California. This was offset by a 1.2 percent increase in energy costs, the biggest increase since an identical one in October.
On Friday, the Government is to report on consumer prices for March, with analysts expecting figures similar to today's. For the year, they expect an increase of 3.5 percent, compared with 3.1 percent for 1991.
"We are forecasting good inflation news, lasting probably until 1994," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting company.
In addition to a 2.1 percent drop in vegetable prices, which came after a 26 percent jump in February, fruit prices were down 3.8 percent last month, with prices also falling for eggs, beef and turkey.
The increase in energy prices reflected a rise of 1.1 percent for gasoline and a 1.2 percent climb in prices for electricity, natural gas and home heating oil.
 
Little Pressure in Other Areas
 Excluding the erratic food and energy sectors, producer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent, the Government reported.
Car prices climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, while tobacco prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent. Higher prices were also registered for light trucks, shoes and prescription drugs.
Nor was there any significant inflation pressure at the earlier stages of production. Intermediate goods, like a bolt or cloth or a sack of flour, showed no change in March after a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in February and a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in January. Crude goods dropped 1.5 percent, nearly erasing a rise of 1.7 percent in February.
The finished goods index now stands at 122 compared with 121.9 in February. That means a market basket of goods that cost $10 in 1982 now costs $12.20.

HEADLINE: First Union Bank Reports Record First-Quarter Profits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., a leading bank in the Southeast and the 13th largest in the nation, said yesterday that it earned a record first-quarter profit as its problems with bad loans fell sharply.
First Union's results were stronger than analysts are predicting for other large banks, mostly because First Union's home markets in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia have not suffered as much from the recession as have other regions, particularly the Northeast. 
 First Union also benefited from a reduction in expenses, a trend that is widespread in the industry, particularly among banks that are closing branches and computer centers following mergers.
"For many banks in the Southeast, I expect there will be a gradual reduction in write-offs of bad loans as the year progresses, but in other parts of the country, improvement will be harder to find," said John Mason, a banking analyst at the Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation, a securities firm in Charlotte.
Many bankers and analysts also expect that improvement in bank profits will be erratic. Although delinquent loans are not rising as rapidly as in the last few years, bank profits will be limited by a high level of troubled loans not paying full interest and weak demand for new loans, they say.
First Union's profits in the quarter ended March 31 were $107.9 million, or 81 cents a share, up 33.4 percent from $80.8 million, or 67 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. The gain helped lift the company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.625, up $2.375.
The higher profit reflected a sharp drop in write-offs of bad loans, to $68.8 million, from $107.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1991, and a cut in the amount the company added to its reserve for future loan losses to $83 million from $125.3 million. Holdings of badly delinquent or troubled loans and real estate acquired as a result of foreclosures dropped to $1.18 billion in the first quarter from $1.20 billion in the fourth quarter.
"We feel a lot better about our loan portfolio now than a year ago," said Malcolm Murray, chief credit officer at First Union. He noted that the company lost about $100 million last year from loans for commercial real estate projects outside its home region, but that those problems would not be repeated since the troubled loans have been sold or written off as losses.
Although total loans at First Union were about unchanged at $31.2 billion in the first quarter, Mr. Murray said that demand for new loans from consumers had started to increase.
"Eventually that will spread to the business side," he said, "but for now the increased level of customer inquiries we are seeing has not led to any increase in real live loan applications."
At a time of weak loan demand, First Union and many other banks have been reducing their overhead expenses. In the first quarter, expenses for rent, salaries and other costs totaled $435.8 million, down from $458.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Since acquiring the Southeast Bank of Miami last September, First Union has closed 26 of the 120 branches it expects to close as part of a program to cut costs in Florida by $260 million.

HEADLINE: Chip Indicator Drops Slightly

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 9

 BODY:
Orders for computer chips reached a record high in March, but were balanced by a strong increase in shipments, which caused the semiconductor industry's leading indicator to decline slightly, a trade group reported today.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08 for the three-month period that ended in March, down from a revised figure of 1.11 in February and 1.09 in January. 
 The ratio compares orders with shipments and is considered a leading indicator of the industry's performance. A ratio of 1.08 indicates that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $108 was ordered. A ratio above 1 indicates that demand is increasing.
Average monthly orders in the three-month period that ended in March, at $1.53 billion, were up 3.4 percent from $1.48 billion in the period that ended in February, and 10.5 percent higher than the comparable figure a year earlier.
Average monthly shipments in the three-month period ended in March totaled $1.42 billion, up 6.5 percent from February's figure of $1.33 billion. At $1.65 billion, actual domestic market shipments in March were up 26.2 percent from February's $1.31 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Plunges as Fed Acts; Price of Gold Rises in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday after the Federal Reserve signaled that it was pushing interest rates lower.
Gold prices climbed on American markets after moving mostly lower overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $339.50 a troy ounce, up $1.60 from Wednesday's settlement of $337.90. Later, the Republic National Bank in New York quoted an ounce of gold bullion at $339.40, or $1.85 higher than Wednesday's late bid. 
 The Fed added money to the banking system just before noon, as European foreign exchange trading was almost done. The plunge in the dollar was exaggerated because currency trading volume was light, as usual for that hour, dealers said.
"The market reacted pretty violently," said Kevin Lawrie, chief currency dealer for the Bank of Boston. "It wasn't a very good time for that to happen. It happened in a thin market."
Falling American interest rates usually depress the dollar. Reduced rates cut returns on dollar-based holdings and tend to erode demand for the American currency.
Mr. Lawrie said trading in the dollar calmed as the afternoon progressed and the currency seemed to find adequate support at lower levels.
The British pound strengthened against most major currencies as British voters held a national election. The pound was pushed higher by speculation that the Conservative party was leading the opposition Labor party.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7635, from $1.7480 late Wednesday. Later in New York, a pound fetched $1.7665, compared with $1.7500 a day earlier.
The dollar began its world trading day without taking a decisive direction. In Tokyo, the dollar ended unchanged, at 132.70 yen.
But after the Fed acted, the dollar dived, and late in London it was quoted at 132.15 yen. It fell even further in New York, closing at 132.05 yen, down from 132.65 yen Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's late levels, were: 1.6165 German marks, down from 1.6270; 1.4860 Swiss francs, down from 1.4950; 5.4775 French francs, down from 5.5110; 1,221.00 Italian lire, down from 1,227.00, and 1.187555 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18925.
At New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at $4.105 a troy ounce, up from $4.078 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Advertisers Urged to Battle Practice of Trade Promotion

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla.

 BODY:
THE advertising industry, already fighting foes ranging from recession to mediocre creative output, is being urged to battle another villain, one portrayed as a masterful pickpocket.
At the 74th annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies here yesterday, Robert L. James, chairman and chief executive of McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York, sought to stir his colleagues with a call to arms against a practice known as trade promotion. 
 "More and more money is getting pulled permanently out of marketing communications and getting parked inside the vague, unmeasurable nether world of trade promotion," said Mr. James, the incoming chairman of the Four A's, as the national agency trade organization is called.
His crusade is aimed at recapturing for his industry some of the estimated $150 billion that consumer product marketers pay retailers annually to buy, stock and display their products. For example, a beer company may pay a supermarket chain to put up a special display near the checkout, or a drug company may pay drugstores to carry a new pain reliever, despite their reluctance to add another product.
That expenditure is about the same amount estimated to be spent annually on promotions aimed at consumers -- and $25 billion more than is spent annually on the traditional types of advertising campaigns that agencies create.
Trade promotions are self-destructive, Mr. James asserted, because "if you don't spend money to advertise brands, over time you are going to weaken those brands."
"Less marketing dollars available for advertising means less media advertising," he added. "When media advertising goes down, market share also goes down. Then the ad agency gets blamed because the market share has declined."
And that hurts the manufacturers as well as their agencies, he continued: "If a retailer realizes that he can get more money from a manufacturer now, what's to stop that retailer from doing more of the same in the future?"
Mr. James took pains to differentiate trade promotions that involve cash or discount incentives directly from manufacturers to retailers from other programs "enlisting the support and cooperation of the retail trade." The latter, he said, are "indisputably of paramount importance in marketing," while the former, he added, are "dangerous."
One reason trade promotion is more prevalent was described by John O'Toole, president and chief executive of the Four A's.
"There are too many brands," he said in a speech preceding that of Mr. James: for instance, 1,300 brands of shampoo, 200 brands of cereal and 250 of soft drinks.
As a result, Mr. O'Toole added, "the trade can charge almost anything it chooses in return for a few inches of space on its shelves."
Yet, Mr. O'Toole was even more blunt in his criticism of trade promotions like slotting allowances, by which supermarkets charge marketers for adding new products to their shelves. He called them "forms of extortion."
Both men said the advertising industry's dilemma over trade promotions typified the larger problem of marketers shifting ad dollars out of traditional advertising. Mr. O'Toole complained about Anthony F. J. O'Reilly, chairman and chief executive of the H. J. Heinz Company, who is slashing ad spending and increasing promotional spending after a decade of rising profit margins that followed increased ad spending.
"Tony, it's the Devil's own work you're doing," Mr. O'Toole chided.
Mr. James disclosed results of a pilot research study by the Value of Advertising Committee of the Four A's. Studying 12 well-known brands' ad spending from the 1960's through the 1980's, with spending adjusted for constant dollars, "the results are shocking," Mr. James said, because advertisers were spending less in real dollar terms.
For instance, a dry soup brand that reduced ad spending by 20.3 percent saw its market share plunge 54.7 percent, Mr. James said, and a salad dressing that cut ad spending by 26.6 percent saw its market share drop by 44.9 percent. The study showed that the 12 brands cut their ad spending by an average of 12.4 percent in real dollars, which resulted in a 19.9 percent decline in market share.
Mr. James said he could not disclose the names of the brands involved in the study, which the Four A's hopes to continue. But "when we realized what brands they were," he added, "and who the manufacturers were, we were really, really shocked."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Deadlines Come And Deadlines Go In N.H.L. Talks

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
Face-to-face discussions are expected to resume today between John Ziegler, president of the National Hockey League, and Bob Goodenow, executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association, which has been on strike against team owners since April 1.
After a 3 P.M. deadline imposed by Ziegler had passed without the hockey season's being declared finished, Ziegler told team owners in a conference call yesterday that Goodenow would come to New York today to continue talks, which broke off on Tuesday as both sides turned down each others' most recent proposals. Goodenow and Ziegler spoke by phone several times yesterday. 
 "Mr. Goodenow and I have communicated, and we are to have further communications through the course of this evening and early morning period," Ziegler said in a statement released by an aide at the Plaza Hotel. "At this time, there is nothing specific or further that I am able to report."
The discussions today are not to be considered formal negotiations, according to Paul Costello, a spokesman for the union.
 
'There Will Be No Winners'
 Meanwhile, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service stepped up its effort to bring the sides together. Bernard E. DeLury, the director of the agency, sent a letter to both Goodenow and Ziegler that said in part: "I am compelled to attempt to bring you together in a final effort to work out your differences. This is the final period in hockey's most important match and there will be no winners if you don't take the ice."
The strike began on April 1, postponing the last five days of the regular season and the Stanley Cup playoffs, which were to begin on Wednesday. The post-season tournament, which involves 16 teams and lasts four rounds, was scheduled to end in early June. If the season resumes, it is likely that the championship could not be concluded until mid-June.
Among the major issues still unresolved are free-agent mobility, distribution of revenue from trading cards, the length of the agreement and the use of money from a pension-fund surplus.
Both sides held lengthy conference calls yesterday to discuss possible solutions. After the union's morning conference call, several teams met among themselves in the afternoon and many players postponed plans to leave their team cities and head back to their off-season homes.
William Wirtz, the owner of the Chicago Blackhawks and chairman of the board of governors, canceled an evening press conference at which he was to explain the ticket-refund policy.
Norman Green, owner of the Minnesota North Stars, said Goodenow had initiated the new discussions.
"For those of us eager for the playoffs to carry on, this is good news, depending on what Mr. Goodenow has to offer," Green said. "The most encouraging thing is that a lot of us have heard that the players are really eager to get back to work and that Mr. Goodenow is responding to those opinions. Where there's a will, there's a way."
 
Owners Want a Salary Cap
 Green said that "there's nothing more that John has been authorized to offer" and that the owners wanted a salary cap, although it isn't a precondition for a settlement.
Among the reports that continued to circulate last night were that the players were willing to agree to a shorter contract if both sides were willing to submit to binding arbitition on the unsettled issues and language that guarantees no lockouts and no collusion against them.
Arthur Griffiths, vice chairman of the Vancouver Canucks, said "I hope this isn't another roller-coaster ride. Let's keep our fingers crossed."
 
Sentiment for a Settlement
 Barry Shenkaro, owner of the Winnipeg Jets, said some owners suggested during yesterday's conference call that Ziegler be given more power to complete a deal. That was rejected, said Shenkarow, who is a member of the owners' negotiating committee.
"There's a lot of will to try to do a deal," he said. "A substantial majority would like to see a deal, but we don't know how to do one."
Marcel Aubut, owner of the Quebec Nordiques, said: "There is no agreement in sight and nothing to indicate that we are on the verge of ending this dispute."
Neil Smith, general manager of the Rangers, the team with the best record this season and the most to lose should the playoffs be called off, had mixed feelings about the situation.
"I've learned not to be anything but numb," Smith said. "Every time I'm optimistic, something pessimistic happens and the other way around, too."
Donald Fehr, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said "what has happened recently suggests that the hockey owners are making an attempt either to destroy or to destroy the effectiveness of the N.H.L.P.A. and that is their primary goal.
"Getting an agreement and resuming the season is secondary to that," Fehr said. "Some people might call it 'union-busting.' I've used the term myself. I say that because what seems to be reasonably clear is that every time the players took a step toward them, they took a step either backwards or sideways."
Fehr went on to ridicule Ziegler's contention that the players must agree to salary limitations to protect the owners from spending themselves out of business as they compete with each other for talent.
"The notion that somehow, with a totally free market, you can end up paying more in the aggregate than what the players' market value is, is sort of contrary to the central thesis of economics," he said. "The owners could have made a deal more favorable to the owners than anyone else has in any sport. And they didn't take it. Instead, they found new issues and stepped sideways and raised this idiotic licensing issue. The conclusion seems to be that their interests are in other than making a deal."
Fehr said he has communicated with Goodenow on a regular basis, but said he has not advised him on strike stratgegy.
"Absolutely not," Fehr said. "I don't give him suggestions on collective-bargaining proposals. We try, at his request, to give him the benefit of whatever experience we have had that is relevant." He said such interaction between sports union is commonplace.

Two Leading Candidates
The list of candidates to succeed J. Carter Brown as director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington is getting shorter. After the initial round of interviews ended last week, the two favored names seem to be John Walsh Jr., director of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., and Earl A. Powell 3d, director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a number of museum officials say. 
 Franklin D. Murphy, the chairman of the gallery's board, said in a telephone interview this week that he hoped an announcement would be made after the trustees meet on May 1. Mr. Murphy said he had disqualified himself from the search committee because he was also a trustee of both the Getty and the Los Angeles County Museum.
Speculation about a new director began on Jan. 24, the day Mr. Brown shocked the art world with his resignation, saying he wanted to become involved in various activities, at Brown University and elsewhere. And it hasn't stopped. Everyone from museum curators to prominent collectors and auction-house experts has an opinion on a successor, although few are willing to talk for attribution. At first, the favored candidates were thought to include Edmund P. Pillsbury, director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth and founding director of the Yale Center for British Art, who turned down an offer to become the director of the National Gallery in London a few years ago, and Roger Mandle, currently the deputy director of the National Gallery in Washington. Also on the list were John Wilmerding, who was deputy director of the National Gallery in Washington for five years and is now a professor of American art at Princeton University; Anne d'Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and James N. Wood, director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
"We're working as diligently as possible," said Ruth Carter Stevenson, a trustee of the gallery, who is married to John R. Stevenson, the gallery's president and chairman of its search committee. "But so far no decision has been made."
Among those candidates who would comment on the selection process, Mr. Wood said he had withdrawn his name from the race early on. "I was asked whether I wanted to be considered for the job, and I was flattered," he said. "Although it was a hard decision, I had to say no. I'm halfway through something here in Chicago, and I want to see it through the next stage." He was referring to the Art Institute's renovation and expansion plan.
Mr. Wilmerding said he had also declined the museum's overtures. "I indicated at the outset it was not for me," he said. "The timing is just not right. With my involvement as a visiting curator at the Met and my teaching responsibilities -- I've just gotten my first group of graduate students rolling -- it would be irresponsible to leave now. Besides, Washington is a very different place now than it was when Carter began as director, and it's going to be a very different kind of directorship."
Mr. Pillsbury said: "I was told last week that I am still a candidate, but I am not being invited back for a second interview. Actions speak louder than words." He also said the recent emergence of Mr. Walsh's name had puzzled many people. "That he would be prepared to abandon the Getty midstream, before the new building opens, is surprising," Mr. Pillsbury said, referring to plans for a new $500 million building complex in Brentwood, Calif., scheduled to be completed in 1996. Through the press office at the Getty, Mr. Walsh declined to comment.
The new director will be just the fourth in the gallery's 50-year history. It is a coveted position. In his more than two decades as director, Mr. Brown expanded the gallery from a quiet museum into a complex institution with an international reputation for its full schedule of shows and scholarly programs. Mr. Brown was also a successful fund-raiser and was able to attract donations through his impeccable social connections. (He is a member of a prominent family from Providence, R.I., and is a descendant of the family for whom Brown University was named.) At a time when money is scarcer, a new director will need to be at least as adept at raising money.
That's something Mr. Walsh "doesn't have to do at the Getty," said one prominent museum expert, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. "But John is low-key, and that's what the board may want now, since the era of the blockbuster is certainly a thing of the past."
 
Dispute Over Signature
 Two of the world's leading experts on prints are locked in a complex legal battle over the authenticity of the signature on an impression of Picasso's famous 1935 print "The Minotauromachie."
In June 1990, the New York dealer David P. Tunick bought the work for $1.68 million from Galerie Kornfeld, a well-respected auction house in Bern, Switzerland. Now Mr. Tunick says museum experts and other colleagues who have seen the print are certain the signature is fake. Eberhard Kornfeld, owner of the auction house and a Picasso expert himself, insists it is genuine and has even offered to exchange it for his own version of the print, whose authenticity is not in question. He says Mr. Tunick is trying to get out of the deal.
The incident has led to lawsuits on both sides of the Atlantic. Sixteen months after the purchase, Mr. Tunick filed suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan, citing fraud; reckless misrepresentation; breach of duty, honesty and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary dealings. He has asked for his money back, along with punitive damages of $20 million. Mr. Kornfeld is also suing Mr. Tunick in Switzerland for the money he is still owed.
"I arrived in Bern the day before the sale, and when I first saw the print I questioned Kornfeld about the signature," Mr. Tunick said. "It was partially erased and seemed odd. But he said he personally guaranteed it. And since Kornfeld is an acknowledged expert on Picasso and has been a longtime friend, I believed him."
Eight months later, in February 1991, the print was the centerpiece of Mr. Tunick's booth at the annual Art Show in Manhattan. It was priced at $2 million and did not sell. Then, in October, Mr. Tunick said, a highly respected and important curator, whom he refused to identify, dropped into his gallery, saw the print and questioned the signature. "Over the weekend we photographed the signature, and on Monday I took it around to about 12 other experts, everyone from museum curators to auctioneers and dealers," he recalled. "Some literally laughed when they saw it. Virtually all of them expressed serious doubts that the signature was by Picasso." Mr. Tunick said he Had also consulted an archive of about 800 Picasso signatures from the 1930's and 40's.
By this time, Mr. Tunick said, he had already given Mr. Kornfeld $1.3 million to $1.4 million of the purchase price in cash and property. In a meeting in Mr. Tunick's office on Oct. 8, the dealer said, he confronted Mr. Kornfeld. The two disagree about what transpired at the meeting, but they do agree that Mr. Tunick declined when Mr. Kornfeld offered his own impression of the print. Mr. Tunick explained that he could not in good conscience go back to his clients with another impression of the print. "They'd think these things grow on trees," Mr. Tunick said.
Mr. Kornfeld said: "I offered him my own print not as a sign of weakness, but as confirmation that the print he bought at auction was right. It was his decision to buy the work in the first place and now it appears, 16 months after the auction, he refuses to pay for it."
Mr. Tunick said: "He thinks he's the Teflon auctioneer, that he's untouchable. Actually, Kornfeld is trying to divert the focus from the real issue: that the signature is false."
 
12 Nicholson Paintings

"If I could have sold real estate, I would have," said Eddy G. Nicholson, the New Hampshire-based collector who made headlines in the 1980's for paying record prices for American furniture and art. "But in this economy it's impossible." Mr. Nicholson owns Granite Partners Ltd., a concern based in Hampton, N.H., that acquires ailing companies and turns them around. "Today's environment offers tremendous business opportunities for me right now," he said.
To increase the company's investing capital, Mr. Nicholson has decided to sell 12 paintings from his private collection at Christie's in New York on May 28. He is also selling eight pieces of his American furniture and eight pieces of 18th-century American silver at Christie's June sales in New York. "We chose things that were fresh to the market and that wouldn't create a gap in our collection," Mr. Nicholson said. Among the works being sold are two paintings by Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait: "Trappers Following the Trail: At Fault" (1852), expected to sell for $350,000 to $450,000, and "Ruffed Grouse Shooting or Flushed" (1857), which is expected to bring $250,000 to $350,000. He is also selling Thomas Birch's "Commodore Perry Leaving the Lawrence for the Niagara at the Battle of Lake Erie," dating from the first half of the 19th century, which is expected to fetch $250,000 to $350,000.
"It wasn't easy deciding what to sell," Mr. Nicholson said.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Who Keeps Score on Commissioner? The Owners

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
The words were so remarkably similar they prompted instant recollection of the first time they were heard. Criticizing the head of the National Hockey League Players Association recently, the head of the owners' board of governors said that the strike leader had miscalculated the stance of the owners.
For the last decade, Bowie Kuhn, who as baseball commissioner presided over a 50-day players' strike in 1981, has said that the players miscalculated the resolve of the owners that year. The owners' resolve, in reality, was such that as soon as their $50 million worth of strike insurance ran out, they capitulated, and the players ended their strike. 
 Kuhn, who miscalculated the resolve of the players and in turn was scorned by them, had his critics among the owners during his 15 1/2-year tenure, but except for the times he came up for re-election or extension, no one kept a running score of his popularity among the owners. As long as Walter O'Malley was alive, scoreboard watching would have been meaningless because the Dodgers' powerful owner kept his colleagues in line.
Scoreboard watching, on the other hand, seems to have become a popular pastime during Fay Vincent's term as commissioner. Periodically through his two and a half years in office, Vincent has been the subject of articles quoting owners -- always anonymously -- saying that he is unpopular among his employers and will not serve beyond his present term. Some even have said he would not complete the term.
In recent months, three lawyers involved in baseball have commented in separate conversations that Vincent was finished, that he had lost the respect of the owners and had become a figurehead. Upon checking closer, it was determined that their view stemmed from information from one person: Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago White Sox.
Reinsdorf declined to discuss his view of Vincent, but he is known in ownership circles to be critical of the commissioner.
"It's not appropriate for me to discuss the commissioner, to praise or knock him," Reinsdorf said in a telephone interview. "If I were giving him A's or F's, it wouldn't be appropriate."
Other owners, however, identified Reinsdorf as Vincent's No. 1 critic. These owners said Reinsdorf has failed to generate more than minimal support for his position, and that primarily from Bud Selig of Milwaukee.
Selig, who did not return a telephone call seeking comment, is the chairman of the Player Relations Committee's board of directors, and Reinsdorf is a member. They were instrumental in hiring Richard Ravitch last November as the owners' chief labor representative, a move that prompted additional speculation about Vincent's position.
A recent assessment in a national magazine noted that "the owners already think so little of Vincent" they gave Ravitch a higher salary -- $750,000 -- than the commissioner's -- $650,000. But the problem in that economic blunder wasn't that the owners thought so little of Vincent; they just didn't think.
"I don't think anyone was paying any attention to it when Ravitch was hired," said one owner who was not involved in the hiring. "You know how tidy baseball is."
Reinsdorf said the Player Relations Committee had given Ravitch $750,000 because "that's what it took to hire him and we didn't have jurisdiction over the commissioner's salary."
"It's up to the clubs to raise the commissioner's salary if they want," Reinsdorf said.
The clubs are doing that, but even here Reinsdorf has acted in a way contrary to the view of the other owners.
At their last meeting, in Chicago last month, the owners delegated the executive council, which includes four owners from each league, to put the salaries in the proper order. But while the National League voted unanimously to leave it up to the council, the American League, at Reinsdorf's urging, said it wanted to retain the right to approve whatever the council did.
"Reinsdorf challenges everything relating to Vincent," one member of the council said.
Vincent declined to discuss his status or the Reinsdorf matter. "I'm not going to talk about those things publicly," he said.
In January, when controversy arose over the proposed sale of the Seattle Mariners to a Japanese-led group, Vincent didn't even react when his statement opposing the deal was roundly criticized outside baseball. He had stated the owners' policy against foreign ownership -- not his own -- but in the interest of self-preservation, the owners unanimously refrained from comment, leaving Vincent to take the brunt of the criticism from the outside.
Fred Wilpon of the Mets was willing to talk about the commissioner's status. He said the view that Vincent is in trouble stems more from "newspaper and magazine talk," adding, "I don't see that in one-on-one conversations with owners."
What he sees, Wilpon went on, is that "the commissioner and the commissioner's office have done a terrific job for baseball under very difficult times."
"These are very chaotic times," Wilpon said, "and you do find people who are critical. Some of the criticism I've heard of Fay is unfounded. He has had some very difficult and unpopular issues that he decided based on the facts that he had. The man has unusual integrity and intelligence and he applies it for the benefit of baseball."

HEADLINE: A Parade of Musical Offerings for Easter Week

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
EASTER'S musical offerings this year seem not quite so grand as in the recent past: fewer extended works, fewer orchestras and extra musicians. It is not always pleasing when sacred-music programs and economic realities intertwine, but in an imperfect world, they do. Times have been tough, and this year's Easter presentations may reflect smaller music budgets. The situation probably means a little less work for freelance professional musicians.
Big, ambitious doings are not absent, however. Radio City Music Hall's 60th-anniversary "Easter Show" opens tonight and runs through April 23. Rockettes and Easter bunnies are less Christian statements than old pagan rites with a little glitz thrown in: New York show-business versions of nature reawakened and life in bloom. Mankind has been doing things like this for thousands of years, so why not at Radio City? 
 But the Bach Passions are the true theater of Easter. Various other danced and staged events will happen over the week, but without the benefit of stage, props, movement or costumes, Bach's treatments of the gospels according to Matthew and John lead us through the vivid pictures of Holy Week. A tenor is the narrator, singing the gospel in some of Bach's most exposed and difficult music.
The chorus comments and responds in a manner not all that different from the ancient Greek format. Sometimes the chorus takes part in the play, for example when the mobs call for Christ's execution. Soloists sing elaborate commentary as well, sometimes as anguished bystanders, sometimes as those reflecting back on history. Both pieces will be part of this Easter in New York City.
At the St. Jean Baptiste Church on the Upper East Side, the season begins solemnly today when the Amor Artis Chorus and Chamber Orchestra under Jane Hettrick and a set of soloists that includes John Ostendorf sing Gluck, Salieri and Haydn. At Carnegie Hall tomorrow night, Musica Sacra under Richard Westenburg performs Bach's "St. Matthew Passion."
Indeed, some of the most substantial Easter celebrations will be in secular settings. On Monday night at Carnegie Hall, Robert Shaw leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus in Handel's "Messiah." At 2 P.M. on Easter Sunday, Haydn's "Seven Last Words of Christ," a series of profoundly modest slow movements, takes place at the New School for Social Research in Greenwich Village. Alexander Schneider, Isidore Cohen, Steven Tenenbom and Laurence Lesser make up Haydn's string quartet. Schuyler Chapin will read the texts.
Bach's less frequently played but darkly imposing "St. John Passion" returns to a church setting on two occasions next week. Performances with orchestra come on Palm Sunday from St. Paul's Chapel in lower Manhattan and then on Good Friday from Grace Church in the Village. Easter Sunday will bring Bach's long and difficult "Easter Oratorio," in a performance at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church on the West Side, with choir, soloists and orchestra.
The vast spaces of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Morningside Heights lend themselves to theater as well. Maundy Thursday will bring the premiere of Nora Gibson's "Women at the Cross" with dancing and singing. On Good Friday in the same church, a series of stagings take place: at noon, the medieval drama "Planctus Mariae," and in the evening at 8, a program that includes Schutz's "Seven Last Words of Christ."
The darker, more reticent weekday vigils preceding Easter will be prefaced on Palm Sunday afternoon at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church when Mr. Westenburg leads an afternoon of Mozart's liturgical music. Then on Tuesday, St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue offers early English music, and on Maundy Thursday augments it with Kodaly, Durufle and Poulenc. Trinity Church in lower Manhattan and St. John the Divine on Thursday sing Gesualdo's arresting vocal music. Josquin and Tallis from the past and Messiaen from the present are spread across Thursday offerings at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, the Church of the Ascension in the Village and St. Ignatius Church on West End Avenue. Good Friday is a quieter day of mourning in the Christian calendar, but both at the Church of the Holy Apostles at the General Theological Seminary in Chelsea and at Corpus Christi Church on West 121st Street, William Byrd's "St. John Passion" will be sung. Saturday's vigils will be even quieter.
The major-key mood of Easter Sunday will bring out drums and brass. Calvary Episcopal Church on Park Avenue South performs 20th-century Americans like Calvin Hampton, Lee Hoiby and Randall Thompson. Christ and St. Stephen's on the Upper West Side adds the music of another modern American, Ned Rorem.
At the other end of the stylistic spectrum will be the period-instrument orchestra that plays for Easter services at the Church of St. Luke in the Fields in the Village. At the Church of the Intercession in Washington Heights, the traditional "Hallelujah" Chorus will be supported by the Harlem Festival Brass Ensemble.
The Passion performances offer the greatest promise, along with the "Messiah" at Carnegie Hall (if you can get in; it is nominally sold out, but a few return tickets may be available). The Haydn will in body be far removed from the church; in spirit it is intensely religious music, thoughtful, quiet and deeply moving.

HEADLINE: False Fears About Japan's Crash

 BODY:
When the Japanese stock market plummeted 10 percent earlier this week, fear struck Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged nearly 100 points in two days and Americans wondered whether Main Street would be next.
The answer to such fears, to use the reigning cliche from the movie "Wayne's World," is, NOT!
For starters, Japanese stock prices have been falling steadily since 1989 with little discernible impact outside Japan. Indeed, the Japanese economy continues to grow. And even if falling stock prices force Wall Street prices down, the impact on U.S. production won't be noticeable. 
 Think back to 1987. U.S. stock prices plunged 508 points in a single day, yet the economy grew steadily thereafter. The Federal Reserve knows how to insulate Main Street from Wall Street.
Even plausible worst-case outcomes shouldn't be nervous-making. Some observers fear that Japanese investors, especially banks, will replenish sagging domestic portfolios by "pulling their money out." That might sound worrisome, but it's not.
Suppose Japanese investors sell real estate and other U.S. assets. They'd first deposit the dollar proceeds in a U.S. bank and then sell the dollars for yen. All that would do is drive the value of the dollar lower, making American exports cheaper, and therefore more attractive, to foreign buyers. And that would be a welcome boost to a recession-plagued U.S. economy.
The United States might have little to fear from Japan's stock market meltdown, but neither does it have much to gain. Americans are often told that Japan's success threatens our own. The truth is closer to the opposite: If the Japanese economy sags -- which is far from certain despite the market decline -- the U.S. is likely to lose export sales. And as Japanese banks are forced to retrench, they might withdraw loans from U.S. borrowers.
But neither of these impacts is likely to be large. Export and capital markets are worldwide. If Japan stumbles, there are plenty of others to help pick up the slack. Stock market crashes can be traumatic. But, as events here and abroad in recent years have shown, they don't need to be economically crippling.

HEADLINE: The Voters, Yes. But Which Ones?

 BODY:
Paul Tsongas honored principle and not just reality yesterday when he said "no, thanks" to the Democratic Presidential race for the second time. The first time, in March, he suspended a candidacy he had launched himself. The one he gave up yesterday was created subsequently by The Voters.
By declining now to pursue a candidacy that would inevitably look personally opportunistic, Mr. Tsongas keeps attention fastened on his sober economic message and recognizes the perils of flattering self-deception. 
 Tuesday's New York primary voters put him back in the spotlight by giving him, a non-candidate, an astonishing second-place finish behind Bill Clinton and ahead of Jerry Brown. That improved even on the support Connecticut gave him March 24, when he drained away enough protest vote to give Mr. Brown a narrow victory.
All this encouragement might have tempted a less principled candidate. What more tempting invitation than one directly from The Voters? But Mr. Tsongas, committed to getting his message across, understands that there are voters and there are voters.
The people who supported him so warmly on Tuesday were, for one thing, not particularly representative of Democrats elsewhere. Indeed, there were striking differences even between them and New York primary voters in 1988. This time, one of six voters was black. In 1988 it was one in four. This time, Jewish voters constituted a third of the electorate, in 1988 only a quarter. This time, voters age 60 and over were 36 percent of the electorate, then 30 percent.
Probably the most striking point about The Voters this year in New York is how few there were. Nearly 1.6 million Democrats voted in the 1988 primary. On Tuesday, there were barely a million. The proportion of all eligible citizens voting, which rose to 12 percent in 1988, dropped to a mere 7 percent.
If the differences between one primary and the next are dramatic, consider the contrast between a 7 percent primary election turnout and the 50-plus percent likely to vote in November. People with higher education, those more likely to vote for Mr. Tsongas, constituted 55 percent of Tuesday's voters, compared with 44 percent in the 1988 primary, and only 35 percent in November. It's unclear that he would do as well in a less educated electorate.
Why did so few New York Democrats vote? There's not much point in sermonizing gravely about a pernicious erosion of citizenship. When people care about a candidate, they vote. In 1988, the Rev. Jesse Jackson pulled out a healthy, enthusiastic black vote. In 1992, as non-candidate Tsongas's showing demonstrated, the voters' most passionate desire was to show how much they didn't care for the announced candidates.
Some of the reason for that concerns personalities. More important, these remain tough times, a fact driven home with special force by the fact that taxes are due next Wednesday. And beyond all that, Americans seem disgusted with politics.
Last summer, the Kettering Foundation issued a carefully researched report on the public's reaction "against a political system that is perceived as so autonomous that the public is no longer able to control and direct it. People talk as though our political system had been taken over by alien beings." That message seems to have been ratified by the protests of The Voters, the 7 percent, on Tuesday. The other 93 percent remain to be heard from.

Voters Boot Centrists

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
The results of recent elections in Western Europe and primaries in the U.S. suggest a new, volatile and inward-looking pattern of politics within industrialized democracies.
Voters, from ordinary citizens to skinheads, are angry at mainstream parties for failing to address their problems. They are increasingly turning against both conservative parties long in power and the usual liberal/Socialist alternatives. With the apparent exception of Britain, they are throwing out the bums-in-power without bringing back the familiar bums-in-waiting. 
 Extremists have been the principal beneficiaries. The gainers in Germany, France and Italy represent the far left and right. Protest and fringe candidates have also done relatively well in the U.S. Presidential primaries. Britain's Labor Party picked up votes, but Conservatives seem to be holding onto power by a very narrow margin.
Extremists are far from achieving governmental power, and broader patterns of voter discontent have not yet played themselves out. But even short-run effects are proving troublesome and nasty.
They are forcing the creation of unstable coalitions and coalition-style governments. Britain, despite the Conservative victory, might still end up with some kind of partnership. The ruling Italian coalition, already immobilized, will have to become even broader and more unwieldy to hold power. To run German state governments, Christian Democrats and Social Democrats may have to band together or coalesce separately with fringe parties. French Socialists will also be seeking new partners to retain office next year. Brian Mulroney, the Conservative Prime Minister of Canada, has hit rock bottom in the polls. And there is no telling where Canadian politics will go next.
George Bush will certainly see positive signs for himself in John Major's re-election in Britain. Since World War II the fates of British Conservatives and U.S. Republicans have often run in parallel. Yet the political situation in America remains highly volatile.
In Europe, conservatives and liberals could band with each other to create ruling majorities or governments of national unity. But the present union of Christian Democrats and Socialists in Italy shows this generally does not work.
Center parties, more likely, will align with fringe groups that they think they can tame. But extremists often get the better of the deal on issues that concern them. Patrick Buchanan has tugged President Bush rightward. In Germany and France Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand are already sounding anti-immigrant notes. Italy's Christian Democrats will need to accommodate the northern-based Lombardy League's growing appeal to separatism from the Mafia-dominated South.
Separatist, nationalist and racist themes could play havoc with commitments to Western European union. And they certainly will make it harder to bridge the gaps between the ex-Communist East and the West. As for the environmentalist parties rising now in Italy and France, their focus is narrow and their impact still unclear. Greens have already forced a halt in French nuclear testing.
All too clear is that the narrow nationalism of right-wing parties reinforces protectionist pressures. Hard times already make it harder for free-traders to prevail.
Such free-traders and free-marketeers -- first Margaret Thatcher, then Ronald Reagan and Helmut Kohl -- ushered in more than a decade of triumphant conservatism. Now, cold war successes fading in the gloom of economic stagnation, their tide is running out. It is being superseded by eddies of public anger and uncertainty, carrying frightened leaders of mainstream parties inward and down.
It is possible, of course, that leaders of these conservative and liberal parties will take voters' cries to heart and shape up. But most familiar power-holding and power-seeking parties are led by a bunch of tired old politicians, whose minds appear untouched by new ideas and whose actions lack confidence and courage.
The voters, for all their sublime ignorance of issues and candidates' stands, do very well at smelling the stench of decay. Their ballots here and abroad ring with one message to mainstreamers everywhere: You are beginning to stink.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Missile-Mongering

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
First, fellow students of journalism, I want to thank the truth squad of military specialists, outside and inside the Pentagon, who helped me achieve victory over the mighty column-writing team of Evans and Novak.
You will, I trust, remember my investigative reporting on a column by Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. Their story was that the Israelis were trying to sell to China an Israeli air-to-surface missile called STAR. 
 But, said Evans-Novak, STAR is an Israeli steal from a hush-hush American missile called HAVE NAP. They reported that HAVE NAP was equipped with technology to make it "stealthy" and was so important that on the very first day of the Persian Gulf war it was dropped on Iraq from B-52's in a secret mission.
The story outraged military experts not merely because it was one more example of anti-Israeli "leaks" from the Administration to receptive journalists, but because it was so full of Errors and Nofacts that it offended their professional dignity.
So, after checking, I reported that HAVE NAP was not stealthy, that it had not been dropped on Iraq and that the missile had been created, of all places, in Israel -- where it is cabalistically known as Popeye. It is now produced in the U.S. and, coup de grace, jointly by Israel and America.
Evans-Novak sputtered their way through two more columns of trying to salvage their reputation as military scoopists. With each sput they entwined themselves in further error, fury and slur. So let us leave them, gurgling, but with one remark about their story ringing bell-like over American journalism. It was made by Brig. Gen. Buster Glosson, top air war planner during the war, as reported in Defense Week: "Unadulterated bull[excrement]."
But a real problem remains. Stories like STAR-Popeye or the lie about the Israeli sale of Patriots obscure the real missile danger from China.
A clear look is taken in a report by the International Missile Proliferation Project of the Monterey Institute of International Studies. Written by Timothy V. McCarthy, it comes to these conclusions:
1. China is carrying out the world's most comprehensive program of providing "developing" nations with missile know-how.
2. The great danger: Beijing is turning these dictatorships in the Middle East and Asia into missile-producing and missile-transferring states themselves -- North Korea for instance.
3. Chinese missile exports are directed primarily to Mideast or Asian states that have threatened or could threaten the U.S. or its allies.
4. All U.S. diplomatic efforts to restrain Chinese missile exports have failed. American diplomats talk to Chinese diplomats. But the decisions are taken by the web of family-run corporations tied into the Chinese Central Military Commission. Also, as long as the West makes multibillion-dollar arms sales to the Mideast, the Chinese figure they can too.
(And, I believe, Beijing will continue to instruct the U.S. to go to hell as long as President Bush keeps vetoing Congressional legislation to withdraw economic benefits as the price of Chinese missile proliferation and trampling of human rights.)
The report lists scores of cases where Communist China sold missile power to Middle Eastern and Asian dictatorships. Syria emerges as a particular danger -- nearing capability of producing its own Scuds.
The list also details reports of foreign sales to China in the missile field. These include Israeli-Chinese deals other than the phony HAVE NAP and Patriot stories.
By helping China at all, the Israelis are helping the very countries that are aiming all their missiles at Israel.
Israeli officials, Labor and Likud, say Israel needs foreign markets to support its own essential arms industry. True. But national interest and international democratic values dictate sacrificing the Chinese slice of the market because it feeds critical weapons to Mideast dictatorships.
Any country, including the U.S. or Israel, that aids or abets the deliberate Communist Chinese program of missile proliferation helps make more wars more likely.
Yes -- and that goes too for journalists who spread cockamamie stories that divert attention from the real dangers of Chinese missile-mongering.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Digital Posts Huge Deficit; Intel Net Off

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation yesterday announced a record $294 million loss and sharply lower sales for its third fiscal quarter, which ended March 28, and blamed the continuing global economic slump. The Intel Corporation announced increased sales but lower profits, reflecting one-time charges.
Following are the details of the two companies' results:
 
Digital Equipment
 Digital's loss, in contrast to a profit of $117 million in the corresponding quarter last year, was far more severe than Wall Street analysts expected, and Digital's stock fell $5.25, or nearly 10 percent, to $48.25, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 John F. Smith, Digital's senior vice president for operations, was pessimistic about the current quarter as well and said Digital, which is based in Maynard, Mass., was likely to take another charge against earnings and possibly lay off more people.
The company has already taken $1.65 billion in restructuring charges in the last two years and reduced its staff by 20,000 people, to 106,000. Mr. Smith said Digital would accelerate the closing and consolidation of various operations and noted that the company had already trimmed 7.3 million square feet of space from its ledgers.
The loss announced yesterday was underscored by an 8 percent drop in revenues, $3.25 billion. It was the second consecutive quarterly loss for Digital, which lost $135 million in its second quarter.
Mr. Smith attributed the poor earnings to stagnant markets in the United States, Japan and Europe. He also said severe negative currency translations created $150 million to $200 million in losses.
Mr. Smith also noted that while the company was showing a sharp increase in sales of its desktop computers, it was suffering a serious decline in sales of Digital's most profitable higher end systems, including the VAX 9000, VAX 6000 and VAX 4000 series.
David Wu, an analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company, said the severity of the loss reflected more than a weak economy. He noted that Digital's competitors such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard were facing the same economic conditions but both were showing revenue increases.
 
Intel
 The Intel Corporation yesterday reported increased sales but decreased earnings for the first quarter, which it attributed to a number of one-time charges and pricing pressure on much of its product line. Without the charges, earnings would have been essentially flat relative to a year ago.
For the quarter, Intel had earnings of $184.1 million, or 86 cents a share, down 7 percent from $197.4 million, or 95 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Sales rose 9 percent, to $1.24 billion, from $1.13 billion in the first quarter of 1991.
First-quarter 1992 earnings reflect a $35 million reserve to cover payment to the Hughes Aircraft Company as part of a patent infringement settlement and a $15 million reserve for a possible payment to Advanced Micro Devices Inc. as part of an arbitration decision. These charges were partly offset by recognition of $23 million in deferred royalty revenue previously received from Advanced Micro. Without the charges, first-quarter income would have been about $202.1 million, or 94 cents a share.
Intel's earnings, which the company released after the close of the market, equaled most analysts' estimates. Intel shares closed yesterday at $2.625 in over-the-counter trading.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 11, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the Intel Corporation's first-quarter earnings misstated the company's closing stock price in over-the-counter trading on Thursday. It was $57.25 a share, down 25 cents.

HEADLINE: Residential Complex For Brighton Beach In Progress, Again

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
After twice failing to win city approval, a developer has begun a new effort to secure the right to build a large residential complex on the site of the historic Brighton Beach Baths.
In a meeting Wednesday night, members of Brooklyn's Community Board 13 voted 31 to 3 in support of zoning changes that would allow 1,600 units to be built in five towers, ranging in size from 22 to 29 stories. 
 The plan will go before Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, who will hold a public hearing on May 8 to hear comments on the proposed development. It then goes before the City Planning Commission. Final zoning approval would be given by the City Council.
It was the third time the community board had endorsed the luxury- and middle-income plan, called "Brighton-by-the-Sea," for the current site of the Brighton Beach Baths & Racquet Club, which has seen its membership dwindle in recent years.
Earlier versions of the plan, proposed by Baths owner and long-time New York City builder Alexander Muss & Sons, were endorsed in 1988 and again in 1989 by the community board, which covers Brighton Beach, Coney Island and Gravesend.
The first two proposals failed at various stages of the city-mandated Uniform Land Use Review Procedure -- once when Mayor Ed Koch stepped in, then again when the City Planning Commission failed to give a majority approval to the project. Since then, the plan has been scaled down and made more environmentally sound, its supporters say.
Most local officials and community board members praise the development as an economic boon for Brighton Beach, a low- to middle-income neighborhood that is home to thousands of Soviet emigres.
Opponents, including the Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach & Manhattan Beach and the Sheepshead Bay/Plum Beach Civic Association, say the project poses environmental problems, especially for the local sewage plant, which they say is already working above capacity.

HEADLINE: American Air Cuts Most Fares In Simplification of Rate System

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, said yesterday that it would scrap the convoluted system of airline fares that has evolved over the last decade. It announced a simplified system that includes only four kinds of fares instead of 16, and will mean lower prices for most business and leisure travelers.
Other carriers quickly announced similar overhauls; the changes will take effect Monday. 
 Under the new system, American will offer only a first-class fare, a coach fare that can be bought anytime before flight time, and two discount fares, one requiring purchase 21 days in advance of travel and another requiring purchase seven days in advance.
 
$25 Million in Savings
 In simplifying its fare system, American is eliminating all but 70,000 of the 500,000 fares in its computerized reservations system -- an 86 percent drop. The resulting reduction in administrative burden will be so large that the carrier expects to save $25 million annually by reassigning about 600 employees to other tasks.
The change will reduce current coach fares an average of 38 percent and first-class fares 20 to 50 percent. The cuts in discount fares will be smaller, and in a few markets the lowest discount fare will actually be higher than it was before.
"The whole fares system has become chaotic, inflexible, illogical and unfair," Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman and president, said in announcing the new fares in a news conference in New York. "The system just has not been working."
Mr. Crandall, who said that the fare revision was intended to be permanent, not a special short-term offer like many in the past, appeared to be using his position as head of the nation's largest airline to force changes on the industry. [Page D1.]
The new system cuts a wide swath through the thicket of air fares by eliminating many discounts -- some discreetly offered to companies with many employees -- and other special fares, including those for Government employees, passengers bound for conventions and members of the armed forces. This way, Mr. Crandall said, "Every customer can get the best price available."
The new system, which will be announced in advertisements nationwide beginning today, should also deter cheating by crafty travelers who beat the old system through tricks like buying two steeply discounted tickets that together amount to less than an unrestricted fare and using half of each ticket.
American announced another significant change. On most flights currently, passengers who buy advance-purchase tickets and do not fly when scheduled can neither obtain refunds nor reschedule. Under the new system, they still cannot obtain refunds but, by paying a $25 service fee, can reschedule, as long as applicable advance-purchase and length-of-stay requirements are met.
The new fares also apply on flights to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, but not on other international routes, most of which are regulated by foreign governments. Nevertheless, Mr. Crandall said it was American's intention eventually to simplify and reduce international fares.
American and the other carriers are gambling that the fare cuts will produce an increase in travel that more than offsets the price reductions. The growth in the number of airline travelers has been weak in recent years, partly because of the recession and Persian Gulf war, and airlines that expanded their fleets rapidly have been flying with many empty seats and have slashed fares, suffering large losses in the process.
Mr. Crandall said that American, which flies 90 million passengers a year, anticipates losing at least $100 million in the next three months because of the new lower fares, but expects to increase earnings by as much as $350 million annually because of the new fare system.
Those projections anticipate a 3 percent to 4 percent increase in passengers, compared with the 2 percent gain previously projected. They also assume that the economy will grow slowly.
In the last two years, United States carriers have lost almost $6 billion, and their spokesmen -- the outspoken Mr. Crandall in particular -- have argued time and again that the industry needs to raise revenues. Until yesterday, those attempts took the form of higher fares, especially the higher full fares used by business travelers, who travel on short notice.
But not only did that strategy widen the disparity between leisure and business travelers, it had the additional disadvantage, in a weak economy, of discouraging business travel. Mr. Crandall said American hoped to reinvigorate the business travel market, especially among small businesses.
 
Wide Variations
 Corporate air fares averaged 28 cents a mile last year, compared with 26 cents in 1989, according to Topaz Enterprises, an air-fare auditing concern in Portland, Ore. But the price ranged from an average 56 cents a mile for first class to 24 cents a mile for negotiated fares. Mr. Crandall said yesterday that corporate discounts averaged about 38 percent industry wide.
Analysts and industry executives were quick to praise American's effort.
"It is a brilliant strategic move," said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst with Solomon Brothers. "In effect, American has said the time has come to bring back the relationship between costs and revenues. Other carriers, and especially the financially weak ones, will have no choice but to go along or go out of business."
Continental Airlines, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, said it would match the new fares but might raise or lower them "depending on the market." United Airlines, Northwest and Delta also said they would adopt parts of the new fare system.
Wall Street responded favorably to the announcements, sending the share price of American's parent, the AMR Corporation, up $3.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, to $71.875. The share price of United's owner, the UAL Corporation, rose by $2.50, to $133.25, and Delta Air Lines Inc.'s rose $1.50, to $60.75.
Some travel agents had feared that American was planning to lower commissions, which average about 10 percent of air fares, or try to impose commissions based on a sliding scale. But once they learned the details of American's plan, some travel agency executives were pleased, even though lower fares will likely mean lower commissions on individual transactions.
"Anything that simplifies the fare structure is sure to be helpful," said David S. Paresky, the president and chairman of Thomas Cook Travel, which has 320 locations in the United States. "It helps us respond to what our clients are looking for: lower fares and greater flexibility."
Mr. Crandall said American had been spurred by a litany of complaints from business travelers, who disliked the high fares, and leisure travelers, who were frustrated by the many restrictions. He cited a difference of $1,166 in the highest and lowest current round-trip transcontinental fares.
"Our customers," he said, "no longer feel air travel is a good buy, or even fair."
Don Carty, American's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said that 10 percent of American's excursion travel "is probably people gaming us" -- that is, circumventing the rules applicable to discount tickets. But the fault, he said, "is simply because of how aberrant the system is."
 
Matching the Distance
 Under the new fares, which try to relate fares to distances traveled, American's unrestricted coach fare between New York and Los Angeles will drop from $752 one way to $460, and between New York and Chicago from $427 to $250. American expects that about one-third of its traffic will fly using this fare.
American's 21-day advance-purchase round-trip fare between New York and Los Angeles will drop to $460 from $549, and between New York and Chicago to $260 from $355. The new 21-day fares, which require a Saturday-night stayover, average 49 percent less than American's new unrestricted coach fares, the carrier said, and average about 6 percent less than the 21-day fares that are in effect until Monday.
However, until yesterday at least, some restricted fares on those routes were lower than the new ones. American, for example, offered a 30-day advance purchase fare between New York and Los Angeles for $398 round trip, requiring a Saturday stayover, and a 14-day round trip for $338, which required a stayover and was valid for travel only on Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday.
American's new seven-day advance-purchase fare also requires a Saturday-night stay and is also nonrefundable. But both advance-purchase fares allow passengers to change their itinerary and reuse tickets, provided they meet the applicable advance-purchase and length-of-stay requirements.
In a question-and-answer session yesterday, Mr. Crandall said American was mulling future changes, but probably not in its frequent-flier program. And he said the carrier would continue to offer discounts to senior citizens, because "of the competitiveness of that market," and will honor existing corporate contracts until they expire.
While he did not rule out the possibility that the industry could again begin offering an array of special fares, he said that now, having learned that lesson, "hopefully we won't repeat it."

Chart: "American's Simplified Fares" -- In place of an existing domestic fare system involving dozens of prices, discounts and restrictions that are constantly changing, American is introducing a simpler system with few rules. Other airlines have said they will match American's move. Here are the main elements of American's new domestic fare system:
 
First class
* No restrictions.
* New first-class fares will be 20 percent to 50 percent less than former first-class fares on the same routes.
 
Coach
* No restrictions.
* Available on all flights every day.
* New coach fares, which the airline calls "AAnytime," will be 38 percent lower than former unrestricted coach fares.
 
Discount fares
* Trip must include a Saturday night stay.
* Must be bought in advance: Either 7 days or 21 days, depending on the discount.
* New discount fares, which the airline calls "Plan-AAhead 7" and "Plan AAhead 21" will be up to 49 percent less than new coach fares.
 
Charge for refund or reissue
* New $25 charge for refund or reissue of any ticket.
* First class and coach tickets are refund-able.
* No refunds for discount tickets, but they can be reissued for another flight provided that the discount's restrictions are met. (pg. D3)

HEADLINE: No Victory for Panama

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is savoring the drug conviction of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as a final triumph over the deposed dictator. But its own studies show that toppling him failed to stanch the flow of illicit narcotics through Panama.
Further, critics in Congress and elsewhere are saying that the Government built its case against the general by making far too many costly deals with drug traffickers and other criminals to get them to testify against the defendant. 
 Today, President Bush lauded the conviction of the first foreign head of state ever tried on criminal charges in a United States court. He said at a news conference that the United States invasion of Panama "enabled justice to be served, American lives were protected, and it helped Panama set out on a new democratic course." That nation, he said, is "on the mend with encouraging economic growth rates, reduction in drug trafficking and a new commitment to democracy."
 
Reports of More Trafficking
 But the President's assertion about drug trafficking is contradicted by Administration reports, along with other Government studies, which conclude that drug trafficking and money laundering in Panama may have increased since General Noriega was ousted in December 1989.
A State Department report on international narcotics-control strategies issued last month credited the government of Guillermo Endara with trying to combat drugs, but said that "narcotics trafficking and money laundering continue to be serious threats to democracy in Panama" and that Panama remained "a major transhipment point for cocaine destined for the U.S. and Europe."
A report last summer by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, provided a harsher assessment. It said that United States officials believed that "drug trafficking may be increasing" and cited one unnamed agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who "believes that trafficking may have doubled" since the general was toppled by United States invasion forces.
After a seven-month trial, General Noriega was convicted Thursday of eight criminal charges, including cocaine trafficking, racketeering and money laundering. Prosecutors convinced the jury that the defendant had accepted millions of dollars from the Medellin drug cartel, which wanted to ship tons of cocaine through Panama on its way to the United States.
From the start, Bush Administration officials said the chief goals of the invasion included not only the restoration of democracy in Panama but also the apprehension of the erratic dictator and the curtailing of drug shipments through Panama.
A force of 27,000 United States troops overwhelmed the Panamanian Defense Force in four days, with 23 Americans and hundreds of Panamanians killed. General Noriega was arrested and brought to Miami on Jan. 4, 1990, to stand trial.
The military victory in Panama handed the Justice Department an unanticipated legal problem. At the time, senior officials said the indictment against General Noriega was thin and that it had been prepared nearly two years before the invasion, when it appeared unlikely that he would ever be brought to trial. As a result, the prosecutors' fear of the political repercussions of an acquittal often seemed to dictate the Government's scorched-earth approach to building the case.
Federal prosecutors went to such extraordinary lengths to bolster their case that Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, is asking the Justice Department for a detailed account of the deals granted to prosecution witnesses.
Mr. Schumer said that the prosecution called more than 40 witnesses, most of them convicted drug traffickers. The report profiled 15 witnesses, who were excused of crimes "worse" than those for which General Noriega stood trial.
Among them were Ricardo Bilonick, a former Panamanian ambassador at-large to the United States, who testified that he earned $47 million in drug profits; Floyd Carleton Caceres, an arms and drug courier for the Medellin cartel, and Colonel Luis del Cid, General Noriega's self-described "errand boy," who testified that he knew of millions of dollars in drug profits laundered through Panama each week.
Mr. Schumer, who is chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee on crime and criminal justice, said in a report issued Thursday that the Department paid some informers hundreds of thousands of dollars and allowed informers to keep millions of dollars that it knew had been earned through drug sales.
A statement accompanying the report said that "convicted murderers, drug traffickers and other felons got sweetheart deals from prosecutors."
Other witnesses were granted immunity from prosecution for their drug crimes, excused from paying tax penalties, exempted from deportation and promised placement under the Federal witness-protection program.
"The Government was hellbent on convicting Noriega no matter what the cost," said Mr. Schumer.
Robert S. Mueller 3d, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, defended the agreements reached with prosecution witnesses, saying that Mr. Schumer's report sounded "like a brief that could have been prepared by the defense counsel."
Mr. Mueller said today Mr. Schumer had failed to consider the importance of the testimony these witnesses provided. "The evidence that one needs to lay out in court about the criminal activities of individuals can only be obtained from those who are members of the conspiracy," he said.
 
Surprise Outside Case
 Lawyers unconnected with the case said the cooperation agreements in the Noriega case seemed somewhat unusual. "It is absolutely impossible to make a case like this without those kind of witnesses," said E. Lawrence Barcella, a former Federal prosecutor. "But that said, the reported deals they received appear in some cases to be pretty generous."
While the use of such witnesses is a common practice in narcotics and organized-crime cases, other issues in the case appear likely to provide grounds for an appeal.
These include the question of the legality of the general's arrest; the Government's decision to freeze millions of dollars of his assets in a move that left his two-lawyer defense team outgunned, and the prosecutors' monitoring of the general prison telephone conversations with his lawyers.
And there remains the issue of classified documents related to General Noriega's relationship with United States intelligence agencies. Last year, prosecutors won a series of legal battles that effectively barred the defense from shifting the focus of the trial from a straightforward South Florida narcotics prosecution into a case that the defense had hoped would put United States policies in Central America on trial.

HEADLINE: Tories' Triumph: Bucking a European Trend

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 10

 BODY:
At first glance, the surprise victory for Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Party in Britain on Thursday seems to go against the grain of other recent European elections.
In France, Italy and Germany, local and national votes in the last month showed strong dissatisfaction among voters with the status quo and the parties in power. 
 The cold war is over, and Europe is well into 1992, the year that was supposed to usher in a new era of prosperity in a single European Community market. Yet the economy is sluggish in every European country, and instead of security now that the Soviet Union is gone, there is turmoil and uncertainty. Things aren't turning out the way they were supposed to, European voters seem to be saying, and traditional politics often seems incapable of dealing with new realities.
Yet here in Britain, mired in the longest recession since the 1930's, Mr. Major managed the fourth straight Conservative victory since 1979 against the opposition Labor Party, despite a complete Labor transformation from the left-wing fringes of a decade ago to the solid middle ground.
"All over the world," Mr. Major said outside 10 Downing Street today, "governments facing elections in recessions have tended to lose seats. Many of them have lost power. We have bucked that trend in a most spectacular fashion."
Mr. Major's Government did lose 32 seats in the House of Commons, most of them to the opposition Labor Party, and the election reduced the Conservatives' comfortable 86-seat majority to a narrower 21-seat margin. But the Labor Party's gains since 1987 were not enough to give it the victory that its leader, Neil Kinnock, clearly expected.
In this respect, the British result seemed consistent with setbacks to President Francois Mitterrand's Socialists in France in regional elections last month, and to both the Socialists and the remnants of the once-powerful Communist Party in national elections last Sunday in Italy.
"The failure for Labor confirms the picture of a deepening crisis for the Social Democrats and Socialists in Western Europe," said Prime Minister Carl Bildt of Sweden, whose Conservative coalition swept the Social Democrats out of power there in elections last September.
 
Polls Gone Wrong
 Here, Labor and the opposition Liberal Democrats did not even win enough seats to produce the stalemate in the House of Commons that had been predicted by all the public opinion polls, though Mr. Major may have to worry more about unexpected defections and local election losses than his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, did.
What went wrong with the polls was a question all the British public opinion research organizations were grappling with today.
The poll takers have been reporting for months that British voters were in an angry mood in the midst of a recession the Government seemed unable to halt, and that large numbers of them were going to switch support from the Conservatives to Labor. But in the voting booths Thursday, only about 2 percent of them actually did switch, according to computer analyses.
The polls may have been right, as far as they went. One possible explanation is that many voters were angry enough to tell poll takers that they were going to vote against Mr. Major's Government, but not sure enough of Mr. Kinnock's ability to do a better job to give him a mandate when they finally cast their ballots on Thursday.
"I think frankly I didn't pay enough attention to the data," said Robert M. Worcester, whose polling organization, Market & Opinion Research International, asked voters how they intended to vote, and from the answers, predicted Labor would come out slightly ahead of the Conservatives in a deadlocked Parliament. "But all along," he said, "when we asked people who they thought would make the most capable Prime Minister, Major or Kinnock, most people chose Major."
In the voting booths, perhaps thinking hard about Mr. Kinnock's plans to raise taxes on upper-middle-class incomes, many voters obviously decided to stick with Mr. Major instead.
That many voters were angry with his Government, and fearful about the future, Mr. Major did not deny, but he promised to do his best to look after the interests of those who did not support him, as well as of those who did.
Anger and dissatisfaction with the parties in power, more than skepticism about socialism, is what seems to be the common thread of all the recent elections, especially in Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein in Germany last weekend.
In both states -- one ruled by the Christian Democratic party of Helmut Kohl and the other by the Social Democrats -- a significant percentage of German voters, angry at the inability of the Government and the established parties to deal with the country's growing refugee problem, voted for xenophobic far-right parties instead, according to many German politicians.
More than 1,000 foreigners a day, most of them people seeking asylum from the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe, have been pouring into Germany this year, knowing that the German Constitution obliges the authorities to house them until their applications are decided.
 
Sought to Amend Constitution
 Mr. Kohl's party wanted to amend the Constitution to deter some of the influx, but his coalition partners, the Free Democrats, and the opposition Social Democrats, refused. After the strong showing of the rightist German People's Union in Schleswig-Holstein and the Republican Party in Baden-Wurttemberg, Mr. Kohl offered all-party talks to try to find a way out of the impasse.
"We can't leave people's fears to the radical parties," said Barbara John, an official of the city of Berlin who deals with refugee problems, yet that is what all the larger German parties seemed ready to do until last weekend.
The politics of the status quo has also failed so far to deal adequately with the rise of regional and ethnic separatism. The cold war and Communist control kept it in check in Eastern Europe after World War II, but when the lid came off there, Western European regions like Scotland, Lombardy and Piedmont began wondering why they couldn't have more autonomy too.
With the Italian Communists split, renamed and no longer much of a threat, many voters there found little reason to keep voting for the ruling Christian Democrats, and the Lombardy League of Umberto Bossi suddenly surged onto the political scene as a power in its own right, voicing northern Italian resentment of the alleged corruption and financial drain of the Christian Democratic south.
 
Scots Have Second Thoughts
 The Scots, who traditionally vote overwhelmingly for the Labor Party and did so again Thursday, have been brooding for nearly 13 years about being dominated by Conservative governments in London that they never choose.
For a while last winter, it appeared that the Scottish National Party would make big electoral gains with its outright demands for Scottish independence within the European Community.
Mr. Major warned that secession would fatally damage Britain, and in the vote Thursday his Conservatives actually gained two seats in Scotland, bringing their share of Scotland's 72-member delegation to the House of Commons to 11, to Labor's 49. The Scottish National Party lost two seats and will have only three members in the new House of Commons.
But Mr. Major said today that he would "take stock" of the complaints of his countrymen north of the border. Labor had promised a separate Scottish parliament to deal with issues of local taxation and government if it won.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
BUSH, IN A SESSION WITH JOURNALISTS, PLAYS TO STRENGTH

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
Apparently trying to counter the notion of policy paralysis in the White House and a re-election campaign adrift, President Bush answered reporters' questions in the Rose Garden for an hour today, discoursing on matters ranging from Peru to Perot and from parks to perks.
On the substantive issues he addressed -- welfare, for example, and the environment, health, education and the economy -- Mr. Bush broke little new ground. But he displayed a Presidential mastery of those topics and used the occasion to rail against Congress and to deny reports that he had brought his son George to Washington to put the White House and the campaign in order. 
 On foreign policy, he said he would support subjecting Peru to "outside pressure," including economic sanctions, to promote a restoration of democracy there. [Article, page 3.]
 
Playing to His Strength
 The setting was made to order for the cameras, outdoors under the blooming tulip magnolias on this spring's warmest day yet, and it played to Mr. Bush's political strength. He performs much better in a casual give-and-take with reporters than he does in a formal speech, where he tends to be stiff, or at a campaign rally, where he is often awkward.
He began the unusually long news conference by reading a statement in which he ran through the news of the week and his activities as President: his meeting today on welfare policy with Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin; his pleasure on learning Thursday that the Federal Reserve had cut an influential interest rate; his speech on the former Soviet Union at an editors' meeting; his conversations with leaders in Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Venezuela and Nicaragua; his satisfaction on learning of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's conviction on drug charges, and his support for a political settlement in Afghanistan.
In other words, Mr. Bush stressed the theme his political advisers have established for him: that he can best run for re-election by acting Presidential. In the first 250 words of his statement, he used the word "reform" nine times.
Later, when a reporter asked him why he wanted to be President for another term, Mr. Bush began his answer by saying that he wanted to "enhance world peace and democracy around the world" and to "improve the lives of people here at home."
Then he said, "I think the people want change."
Mr. Bush took specific issue with an article in The New York Times today that quoted aides as saying he was unhappy with the operations of the White House and his campaign and had asked his son George to review the situation.
"It simply is not true," the President said. "If I were dissatisfied, you'd know about it loud and clear, and I'm happy about it."
He acknowledged, however, that his son was in town and had visited the campaign office.
The President refused to discuss Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who will presumably be his Democratic opponent in the fall campaign, or H. Ross Perot, the industrialist who has said he is interested in running as an independent.
Mr. Bush also said he had sent "specific instructions in writing to our people to stay out of the sleaze business."
On policy matters, he made these points:
*Achieving education goals, like making American students first in the world in math and science, would be his top priority in a second term.
*He favors the principle of legislation passed by the House of Representatives on Thursday night that would raise the amount of money the elderly could earn without losing Social Security benefits, but he opposes the House bill because it would increase the budget deficit.
*He will not introduce health insurance legislation this year because Congress would not pass it. And besides, he has not decided exactly how to finance it.
*He is granting official waivers of Federal law to states like Wisconsin that want to cut welfare benefits because he wants the states to be "laboratories" for welfare experiments.
*He has not decided whether to attend a meeting of world leaders in Brazil in June to discuss the environment, but he is determined to find the proper "balance" between environmental protection and economic production.
*He has no objection to Caterpillar Inc.'s hiring of permanent replacements for striking workers as long as no laws are broken.
 
Congress Gets the Blame
 Several times during his news conference, Mr. Bush reasserted his view that Congress was to blame for many of the nation's ills.
Asked at one point about privileges enjoyed at the White House, he did not respond directly but said, "It seems to me very funny tht all of a sudden, faced with the outrage of the American people, not on cars, not on how much a hamburger costs in the Senate restaurant, but on fundamental problems with an institution that was manifested in so many ways recently, the Congress now starts saying, 'Well, how many caligraphers do you have making out cards for a state dinner in the White House?' "
Mr. Bush did say, however, that it costs about $25,000 an hour for him to fly in Air Force One.

HEADLINE: Bush Backs 'Outside Pressure' to End Peru's Crisis

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would support subjecting Peru to "outside pressure," including economic sanctions, to promote a restoration of democracy there.
Asked at a White House news conference whether he would favor outside pressure and sanctions to counter the decision by the Peruvian President, Alberto Fujimori, to suspend Peru's Constitution, dissolve the Parliament and jail opposition figures, Mr. Bush said, "Yes, I'd favor some outside pressure." 
 The Peruvian President argued that he had to suspend democracy on Sunday in his country in order to restore order, at time when his Government is facing challenges from drug traffickers and Maoist Shining Path guerrillas.
Mr. Fujimori's actions have been solidly backed by the Peruvian military and polls show wide popular support. He had been on close terms with Washington before his coup from the top, and Washington's decision not to support him was a difficult one, officials said, made after weighing the alternatives.
 
Strategy Used in Haiti
 Basically, the Bush administration decided that even though it shared Mr. Fujimori's desire to crack down on the Shining Path guerrillas and end corruption in government, his measures are unacceptable. The officials said, however, that they would be slow impose the most severe sanctions out of understanding for Mr. Fujimori's dilemma.
Mr. Bush, in his toughest statement to date on the situation in Lima, said: "We can't sit by without registering our strong disapproval about the aborting of democracy in Peru. We want it restored."
The President said he was looking forward to an emergency meeting of foreign ministers from the Organization of American States, scheduled for Monday, and suggested that any action the United States took would be under the leadership of, and in cooperation with, the O.A.S.
The Administration adopted a similar approach six months ago when it encouraged the organization to impose tough economic sanctions on Haiti, after the military ouster of the democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Mr. Bush said a similar approach might be appropriate for Peru, although up to now the sanctions imposed on Haiti have not led to Mr. Aristide's return.
 
Effect on Latin America
 "We considered sanctions in our efforts to try to restore democracy to Haiti," said Mr. Bush, adding that "certainly we would consider" it in the case of Peru as well.
Mr. Bush continued: "Outside pressure will be mobilized in the O.A.S. Maybe a follow-on mission from the O.A.S. would be a clear and productive step."
The Bush Administration on Monday imposed some sanctions of its own, suspending $45 million in new aid to Peru, as well as reviewing all existing aid programs.
A senior Administration official, briefing reporters before the President's remarks, made clear that Washington was concerned that the coup this week in Peru could affect the political climate across Latin America, and therefore Washington had rejected a Peruvian plea for support in its actions and was preparing to alter fundamentally its relations with Lima.
As if to underline the Administration's concern about the domino effect of coups, the United States chose today to announce that it was withdrawing the visas of a "significant number" of Haitians who support the military regime that overthrew an elected Government of Haiti on Sept. 30. Father Aristide has been advocating that move for six months.
On Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will take part in the an O.A.S. meeting, the State Department said.
Officials said the Administration would press for collective action by nations in the hemisphere to persuade Mr. Fujimori to reverse what Washington called his unconstitutional acts or face a broad cutoff of aid, including vital assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The senior official, speaking to reporters and insisting on not being identified, said the Administration had no advance indication that President Fujimori would dissolve the Parliament and give wide powers to the military on Sunday night, just as a high-level team from Washington was arriving in Lima. According to other officials, no United States intelligence agency had knowledge of the Peruvian plan, which also caught the Peruvian political opposition off guard.
But the senior official said the Peruvian Government had earlier asked the team of United States officials to delay their visit, and was told that was impossible because of schedule conflicts. A retired American military officer with close ties to the Peruvian Army said in a separate interview that it was his understanding that the plan put into effect Sunday had been discussed for at least six months.
The American team, led by Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, intended to present Peru with a proposal for an American-assisted seven-year development plan for the Upper Huallaga Valley. The region, about 230 miles northwest of Lima, is the center of Peruvian coca leaf production. It is also an area where guerrillas of the Shining Path are active.
The team left Lima Monday after Mr. Aronson cancelled an appointment with President Fujimori. The Assistant Secretary saw Peruvian human-rights leaders and met the Foreign Minister, Augusto Blacker Miller, who asked for understanding of Peru's situation. The Bush Adminsitration said Monday that while it understands the extent of Peru's social and economic crisis, it finds the abandonment of democracy an unacceptable response.
The senior official said today that the Peruvians appear to have miscalculated the extent of international alarm and revulsion at Lima's decision. The move seems to have come from President Fujimori, and was not forced on him by the military, the official said.
President Fujimori, who cited a worsening guerrilla war and the need to combat narcotics as reasons for dissolving the legislature and gutting the judicial system, was also apparently motivated by fears that a former President and now opposition leader, Alan Garcia, was planning a political campaign to hobble the Peruvian administration and reduce its popularity. The President was not scheduled to face a new election until 1995.
Mr. Garcia, now in hiding, is being sought by the Peruvian police and military. The United States earlier this week asked Peru to free all opposition politicans.
Many grievances against politicians, the judiciary and other institutions listed by President Fujimori were the same grievances named by military officers who tried to ovethrow the Venezuelan Government in January, the senior American official said, returning to the theme of dangerous precedent being set in a region that boasted less than a year ago that nearly all its governments were democratically elected.

PERU OFFICIAL FLEES TO EMBASSY
 LIMA, Peru, April 10 (Special to The New York Times) -- Peru's Second Vice President, who was secretly elected by the Peruvian Congress on Thursday to replace President Alberto Fujimori as head of state, sought refuge today in the Argentine Embassy, saying he feared for his safety. The Argentine Government promised to grant him political asylum and to seek to give him safe passage to Buenos Aires.
The appointment of Carlos Garcia Garcia, a protestant evangelist, set off a series of complex diplomatic moves as the members of the Congress, which was dissolved on Sunday, tried to create political support for their actions in this capital and in the United States.
Congress members notified the Peruvian Ambassador in Washington, Roberto McLean, that he was to obey the orders of Mr. Garcia. They also ordered the country's representative to the Organization of American States to bar Mr. Fujimori's Foreign Minister from speaking to the organization's meeting on Monday.

HEADLINE: Having Outwitted the Seers, Tories Wax Conciliatory

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 10

 BODY:
Emboldened by the Conservative Party's unexpected triumph in the national election on Thursday, Prime Minister John Major vowed today to lead Britain out of recession and toward the "classless society" he envisioned when he took over the Government from Margaret Thatcher 16 months ago.
Appearing outside 10 Downing Street only hours after voters defied pundits, bookmakers and poll takers who argued the Conservatives were likely to fall to the Labor Party, the Prime Minister chose to strike a deliberately conciliatory tone after one of the most closely fought British election campaigns in recent memory. 
 He promised he would expand opportunities for education, job training and home ownership, and assured voters he had no intention of ever privatizing Britain's National Health Service, as Labor had asserted during the campaign.
 
Labor's Despair
 "Every government that has ever been elected in this country has had people who didn't vote for it," said Mr. Major, 49 years old, whose personal popularity among voters helped extend the Tories' winning streak to four elections, beginning in 1979. "And my job as Prime Minister is to make sure I never overlook their interests when I frame legislation, and when I decide what the Government does." Not since the Napoleonic wars has a British party been able to form four consecutive governments.
As Mr. Major beamed and Conservatives took solace in their narrow escape -- they watched their majority of 86 seats in the House of Commons shrink to just 21 -- the rival Labor Party was plunged into despair and recrimination over its failure yet again to topple the Tories, in spite of Britain's worst recession since the 1930's.
Neil Kinnock, 50, who as head of the Labor Party has now lost two successive elections to the Conservatives, went into seclusion today, amid speculation that he might resign as the party's leader.
 
Kinnock's Future
 Aides to Mr. Kinnock released a brief public statement that said, "I am consulting with colleagues to inform them of the action which I propose to take in the wake of the election defeat."
Close aides to Mr. Kinnock said the Welsh coal miner's son had been devastated by the defeat, since he believed, on the basis of public opinion polls and the Labor Party's own analysis, that he was headed for victory on Thursday.
With the final results in from balloting in all 651 seats in the House of Commons, the Conservatives won 336 seats; Labor, 271, and the centrist Liberal Democrats, 20. Regional parties won 24 seats.
 
A Conservative Cushion
 Experts on parliamentary government said a majority of 21 seats would give the Conservatives just enough of a cushion to insure passage of their legislative program, although party whips would have to exact a stricter discipline among members to assure attendance for critical votes.
For Mr. Major, the election marked a personal triumph, and gave him his first popular mandate to govern. He had assumed the premiership by default in November 1990, when Mrs. Thatcher was ousted in a Conservative Party revolt.
Mr. Major wasted little time today in working to put his own stamp on his new Government, and aides to the Prime Minister said he was likely to announce a reshuffled Cabinet on Saturday.
News of the unexpected Conservative victory sent London stocks and bonds soaring, after weeks of uncertainty among businessmen and traders, who said they feared that plans by Labor to increase taxes and public welfare spending would set back any hope of economic recovery.
Mr. Kinnock was not the only big loser in the election Thursday. Britain's pollsters were also handed one of their worst embarrassments ever.
In the weeks before the ballot, British editorialists and columnists had sharply attacked the Conservatives and Mr. Major for a lackluster and uninspiring campaign, and not a single public opinion poll prior to the election was even close to predicting the final outcome.
Most had shown Labor with a slight lead, but suggested the race was so close that neither Labor nor the Conservatives would win a majority, resulting in a deadlocked Parliament in which Labor would probably have the upper hand.
For example, on the eve of the election, Market & Opinion Research International, which in the last two elections came within one percentage point of accurately predicting the outcome, showed Labor at 39 percent, the Conservatives at 38 percent and the Liberal Democrats at 20. The sample involved 1,731 registered voters, and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
 
Wiping Off the Egg
 But the final national returns tabulated today showed most of the actual results fell beyond the range of error. Of all ballots cast, the Conservatives won 41.9 percent of the votes; Labor won 34.2 percent, and the Liberal Democrats 17.9 percent. Other parties won 6.1 percent.
Robert Worcester, the chairman of the research and polling group, said it was conducting additional samples today to determine what, if anything, had gone wrong.
"We've got egg on our face," he said. He said a large and unexpected turnout among Conservative voters might have thrown off his findings. Many of these were may have decided to vote at the last minute, fearful that Labor's tax plans would cost them money.
British election officials said the turnout of more than 77 percent was the highest since 1974, when Labor and the Conservatives fought to a near draw.
 
The Tax Factor
 Politicians trying to make sense of what happened on Thursday offered a number of alternative explanations. In addition to a late surge as a result of worries about Labor tax policy, others argued that Mr. Kinnock and other Labor officials may have hurt themselves in the closing week of the campaign by acting as if they had won the election, when public opinion polls showed them with a four to seven point lead.
Shirley Williams, a former member of Parliament for the Social Democrats, an old centrist party, referred to the chilling effect on voters of a highly orchestrated rally last week in Sheffield, in which Mr. Kinnock appeared, in television news reports, to be in what she described as "a triumphant mode."
"At the last analysis, people stubbornly resisted a Labor government," she said.
The bookmakers also misjudged the election. On election day, some betting shops were giving odds of 14-1 on the Conservatives' winning with a margin of 15 to 20 seats.
The Scottish National Party, which had been banking on polls showing a growing support for Scottish independence from Britain, also ended up losing two of the five seats they held in Scotland, and Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, went down to defeat in the one seat it has held for the last nine years in Northern Ireland.
Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, was defeated by Joe Hendron, a doctor and a moderate Irish nationalist.
 
Celebrity Victors
 Chris Patton, who ran the Conservatives' national campaign, also was a loser; he was defeated in his Bath constituency, at the same time he was given credit for orchestrating the Conservatives' stunning upset.
Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Britain's third-largest party, also was a loser. Mr. Ashdown had been banking on holding the balance in a deadlocked Parliament, in the case that neither Labor nor Conservatives held the advantage.
Instead, Mr. Ashdown not only found himself once more dealing with a Conservative majority, but his party actually lost two seats in the election.
Amid the carnage, there were also two well-known winners. Glenda Jackson, the actress, won a Labor seat in the fashionable north London district of Hampstead and Highgate, and Sebastian Coe, a Conservative who won two Olympic gold medals as a runner, crossed the finishing line first in Falmouth-Camborne, a district in southwest England.

HEADLINE: Carter's Civic Crusade Tries to Meld Two Atlantas

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 10

 BODY:
In the shadow of the city's downtown skyscrapers and 100 yards from the manicured lawn and crisp, modern architecture of the Carter Center, vacant city-owned lots are overgrown with gnarled kudzu vines, and tar paper shacks occupied by some of the city's homeless dot the brush.
It has been a decade since the land was cleared of rundown houses and warehouses to make way for a parkway to carry suburban commuters into downtown Atlanta. But the roadway has been tied up in court action and the only development has been the shacks of the homeless. 
 The promise, wealth and intellectual goals of the Carter Center existing alongside the poverty and despair illustrate the circumstances that have led former President Jimmy Carter in recent months to sermonize about two Atlantas: one rich and one poor.
Recently Mr. Carter evoked the contrast as he addressed a breakfast gathering of about 1,500 business and civic leaders and described how he had gone out amid the shacks and met his "neighbors," talked to them about their lives and come away chastened.
 
'We Ought to Be Helping'
 "I was told one of them was recently arrested for urinating in the kudzu," Mr. Carter said. "We don't even provide portable toilets, and then we arrest them. It bothers me that we aren't doing anything about it. We ought to be helping but not in a supercilious 'I'm better than you' attitude. But in a way that will make us a truly great city."
After years spent mediating disputes overseas through the Carter Center, helping Habitat for Humanity to build houses in the nation's poor neighborhoods and rural byways thousands of miles away, and financing research on agricultural and health in the third world through the center's Global 2000 program, the former President has turned his attention to this city. In the process he has rattled the smug calm of some residents while inspiring others to see not only the city's prosperity but also some of its warts.
He has created the Atlanta Project, which seeks to provide a way for rich Atlanta to aid poor Atlanta. Mr. Carter has become the "moral force" behind a civic crusade, said Ivan Allen 3d, the president of an office-supply company and son of a former Atlanta Mayor.
Mr. Carter's vision for his Atlanta Project comes at a time when this city of nearly a half a million people has experienced a 300 percent increase in all violent crime over the last five years, watched its homeless population grow to an estimated 12,000 and seen many of the measures of the health and incomes of its citizens decline.
In spite of its reputation for a strong black middle class, Atlanta, with its urban core that is more than two-thirds black and largely poor, typifies the urban-suburban disparity, which has become all the more troubling to many here as the city begins preparing for the 1996 Summer Olympics.
 
A Collaborative Effort
 The Atlanta Project, with hopes of creating a $5 million a year budget over the next five years, seeks to help the city's business community, foundations, government and residents of poor areas to work together to solve problems.
Mr. Carter, who is 68 years old, first announced his idea for the Atlanta Project in October, and since then the business community has moved from skepticism to enthusiastic support, largely as a result of Mr. Carter's outflanking its skepticism with his willingness to put his prestige on the line for the campaign.
At the most basic level, the Atlanta Project will bring together individuals who want to volunteer to be mentors, helping in day-care centers or in schools in poor areas. At its most complicated, it will use its relatively small annual budget to leverage millions in corporate and foundation donations to help community people and professionals solve problems and design education, employment, housing and social service programs.
James Brasher, a special assistant to Mr. Carter, used day care to describe how the project hoped to be a "framework" for corporate and foundation involvement as well as "a conduit for volunteers."
He said the project would hire a community person in each of 20 target areas in the city to help identify needs and existing resources. The project would then promote the social benefits of a day-care program that feeds poor children while it allows their mothers to work or get training. In so doing, he said, the project would show donors and corporations the benefits of such programs.
 
Praise From Business
 Many business leaders spoke of Mr. Carter's "boldness" in putting himself at the head of such a difficult task, and they acknowledge the project's idealism when they openly refer to Mr. Carter's "impossible dream."
"It is probably no more quixotic than a one-term Southern Governor trying to be President of the United States," said Bill Campbell, a member of the City Council.
Mr. Carter had timing on his side and a canny politician's sense of just how to appeal to Atlanta's private sector. The Olympics is a concern to all Atlanta and by tying the Atlanta Project's longer-term goals to a municipal face-lifting for that event, Mr. Carter overcame apathy.
"With a specific date you're aiming for like the Olympics and the support of an ex-President, we ought to be able to get the business community involved," said Larry Gellerstedt, a retired construction company executive.
Although a full-fledged fund-raising effort, headed by Ivan Allen 3d and Ronald Allen, president of Delta Airlines, is not scheduled to begin until next month, already the Atlanta Project has attracted $8 million in in-kind personnel, equipment and consulting services from businesses and educational institutions. The project has also received pledges of $5 million in cash contributions from companies, including a $1.5 million grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which focuses on disadvantaged children. And the City of Atlanta has donated space in a former Sears distribution center to house the project's office.
 
Weaving New Image
 In his appeals to the private sector, Mr. Carter has constantly evoked the city's past, in which wealthy whites and black civic and religious leaders worked together to ease the city's passage from legal segregation to integration. By weaving this image with the oratory of what is basically an anti-poverty effort and the familiar language of civic boosterism, Mr. Carter has seemingly overcome the problem of a public that has run out of compassion.
"The problem of compassion fatigue is real," said James T. Laney, the president of Emory University and a close associate of Mr. Carter in devising the Atlanta Project. "But it has more to do with a sense of hopelessness. Once people see that through the Atlanta Project that there is a way of getting at problems that seem intractable it will attract a lot of support."
There is more than a faint echo in the project of some of the policies of the Carter Administration, said Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was Mr. Carter's domestic affairs adviser. The former President's "unusual blend of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism" got him in trouble with supporters of the more far-reaching kind of Federal involvement in the Great Society of the 60's, Mr. Eizenstat said. But Mr. Carter had a strong belief in an active Federal Government and his Administration was one of the last to endorse a host of Federally financed social initiatives.
Among the programs Mr. Carter backed as President that can be seen in the Atlanta Project are public service job programs, housing construction grants, youth employment programs and a national health care program for children. Also as President he relied on public-private partnership efforts.
Atlanta's Mayor, Maynard Jackson, and other black elected officials welcome the effort.
"The irony of black political hegemony is that we gained power as cities' resources diminished and the Federal Government withdrew from the field," said Michael Lomax, the chairman of the Fulton County Commission, who is black. "None of us feel hostile or competitive with President Carter on this because the challenge is greater than the abilities of any one black elected official or white elected official."
The reception that the former President have gotten from some of the city's poor and advocates for the poor has not always been as unequivocal.
Earlier this month he held a forum at the city's East Lake Meadows public housing project, where some residents greeted him with skepticism.
In January at a meeting with some of the city's black clergymen, Mr. Carter encountered another kind of wariness.
"Reassure me that this is not an extension of the institutionalizing and privatizing of public service," said Bishop John Hurst Adams of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Georgia. "Is this not another effort to dump some more responsibility on churches and community agencies that the government was created to perform?"
 
Meeting With Bush
 "It's not just government," said Mr. Brasher. "It's not just the corporate power structure or just people talking with one another. It's all of those. It's a new compound."
Last week Mr. Carter went to Washington to speak with President Bush and to allay any fears within the Republican Administration that the Atlanta Project has a partisan edge.
For Mr. Carter, the real key to the effort is nothing so mysterious as the personal contact with poor people of the kind he experienced working with Habitat for Humanity.
"We worked side by side with them and found them so eager, ambitious and competent," Mr. Carter said to the breakfast gathering here recently. "We have underestimated these people and I have seen them, just after they move into a decent house, start talking about what college they want their children to go to. It is almost an impossible chasm for some of us to cross, but with an adequate degree of groundwork and acculturation it can be done."

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Military Budget At Levels Sought by White House

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
In a bipartisan vote, the Senate approved a $1.5 trillion Federal budget plan for 1993 today that embraces President Bush's call for $292 billion for the post-cold war military.
By a 54-to-35 vote, lawmakers adopted their first budget since the former Soviet republics dissolved their union. Democrats tried to shave billions of dollars from Mr. Bush's military plans after the dismantling of the world's only other superpower, but lost three votes on Thursday. 
 Voting for the budget were 36 Democrats and 18 Republicans, while 15 Democrats and 20 Republicans voted against it.
The spending plan, for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, would closely track most of Mr. Bush's domestic priorities. The most substantial changes lawmakers would make -- spending about $1.1 billion less than Mr. Bush for law enforcement and $1.8 billion more for welfare -- amount to shifts of one one-thousandth of the overall budget.
Senate negotiators will next try to write a compromise budget with members of the House, which last month approved a budget holding defense expenditures to $287.2 billion.
 
Only a Blueprint
 The final product will not need the President's approval, because it serves only as a blueprint for future Congressional spending bills.
Much of the day was spent debating, and ultimately turning aside, a plan by Republicans and conservative Democrats to shrink the Federal deficit by limiting the uncontrolled growth of most benefit programs, like agricultural support payments.
"We do this because we don't know any other way to save America for our children," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico. "Everyone in this country has to understand there is no money left in the Treasury."
Sponsors withdrew their proposal, which was not binding, after the Senate voted 66-to-28 for a Democratic amendment exempting veterans benefits. The vote was a vivid indicator of how difficult approval would be for cuts in popular programs.
Benefit programs are the fastest-growing part of the budget but are rarely cut because they serve politically potent groups.
 
No Control on Medical Costs
 Democrats said the proposal, which would have exempted Social Security, ignored rapidly rising medical costs. They criticized Mr. Bush for failing to introduce legislation that would control medical expenses and accused Republicans of cutting programs that largely serve the poor to fix the Government's fiscal ills.
"They're protecting the wealthy people of this country who are unwilling to pay their fair share of taxes," said Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan.
Beginning in 1994, the plan would have limited the growth of those programs to increases in population, inflation plus an additional 2 percent. That 2 percent would be phased out by 1997. Sponsors say that if it were followed, the Federal deficit would be reduced to $55 billion by the year 2002, as against the expected $407 billion.
The budget deficit is expected to be a record $400 billion this year; the spending plans Mr. Bush and lawmakers have proposed would leave the red ink above $320 billion next year.
In recent weeks, both chambers of Congress have refused to accept Democratic plans transferring billions of dollars from military to social programs.

HEADLINE: Experts See Glass Beads as Low-Cost Tool for Oil-Spill Cleanup

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 9

 BODY:
Using materials like white paint pigment and microscopic glass bubbles, it may soon be possible to clean up huge oil and chemical spills quickly and relatively cheaply, chemists said today.
Comparing their results in combating pollution and oil-spill problems, chemists attending the national meeting of the American Chemical Society agreed that the most effective techniques will probably involve combined approaches exploiting solar energy, bacteria and mechanical agents like glass beads. 
 A promising weapon against large oil spills, its developers said, could combine the use of hollow glass beads, about the thickness of human hair, with coatings of titanium dioxide, a common pigment used in white paint, plastics and other products.
Dr. Adam Heller of the University of Texas at Austin, a developer of the idea, conducted a compelling demonstration for those at the meeting. Using a glass dish filled with clear water, he poured on a layer of crude oil of the type that fouled Prince William Sound in Alaska when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran aground three years ago.
Next Dr. Heller poured a few teaspoons of sand-like glass bubbles on the "spill." The oil almost instantly combined with the floating bubbles, congealing into floating clumps and leaving the rest of the water surface completely free of oil.
Dr. Heller then demonstrated that the clumps, unlike thin layers of oil, could be easily ignited with a match, burning away the volatile and toxic light hydrocarbon compounds.
The tiny beads, he explained, were coated with titanium dioxide pigment, sometimes mixed with traces of the metal palladium. This coating belongs to a class of materials called semiconductors that, when exposed to sunlight, furnish the energy needed to drive oxidizing chemical reactions.
In sunlight, therefore, the coated beads can oxidize hydrocarbons from oil spills that adhere to them, rendering the remaining oil components soluble in water. Once dissolved, Dr. Heller said, such compounds are quickly attacked and destroyed by the natural bacteria in sea water.
Dr. Heller said he believed the method, which has not been tested outside the laboratory, would be capable of mopping up an oil spill the size created by the Exxon Valdez, about 11 million gallons, in three days for about $75 million, about 5 percent of the cleanup cost that was paid by the Exxon Corporation.
The coated beads, Dr. Heller said, are likely to cost about $3,000 a ton. Manufactured by fusing the silica-based fly ash that goes up the chimneys of many industrial plants, the beads would have no more effect on the environment than beach sand, he said.
Dr. Heller said the project had so far lacked the financing needed for large-scale trials.
Nick Sandifer, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, which is mainly responsible for dealing with oil spills, said that the Coast Guard could not assess such technologies until they become available commercially, and that "this appears to be still cutting-edge research that we wouldn't know about."
 
Other Applications
 Many other research groups that presented papers here on pollution cleanup strategies said that they were also exploiting titanium dioxide and sunlight in various ways.
Scientists from the research arms of the Canadian Government, the European Economic Community, the Italian Government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reported major progress in using titanium dioxide activated by sunlight to break down some common and dangerous pollutants.
Dr. Detlef W. Bahnemann of the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hanover, Germany, reported that his group was using titanium dioxide particles in water treatment at plants in Spain and Brazil. In both cases, he said, sunlight was used to activate the catalytic properties of the pigment.

HEADLINE: House Would Let Retired Earn More

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly Thursday night to increase the maximum amount that Social Security recipients could earn and still collect full benefits.
The measure, reflecting the power of older Americans in an election year, would nearly double, to $20,000, the amount that workers from 65 to 70 years old could earn before losing any Social Security benefits. 
 The vote of 340 to 68 came after the White House lined up support for the measure from recalcitrant Republicans who had wanted the earnings ceiling eliminated. The Senate eliminated the ceiling in its version of the bill, passed by voice vote last November. The House bill will now be considered by the Senate.
Under the House measure the ceiling, now $10,200, would increase to $12,000 in 1993 and then $2,000 annually until 1997. Based on the number of people 65 to 70 now working who would be affected by the new ceilings, the House Ways and Means Committee calculated that the bill would cost at an estimated $7.3 billion in increased benefits in the next five years.
The White House position appeared both practical and political: While trying to thwart a chance by Democrats to accuse Republicans of indifference to the elderly, it would also ward off repeal of the earnings ceiling. The Senate version, with the repeal, would cost $27 billion in increased benefits over five years, the House panel said.
The debate had further partisan overtones because upper-income professionals who are more likely to want to work in their 60's are also likely to be Republicans. Blue-collar workers, who experts say are less likely to work in their 60's, are likely to be Democrats.
The Congressional debate also pits those who regard Social Security as a pension that should only be paid to retirees against those who regard it as an annuity that is owed to recipients, whether working or retired.
The debate places advocates for the elderly in a quandary. John Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "We think that people who want to continue to be productive should not be penalized. But we're also concerned with the overall integrity of the Social Security Trust Fund, and complete repeal would be quite expensive."
Under current law, Social Security recipients from the ages of 65 to 70 have their benefits reduced $1 for every $3 earned above the earnings ceiling of $10,200. The average retiree receives $7,548 in annual benefits, and the maximum benefit is $13,056, according to the House committee.
The House bill would not affect the $7,440 earnings ceiling for Social Security recipients 62 to 65.
Forty million people receive Social Security benefits, and about 800,000 people exceed the income limit and receive either reduced benefits or none. Removal of the earnings limitation would not be likely to increase the number of older people who continued to work, according to studies by the Social Security Administration and Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. The studies found there were many reasons older people continued to work, including job opportunities, psychic rewards and increased income.
The measure would also increase by $56 a month the benefits to 830,000 widows and widowers over the age of 80 whose deceased spouses received Social Security benefits, and would enable disabled widows and widowers from the age of 50 to 59 to receive benefits.

HEADLINE: Recording by Hand, Nassau Lags Behind

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., April 10

 BODY:
This is what Rita Figurniak, an employee in the Suffolk County Clerk's office, does to record a judicial motion in a court case: she calls up a file on her desktop computer, looks over the papers and enters in two-digit codes. On average, it takes 30 seconds.
In Nassau County, the papers are assigned numbers, then filed in drawers and, eventually, recorded in two-inch-thick books. The county is more than three months behind in recording judicial actions. 
 "Every few days, I'll notice we haven't been entering the clerk's minutes, and put somebody on it," said Carol Fralick, who is in charge of records in the document department of the Nassau County Clerk's office. "They'll usually stay on it a few hours, and then be needed somewhere else."
The Nassau County Clerk's office, which hobbled through Long Island's real-estate boom of the 1980's largely without computers, is reeling through the recession of the 90's under budget cutbacks that slashed the number of employees almost in half, to 72 from about 130.
The backlog has crippled operations in the county's civil courts and left millions of dollars of undeposited mortgage and transfer taxes and fees sitting in cardboard boxes, unable to be used by cash-strapped state, county and local governments.
The clerk's office is facing a lawsuit from the New York State Land Title Association, the trade group for title insurers, which contends that the Clerk, Harold W. McConnell, is failing to meet the county's obligation to record mortgages in a timely fashion and is leaving title insurers, banks and home-buyers vulnerable to fraud. The association fears that the delay in recording mortgages could allow banks to unknowingly lend money to people who have already borrowed more than the home's value.
Since the title insurers filed suit a month ago, the situation has worsened, despite the presence of a troubleshooter from the county's data processing unit. A 13-week backlog in recording mortgages has grown to 16 weeks.
On the court side of the County Clerk's operations, a 16-week lag in entering judgments has stretched to 19 weeks. Lawyers must wait three and a half weeks to obtain index numbers, which are needed to file lawsuits. In Suffolk County, the numbers are issued instantly.
A comparison with the Suffolk County Clerk's office, where computers were introduced seven years ago, offers a striking example of the importance of automation in keeping up with Long Island's growth, especially in tight fiscal times.
"This has reached the point of being an outrage," said A. Thomas Levin, head of the Nassau County Bar Association, which last week voted to bring suit against the clerk's office. "There has to be a tremendous change in attitude. Nassau is different and worse than most other counties in the state."
The Suffolk County Clerk, with a staff of 91, handles more than twice as many real-estate transactions as Nassau County. But Suffolk is only five days behind in recording and indexing mortgages, compared with the 16 weeks in Nassau.
 
Computers Save the Day
 In January, for example, Nassau recorded 1,704 mortgages. Suffolk, the busiest county in the state, recorded 4,493, according to the State Department of Taxation and Finance.
Edward P. Romaine, the Suffolk County Clerk who took office two years ago, said he accomplished this "with zero overtime." He called the county's early use of computers "the only thing that's kept us up to par.
Though other county officials blame Mr. McConnell for resisting computerization through the 1980's, Mr. McConnell said he had asked for his office to be automated in the early 1980's, but his appeals were ignored.
Mr. McConnell, a Republican in a county long dominated by the Republican Party, sent a memo pressing the Nassau County Department of General Services to supply him with computers in 1980.
Though funds were budgeted to computerize county offices throughout the 1980's, the various agency chiefs of Nassau County were forced to compete for technology.
Money that could have gone to Mr. McConnell's office was spent to computerize the police and health departments, the Nassau County Medical Center and the district attorney's office, said Gary Soricelli, the Department of General Services emissary now assigned to clear up the backlog .
Robert J. McDonald, a deputy to County Executive Thomas Gulotta, said Mr. McConnell, who has held the elected post of County Clerk since 1967, did not sufficiently press his case. "Do you think one memo in eight years is enough?" Mr. McDonald asked. "Most departments aggressively pursue these things."
Mr. Romaine, the Suffolk County clerk, said clerks' offices were typically the last to get capital funds, largely because when they function properly, they go unnoticed.
"Everyone uses us, and yet no one knows what we do," Mr. Romaine said. "It's because the county clerks don't make policy, and we're not viewed as a powerful office."
It is not only their reliance on computers that distinguishes Suffolk from Nassau, but their philosophies. Recording a mortgage in Nassau County is a lengthy and exacting process, with documents passing through 13 steps and employees checking over the same document several times. Until Mr. Soricelli arrived, employees actually took rulers to county survey maps to confirm the property boundaries in the deed.
"It's a different level of service," Mr. Soricelli said. "If it weren't for the backlog, I think title insurers would prefer Nassau to Suffolk."
Mr. McConnell estimated it would take the county nine months to catch up with the backlog; Mr. Soricelli estimates half that.
Several of the steps, such as keeping the preliminary and recorded "tickler" or index, are necessary only because there is a backlog. "The backlog is feeding itself," said Mr. Soricelli, who appears to have taken charge of the office.
 
Checks in Boxes
 In Suffolk, a title insurer usually gets the property's boundaries checked himself at a separate office, the Real Property Service Agency, before presenting documents to the clerk's office for recording. There, a single worker examines the papers, calculates the taxes and fees and collects them, usually with the title insurer sitting nearby during a scheduled appointment.
In Suffolk the fees are paid and deposited in interest-bearing accounts, usually within 24 hours.
In Nassau, the backlog has kept the county from immediately depositing mortgage taxes and fees that are often sent in with the documents. Mr. McConnell estimated that checks for millions of dollars were stuffed in boxes waiting to be deposited upon recording of the mortgages.
In an unusual step, the State of New York Mortgage Association, SONYMA, has warned that it will stop buying loans in Nassau County if title insurers stop issuing "gap insurance," which covers lenders from liens placed on property between the moment the house is bought and the time the mortgage is recorded.
The New York State Insurance Department has been canvassing title insurers to determine whether to order them to stop issuing gap insurance, which officials stressed would be a last resort.

HEADLINE: Life on Long Island Is Full of Slow Lanes

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, L.I.

 BODY:
Guido Bonelli lives in Ronkonkoma, nearly 50 miles from midtown Manhattan. In most metropolitan areas -- even in most parts of the sprawling New York region -- Mr. Bonelli's house would be outside the ring of densely populated suburbs. It would be surrounded by woods or open fields and he would drive to work on bucolic back roads.
But Mr. Bonelli lives in the heart of Long Island, and that means he fights his way each morning along the Long Island Expressway to the men's clothing store in the Walt Whitman Shopping Center here, where he works as a tailor. His route covers 16 miles, and would take no more than 25 minutes without traffic. Most days, however, the rush-hour commute takes nearly an hour. 
 "It's bad, very heavy," he said. "There are just not enough roads for the traffic."
 
Traffic as a Way of Life
 Highway congestion, while common in virtually all suburbs, is so severe on Long Island that it has had a profound impact on everything from the industries it attracts to the cultural fabric of its communities to the psyches of its citizens.
Commuters dream up elaborate routes on back roads to avoid the rush-hour crunch. Some say that they avoid driving on Sundays in warm weather because the traffic can be so overwhelming on beach days. And many residents say that they often plan their days with highway congestion in mind.
The facts are simple: Nassau and Suffolk Counties are home to 2.6 million people, most of whom now live and work within the confines of a long, slender sliver of land that is 105 miles long and only 23 miles wide at its broadest point. That means virtually everyone must travel east or west to reach their destinations, and they are served by only three major east-west highways.
"That's basically the major problem with the island, the traffic," said Anthony Serina, who drives around the region every day servicing directories, maps and display advertising at shopping malls. "That and taxes."
Mr. Serina is one of those whose life is ruled by traffic. He drives each workday from his home in Farmingville, a small community in the middle of Suffolk County, to malls across the New York region, including seven in Nassau and Suffolk. He says he has learned some fundamental truths: The afternoon rush hour begins at 3 P.M. on Long Island, and, he insists, it does not pay to use back roads.
Mr. Serina says he switches between the Long Island Expressway and the Northern State Parkway -- express routes that run parallel to one another -- in the hope of avoiding the worst tie-ups. "It kind of helps a little bit," he said. "But there's really no way around it. It's just part of Long Island."
Dozens of Long Islanders, in interviews at shopping malls and business districts, said they, too, accepted traffic as the price for living on the island, with its safe communities, good schools and terrific beaches.
John Lipori, a bank officer who works in Garden City, said a 10-mile trip east to Melville during the middle of the business day often takes 40 minutes. Tony Carfagno, a salesman of small electrical appliances, said that it takes him about 2 hours and 15 minutes -- each way -- to commute between his home in Babylon and his office in Manhattan.
"It's unreal," said Mr. Carfagno, who grew up in Delaware and moved to Long Island three years ago. "You just get acclimated to it. Either that, or you pull your hair out."
But many others said that they found the crush on the highways unbearable.
"A lot of times on Sundays, we won't go out because the traffic is so bad," said Joan Tibball, who is from Bay Shore and who is planning to move with her husband, Dan, to northern Nevada.
Dr. Mike Graham, a medical resident at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, is another who cannot make peace with the congestion. "I hate it, and I'm going to Syracuse on July 1," he said. "I'm dying to get off Long Island. The traffic is one of the reasons.
"People on Long Island think it's tolerable because they haven't been anywhere else," said Dr. Graham, who grew up in Lake Hopatcong, N.J., at the edge of the suburbs in western Morris County. "They don't know there isn't traffic everywhere else."
While there are just three major east-west highways on Long Island -- the Long Island Expressway and the Northern and Southern State Parkways -- there are six major highways that crisscross Westchester, a county with a population less than one-third of Long Island's. And in Bergen and Passaic Counties in northern New Jersey, which have a combined population that is less than half of Long Island's, there are five expressways.
 
Elaborate Warning System
 Long Island officials have tried a variety of strategies to alleviate the commuter crush. They have extended the Long Island Expressway's service roads through Nassau County into Suffolk, and they have installed an elaborate system of road sensors and computerized signs to warn motorists of congestion on the expressway and the Northern State. They also plan to begin widening the expressway, adding a fourth lane in each direction.
Although there is no more room for additional highways, expanding existing routes may solve much of the problem, said Dr. Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. With the widening of the expressway, he said, "Long Island will be reasonably well-served, from east to west."
Dr. Koppelman also contended that people sometimes exaggerate the congestion on Long Island.
Census data from 1990, when analyzed by the regional planning board, showed that the average Long Island commuter drives only six exits on the expressway, Dr. Koppelman said. The average trip from home to office was 34 minutes, he said.
 
Traffic Has Diminished
 Traffic on some roads has diminished somewhat during the last two years, apparently because of the recession. But data from traffic counters placed on more than a dozen highways and major roads by the State Department of Transportation show an uneven pattern.
The daily volume on the Long Island Expressway was slightly lower in the first three months of this year compared with the same period a year earlier, but the volume on other roads has been slightly higher.
"If you are from an area that has relatively light traffic, then the perception that Long Island has a lot of traffic may be correct," Dr. Koppelman said. "What people are really saying is that they are not used to the psychology of driving on Long Island."
Dozens of Long Islanders disagreed, saying that it was a question not of perception but of fact: There are just too many cars and not enough highways, they said.
But many also said that, while highways may flow better elsewhere, they were resigned to the roads at home. "I have no choice," said Mr. Bonelli, the men's tailor, "because I can find no other jobs."

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue Rally; Dow Up 30.41

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stock prices surged for a second straight session yesterday, buoyed by low interest rates and rallies in London and Tokyo.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.41 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 3,255.37. The Dow ended a week of wild price swings with a gain of 6.26 points. 
 Volume was a heavy 199.45 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues outpaced losers, 1,221 to 532.
"There are an awful lot of reasons to have an up day," said Gregory Nie, a market analyst at Kemper Securities.
Stocks continued to enjoy a lift from the Federal Reserve's move Thursday to cut interest rates, although a report yesterday of higher-than-expected inflation dampened hopes that rates would be cut further.
 
'Not Out of the Woods Yet'
 "It is a continuation of yesterday, but I think we are not out of the woods yet," said Ned Collins, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities. "There is still work to be done in terms of consolidation."
The Consumer Price Index rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March, the Labor Department reported, compared with expectations of a three-tenths of 1 percent gain.
As a result, bond prices fell, with the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond off almost a quarter of a point, or $3.44 for $1,000 face amount, pushing up its yield to 7.87 percent from 7.85 percent Thursday.
Nevertheless, Wall Street was spurred by strong rebounds in London and Tokyo.
In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average rose 1,252.51 points, or 7.6 percent, to close at 17,850.66, making up most of its losses for the week. It was the fourth-biggest surge ever on the Tokyo exchange.
"Some kind of rebound was inevitable, especially after the U.S. rate cut, though everybody is surprised the market has bounced this far," one Tokyo analyst said. "But it's too early to say whether we have touched bottom."
British stocks roared ahead by more than 5 percent, fueled by the election victory of the ruling Conservative Party. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks jumped 136.2 points, or 5.6 percent, to 2,572.6.
Some analysts doubted, however, that the rally in the United States would last, given the persistent doubts about first-quarter earnings, which are beginning to roll in.
"It was rather an exciting trip to nowhere," said Jim Schroeder, market analyst at MMS International. "Unless earnings are a bit better, it will be difficult to make a case for us to maintain this."
Indeed Intel dropped 6 1/8, to 51 1/8, on extremely heavy over-the-counter volume after the chip maker reported late Thursday that first-quarter earnings fell short of estimates.
The over-the-counter market as a whole did not share in Wall Street's rally, with the Nasdaq composite index off 2.51 points, to 584.24.
Analysts said shares were likely to resume trading in the fairly narrow range of the last few weeks until more corporate results provided guidance.
Among other active shares, Digital Equipment shed 3, to 45 1/4, after reporting a loss Thursday. Hewlett-Packard fell 4 3/8, to 74 1/4.
 
Bad Day for Computer Issues
 Microsoft fell 4, to 116, ahead of a court hearing on a suit filed by Apple Computer. Apple fell 1 3/4, to 55 1/2.
Telefonos de Mexico rose 1 5/8, to 56 1/4. Traders said Lehman Brothers. had added the company to its recommended buy list.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 3.65 points, to 404.29. The American Stock Exchange index rose 2.07, to 388.01.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.17, to 223.27. The average share fell 35 cents.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of Big Board, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq issues -- was 3,941.424, up 34.107, or 0.87 percent.

HEADLINE: Advance of 7.6% Halts Drop in Tokyo Stocks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 10

 BODY:
After a week of plunging prices and frayed nerves, Government action in the credit markets in both the United States and Japan finally arrested the slide in Japanese stocks. The market began a sharp, if unsteady, rise from the opening bell here today and posted its fourth-largest one-day gain in a spectacular rally.
Government officials and analysts welcomed the improvement after a two-week decline, but many noted that it still left the market with a big loss for the week and did not appear to have revived badly damaged investor confidence. 
 The 225-stock Nikkei index rebounded 1,252.51 points today, or 7.6 percent, to 17,850.66. In percentage terms, that was the fourth-largest gain on record.
Trading volume remained modest, however, which analysts said was a disappointing sign of the continuing nervousness of large investors. A total of about 380 million shares changed hands, the same as on Thursday, when the market shed 577.38 points. The advance today still left the Nikkei index down by nearly 4 percent for the week.
"It's encouraging, but with that volume it's unconvincing," said Liam Newberg, a senior analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. "We're waiting for more evidence."
The Governments on both sides of the Pacific helped start today's recovery. First, in New York the Federal Reserve eased short-term interest rates on Thursday, which helped start the big stock market rally on Wall Street. The Fed's move also helped prices in the Japanese Government bond market begin to rise after big declines earlier this week.
Then, after the markets opened here today, the Japanese Government organized more support in the Government bond market, buying a total of 500 billion yen worth of bonds. The bond rally infected stock traders, according to analysts, and added to the upward impetus.
 
No Change in Fundamentals
 "It was a pretty strong statement that they don't want the bond market to fall further, but this doesn't change the fundamentals of the economy and the market," said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist with Salomon Brothers Asia. "I think we've seen the end of the first wave of selling, but it will take more time for the market's psychology to mend. It doesn't fix any of the deeper problems the markets face."
Although it has not been clear precisely what began the relentless decline in prices for two weeks and the negative sentiment in the market, analysts have pointed out that the Japanese economy has been cooling in recent months and the number of bankruptcies has been rising. The economy actually showed negative growth in the fourth quarter of last year and most economists say they do not expect a rebound until the latter half of the year.
Nonetheless, Government officials have issued appeals to investors not to panic and to stop selling shares. "The current low level of stock prices does not reflect Japan's economic fundamentals," insisted Tsutomu Hata, the Finance Minister.
An important sign of how weak confidence remains is the fact that the news that seemed to hearten investors most came from overseas. In addition to the lowering of interest rates in the United States and the market rally, there were reports here that the United States would demand that Japan take firmer measures to stimulate the economy. This is precisely what many investors have been demanding.
The finance ministers of the leading industrial nations are expected to meet later this month to discuss a variety of subjects. Newspapers here reported today that the United States was expected to press the Japanese Government to raise spending and take other measures to insure that the economy picks up momentum.
Washington is concerned that a slowing Japanese economy will just force manufacturers to export their goods more aggressively and cause Japan's trade surplus to rise further. Already Japan is expected to report a record trade surplus this year of well over $100 billion, which is likely to fuel trade frictions with the United States and Europe.
All these factors, analysts said, are likely to keep some pressure on the economy and the stock market in coming days.

HEADLINE: Kenneth L. Dawson, 45, Is Dead; Led Gay and AIDS Organizations

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Kenneth L. Dawson, a leader and adviser of gay and lesbian and AIDS organizations, died on Thursday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan.
He was 45 years old and lived in Brooklyn. He died of complications from AIDS, said Jed Mattes, a friend. 
 Mr. Dawson was on the founding board of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in Manhattan in 1983. The center sponsors cultural, social and educational programs and provides offices and meeting space for numerous organizations for gay men and women.
From 1981 to 1987 he was the executive director of Senior Action in a Gay Environment, an organization for elderly homosexuals.
Starting in 1985 he also organized a series of national conferences for gay and lesbian leaders and advocates for AIDS services to share information and develop strategy.
Mr. Dawson was born in East Rockaway, L.I. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1968 and earned a master's degree in teaching from Antioch University in 1972 and also graduated from Columbia University's Institute for Not-for-Profit Management.
Earlier in his career, he was the director of the Calhoun Lower School in Manhattan and of the East Harlem Block Elementary School.
In recent years he was a partner and chief operating officer of Strub-Dawson, a direct-mail, fund-raising firm. He was also a consultant to nonprofit organizations and an adjunct teacher at the New School for Social Research's graduate school of management and urban policy.
His companion was Todd Hunter.
Mr. Dawson is survived by his mother, Marjorie Ruth Dawson of Epsom, N.H.; a brother, Steve of Brentwood, N.H., and a sister, Catherine Woodward of Dover, N.H.

HEADLINE: Judge Orders LTV Unit Sold To a French-Linked Group

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 10

 BODY:
A Federal bankruptcy judge in New York ended a tense, spirited auction of the aerospace and missile operations of the LTV Corporation today by ordering the sale of the unit to the Carlyle Group and Thomson-CSF for $450 million.
The decision, which came late in the afternoon after three days of dueling by opposing suitors, brought an immediate warning from the Martin Marietta Corporation, one of the losing bidders, that the deal could jeopardize the nation's military power. 
 Thomson-CSF, which will acquire the LTV missile unit's Army tactical missile system and the multiple-launch rocket system widely used in the Persian Gulf war, is controlled by the French Government.
"We were at a disadvantage, as any U.S. private firm would be, competing against a foreign government" in the auction for the LTV aircraft and missile unit, said Phillip Giaramita, a spokesman for Martin Marietta, a subcontractor on the Patriot missile program and the nation's eighth-largest military supplier.
"That is a pretty serious issue from an economic view these days, but it is heightened by the fact that we're talking about the sale of highly sensitive, national security assets flowing to a foreign government, no matter how friendly they might be," Mr. Giaramita said. "It's a matter of great concern."
Martin Marietta, joining with the Lockheed Corporation, offered $385 million, plus a royalty on future sales of the LTV unit, which is based in Dallas and has 12,000 employees. Judge Burton R. Lifland of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan indicated during the hearings that he delayed a decision until today in an effort to coax a higher offer from Martin Marietta and Lockheed.
In explaining his decision, Judge Lifland was quoted by Reuters today as saying that if the two companies' final offer "does come within the range of reasonableness, it only scrapes the bottom and cannot be considered the best offer."
The choice of Thomson-CSF and the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment firm whose principals include Frank Carlucci, a former Defense Secretary, made bitter losers out of Lockheed and Martin Marietta. The companies had signed a deal with LTV on Feb. 26 to pay $355 million for the unit.
A Lockheed spokesman, Scott Hallman, said that the company was "deeply disappointed" by the decision and that it would "voice our concerns over the national security and economic issues raised by foreign ownership of the defense industrial base."
LTV has been in bankruptcy since 1986. Most of the money raised from the auction of its once-prized aerospace and missile unit will go to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as payments for three LTV steelworker pensions that are underfunded by $3.1 billion.
The Government agency, which oversees corporation pension plans, said it favored the higher, Carlyle-Thomson bid. Richard Gelfond, an investment banker at Cheviot Capital in New York, who represented Thomson at the hearings, said other LTV creditor groups were nearly unanimous in backing the Thomson offer.
Carlyle will acquire the aircraft business, which assembles the mid-section of the B-2 bomber and tail sections for Boeing Company commercial planes, for $110 million in cash, plus $20 million in preferred stock and another $20 million in either preferred stock or notes. Before the auction began Wednesday, Carlyle's offer was $90 million in cash and $30 million in preferred stock.
 
Thomson-CSF Increased Offer
 Thomson-CSF increased its offer for the missile unit three times during the court hearings, to $300 million in cash, from $280 million. The military-electronics firm also agreed to pay $20 million to LTV if the deal is canceled.
Congress and the Bush Administration have approximately 90 days to oppose Thomson's role in the deal under rules of the Exon-Florio Act. Senator Daniel Inouye, the Hawaiian Democrat who heads the Senate panel governing military spending, said Thursday that he would ask the Defense Department to block a sale to Thomson if Judge Lifland approved it. An assistant to Senator Inouye said today that Senator Inouye might act as soon as next week.
But the Bush Administration may have a different view. Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a Washington research group, said the Pentagon and the White House had been silent on Thomson's role, implying that foreign ownership of military assets in some cases was now acceptable.
"That fits with what I see as a long-term trend here," Mr. Adams said. As military spending shrinks, private suppliers will increasingly link arms or trade assets across borders. "It has some troublesome implications, but I think it's inevitable," he said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index Jumps 0.5%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
Consumer prices posted their biggest increase in 17 months in March, climbing five-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department said today. The sharp rise prompted much surprise at first, but little dismay on closer analysis.
The increase, about twice as much as most analysts had expected and largely attributed to higher energy and food costs, sent an initial tremor through the bond market, pushing rates higher. But most of the loss was later recovered as analysts and traders found the rise marked by statistical quirks and temporary factors that in some cases have already been reversed.
"It doesn't seem to signal any sort of resurgence of inflation," asserted Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities. He said that every economic recovery in the last 40 years had shown inflation declining during its first year and that he saw no reason why the pattern should be different this time.
 
An Official's Viewpoint
 A relatively benign view was also taken by Patrick C. Jackman, a senior Labor Department economist in charge of studying prices and living conditions. "We are definitely still on track for an increase of less than 4 percent for the year," he said.
The hefty increase in retail prices followed by one day a reassuring report on inflation at the producer level that seemed to have encouraged the Federal Reserve to make another cut in an important short-term interest rate. The Labor Department said producer prices last month edged up just two-tenths of a percent.
For the first three months of the year, the Consumer Price Index has risen at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, slightly above the 3.1 percent rate posted for all of 1991.
Although some analysts, such as those at the New York investment firm of C. J. Lawrence, cling to inflation projections as low as 2 percent this year, the average annual inflation expectation of the 52 economists responding to the Blue Chip survey was reported today as 3.1 percent, unchanged from a month ago. For 1993, they expect inflation to be 3.6 percent.
But there are also those who found in today's figures confirmation of their view that inflation pressures are rising, although none saw a return to even half the double-digit inflation levels of a decade ago. This group expects that economic recovery will prompt companies to seek higher prices rather than greater market share.
Among them is Kathryn L. Kobe, economist at Joel Popkin & Company, a Washington firm headed by a former Labor Department price specialist. While finding that the March increase was exaggerated by "some strangeness in the seasonal factors," Ms. Kobe said she still expected the consumer index to advance by at least 4 percent this year.
The latest report included data for five major metropolitan areas, three of which recorded price increases higher than the five-tenths of 1 percent for the country at large.
For New York, the rise was seven-tenths of 1 percent, paced by a 1.4 percent jump in residential rents and a 1.7 percent jump in owners' rent-equivalency. Mr. Jackman said, however, it would be "a leap" to conclude from this that there has been a firming in the area's real estate market.
Prices in Philadelphia surged eight-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting a big increase for clothing, while prices in the San Francisco area rose six-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Energy and Food Rise
 Nationally, the department said, the speeding up of the inflation pace, from the three-tenths of 1 percent posted in February, mainly reflected an upturn in the price of energy and a faster rise for food, almost entirely in fresh fruits and vegetables.
Even when the erratic energy and food components were excluded, however, the advance was five-tenths of 1 percent, up from four-tenths of 1 percent in February and three-tenths of 1 percent in January.
Viewed yet another way, divided into indexes of goods and of services, the increase in each category was still five-tenths of 1 percent. The fact that the overall consumer index includes services and imported goods while the producer index does not, was cited as one reason, besides seasonal and statistical aberrations, for the difference between the two gauges.
Some analysts suggested that today's report, while not ruling out further action by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, made it highly unlikely the Fed would make such a move soon. As it was, some thought the Fed might have embarrassed itself by making an unexpected rate cut on Thursday and then seeing today's somewhat jarring data, even though the rate cut seemed to be largely a response to lagging M-2 money growth.
A Fed governor who is usually accessible declined to respond today to a request for comment.
The inflation figures showed food rising five-tenths of 1 percent, led by a 6.1 percent rise for fresh fruits and vegetables. Tomatoes soared 22.8 percent last month and have more than doubled since New Year's Day. Cereal and bakery products also rose, but the price of eggs dropped 9.9 percent.
Housing rose four-tenths of 1 percent, double the early-year advances, with fuel oil prices falling less than usual for the month and electricity climbing nine-tenths of 1 percent. Furniture and bedding jumped 1.9 percent.
 
Cars, Gas and Air Fares Go Up
 In transportation, where prices climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent after two straight monthly declines, the main factors were higher prices for gasoline, new cars and airline fares. Prices of used cars were unchanged after falling for three straight months.
Clothing prices, for which the seasonal adjustment factors are particularly suspect in light of shifting industry practices, rose six-tenths of 1 percent but this was less than February's 1.5 percent jump.
The cost of medical care, moderating slightly, rose five-tenths of 1 percent to a level 7.8 percent above that of March 1991. Elsewhere, entertainment rose four-tenths of 1 percent while such personal expenses as legal and financial services and funeral expenses advanced five-tenths of 1 percent to bring the first-quarter annual rate to 9.6 percent.
The index now stands at 139.3, meaning that a group of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-1984 period now costs $13.93.
An alternate gauge, the C.P.I.-W., covering urban wage earners and clerical workers, also rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Labor Department reported.

HEADLINE: 4 Whole Days Till Tax Time, So Why Panic?

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
If you are among the millions of taxpayers tackling Form 1040 this weekend, don't despair. Even though Wednesday is the tax-filing deadline, you can still avoid running afoul of the Internal Revenue Service and get any tax breaks you are entitled to.
The keys are completeness and accuracy, said Michael Janicki, a partner in Arthur Andersen & Company, the nation's largest accounting firm. 
 "There is a high degree of filing incorrect returns," he said. They are often a result of avoidable errors like the omission of income because of an overlooked Form 1099 from a bank or brokerage, incorrect math, incompleteness, the selection of the wrong number in the tax-rate tables, or the deduction of personal interest, which is no longer allowed.
If the taxpayer overlooks a Form 1099, the Internal Revenue Service is unlikely to do so. "Its computers are up and running," Mr. Janicki said, and they are quite efficient at comparing the income that taxpayers report with the service's own copies of the 1099's, and with the W2 forms that employers use to report wages and salaries. The computers are also sure to catch arithmetic errors and the other mistakes he cited.
 
Take a Break, and Double-Check
 Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and certified public accountant, advised taxpayers not to overlook any sources of interest, dividends and other income reported on Form 1099, and to see if there are any carry-forwards -- items from years past, like net long-term capital losses above $3,000 -- that should be shown on the return.
"If you work on it this weekend, put it away and double-check it the next day when you are fresh," he said.
Mr. Kess also advised taxpayers not to claim the standard deduction simply because it is easier, but instead to see what itemized deductions might be possible by completing Schedule A. Take whichever deduction is greater.
Sometimes a married couple can lower their tax bill by filing separate returns, if that enables one to itemize deductions, he said. For example, medical expenses can be deducted only if they exceed 7 1/2 percent of adjusted gross income, a threshhold that might be easier to meet on a separate return than a joint one.
Some deductions can be overlooked, Mr. Kess said:
*Clothing, books and furniture donated to charity are deductible. "Use some judgment in coming up with a reasonable estimate for what it is worth," he said. Give it a thrift-store value, not its original cost: "Don't be a pig." If the value is greater than $500, Form 8283 must be attached, showing the basis for the valuation.
*In deducting state and local income taxes, include any payment made last April 15, as well as any estimated taxes paid during the year and amounts withheld, as shown on Form W2. (But state tax refunds must be reported as income by those who itemize.)
*People who drive their cars for charitable purposes, like scout leaders or church volunteers, may deduct 12 cents a mile, plus tolls and parking.
 
Getting an Extension
 People who need more time to gather up information or feel insecure about the returns they have prepared should file a Form 4868 for an automatic four-month extension. Then they can double-check their returns or get professional help. But they are expected to pay their tax by the filing deadline.
Complex matters -- like home sales or refinancing, the alternative minimum tax, passive losses and the phase-out of deductions and exemptions for upper-income taxpayers -- are particularly likely to require professional help. This late in the tax season, most professionals will get extensions for any clients now approaching them.
Many taxpayers fear that filing for an extension may lead to an I.R.S. audit, Mr. Janicki said. But there is absolutely no evidence to support such an idea. On the other hand, he did say that sloppy or incorrect returns are likely to be questioned. The I.R.S. sent out inquiries on 4.5 million of the 110 million returns filed last year because of inconsistencies on 1099 and W2 forms, he said; such inquiries often result in the assessment of interest and penalties, as well as additional taxes.
Those who file Form 4868 must remember that they are receiving an extension to file, not an extension to pay. They are expected to pay their taxes when they file the form, estimating the tax liability accurately, and perhaps even overestimating it, to be safe. Any overpayment can be claimed as a refund when the return is filed.
For people who use personal computers, a big timesaver at the last minute can be popular computer programs like Turbotax, Macintax and Taxcut 1040. They print out their own forms, which are acceptable for filing, and they "interview" the taxpayer and provide checklists that help in avoiding errors and omissions, and in getting the math right. Of course, no program can make sure a user does not enter incorrect data or make other errors.
Thomas Hoglund, a C.P.A. who is the product-line manager for Arthur Andersen's A-plus Tax, a software package used by tax professionals, suggested that if you are unsure you have filled out your return correctly, have it reviewed by an accountant. Many charge less for a review than for preparing a return, he said.
Even if the return must be redone by the professional, he said you can hold down the fee if you have complete, well-organized data. You might save even more money if the data are on a computer disk from a tax program, a personal finance program like Quicken or Managing Your Money, or a spreadsheet like Excel or Lotus 1-2-3; in such cases, the accountant will not have to re-enter the data to use his own program.
 
If You Can't Pay, Don't Hide
 Avery E. Neumark, a partner in Weber Lipshie & Company in New York, noted that with the recession and job losses, some people owe taxes on money they earned early in 1991 but are unable to pay it now. They should file returns to avoid a late-filing penalty, he said, and work out a payment plan with the I.R.S.
The penalty for late filing is 5 percent of the amount due for each month or part of a month that the return is late, up to 25 percent of the tax due. There are also penalties for late payment, but they are lower, usually one half of 1 percent of the unpaid amount for each month the tax is not paid, up to 25 percent, as well as interest charges, currently 9 percent a year.
The I.R.S. says that taxpayers who cannot pay all their 1991 taxes on time should attach a letter to their returns explaining how they plan to pay the rest and include a telephone number so a representative can call to work out a payment agreement.
 
 
 
FINDING FORMS AT LAST SECOND
 Taxpayers who want to file their returns late will not find the necessary form, 4868, in the booklet that the Internal Revenue Service sends taxpayers.
If you need it or other less-common forms -- like 8829 for an office at home, 1040X for an amended return or 4562 for depreciation and amortization -- you must get them elsewhere. The I.R.S. will send forms if you call (800) 829-1040, but it's a bit late to call for the form for an automatic extension.
Few banks and post offices have tax forms anymore, but many public libraries have forms that can be photocopied for a small fee. The Ernst & Young Tax Guide 1992 (John Wiley & Sons, $12.95) also has final I.R.S. forms that can be clipped out or photocopied. And those willing to stand in line can get forms at I.R.S. offices.
The simplest source is a new private service, Forms-U-Need. For $5 a form, which is charged to Visa or Mastercard, you can call (800) IRS-4502, or (800) 477-4502, on a touch-tone phone and have forms sent immediately by fax, simply by following the telephone instructions. The fax must be photocopied for filing.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "I.R.S. Tips for Avoiding Mistakes"
 
Fran Crowley, assistant district direcotor for the Internal Revenue Service in New York, suggests these steps to avoid common filing errors and get speedier refunds processed. The refunds averaged $973.
 
If taking the standard deduction, use the correct one for your situation. People who are age 65 or over, or are blind, qualify for a larger standard deduction.
 
Use the label from your tax package in the name and address block on the return. If you do not have the package, be sure to use your correct Social Security number, address and ZIP code.
 
If sending in a payment, write your Social Security number, day time telephone number and "1991 Form 1040" (or 1040A or 1040EZ) on the check or money order.
 
Don't overlook tax benefits. For example, many eligible people fail to claim the earned inocme credit, which is available for most workers who make less than $21,250 and have a child. If you make so little that you aren't required to file a return, but you are entitled to the earned income credit, file a tax return, and the I.R.S. will send you a check for the credit.
 
Sign and date the return. When filing jointly, both spouses must sign, even if only one had income.

HEADLINE: A New Squeeze On Air Travelers

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
On most flights across the country, passengers have a limited choice of entertainment. They can watch a movie, read and on aircraft with two aisles, stretch their legs a bit.
But now, some airlines are increasing the number of single-aisle, or narrow-bodied, airplanes they use on long-distance domestic flights. This makes it important for long-distance travelers concerned about comfort to ask, when making their reservations, what type of plane they will be on. 
 "I am getting screaming calls from business travelers who are expecting wide-bodied planes," said Joe Brancatelli, the editor of Frequent Flyer, a travel magazine based in New York. "There are three seats on the right of the aisle and three seats on the left; end of discussion. If a flight attendant is in the middle of the aisle with a cart, you can't get through the plane."
The narrow-bodied aircraft typically used on long-distance domestic flights, mostly the coast-to-coast routes, is the Boeing 757. It seats up to 194 passengers, depending on the model used and the number of first-class seats.
While some airlines are increasingly using 757's on longer domestic flights, they are diverting their wide-bodied aircraft for new or expanded international routes, said Tim Smith, the spokesman for American Airlines. "You have to balance the planes that you have on hand," he said.
Recently, American announced it would use 757's when it starts a new service between New York and Seattle. And about 18 months ago, Delta Air Lines equipped its 757's with systems that show movies and play music on long-distance flights, said Neil Monroe, a company spokesman.
 
A Veritable Workhorse
 The aircraft, which has three seats on each side of a center aisle, is a virtual aerial workhorse. It can easily take off on short, high-altitude runways and has the range to make flights across the country.
But on the longer flights, the plane's single aisle and confining seats are drawbacks. When meals are being served, for example, it is more difficult to walk around the serving cart and to get to the restrooms. And the plane's seats are among the narrowest of any long-range aircraft.
"It would be my last choice for a long-distance flight," said Ed Perkins, the editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
Fortunately, travelers can easily learn what airplane they'll be on by asking their travel agent or the airline's reservation clerk. The same airline will fly different types of aircraft on the same route at various times of the day, so choices are available.
Delta sometimes uses 757's for its off-hour flights, according to Mr. Monroe, the company spokesman. United Airlines flies a 757 on one of its two daily flights between Boston and Los Angeles; on the second flight it uses a wider plane, the Boeing 767.
By contrast, the 767 has two aisles and wider seats.
"The 767 is about the most comfortable plane flying," said Mr. Perkins of Consumer Reports. "It is as good as it gets in economy class and I would always choose it."
Other aircraft with two aisles that are frequently used on long-range domestic flights are Lockheed's L1011, McDonnell Douglas's DC-10 and various models made by Airbus Industrie.
United also may soon use 757's on the five-hour flight between San Francisco and Hawaii, both Mr. Brancatelli and Mr. Perkins said. It is currently using the larger DC-10.
Recently, some travelers expressed concerns about flying on a Fokker F28 after one operated by USAir crashed during a snowstorm at La Guardia Airport in New York, killing 27 people. The possibility that the aircraft is prone to ice buildup on the wings has been raised as a possible cause of that crash.
But Mr. Perkins of Consumer Reports said other planes, including the DC-9, also might be susceptible to icing, a condition that makes taking off more difficult.
"Everyone gets scared of the plane that has had the last crash," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold Are Higher; Election Lift Seen for Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday, but the spotlight was on sterling following the Conservative Party victory in the British national election.
Gold prices were also higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $341.10 a troy ounce, up $1.60 from Thursday. Later, the Republic National Bank in New York quoted an ounce of gold bullion at $340.65, up $1.25. 
 Traders said the pound was likely to continue strengthening next week after Thursday's election gave the Conservative Party an unexpected majority in government.
Now that the political uncertainty is over, dealers said sterling could rise higher -- particularly against the German mark -- on renewed optimism over Britain's prospects for economic recovery. Other European economies, notably Germany's, face a downturn.
There was little United States news to affect the dollar yesterday, said Mike Faust, a currency dealer with MMS International. New economic data had marginal impact on the dollar, he said.
The Labor Department said consumer prices, jolted by sharp increases for food, gasoline and clothing, rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month.
It was the biggest increase in the Consumer Price Index in 17 months, but economists said it was unlikely to be repeated given the economy's prolonged weakness and the expected anemic recovery.
Traders also said the dollar was somewhat supported by the perception the Federal Reserve would not ease interest rates further. The dollar fell Thursday after the Fed added money to the nation's banking system.
The move was widely interpreted to mean the Fed had cut its target for the Federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans, from 4 percent to 3.75 percent.
Falling United States interest rates usually erode demand for the dollar by reducing returns on dollar-based holdings. In New York, the British pound was quoted at $1.7660, down from $1.7665 late Thursday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7655, from $1.7635 Thursday. The pound soared to finish at 2.8910 marks, up from 2.8595 marks.
The dollar was quoted at 132.85 Japanese yen in New York, up from 132.05 Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.51 yen, to 132.19. Later, in London, it was quoted at 132.85 yen.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with Thursday's late levels, were: 1.6360 German marks, up from 1.6165; 1.5080 Swiss francs, down from 1.7665; 5.5390 French francs, up from 5.4775; 1,232.00 Italian lire, up from 1,221.00, and 1.8675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18755.

HEADLINE: MARATHON;
Best American Men Are Running on Empty In Top Competitions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
The first three finishers today in the Columbus, Ohio, marathon for men will represent the United States in the Olympic marathon this summer in Barcelona, Spain. But, given the current state of American distance running, it might not matter who they are.
The last 10 years have provided dramatic evidence that even the best marathoners in the United States have little chance to win major international events like the Olympics. Whether the reasons relate to training, cultural differences, motivation or innate talent, Americans are lagging behind rivals from many other countries, including Japan, Mexico, Australia and African nations like Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania. 
 Recently, Americans have rarely broken through the ascending standards set by others. Steve Spence did it by finishing third at the world championships last summer in Tokyo, and so did Ken Martin, who had a second-place finish in 2 hours 9 minutes 38 seconds in the 1989 New York Marathon, the fastest time by an American in more than eight years.
Among the 149 recorded performances under 2:10, Americans account for only 12 of them, and the best, Alberto Salazar's 2:08:52 to win in Boston in 1982, ranks 48th on the list.
 
Taking to the Road
 While there may be no single explanation for the disparity, several factors seem to help explain it.
One is training methods. Without the kind of support programs that exist in other countries, which allow elite runners to focus on major events, many Americans subsist on the lucrative road-racing circuit in North America. That generally means running too often to follow a more disciplined training schedule for success in the marathon.
Frank Shorter, the last American to win an Olympic marathon, in 1972, contends that frequent road racing keeps too many runners away from the track, where they need to develop speed over 10,000 meters for faster times in the marathon.
Once a runner knows he can run the 10,000 in 27 minutes 30 seconds or better, his confidence increases substantially, as Shorter's did 20 years ago. Eight days before the Olympic marathon, he set an American record in the Olympic 10,000.
"So I could go into the marathon, knowing no runner was faster than I was over 10,000 meters," he said. "Psychologically, I was able to control the race. Our Americans are wondering which of 15 other people with better times at 10,000 is going to control the race."
 
10,000 Problems
 The American record at 10,000 meters is 27:20.56, run by Mark Nenow six years ago in Brussels. That time ranks eighth in the world and remains the only entry by an American in the top 10. The world record, 27:08.23, was set by Arturo Barrios of Mexico in 1989.
More telling is what happened in the 10,000 last year. Thirty-one athletes had faster times than the leading American, Shannon Butler (27:59.35), and 10 were Kenyans. In the marathon, the fastest American was Martin with his sixth-place finish of 2:12:06 in Berlin. But more than 40 other runners, including 12 from Japan, had faster times.
"Americans are not focusing on training for a race," Shorter said. "They're too focused on the American road-racing scene. They have become lulled into thinking they can race more often and still be successful in the big events."
Despite Japan's deep tradition for developing successful marathoners, with 3 on the top-10 list for 1991 by Track and Field News, Africans were prominent in other distance events, with 7 of the top 10 in the 10,000, 8 in the 5,000 and 8 in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Of those 23 athletes, 15 were Kenyans, many of whom will likely become marathoners.
 
Different Life Style in Africa
 Shorter and other runners, like Bill Reifsnyder, the defending champion and course-record holder in Columbus, cite training regimens as a reason Japanese and Kenyan runners, among others, have been more successful. They sometimes train as often as three times a day, a schedule few Americans would attempt.
Runners from Kenya and other African nations are also set apart by the social and economic conditions. Reifsnyder, one of the favorites with Martin, Bob Kempainen, Mark Curp and Spence, recalled a recent conversation that his friend Jill Hunter, the British distance runner, had. She was talking with William Mutwol, who was second in Kenya's 1-2-3 sweep of the world cross-country championships last month.
Mutwol told Hunter that Americans had it too easy, with cars to transport them everywhere. He told her of returning to Nairobi recently after a race abroad and then walking another 31 miles to his small village.
"Why didn't you run part of the way?" Hunter asked.
"Couldn't," he replied. "I was carrying my luggage."

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Rising Tax Load On Middle Class

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
TO the middle-class taxpayers who feel they are saddled with an unfair share of the nation's tax burden, H & R Block Inc., America's biggest tax-preparation firm, is saying, "You're right."
Block, which prepares one in seven of the country's tax returns, commissioned a study by the Tax Policy Research Project at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and released the results this week. "Middle-income taxpayers have been shown to bear increasing effective total tax rates over the last 15 years," the authors concluded. 
 "I believe the more money you make, the greater your ability to pay tax," Thomas M. Bloch, president of the company, said in an interview. "In 1977, we had a much more progressive system, and I would say it was fairer." The Tax Reform Act of 1986 slashed rates and eliminated deductions, with the intent of making the tax code simpler and fairer.
Mr. Bloch hastened to add, "We have a very good tax system in this country and it would be a mistake to throw it out, but we should bring back some progressivity -- it needs to be fine-tuned."
"We did this to help the people we serve," he said. "I'm hopeful that members of Congress will take a look at this and something will be done. I would like to think that tax relief for the middle class is not a dead issue," despite President Bush's veto of a tax bill with that intent last month. The President's main reason was that the bill did not lower taxes on long-term capital gains. Mr. Block agreed, saying, "There are real advantages to a lower capital-gains tax."
On the other hand, David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young, which serves a more affluent clientele, when asked about the study, said, "The country is a vast middle class, and that is why the middle class is bearing the brunt of the tax burden." A millionaires' surtax has populist appeal but would do little to reduce the deficit, he said, because there are relatively few millionaires.
The study, by Dr. Larry R. Garrison, executive director of the university's Tax Policy Project and an associate professor of taxation, and Wanda James, a research associate, analyzed the tax burden of 32 typical taxpayers over the last 15 years.
They used the following filing categories: single, head of household with one dependent, married filing jointly with no dependents, and married filing jointly with two dependents. They calculated taxes using average deductions, based on I.R.S. figures, for each of these categories in eight 1990 income groups: $15,000, $25,000, $35,000, $50,000, $75,000, $100,000, $150,000 and $200,000. They focused on the years 1977, 1984, 1988 and 1990 -- when key tax laws had taken full effect.
"The wealthy received the greatest tax-cut benefit between those years, with decreasing benefits accrued to taxpayers with lower income levels," the authors wrote.
They found that the effective income tax rate (that is the percentage of income actually paid in taxes, as opposed to the marginal tax rate, which is the rate paid on the last dollar earned) for a married couple filing jointly with no dependents in the lowest income group went from 4.2 percent in 1977 to 5.5 percent in 1990, while their total Federal tax burden including Social Security and Medicare taxes went from 10 percent to 13.1 percent.
A couple with income of $50,000 saw their income taxes drop to 11.7 percent, from 14 percent, but their overall taxes rose to 19.3 percent, from 18 percent. In contrast, the couple with $200,000 of income saw their effective income tax rate drop to 21.7 percent, from 30.2 percent, and their overall rate drop to 23.6 percent, from 31.2 percent.
The authors said that they strongly recommended "a more equitable distribution of the Federal tax burden across all income groups." They added that they opposed raising taxes on the middle class to reduce the deficit, invite investment and pay for "sorely needed domestic programs."
To be sure, not all tax experts agree. The authors drew general conclusions from 32 sample tax returns without reference to macroeconomic data.
Mr. Berenson called it "flawed, divisive, almost jingoistic," to pit the middle class against the wealthy. "The biggest problem facing the United States is not someone's perception of equity," he said. "The biggest problem is the loss of jobs, economic position. The greatest benefit you can give the middle class is a job."
Mr. Berenson contends that the country needs incentives for more jobs, capital formation, deficit reduction and economic stimulus to make American industry more competitive.
Furthermore, he said, it is a mistake to lump payroll taxes, which are intended to provide old-age and disability benefits, with income taxes.
Professor Garrison said he had done so because "a lot of people see it as another tax, just like the income tax." He added, "They don't see the benefit at the other end."
He and Mr. Berenson agreed on one point. Payroll taxes -- a flat 7.65 percent on both employees and employers for Social Security and Medicare -- are regressive for both individual taxpayers and for business.

HEADLINE: Democracy's Checkpoint

 BODY:
Millions of Americans are hunched over desks and dining room tables this weekend, struggling to meet Wednesday's deadline for filing Form 1040. Too many will skip right past the check-off boxes at the top -- the place to cast your vote for fair Presidential campaign financing.
Each "yes" vote sends a dollar to the fund that finances campaigns and nominating conventions and diminishes the influence of special interests. Voting "no," or not at all, invites a return to the bad old days of unlimited spending and unrestricted fund-raising. 
 Federal financing was established in 1974, in the wake of the 1972 money-laundering scandals. Fixed amounts are allocated for party conventions and their nominees' campaigns; the rest goes, on a matching basis, to primary candidates who qualify by raising $100,000 from small personal donations.
The check-off peaked in 1980, when 41 million taxpayers fed the fund $41 million. It has since fallen back to about $32 million each year -- weak support from the nation's 110 million taxpayers.
Among taxpayers who filed early this year, substantially more checked "yes" than early filers last year did. Whatever the reason, not yet known, that's good news for now but no guarantee for the future. Indeed, the Federal Election Commission estimates it will come up at least $75 million short for the 1996 elections.
People may be disinclined to finance the election of any politician these days. One reason is the corrosive flow of unrestricted "sewer money" contributions that skirt the limits on candidates' national campaigns by funneling funds through state organizations that support them.
It's up to Congress to stanch this corruption of a worthy concept, and to fix the basic financing formula while there's still time. Campaign costs have soared, but the check-off remains at $1; it should be raised to $2.50 or $3, and then indexed to keep pace with inflation.
Taxpayers can help, too, by checking "yes."

HEADLINE: What Coated Windows Can Do

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Because efficient windows are critical to solving many environmental and economic problems I was happy to see your March 21 Consumer's World page article bring these issues to a wide readership. 
 Use of new kinds of windows will save consumers in the United States more energy than is now supplied by the Alaskan oilfields. Windows using low-emissivity coatings, argon gas and insulated frames are all cost-effective in saving huge amounts of energy now lost through windows.
Unfortunately, the experts you consulted gave some misleading and outdated information, which may lead readers to mistaken choices of window technologies. The following four points need correction.
You compare soft and hard low-emissivity, or low-e, coatings, concluding that soft coatings (including Heat Mirror) perform better in containing indoor heat and repelling outdoor heat and ultraviolet rays, while hard coatings are more durable.
Tradeoffs between durability and performance are no longer necessary. I invented completely durable hard low-e coatings that outperform other low-e coatings. Libbey-Owens-Ford and Pilkington Glass have marketed them since 1989. In cold weather, these products conserve more energy than soft coatings, because the hard coatings let more free solar heat into a window. In warm climates, hard coatings are more economical in cutting air-conditioning costs. Hard coatings are durable enough to be used on inexpensive single-glazed windows, which are traditional in Southern architecture.
Readers may incorrectly conclude that all hard coatings have about the same performance, because you report that they vary only slightly in heat reflectivity, from 74 percent to 80 percent. But commercially available hard-coated products have widely different heat reflectivities: Pilkington's K-Glass, 82 percent; Libbey-Owens-Ford's Energy Advantage, 80 percent; A.F.G.'s Comfort-E2, 80 percent; Ford's Sunglas HR, 65 percent; P.P.G.'s Sungate, 63 percent, and A.F.G.'s Comfort-E, 55 percent.
The top three products are so efficient that they are net collectors of solar energy even in this country's coldest winter climates, whereas the lowest three are net losers of energy.
You suggest that saving energy with low-e glass may require a tinted window. Now, however, the best-performing hard low-e coatings have no tint or color at all.
You incorrectly state that hard low-e coatings have a problem with sealing in argon gas and imply that soft coatings do not have such a problem. But it is the soft coatings that have this problem. The glue, which is used to keep the argon inside the double glazing, does not stick to the soft coating. Therefore in production, the soft coating must be carefully removed from the entire edge of the glass sheet. In contrast, the glue sticks even better to the hard coatings than to glass.
It is easy to be misled by the competing claims for various products. An energy rating system is needed for windows, similar to the one that is now used for household appliances. The ratings should show the energy cost of using each product in a particular climate zone. Such a rating system is being introduced in Canada and California, and ought to be adopted elsewhere.

HEADLINE: As Economy Drops in Japan, Chiefs Vie for Top Cut in Pay

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 10

 BODY:
American executives often wince and stumble for explanations when their hefty pay packages are compared with the relatively modest compensation received by their Japanese counterparts.
Now the comparison is becoming even more uncomfortable: With Japan's economy hitting the wall and corporate profits dropping, industrial leaders here are suddenly competing with each other to see who can absorb the deepest pay cut. 
 In the last few weeks alone, the chiefs of companies like Hitachi, Fujitsu, IBM Japan and Japan Airlines have called in reporters to say that with business this bad, they are slashing their base pay by upward of 35 percent.
 
'Sign of Our Resolve'
 At the Ricoh Corporation, one of Japan's leading makers of copiers, the company is about to post its first operating loss in decades. Hiroshi Hamada, Ricoh's president, has already taken a 20 percent pay cut. And a few weeks ago the order went out to the company's top executives: Each one must walk around with a formal letter of resignation in his breast pocket.
"It is more a ritual kind of resignation than an actual one, and that could be easily misunderstood in the West, where there is no real equivalent," said Hiroshi Sakagami, a company spokesman, who said none have been accepted. "But it is symbolically important as a sign of our resolve to improve business performance."
Without question, some of the announced pay cuts seem more than a little self-serving. Many executives seem to be hoping that their sacrifices will overshadow some extraordinarily poor decisions and loose spending in the boom times that suddenly ended last year.
But coming just months after the trip here by President Bush was tainted by his accompanying entourage of high-paid executives, several of whom run companies in far worse shape than their Japanese competitors, the political symbolism of the Japanese cuts seems particularly stark.
"In America in tough times, executives might cut their big bonus pay for the year," said Stephen F. O'Byrne, a principal in Towers Perrin, a consulting firm that tracks some executive pay issues. "In Japan, they cut the base salary. That sends a very different message."
While some American executives have also seen their compensation decline, most stock-bonus plans and profit-sharing incentives work according to strict formulas, allowing executives to gather wealth in good years and leaving them little downside risk. The base salary cuts, however, are usually regarded as a more serious -- and often longer-lasting -- matter.
Even with corporate losses, the base pay of American executives does not usually go down, although their performance-based bonuses and other compensation often does. Last year, for example, Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, received a rise in base pay of about 6 percent, to $976,378, although his total pay package, including bonuses and incentives, shrank by more than a third. Robert L. Crandall, chairman of the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, said his base pay of about $600,000 had stayed the same for three years of lower profits and losses. His total compensation in 1990 was off by about a third.
The Japanese are hardly cutting their pay to satisfy shareholders, as have some big American companies. Shareholders here have far less clout than in America. For the Japanese, pay cuts are just another form of apology, perhaps a little more meaningful than a deep, remorseful bow on national television when record-low earnings are announced, but a little less permanent than ritual suicide -- also not unheard of in Japan's unforgiving corporate landscape.
No one is quite sure how much Japanese executives are hurting because no one is quite sure how much they get paid. While many American companies must report such figures in public filings, the Japanese requirements are far less stringent.
 
Plenty of Privileges
 But in 1990, according to estimates made by Graef Crystal, an executive pay expert and professor at the University of California at Berkeley, the chief executives of America's biggest companies typically made about $3.2 million. The comparable figure in Japan is slightly more than $500,000.
But Japanese executives also receive perquisites that make their lives considerably more luxurious than the salary figures would suggest. Most live in company-supported houses or luxurious apartments in exclusive neighborhoods in Tokyo and Osaka, far out of the reach of ordinary white-collar workers. Their expense accounts are virtually unlimited and little scrutinized.
Like many American executives, they are often given club memberships, especially to golf clubs; the difference is that in Japan, such memberships would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Unlike American executives' perks, theirs are almost all nontaxable.
"People make too much of this whole thing about compensation," said Harold A. Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, when he was repeatedly challenged on the pay issue during Mr. Bush's visit here in January. "If you spend time scrutinizing Japanese pay, you'll discover they are living very nicely."
Few top American executives, however, would trade their own package for a Japanese one. Mr. Poling, for example, got a total of $1.14 million in pay and other compensation last year, down 6.6 percent from 1990, even though his base pay was unchanged. Japanese auto executives have not been announcing pay cuts lately, but they get only about half of what Detroit chiefs get.
And Japan's tradition of stable, lifetime employment often stops at the board room door. These days especially, the tenure of a Japanese executive can be strikingly short.
 
Many Ousted Recently
 In recent months, many top executives have been demoted or expelled, usually for lending out company money for speculative real estate deals that have gone sour.
In the latest such case, two leading executives of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the Japanese consumer electronics concern known for its Panasonic products and its ownership of MCA Inc. were stripped of their titles and sent to the corporate dungeon for $1.3 billion in bad loans. Among the victims was Masahiko Hirata, Matsushita's powerful executive vice president and one of the architects of the acquisition of MCA. Akio Tanii, Matsushita's president, apparently had no knowledge of the deals, but took a self-imposed 50 percent cut in pay for six months for lax supervision.
The Japanese press reported that the demotions did not follow any calls for blood from shareholders, but rather from employees. "It is like taking the money with which you can build three or four fine factories, and dumping it into the sewer," one executive was quoted as telling Aera magazine, a popular Japanese monthly.
The strongest evidence that pay cuts are a Japanese cultural phenomenon comes when one compares what has happened at IBM Japan and at its corporate parent, the International Business Machines Corporation. Late last year I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, came to Tokyo and declared that Takeo Shiina, the president and chief executive of IBM Japan, was a "hero of the I.B.M. Corporation," despite widespread troubles at the Japanese subsidiary that led to a 32 percent decline in net income last year.
 
Reward Is a Cut
 Apparently the reward for heroism at IBM Japan these days is a 10 percent cut in pay. Vice presidents, senior managing directors and managing directors of the company are all taking 8 percent cut pay cuts.
But Mr. Shiina's example is not being followed at I.B.M.'s corporate headquarters, which had a lot worse year than the Japan operation. Worldwide, I.B.M. lost $2.83 billion last year, down from a profit of $6.02 billion in 1990, but Mr. Akers's base pay of $925,000 has stayed the same. The company points out, however, that the total compensation package of Mr. Akers has declined 40 percent, to $1.58 million, because of a large drop in his bonus pay and stock options.
Probably the broadest pay cuts have come at Hitachi. Operating profits at the electronics giant dripped to 120 billion yen, or less than $1 billion, meaning that the huge company eked out a smaller profit than tiny Nintendo, the video-game maker. Eight executives, including the chairman and president, will take a 15 percent cut in their salary, and other board members will suffer a 10 percent cut. The company also announced that 9,000 managers would forgo a scheduled 4.7 percent raise.
 
The 'Me, Too' Industry
 The Hitachi announcement set off a flurry of other cuts in the electronics industry, known for its "yokonarabu" tendencies, a term that roughly translates as "me, too." Fujitsu said last week that it would cut salaries for top executives 15 to 35 percent and freeze the pay of other managers. Yamaha said its president's pay would be cut 20 percent.
"If there is a pay cut, it creates a feeling of a kind of crisis," said a Fujitsu spokesman, Yuri Momomoto.
That, in the end, may be what is at work in the pay cuts. Japan, many Japanese executives have lamented in recent months, not only got rich in the 1980's but fat and happy. And nothing makes the Japanese work harder than a crisis.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: California;
Strategies Emerge in Dual Senate Races

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 10

 BODY:
John Seymour's first television commercials for California's June 2 senatorial primary neglect to mention that he is a Senator, but tell viewers that Congress "has botched things up" and is "the epitome of arrogance."
The advertisements have led the Democratic candidates and Mr. Seymour's critics in the Republican Party to call him a hypocrite for disguising the fact that he was appointed to fill the comfortable chair on Capitol Hill that belonged to Gov. Pete Wilson until 1990. 
 But the commercials have aptly captured the commanding theme of anti-incumbency in the primary campaigns here. Californians will chose candidates for two Senate races, the first such political free-for-all in the state.
"In the old days you came back home and bragged about how influential you were in Washington," said Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of The Cook Political Report, a newsletter that tracks Congressional and Presidential races. "Now everyone is running as an outsider."
 
The 'Thornburgh Mistake'
 Dianne Feinstein's campaign manager agreed. "You have to run against the establishment now," said the manager, Ken Kuwata, whose candidate has a wide lead in the polls against her Democratic opponent, Comptroller Gray Davis, and is also running ahead in a matchup with Mr. Seymour. "Nobody is going to make the mistake that Dick Thornburgh did in Pennsylvania and say, 'I know the halls of power.' "
The choices in the two primaries, one to pick candidates to contest for the seat being vacated by Senator Alan Cranston and the other to fill out the remaining two years of Governor Wilson's term, will send a loud message about the importance of incumbency.
Though most of the candidates are insiders by one definition or another, those who serve in Congress are considered more vulnerable, at least for the moment, than those who walk the corridors of the State Capitol.
"The single most visible object of scorn is Congress," said Roy Behr, campaign manager for Leo McCarthy, California's Lieutenant Governor, who is ahead in polls in the Democratic race against two members of the House of Representatives, Barbara Boxer and Mel Levine.
Several other themes are also expected to play out here: the political significance of sex and wealth, the prospects for the right wing of the Republican Party and the role of foreign policy in an election year so far dominated by domestic malaise.
Democratic women, who along with the other Senate candidates from their party will be on display at a state convention this weekend in Los Angeles, are running in both primaries. Ms. Feinstein, the former Mayor of San Francisco and a failed candidate for governor, is seeking the two-year seat, and Representative Boxer is seeking the six-year seat.
The voting will help answer the question of whether the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, and the anger that many women expressed at the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee, have made women significantly stronger as candidates.
 
Women Want Their Own
 "Gender consciousness has increased immeasurably," said William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. "Being good on women's rights is not enough anymore. Women are saying, 'We have to have our own.' "
Ms. Feinstein is not known here as a woman's woman, and her record as Mayor left some feminists leery. In her first setback of the young campaign, Ms. Feinstein was sued last week by the State Fair Political Practices Commission, and will likely be fined, for improperly reporting millions of dollars in campaign money in her 1990 run for governor.
Ms. Boxer won notice last fall when she led a group of seven female lawmakers up the steps of the Capitol in Washington, protesting the slowness of the Judiciary Committee's inquiry into allegations that Judge Thomas had sexually harassed an aide.
Since then, however, Ms. Boxer's campaign stumbled with the disclosure that she had overdrawn her checking account at the House bank. Many analysts say her Senate bid is doomed, but she has responded with disarming good humor to headlines about "Barbara Bouncer," saying, "My closets aren't neat either" and predicting that voters will still find her the candidate best able to tweak the Washington establishment.
"One of my opponents is from the most powerful political machine in Southern California," she said. "The other is from the Sacramento machine. It's not like I'm running against H. Ross Perot."
The Sacramento candidate is Mr. McCarthy. The Southern California candidate is Mr. Levine, an obscure Congressmen who was invisible through the early months of the campaign as he built a huge treasury. But late last month he began a $3.5 million television advertising campaign that will bring him into California living rooms more times each week than all the network news anchors combined.
Mr. Levine's blitz, which brags that he "wrote no bad checks," could knock Mr. McCarthy out of the lead he now holds in the polls and push Ms. Boxer from the No. 2 spot.
 
Testing Bounds of Money
 "Mel's campaign will test how far you can get with money," Mr. Schneider said. "I can't think of anyone who's used such a deliberate strategy of waiting and blanketing the state with ads. He's literally trying to buy the California primary."
The gamble is a big one. Duane B. Garrett, Ms. Feinstein's campaign chairman, noted that any major world event, like a Middle East conflict, could drown out Mr. Levine's message.
Even more likely to upstage him is a vigorous Presidential campaign here by Edmund G. Brown Jr., California's native son. "A lot of Mel's strategy depends on the California Presidential primary not mattering," said Bruce Cain, associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley.
The two Republican primaries here will draw clear ideological lines like the Goldwater-Rockefeller struggles of old. These races are expected to be particularly heated if Patrick J. Buchanan runs hard in the nation's final Presidential primary and thus galvanizes his right-wing supporters.
 
Big Test for Governor
 More than the Republican candidates themselves, the big winner or loser here in June will be Governor Wilson, who selected, coached, bankrolled and endorsed Mr. Seymour. Mr. Seymour's main opponent in the primary is Representative William E. Dannemeyer, one of the most conservative members of Congress, who made his mark excoriating homosexuals. Also in this race is William Allen, a graduate school professor and a member of the United State Civil Rights Commission.
So far, Mr. Wilson has stayed out of the second primary race, a more competitive contest that pits Representative Tom Campbell, a former Stanford University economist, against Bruce Herschensohn, a right-wing television commentator.
The Campbell-Herschensohn race is thought to be a clearer ideological test because Senator Seymour is a recent convert to moderate positions regarding abortion rights and environmental protection, while Mr. Campbell has consistently held such views.
Running against these two is Mayor Sonny Bono of Palm Springs.
Both primaries will test the strength of the conservative wing of the party, which propelled Ronald Reagan to victory as Governor and then to the Presidency, but has lately lost strength.
"These races will demonstrate whether the religious right is still powerful and whether the anti-gay issues are a major political force," Mr. Schneider said.
Another motif here is how foreign policy will play as campaign issue. Both Mr. Levine and Ms. Feinstein were vocal last year in support of the Persian Gulf war, distinguishing themselves from the rest of the Democratic field.
"A year ago everybody thought this would be the key issue," said Tony Coehlo, the former House Democratic whip. "Now it doesn't matter and it might be a negative."
So far Mr. Levine is the only candidate announcing loud and clear that he is a Washington player. "My ads make very clear that I am Congressman Mel Levine running for Senate," he said. "I am certainly not trying to define myself as an outsider because I am not one."

HEADLINE: Reichmanns And Official In Dispute

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 10

 BODY:
Because of a clash with the secretive Reichmann brothers over financial disclosure, Thomas S. Johnson, the president just hired to head their company, Olympia & York Developments Ltd., is likely to miss a crucial meeting with creditors on Monday, banking and company officials said today.
 "Let's say that I'd fall over a chair if I saw Mr. Johnson there," said an Olympia official who asked not to be identified. 
Mr. Johnson is the former president of the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation in New York who was appointed only two weeks ago to lead Olympia & York's debt reorganization.
 
No. 2 to Lead Talks
 Heading the talks instead will be Robert S. Miller Jr., who helped save the Chrysler Corporation from collapse in the early 1980's and who was second in command to Mr. Johnson on the giant real estate company's planning and finance committee.
 Olympia issued a statement saying that the role of Mr. Johnson, who continues to hold the title of president, is being "redefined."
 Mr. Miller and Paul Reichmann, the family's chief strategist, are preparing a plan that will analyze each of the more than 50 prime commercial properties of North America's biggest landlord and how Olympia plans to deal with any individual financing problems related to those properties, officials said.
 But Olympia, though still believed to have assets well in excess of its $18.5 billion of debts, is resisting providing global data on its overall financial position.
 Officials said this resistance was at the bottom of the dispute with Mr. Johnson, who felt it was essential to give the banks a full financial picture of the natural resources and real estate empire created over the last two decades by the Reichmann family.
 Another Olympia executive said that Mr. Johnson was upset that his compensation package had not been agreed to and that he left Toronto on April 3 refusing to return unless his demands were met.
 Mr. Miller issued a statement denying there was any rift over disclosure between the rescue team and the Reichmanns.
 It was uncertain what impact Mr. Johnson's absence would have on what amounts to the largest private- sector debt restructuring in history. Olympia's debt load is as high as many third-world countries during the debt crisis of the 1980's.
 "My own sense," said Alain Tuchmaier, financial services analyst for McLean McCarthy Inc., "is that so much is at stake that the importance of a single individual is overwhelmed by the need for the restructuring process to go forward."
 
Big Meeting Monday
 Yet the divisions between Mr. Johnson and the Reichmann family could have echoes at the big Monday meeting. Burns Fry Ltd., Olympia's Canadian investment bankers, have retained the Dominion Ballroom of the Sheraton Center Hotel, one of the city's largest meeting places, and are expecting 400 to 500 representatives of banks, insurance companies, lawyers, accountants and others.
 "I still think the banks are going to persist in demanding global disclosure," one senior bank official commented. "They have to be able to assess the total picture before they go into a restructuring."
 Olympia's cash troubles, which have seen it narrowly miss defaulting on several bond issues and failing to repay a bank loan of $450 million (Canadian), or $378 million (United States), that came due April 1, have been brought on by the recession, declining commercial real estate values and upward spiraling costs at its $7 billion Canary Wharf development in London.
 Mr. Miller, who had been vice chairman of Chrysler, left the automobile company earlier this year to become a partner at James D. Wolfensohn Inc., a financial advisory firm in New York, amid speculation that he was not in the running to become Chrysler chief executive. After the Reichmanns retained the Wolfehsohn firm he came to Olympia as Mr. Johnson's deputy.
 
Tough Tactics Expected
 Mr. Miller is expected to use tactics similar to those he employed in the Chrysler restructuring, negotiating hard with each creditor. That style is said to appeal to Paul Reichmann and his two brothers, Albert and Ralph, who are not only anxious to keep a lid on the operations but reluctant to approve any asset or equity sales that the banks may seek.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Turns Hollow

BYLINE: By Saskia Sassen; Saskia Sassen, professor of urban planning at Columbia University, is author of "The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo."

 BODY:
Japan's bubble economy has burst, revealing systemic problems that preceded the country's recession and are likely to worsen in the future. Some commentators speak of the "hollowing out" of the economy, even of the shrinking of the industrial base. The ailments run so deep that it is deluding to imagine that Japan's economy can serve as a model to remedy our own problems.
Aside from the dramatic rise and fall of the Nikkei index, corporate failures are at a postwar high. Banks are suffering from bad real estate loans and the collapse of the real estate market. The Government is having trouble covering its obligations from expected revenues. 
 Mines, steel factories and shipyards where profits have declined have been closed. Large-scale unemployment in the affected regions has led the Government to designate 38 depressed areas as eligible for special assistance.
And while urban ills have not plumbed the depth of poverty found in New York and London, economic decline and forced displacement of thousands of working-class people in Tokyo have created inner-city problems that are familiar in the West.
Like American companies, Japan's companies seek low wages and high profits by going abroad. By 1989, Japanese companies had set up some 40 factories in Mexico to produce electronics components and auto parts for their U.S. factories. By 1990, they had opened hundreds of plants in Thailand to produce parts and components for their factories in Japan. And in 1991, employment in the manufacturing sector fell by 4 percent.
Since the mid-1980's, manufacturing has been losing its wage-setting power. Increases in earnings for full-time workers in establishments with 30 or more employees have fallen yearly, from 5 percent in 1985, to 3 percent in 1988, to 1 percent in 1990.
While wages in manufacturing are stagnating, professionals in finance are earning the highest salaries ever, if they are men. Women tend to do part-time work, and there is a rapidly increasing number of part-time and casual jobs throughout the economy. The gap between part-time and full-time salaries has increased. In 1977, part-time workers earned 80 percent of full-time earnings; today they earn 60 percent.
There is less job security and more work-related stress. Only 22 percent of all workers have the much-touted lifelong tenure. Many workers suffer from chronic fatigue and work-related illnesses; since 1989, an average of 10,000 a year have died of diagnosed work-related cerebral hemorrhages. Many Japanese will never own a home. There now are 90-year mortgages, which give people a chance to buy a home over three generations.
Household debt, as a percentage of disposable income, rose from 77 percent in 1980 to 114 percent in 1990. (For the U.S., the 1990 figure was 103 percent; for Germany, under 80 percent.)
Everyone pays very high prices for food, clothing and household goods. Except for cars, Japan's manufactured goods are about 50 percent more expensive at home than abroad, and imported goods cost about 80 percent more than in New York, Paris or London.
All this points to a widening chasm between the high-living newly rich and the newly poor -- blue- and white-collar workers struggling to maintain their standard of living but losing ground. At the bottom is a growing mass of the destitute -- day laborers who have lost all Government protection because their numbers have become unmanageable, old people who have become homeless and new illegal immigrants from Asia.
Nowhere is the gulf clearer than in Tokyo. Next to the glamorous central business district lies what might be called the "other Tokyo," a broad area long occupied by the low-income working class and small-scale factories.
In the 1980's, during savage competition to accumulate enough small parcels of land on which to build and expand the business district, some companies resorted to organized crime to meet their needs. Arson and terror were used to drive out longstanding occupants. Criminality and vandalism are growing. There are increasing numbers of homeless old people whose children have left for the suburbs and two-hour round-trip commutes to work.
For 10 years, the world, looking through the bubble, thought Japan's economic leaders had found a better way. Japan built an industrial powerhouse, based on impressive technical development, that came to dominate global markets.
All this was built at a price. The price is now being paid.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Life's Tragic, but Julie Hagerty's Funny

BYLINE: By ANDY MEISLER; Andy Meisler has written about television for TV Guide and California magazine.

 BODY:
Here's one way to look at it: Julie Hagerty is finished in Hollywood -- at least in sitcoms, at least for now. Gone -- under circumstances both mysterious and ridiculous -- is her starring role in the CBS comedy "Princesses." Gone, too, for that matter, is "Princesses." Just a fond memory is her Universal Studios dressing room; ancient history is her shiny red rented sports car; available for occupancy is her former West Coast base of operations -- an, er, interesting house in the Hollywood Hills.
Who's discouraged or surprised by all this? Not Ms. Hagerty, who can be seen these days in "Noises Off," Peter Bogdanovich's film version of Michael Frayn's backstage farce. In "Noises Off," the actress, who is in her late 30's, plays Poppy Taylor, the spectacularly ineffectual assistant stage manager of a dysfunctional theatrical troupe. 
 In real life, as movie-star profiles put it, she is back in her beloved Upper West Side apartment, where she has been, as they say, mulling her options. In this case the options include: shopping, going to Riverside Park for a frolic with her breadbox-sized Boston terrier, Raisin, or visiting a friend.
The past four months, she says, have been a veritable orgy of theatergoing, aerobics classes and sumptuous, straight out-of-the-Ragu-jar spaghetti dinners. The decidely mixed reviews for "Noises Off" haven't exactly catapulted her to the cover of Vanity Fair.
Has unemployment been trying? "Oh, heavens no! I'm happy as a clam," says Ms. Hagerty in the breathy soprano familiar to fans of her stage and film work. Familiar also are the high cheekbones, the long auburn hair pulled back Alice-in-Wonderland style, and the expression of plucky courage in the face of absurdity first seen in the hit 1980 comedy "Airplane."
In that movie she played the sweet, on-the-edge-of-panic flight attendant who goes to heroic lengths -- including having intimate relations with an inflatable autopilot -- to bring her airliner back to earth safely.
Since then, she has shown an affinity for playing comic heroines in distress: a woman dragged into a manic search for personal fulfillment by her yuppie husband in Albert Brooks's 1985 film "Lost in America"; a neurotic journalist entangled with a philandering bisexual (Jeff Goldblum) in "Beyond Therapy" (1987); a wife who sweetly takes care of business while her psychiatrist husband (Richard Dreyfuss) goes crazy in "What About Bob?" (1991), and the game but inconveniently stone-deaf starlet in the 1986 Lincoln Center production of John Guare's play "The House of Blue Leaves."
In "Noises Off," in which Ms. Hagerty co-stars with Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner, Mark-Linn Baker and Denholm Elliot, viewers get the physical side of the Hagerty Desperation Spectrum: she is, at various junctures, kicked in the head, forcibly disrobed and impregnated.
The movie is essentially a faithful, only slightly opened-up rendition of the stage play; on stage rehearsals were held for a month before filming began last winter. "It was so much fun," says Ms. Hagerty, at the dining table of her airy, art-filled one-bedroom apartment. "Watching Carol and John and everybody goof around between takes, and listening to Michael's wonderful stories, it was a really joyful time."
A slightly more subtle (and considerably less pleasurable) farce was the saga of "Princesses," which flashed briefly into living rooms last fall. A comedy with the formidable task of competing against ABC's Friday night juggernaut "Family Matters," "Princesses" was created by the writer-producer Barry Kemp ("Newhart," "Coach"). In it, Ms. Hagerty played an unmarried remedial-reading teacher and aspiring actress who lived rent-free, with two other women, in a Manhattan apartment 10 times the size of her real one. Said Mr. Kemp when the show was on the air: "There's a natural buoyancy to Julie. A tendency to look on the good side of things. And she has the ability to be very funny when put into compromising situations."
Unfortunately for Ms. Hagerty, not all the compromising situations were in her scripts. According to several individuals close to the production, Jeff Sagansky, CBS's head of entertainment, had been opposed to Mr. Kemp's decision to cast Ms. Hagerty in the series. She had not received positive response when the pilot episode was shown to test audiences. (Mr. Kemp and Mr. Sagansky declined to comment on Ms. Hagerty or on "Princesses.")
In addition, although Ms. Hagerty had been cast first in the series and the show had ostensibly been built around her, the plots frequently focused on the antics of her more overtly wacky roommates -- a man-hunting Noo Yawkah played by Fran Drescher and a deposed European princess played by the former model Twiggy Lawson.
"It was a very weird situation," says a member of the "Princesses" team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The way the show developed, she became the person who keeps things fairly grounded in reality. But she didn't want to be the straight person. She wanted to be the quirky one."
Says Ms. Hagerty: "I really adored Fran and Twigs. But it's hard when you're not playing a real person."
Meanwhile, Ms. Hagerty was living another sitcom -- as perhaps the most tragicomically displaced New Yorker west of St. Louis. She rented the first house her Los Angeles real-estate agent showed her. Dug into a hillside, it had a rambling back yard so overgrown that it intimidated both woman and dog. "Sometimes," says Ms. Hagerty, "Raisin and I got in the car and went to find a street where there's a sidewalk. Then we'd get out and take a walk."
She drove the only way recommended for people who have spent the last 20 years flagging down taxicabs. Avoiding the suicidal freeway system at all costs, she gripped the steering wheel so tightly she developed calluses.
After four months, she says, she had made a decent connection with an Italian restaurant that delivered. But by then she had expressed her dissatisfaction to Mr. Kemp, and negotiations had broken down. "We could have changed the part to please her, but it would have ruined the show," explains one person involved in the series. A few weeks after "Princesses" had its premiere, Ms. Hagerty left the show, it was announced, "by mutual decision."
Eight episodes had been filmed; the series was broadcast to dismal ratings. After Ms. Hagerty's departure, Mr. Kemp and CBS shut down the production to regroup and recast. After several meetings, the producers and writers decided that as hard as it was to do the show with Ms. Hagerty, it was even harder to do it without her. And so the show was quietly canceled.
"I got home, gosh, the day after Halloween?" says Ms. Hagerty. Thus far the highlights of her return have included warm welcomes from her neighbors, some unsuccessful experiments in installing track lighting ("These amazing sparks came out of the fuse box") and an interesting offer from David Letterman. "He asked me to bring Raisin with me on the show. I don't think he's ready for his TV debut."
If any one theme runs through Ms. Hagerty's life and art, it's an almost instinctual ability to make the most out of essentially baffling circumstances. Born in Cincinnati, the daughter of a former model and a musician, she spent her childhood around "The Paul Dixon Show," a local television program on which, for its 20-year run, her father, Jerry Hagerty, played saxophone in the orchestra. Sometimes it was Pajama Day, and everybody in the audience had to wear pajamas. One time there was a show for which audience members had to be more than 200 pounds.
Ms. Hagerty attended a local drama school and was discovered by the model agency owner Eileen Ford. But, says Ms. Hagerty, "I had a little problem with modeling. I love to eat. I always managed to pay my rent, which was great, but I was always the one in the bridal gown. Or doing a lot of shampoo ads.
"Also, I always wanted to act, but Eileen would never send me out on auditions where you had to speak because I was so shy."
Discouraged, she moved briefly back to Cincinnati, and then returned to New York to join her older brother Michael, who had founded an Off Off Broadway theater group. With her brother's help she began to overcome her shyness; a brief live-in relationship with the late Bob Fosse prompted a visit to one of her performances at her brother's theater by Mr. Fosse's agent, Sam Cohn. The casting director of "Airplane" was next; Ms. Hagerty was one of 75 actresses asked to audition.
Recalls Jerry Zucker, one of the triumvirate of producer-directors responsible for that seminal spoof: "She was our first choice. We were jumping up and down. 'The movie works,' we said. 'We've got Julie.' "
Is Julie really conscious of how funny she is?
Albert Brooks ponders the question. "Well, above everything else, Julie is an actress. She goes to work and puts on makeup. Still, she's a genuine comedienne. An inherently funny woman. You don't frown when you see her; your mouth starts to go up."
Ms. Hagerty, says Mr. Brooks, was the only actress he could think of who could retain the audience's sympathy after gambling away, as her character did in "Lost in America," her family's entire nest egg in one frenzied night in Las Vegas.
Says Ms. Hagerty: "I don't know how to explain what I do. All I can tell you is that when you do comedy you have to do it from the heart. You can't realize you're doing anything funny. You have to let the director take you through the moment."
In fact, so innocently vulnerable is her demeanor that it takes a bit of gumption to ask Ms. Hagerty about the more serious areas of her life.
"O.K.," she says in a tiny voice, when asked to speak about them.
Bob Fosse, she says, had a quicksilver mind; he was a genius who taught her a new way of looking at the world. Michael Hagerty, who died of AIDS last April, was a feisty, talented man who always supported and prodded her and whom she misses dreadfully. And yes, she and her husband of four and a half years have recently divorced, "but I don't think I should talk about it," she says apologetically.
What she would like to talk about is her pride in "Noises Off," her regret that Benny's Hot Dogs, one of her favorite neighborhood landmarks, was replaced by a high rise, and the realization that after the trauma of "Princesses," it's time to go back to looking for work.
Does that mean she would even be willing to go back to Hollywood?
"Oh, sure," she says, nervously. "But I wouldn't stay there if I didn't have a job. It would be O.K. if I was working, say, 6 or 7 days a week.
"I mean, L.A. is fine for other people. But this is home."

HEADLINE: ARTS/ARTIFACTS;
Are Cartoon Stills Still a Hot Ticket?

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
During the art boom of the 1980's, Herbert Black, a Montreal industrialist, paid record prices at auction for Impressionist art, Chippendale furniture, a John Lennon guitar and Walt Disney celluloids, known as cels.
In the more sober 1990's, Mr. Black is hanging on to Renoir's "Little Gypsy Girl," which he bought for $1.8 million in 1980, then the record for an Impressionist painting. And his collection of 18th-century English antiques is intact. But the Lennon guitar, for which he paid $19,800 in 1984, is gone, raffled to benefit a charity. And he is selling the part of his holdings -- Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Snow White cels -- that so far has remained recession-proof. 
 Mr. Black's collection of 79 Disney drawings, watercolors and cels will be offered for sale at Sotheby's in New York on June 27. Describing the animated art as "the finest ever to be auctioned," David Redden, a senior vice president at Sotheby's, said the holdings are expected to realize $1.5 million.
Since all of these cels were bought in the last five years, the sale is viewed as a significant test of the animation art market. Although many dealers report that prices have not declined, the auction house has placed lower estimates on most of the cels than Mr. Black paid.
In Mr. Redden's view, the internationalization of Disney theme parks -- Euro Disneyland, on the outskirts of Paris, opens today -- is bound to expand interest in this kind of pop culture, including the earliest cels.
Prices for animation art, auctioned at Sotheby's since 1979, exploded during the late 1980's. In 1989, Sotheby's sold more than 900 cels for a total of $2.5 million -- about 10 times the number and dollar total of what it had done the year before. The most valuable offerings to date have been the 1930's black-and-white cels of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the color images of Snow White.
About half the sale of the Black collection is of vintage Mickey Mouse, including the quirkiest and most endearing pictures of him from 1930's and 40's cartoons and from "Fantasia," the 1940 feature-length animated film. The other half consists of scenes from the films "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937), "Pinocchio" (1940), "Sleeping Beauty" (1959) and "Alice in Wonderland" (1951). An outsized ink sketch of Mickey drawn by Walt Disney in 1935 is a rarity, estimated to bring as much as $40,000.
Mr. Black's buying spree, which he said was fueled by nostalgia, began in 1987 and ended two years later. Among the many exceptional pieces he bought was a black-and-white 1934 cel from "Orphan's Benefit" in which an orphaned mouse punches Donald Duck. Mr. Black paid $286,000 for it at Christie's in New York in 1989, a record at auction for animation art. Now Sotheby's estimates that the cel will bring much less -- between $100,000 and $150,000.
"Mr. Black bought at the peak of the market," explained Amanda Deitsch, a Sotheby's specialist in animation art, "and we have to be conservative in this economy."
As collectibles go, animation art is still affordable, with many cels available at $1,000 or less. Two "Pinocchio" images in Mr. Black's collection are expected to sell for $600 to $800 each. "Snow White" cels may realize more: a fierce-faced hag is estimated to bring about $10,000, and one of Snow White in the forest with squirrels and a fawn is expected to sell for about $5,000.
As in all fields of collecting, the earliest and rarest examples of animation art command premium prices. At Sotheby's, there is a second cel from "Orphan's Benefit," this one depicting a crowd of young mice whooping it up in a theater. It is estimated to bring up to $120,000.
Among the many images of Mickey Mouse to be auctioned is a scene from the 1933 short "Ye Olden Days," showing him wooing Minnie in a castle. It is expected to bring about $120,000. Another from "Fantasia," which depicts Mickey atop a mountain conducting the universe, is estimated to sell for about $50,000.
Russ Cochran of West Plains, Mo., a leading dealer in animation art, said he has not seen a dip in sales. "The interest is still there," he said. "But it becomes harder and harder to come up with important pieces."
While the recession has affected his business, Mr. Black said, it did not spur him to sell the Disney material. "I don't collect for business reasons," he said. "I'm selling because I'm going to be living in a smaller house where there won't be room to hang the animation art."
Mr. Redden said Sotheby's envisions a long-term future for animation art as a collectible and has added a specialty department to handle this material. "I have this 3-year-old at home who is balmy about Disney," he said. "Kids today are going to be more familiar with some of these films than we were because they see them on their VCR's. They'll watch them 20 times at a sitting, not merely once as we did. The imprint is going to be stronger in the future than it is now."

HEADLINE: New Lines Seek Niches In the Air

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL covers the travel industry for The Times.

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH Pan Am, Eastern and Midway were shot out of the friendly skies last year, joining such other casualties of the air wars as People Express and Air Florida, a growing group of entrepreneurs is seeking to start new airlines -- not just to fly from one small city to another, but also to Africa, the Caribbean and the Baltic states.
What the newcomers have in common is access to a large pool of experienced pilots, planes and ground personnel, people who worked for the airlines that could no longer compete with such mega-carriers as American, United and Delta. And most of the newcomers also share a common strategy -- trying to carve out a niche too small or too insignificant to invite competition from the big carriers. 
 The odds against their success are high, according to industry analysts. "The overall prospect for startup operations isn't very good," said Daniel M. Kasper, the director of transportation practice for Harbridge House, a Boston-based international management consulting form. "The major carriers are very, very strong, and they have taken advantage of the economies of scale to make it attractive for regular travelers to stick with them. So if you go up against them, you better stay out of their way and be content with off-beat routes."
That is exactly what most of the newcomers intend. "It's the only way we can expect to survive in this environment," said Jack S. Robinson, the president of one such newcomer, Florida Air, which started daily nonstop flights last month from Fort Lauderdale to Nassau, in the Bahamas. "You sure can't beat American, Delta and United by going head-to-head with them."
But avoiding combat does not preclude thinking big. Two proposed airlines hope to fly direct from the East Coast to Johannesburg, South Africa, an 8,000-mile route currently served only by South African Airways.
USAfrica Airways of Washington plans three round trips a week between New York or Washington and Johannesburg. "When sanctions against air travel to South Africa were lifted by Washington last summer, we were quick to apply," said Arthur C. Lewis, USAfrica's chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Lewis, who had been president of Hawaiian Airlines and Eastern Airlines, said he and his nine other board members represent 300 years of experience in airline operations, finances and marketing. "We also represent more than 60 years of experience in Africa," he said, noting that one board member, Chester A. Crocker, was assistant secretary of state for African Affairs from 1981 to 1989.
If its plan is approved by the Department of Transportation, the airline expects to begin service next fall with three leased Boeing 747's. Round-trip fares will compete with those of South African Airways, ranging from about $1,700, with advance purchase, to more than $7,000 for first class, and to break even the airline will need on average to fill about 48 percent, or 168, of the approximately 350 seats. Mr. Lewis said USAfrica would compete by providing superior on-board service.
Pegasus International, a new company in Fairfield, Conn., also has applied to fly the New York-Johannesburg route -- also three times a week, also starting this fall and also with leased 747's. "The difference is that we're affiliated with the largest black transportation association in South Africa, and our intention is for a portion of our profits to go into a trust for the benefit of black South Africans," said Dave Kriz, an executive at Arthur D. Little who is a co-founder and executive vice president of Pegasus. The South African organization is the National African Federated Transport Organization.
Baltia Air Lines plans to begin flying nonstop soon between New York and St. Petersburg, and New York and Riga, Latvia, with continuing flights to Belarus, Ukraine and Georgia.
But Florida is most on the mind of the new airlines, those already in the air and those on the drawing boards. Not only did the state attract 39.3 million visitors last year, but it also lost air service when Pan Am, Eastern and several commuter airlines went out of business.
"YOU can get from anywhere in this state to Orlando and Miami, but you can't get nonstop to most other places," said Mr. Robinson of Florida Air. "At least 25 cities in the state need air service and we're going to go to all of them."
Florida Air got airborne last month with five round trips a day between Fort Lauderdale and Nassau, using a 19-seat turboprop. Eight more are on order.
"Eastern and Pan Am controlled 80 percent of the seats from Florida to the Bahamas, and our plan is to fill the void from Fort Lauderdale," said Mr. Robinson, who formerly headed Eastern's commuter operation in Florida and the Bahamas. With a $99 round-trip fare, a toll-free reservation number and "a reservations system that any travel agency in the world can access to book our flights," in Mr. Robinson's words, Florida Air has ambitious plans for the future.
So does Floridagulf Airlines of Jacksonville, Fla., which began service last December and now flies to 10 cities in Florida (as part of USAir Express) as well as to Charleston, S.C., Savannah, Ga., Shreveport, La., and New Orleans. In mid-April it will add service between New Orleans and Little Rock, Ark., and next month it will add four daily round trips between St. Petersburg and Orlando.
American Dream Airlines of Island Park, L.I., hopes to begin flying daily nonstops this fall between both Kennedy International Airport and Miami and Fort Lauderdale, and between Newark and both of those cities.
"Ours will be all first class service on narrow-body planes that hold roughly 100 passengers," said Tedd Abramson, its founder, "and we're looking to charge slightly more than the lowest coach fare, which is about $200 round trip."
The New York-Florida corridor is already one of the nation's busiest, but that is why it is attractive to newcomers, said Mr. Abramson, a limousine and bus operator. "If you look at traffic flows you're talking about a market that has 1.9 million passengers a year out of New York to Fort Lauderdale, and roughly 2.5 million to Miami," he said.
Destination Sun Airways plans to fly between its home port of Fort Lauderdale and Islip, L.I., a route currently served by Braniff Airlines, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. "We think there's room for more than one," said Guy Lindley, Destination Sun's president. "At one time the island had four, five lines serving it, but they went out of business because they tried to get out of their niche, or because they put on jumbo jets and tried to go up against American Airlines. They handed us our head."
"Our" refers to Northeastern International Airways, of which Mr. Lindley was a founding investor.From 1980 until it failed in 1986, he said, it served 19 cities and had revenues of $350 million a year.
DESTINATION SUN hopes to begin flying in June, and hopes eventually to add flights to Providence, Newark, Hartford, Baltimore-Washington and several other destinations. Flying leased Boeing 727-200's, capable of carrying up to 170 passengers, and charging $119 one way between New York and Fort Lauderdale, the carrier will need a load factor of almost 80 percent to break even.
"We expect to do that," Mr. Lindley said, "because we'll be offering fares with no restrictions and our passengers won't have to stop at a hub. Besides, I think people are tired of reading that they can fly to London cheaper than they can fly to Atlanta."
Other cities may soon have new or additional air service. Ryan International Airlines, a cargo line with headquarters in Wichita, Kan., recently applied to the Department of Transportation to provide business class scheduled service between Newark and Charlottesville, Va. Its hope is to restore the direct jet service those cities enjoyed before Piedmont was absorbed by USAir.
Reno Air in Reno, Nev., wants to fly to West Coast cities, including Los Angeles. Viking International Airlines, a Minneapolis-based cargo carrier, has asked to start scheduled service between Las Vegas and Laughlin-Bullhead City, Nev. And Key Air, which flies charter passengers from five cities each day to its hub in Savannah, Ga., then on to Mexico, Aruba and the Caribbean, has applied to convert those routes to scheduled service, beginning May 1.
"We don't really intend to compete against the major carriers," said Carlisle Vason, Key's director of sales and marketing. "We fly only five flights a week out of Boston, for example, and American Airlines probably flies many more flights out of Boston in one day than we do in a month. We have no aspirations to be a global carrier. We have a little corner of the market picked out, where we don't bother anybody and, so far, nobody bothers us."
Even Sir Freddie Laker, whose Skytrain operation in the 1970's and 1980's helped pioneer low-cost, no-frills flights between the United States and England, is planning to get back into the act. Next month his Laker Airways (Bahamas) expects to begin charter flights between the Bahamas and three Florida cities (Orlando, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach), as well as between the Bahamas and Cincinnati, Cleveland, Nashville, Raleigh-Durham and Richmond. While the charter flights are a contract operation for the Bahamas Princess Resort and Casino on Grand Bahama Island, and are subject to approval by Washington, a spokeswoman for Sir Freddie said "he is not ruling out" the possibility of providing scheduled service in the future.
Following are the names and telephone numbers of the new carriers that are now, or soon will be, in operation:
Baltia Air Lines, , (800) 966-0330; (718) 244-6916.
Destination Sun Airways, (305) 983-0720. Not yet in operation.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Free-Market Capitalism, Applied to the Stage

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Whatever else people say about him and they say a lot -- nearly everyone agrees that Wiktor Kubiak has chutzpah.
The producer of "Metro," the first Polish musical to reach Broadway, Mr. Kubiak is a Runyonesque character who could only have prospered in the let's-make-a-deal capitalism of Eastern Europe. From his 18th-floor office in the Marriott Hotel, Mr. Kubiak looks upon a Warsaw dotted with his properties and well-connected friends. He owns a newspaper and runs four theaters, two of the city's best cinemas and a chain of bookstores. He is also earning a reputation as a political kingmaker. A major financial backer of the Liberal Democratic Party, which held power in Poland through most of 1991, he says he helped underwrite President Lech Walesa's 1990 campaign. Lately, he has been forging links to the new coalition Government headed by Prime Minister Jan Olszewski. 
 Mr. Kubiak proudly boasts that his $5 million investment in "Metro" -- which opens Thursday at the Minskoff Theater -- makes him the first businessman from Eastern Europe to sink money into America.
"This is like opening a big factory in the middle of Manhattan," he says. Peering through half-closed eyes, his face framed by an unruly shock of longish hair, Mr. Kubiak speaks in a rapid-fire patter of his dreams for leaving his mark on Broadway and his native land.
"I want to be the Cameron Mackintosh of Poland," Mr. Kubiak said of the producer of "Miss Saigon" and other highly profitable musicals. "Everyone thinks that culture loses money, but I was the first in Poland to realize that culture can make money. There's no business like show business."
"Metro" is his first stage vehicle. Its cast was recruited nearly two years ago from talent shows throughout Poland. The young performers, mostly amateurs, were trained for months by Janusz Jozefowicz, an actor and choreographer who is the show's director. Since opening a year ago in Warsaw, "Metro" has been playing regularly to sold-out houses, and while the original cast learned an English-language version for New York, a second group was prepared to continue performances in Warsaw.
The show is often described as a cross between "A Chorus Line" and "Hair." It tells the story of a group of young people who try out for a musical, are rebuffed and then organize their own production in a subway. When their musical becomes a success, they must decide whether to sell out to commercial interests and transfer it to a theater or stay underground.
Little is drawn from Polish experience; Warsaw doesn't have a subway. The score, by Janusz Stoklosa, echoes standard pop more than traditional Polish melodies. Mr. Kubiak insists that the themes reflect the concerns of newly capitalist Eastern Europe, even if the esthetic does not.
The musical was conceived in characteristically impulsive fashion. Mr. Kubiak was in Poland on business in 1986 and saw a television production showcasing Mr. Jozefowicz's work. Two months later, they met and formed the friendship and partnership that eventually led to "Metro."
The 47-year-old Mr. Kubiak was born near the town of Brest-Litovsk. His Jewish parents survived World War II with false papers that said they were gentiles. As a result, they were sent to a Nazi-run slave labor camp instead of a concentration camp.
Mr. Kubiak, who grew up in Warsaw, says he was exiled from Poland in 1968 after participating in student unrest at Warsaw University. Hundreds of thousands of Jews left that year in the face of a Government-sponsored anti-Semitic campaign. Mr. Kubiak, whose return was banned until the mid-80's, went to Sweden as a refugee and completed his education. Immediately after graduating, he entered business for himself, selling Western machine tools to Poland in the boom 1970's, when the country was flush with borrowed Western money. He also developed sidelines in exporting Polish timber and arranging loans for state-run Polish companies.
Although the timber business was controlled by the state, Mr. Kubiak said he persuaded some officials to mislabel the best wood and sell it him as if it were of low quality. "You had to find out how to cheat the bureaucrats," he recalled. "That was the whole war."
Poland's transition to a market economy has only expanded his opportunities. In one deal, he took advantage of tax holidays Poland offered to foreign joint ventures. Just before the deadline for setting up these ventures expired last year, he registered 100 shell companies, which he is now offering for sale at a handsome profit.
"What can I do?" he said when asked about criticism of the deal. "I am a player. They wrote the law. I did what I did."
Mr. Kubiak is among the first of Poland's new generation of entrepreneurs to understand the powerful nexus between politics and money. From the beginning, he was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party, which preaches free-market principles.
Last year, Mr. Kubiak donated office space in Warsaw's Marriott Hotel to the Liberals. During this period, a leader of the party, Privatization Minister Janusz Lewandowski, named him special negotiator in the sale of a state-run television tube factory. Mr. Kubiak said he netted $250,000 for his role in saving the $35 million deal.
As the Liberals' political star waned, Mr. Kubiak cultivated other alliances. He contributed money to a foundation that paid the salaries and office expenses of the Civic Committee, a political group then headed by Mr. Olszewski. After the fall elections, Mr. Olszweski emerged as Prime Minister.
Mr. Kubiak's business gambits are frequently a topic of conversation among foreign consultants in Warsaw and have been the focus of critical articles in newspapers that oppose the Liberals.
But for all of Mr. Kubiak's prominence in Poland as a business and political figure, it is "Metro" that could put him on the world map. He shows a visitor an article in an American theater magazine that quotes him as saying: "We realized that if we are a hit, we won't just be on Broadway, we'll be Broadway. We'll be changing it. People will come to us for ideas."
Mr. Kubiak says: "You call that chutzpah? Without chutzpah you can't get anywhere."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Apartment Layouts;
Designing Buildings 'From the Inside Out'

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE architect Peter Claman is a quick man with a pencil. Zip zip zip and he has sketched the floor of a residential building with its apartment layouts. Then he firmly widens the space inside the front door by a few feet.
"You take the kitchen and slide it back a little," he says. "You increase the size of the foyer, for a dining table, or a desk, or a hobby area." 
 Mr. Claman is the 64-year-old managing partner of the firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron Architects, which was founded 51 years ago and has been telling Manhattan apartment developers how to get maximum value out of residential space ever since. He joined the firm as a draftsman in 1952.
The widened entrance is a case of the old hand squeezing advantage from necessity -- the necessity of complying with the city's handicapped-access law, Local Law 58. Mr. Claman is not alone among architects in thinking that in the long run the law will make for better interior design.
The word "interior" is the key. While Schuman Lichtenstein has put new emphasis on exterior qualities -- the stuff of architectural distinction, in a public sense -- it is the maximum effective use of interior space that has made its name. It is among the handful of architectural firms that have designed a disproportionate share of the apartments in New York City over the years.
Thousands of New Yorkers live in apartments laid out by Emery Roth, H. I. Feldman (both deceased) and Philip Birnbaum. Among current practitioners Emery Roth & Sons, Costas Kondylis, the Vilkas Group and Gruzen Samton Steinglass are notable as specialists in new residential buildings.
"The most successful job is a handsome building that rents or sells quickly -- and is within the cost restraints established by the developer," says Mr. Claman. "The success of the interior plan in my judgment determines marketability."
In the present market builders are not beating down architects' doors to design apartments. Larger firms have shrunk, and their emphasis has shifted to institutional and public work and alterations on existing buildings and apartments. Private applications to the Department of City Planning for land-use actions were down to 170 in the nine months ended March 31, from 219 in the similar period a year earlier. But the rate of decline seems to have slowed. There were 356 applications in the nine months ended March 31, 1990.
At Schuman Lichtenstein, employment shrank from 62 people in 1988 to 42 last year. Hospital-related jobs constitute more than half the work, compared with a third a few years ago. Office buildings are handled as well. One, a 20-story addition to the corporate headquarters of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, at 730 Third Avenue at 45th Street, is currently in construction.
To hear Mr. Claman tell it, a turnaround in planning for residential work has begun. Employment is up a bit too, to 45.
"There is a degree of interest from developers in investigating their sites for future development," he says. "They are calling to check the zoning, and they are working on adapting buildings to new uses."
Others agree that when the interiors of future buildings are laid out, they will show differences from the buildings of the 80's. Richard Roth Jr. says that the obligation to produce apartments accessible to the disabled will produce more spacious-seeming apartments because of wider halls, corridors and doorways. "The law is working positively for the nonhandicapped," said Mr. Roth.
"Small apartments will get hurt," says Costas Kondylis, because the spaces lost in closets and hallways to assure accessibility by the disabled may make smaller apartments unmarketable.
Mr. Claman says that developers are likely to seek out the family market in rentals to a greater extent than they did in the 80's, when condominiums held competitive sway over rentals. Now the swing is toward limiting studios and small one-bedrooms in the apartment mix. "The market is family-oriented," the architect says.
He sees a family quality in the Schuman Lichtenstein partnership itself, which has weathered housing cycles for five decades. The firm was formed in 1941 by Sidney Schuman and Samuel Lichtenstein, who met as draftsmen working for Bell Telephone. They are 84 now. Mr. Schuman is retired. Mr. Lichtenstein is still active, and apartment layouts are his specialty. Al Efron became a partner in 1970. Two other partners were made eight years ago -- Jerold Clark and Enzo DePol.
A FAIR share of what Mr. Claman calls New York's "old-time developers" have been on the client list -- Jack Holland, Millard Shroder, Melvin Senville and Samuel Landau in the 50's; the Cohen brothers, Irving and Hyman Shapiro and the Perlbinders later on. The more recent roster includes Hyman and Daniel Brodsky, Ian Bruce Eichner, Vincent Albanese, David Solomon, Harry Macklowe, Donald Zucker, Jason Carter, Jeffrey Katz, The Related Companies and DeMatteis Construction. In all, the firm has done 112 residential buildings in New York City, with more than 35,000 apartments.
Recent projects include buildings for the high end of the market -- 30 East 85th Street for Donald Zucker and United Nations Plaza for Vincent Albanese, for example -- and the moderate end as well, including 200 West 60th Street for the Brodskys or 235 West 48th Street for Jason Carter.
One project designed by the firm in the 80's is the never-occupied 31-story building at 108 East 96th Street. It turned out to violate height restrictions of a special zoning district, although it was in conformity with an erroneous zoning map and had been approved by the Buildings Department. Civitas, the community organization, brought a lawsuit against the developer and won. The court found that he should have recognized the error and it ordered the 12 excessive floors removed.
THE developers, Albert and Laurence Ginsberg, have filed plans to do so. The plans by Mr. Claman also call for a 19-story addition on open space abutting the existing building. The shortened structure would be left with 72 apartments instead of 97. The addition would have 40 apartments, for a total of 112 in the project. The total floor area of the development would be cut to 109,000 gross square feet from the present 118,000 square feet. The work is expected to begin once the plans are approved.
To those developers who come forward in the 90's, Mr. Claman has a new theme -- multiple bedrooms and larger amounts of usable space.
"People share apartments now in rentals," he said, "and multiple bedrooms are more successful. His notion is to persuade developers to add an O.H.R. -- Federal Housing Administration jargon for "other habitable room" -- to their standard one-bedroom apartments plans. The space can be used as a dining room or converted to an additional bedroom.
"It wasn't done in the 80's but it's an old F.H.A. thing that will come back," he says.
Another change, he predicts, will be in the mix of apartments at the lower price end of the luxury market, with rents in the range of about $24 to $30 a square foot per year. At $30 a square foot, for example, a prototypical 650-square-foot one-bedroom would rent for $1,625 a month, he says. But, while the square-footage of this apartment is down by 8 to 10 percent from that of a similar apartment 10 years ago, there are more of them at the expense of the studio-sized apartments.
STUDIOS of the 70's typically had sleeping alcoves, and gave the occupant 515 net rentable square feet of space. By the 80's they had shrunk to a mere 425 to 450 square feet, Mr. Claman says, and gave nothing more than one room, a kitchen, bath and closet.
The new plans will lower the number of studios to perhaps 25 percent of a building's apartments instead of almost half, while the number of small one-bedrooms grows, he says.
Still another change will come about, he says, if the city approves: larger kitchens, or rather kitchenettes. A kitchenette is a kitchen with no windows, and it is limited to 59 square feet. But the handicapped-access law requires too much space for wheelchair turnaround to permit efficient kitchenettes of that size. A proposal to increase the permissible size of kitchenettes is under review.
That would please the layout specialists struggling for maximum efficiency in the use of space. Whatever the economic level of the market for which the building is produced, that is the Claman goal.
"You don't ignore exterior design," he says. "But you work from the inside out."

HEADLINE: Trenton Frees Trash Haulers to Alter Fees

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
A NEW era will dawn on Tuesday for New Jersey's waste haulers and for the millions of homes and businesses that use their services.
On that day, the state will begin to loosen its grip on an industry that has been subject to some of the nation's strictest, most pervasive regulations. For the first time in 20 years, trash haulers will be free to raise or lower the fees they charge customers, within certain limits, without obtaining state approval. 
 The process, under the Regulatory Reform Act, will be gradual, but some effects could be felt quickly.
The goal, said State Senator Harry A. McEnroe, Democrat of South Orange, "is to benefit consumers by allowing market forces to determine the rates people pay to get rid of their trash." He was a sponsor of the 1991 legislation that deregulates the solid waste collection industry over the next four years.
During the first year, haulers will be allowed to raise or lower prices 5 percent plus any percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index. In addition, the haulers will be entitled to pass along any rise in their costs for dumping solid waste at landfills and incinerators. These costs represent a substantial share of haulers' expenses.
Industry experts and state officials say that while they expect competition to result in rate decreases for some customers, the deregulation may also lead to increases for others. They believe that deregulation may lead more communities to contract for townwide trash pickup through competitive bidding. They also predict that the industry's new freedom to vary its charges according to the weight of trash picked up will lead businesses to increase their recycling efforts.
At the time the current regulations were put in place, said Scott A. Weiner, Commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, the industry had almost total control over its rates, lived by its own unwritten rules and established its own informal territories. The regulations were intended to eliminate price-fixing and collusion among haulers, and to stimulate competition. Hauling licenses were issued to individuals and businesses only after vigorous background and credential checks by the State Attorney General's office.
Rates charged to customers had to be approved by the state, based upon a formula that permitted companies a "fair rate of return." But as a result, haulers had no financial incentive to improve their efficiency.
"This is an example of an industry with a regulation that ultimately proved to make no sense," Mr. Weiner said.
George A. Loman, chairman of the New Jersey chapter of the National Solid Waste Management Association, a trade organization based in Somerville, said regulations had inhibited competition and stalled the growth of small companies by prohibiting them from gaining new customers by offering lower rates.
Mr. Loman, who is also an owner of Direse & Sons, a solid waste contractor based in Cresskill, said that a few years ago his company offered discounts to elderly residents in Demarest. "The senior citizens have less garbage, and we wanted to offer something to the town because we had been servicing it for many years," Mr. Loman said. The discount, he said, was $1.50 a month.
"We were told point blank by the regulators that that was a violation of our tariff," he said. "We ended up having to pay a $5,000 fine and having to rescind the discount."
 
Uniform Rates Required
 George Dawson, a spokesman for the State Board of Public Utilities, which regulated trash hauler rates until the Environmental Department took over last year, said: "You had to charge uniform rates. If you offer a discount to one group of people, then another group ends up paying a surcharge to make up the difference."
Authorities say that the regulations have, however, been effective in weeding out unscrupulous operators. "The waste collection industry in the state has cleaned itself up," Senator McEnroe said. The new regulations retain the stringent licensing requirements for entry into the industry.
Beth Sztuk, an official in the Environmental Department, said that a customer's bill contained two basic elements -- the service fee, which is what haulers charge to pick up and transport refuse, and the disposal fee, which is what they must pay at landfills and incinerators to dispose of it.
During the first two years of deregulation, haulers will be able to raise or lower their service fees 5 percent a year plus the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. In the third year, the allowable increase or decrease will go to 10 percent plus the C.P.I. And in the fourth year, only an increase or decrease reflecting the C.P.I. will be permitted.
The new regulations also allow for a dollar-for-dollar pass-through to consumers of increases in the disposal fees charged to haulers. These costs have soared in recent years. Bruce Rosetto, president of Consolidated Waste Services Inc. of Toms River, said landfill fees in New Jersey had risen 3,000 percent in the last 10 years.
 
Many Landfills Closed
 Many landfills have closed, either because they have no room for further trash or because they have failed to meet the state's environmental standards.
"Ten years ago we dumped trash into a hole in the ground," Mr. Rosetto said. Now, he said, landfills must be specially prepared with double plastic liners and other equipment. To prepare a landfill to meet state standards can cost as much as $800,000 an acre, he said.
As a result, increasing quantities of trash are baled or incinerated before dumping, because they reduce the quantity of material to be buried in landfills.
In addition, Ms. Sztuk said, increases in certain special state taxes charged to trash haulers can also be passed along to consumers.
Over all, she said, the potential increases for customers are "pretty significant." But that should be offset, she said, by greater competition in the industry, an opinion shared by many experts.
 
Three Methods of Collection
 In New Jersey, there are three different ways that solid waste is collected. In many of the larger cities, the municipality itself provides the service for residents, using municipal equipment and employees. The costs are included in the property taxes paid by homeowners.
In other cities, the municipality enters into a contract with a trash hauler after putting the contract out for competitive bidding. The costs of contract services are also included in property owners' real-estate taxes.
Under both old and new regulations, private haulers who get municipal contracts after competitive bidding are not regulated on the theory that the bidding process itself serves to insure fair rates.
The third way that trash is collected is through private contracts with haulers. Nearly all commercial and industrial trash is collected that way, and about 150 municipalities require residents to make their own arrangements for trash pickup.
Though deregulation will have no effect on municipalities that do their own trash collection, increased competition is expected to lead to lower bids for public contracts, and to have an even greater effect on the private contracts with residents and businesses.
 
Same Block, Different Haulers
 In towns where residents make their own arrangements for trash removal, it is not unusual to have more than one contractor picking up trash on the same block.
In Westfield, for example, as many as 22 private contractors collect residential trash. In Piscataway, about seven haulers compete for customers among the town's 48,000 residents.
But it is much more cost effective for a trash hauler to pick up trash at every house on a block than at a few houses on the block. Under the new regulations, a hauler will now be able to approach all residents on the block and offer a lower price, which will reflect his potential savings.
Such economies of scale are already being applied in communities that put the whole town's trash collection up for competitive bidding. In Livingston, for example, two haulers formerly served the town. Both were charging about $300 a year for regular household trash pickup. One hauler, however, was charging $300 extra for yard debris, while the other was charging $35 a year for the same service.
 
Saving Achieved in Contract
 By making one full-service townwide contract available to the contractor that bid the lowest rate, officials say they were able to save 80 percent of the residents about $150 a year. In addition, said Charles Tahaney, business administrator of the affluent Essex County community, the residents can deduct the cost of the service on their Federal income tax returns.
John Horensky, director of solid waste management for Somerset County, expects that deregulation will encourage more municipalities to consider public contracts for trash pickup.
"I think the opportunity is better now to go out to bid and get a better price for your residents," Mr. Horensky said. "If it's done properly, a municipality can offer contract collection at a price that would be less than residents pay today for private service."
 
Factors for Businesses
 For businesses, the effects of deregulation will depend upon several factors. "More competition doesn't necessarily translate directly to cheaper service," said Wayne DeFeo, manager of the mid-Atlantic region for the National Solid Waste Management Association.
Now, he said, haulers will be able to offer better rates to their larger customers. At the same time, the haulers could raise rates for other customers. "Your rates could be higher or lower, depending on who you are," Mr. DeFeo said.
Under current regulations, the service fee paid by many business customers depends on the volume of trash they produce, but the disposal fee that haulers pay for dumping the trash at landfills or incinerators is based upon weight. As a result, Mr. Rosetto of Consolidated Waste Services said, "customers with less trash have essentially subsidized those with heavier volumes."
Under deregulation, haulers will be able to charge according to weight. And that, in turn, Mr. Rosetto said, will encourage greater recycling by business.
State law requires that businesses recycle 25 percent of their waste, but since trash removal rates have been based on volume, they have had no special incentive to lower the weight of their trash by recycling it. When the haulers' rates are geared to weight, Mr. Rosetto said, many businesses are apt to change their ways.

PYSANKY DEMONSTRATION
 According to ancient folk lore surrounding pysanky, the term for Easter eggs decorated in elaborate Ukrainian style, a bowlful of the colorful eggs kept in the house at all times protects the family from fire and lightning. In fact, the practice of decorating eggs at Easter time was believed to be essential to the continued existence of the world: without it a monster would appear and destroy the planet.
Ukrainian Easter will be celebrated in two Yonkers libraries, with Maria Kozicky showing about 20 of the eggs she has decorated and explaining how it was done. She will appear at 3:45 P.M. in the Getty Square branch at 7 Main Street and will repeat the program Thursday at 3:45 P.M. in the Grinton I. Will Branch at 1500 Central Park Avenue. 
 "I use powdered food dyes from a Ukrainian shop and real eggs," Ms. Kozicky said. She described the process as similar to batik, in which melted wax is used as masking when each color is applied. The contents of the egg are blown out after the painting is completed, "and the egg will last forever" she said. The eggs must be fresh. An old, hardened yolk could break the shell during the blowing-out process.
Both of her presentations will be accompanied by a videotape made by Canadian Ukrainians explaining the origins of the custom and showing the process step by step. Ms. Kozicky is unable to do a complete demonstration because of a prohibition against lighting a fire in the library. A flame is necessary to melt the wax.
At the Will Branch, a Ukrainian Easter display by the Women's Association for the Defense of the Four Freedoms for Ukraine will open tomorrow and remain through April 30. It will include a collection of pysanky eggs and a typical Easter basket containing the foods eaten on Easter morning. In addition, replicas of Trypillian ceramics dating from the Ukrainian region of 6,000 years ago will be shown. "The Trypillians were our stone-age people," Ms. Kozicky said. The ceramics were done in white, burnt umber and black with geometric designs similar to those of American Indians.
The library is open Mondays through Thursdays from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M., Fridays and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. Call 337-1500 for more information.
 
FILM FESTIVAL ENDING
 The Schoolhouse Center for the Arts in Croton Falls and the film department at the State University of New York at Purchase have cooperated in their first joint venture: a film festival of original feature, documentary, animated and experimental works. The final selections can be seen today, beginning at 4 P.M. with "Prelude," a teen-ager's narrative about the divorce of his parents and the arrival of a stepfather.
"Okefenokee" deals with a young homeless man who encounters his older alter ego, and "Frankie" is a documentary detailing the family life of a young black man in the ghetto. A spoof of Italian movies, called "Colpovole d'Amore," is the last of the afternoon films.
A second session gets under way at 7 P.M. with "Daymaker," an animated piece about what makes the world go around. "Weird Girls in Love" follows, focused on young women's first crushes, and "The Big Dump" is a black comedy in which a wife kills her husband with a roast chicken. The last three films are "The Dark Side," a comedy; "Cartographer's Girlfriend," a philosophical view of the male-female relationship, and "Enrico the Magician," a spoof of silent movies.
The Schoolhouse is on Owens Road. Admission is $5, and the phone number for more information is 277-8477.
 
STEVE FORBERT CONCERT
 Steve Forbert was a 21-year-old recording star when "Romeo's Tune" on his "Jackrabbit Slim" album was released in 1979 and reached the Top 20. Two more albums followed, establishing his status, but in 1984 he had a falling-out with his producer at Columbia Records and by 1986 he was a has-been.
The long road back began by hitting the road in a van with a band of his own. Today, his songs and style have matured, and he is polishing a different image for himself. His new album on Geffen Records, called "The American in Me," is a departure from the old rock 'n' roll Forbert, and listeners attending his forthcoming performances will hear a more thoughtful collection of songs.
Mr. Forbert will appear at the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling on Saturday at 9 P.M. and at the Music Hall in Tarrytown on April 25 at 8 P.M. Admission in Pawling will be $16. (Call 855-1300 for reservations.) Tarrytown tickets will be $18.50. (Call 332-8497.) The Music Hall is downtown on Main Street, and the address in Pawling is 62 Route 22.
 
CONGRESSIONAL REPORT
 "Hate Congress but love my own Congressman" seems to be the consensus of the fractious American electorate these days. Well, Westchester residents will have an opportunity to hear a report from Washington from their four representatives at a luncheon Thursday in the Marriott Hotel in Tarrytown.
Appearing at the Westchester County Association event will be Eliot L. Engel from the 19th District, Nita M. Lowey from the 20th, Hamilton Fish Jr. from the 21st and Benjamin A. Gilman from the 22d District. Among them, they represent the county on the following committees: Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, Education and Labor, Post Office and Civil Service, Small Business, Merchant Marine and Fisheries, and Joint Economic, giving the audience wide latitude for questions.
Taxation and budget issues and their effect on health care, education and housing are expected to dominate the presentation.
Tickets are $40, and the reservations deadline is tomorrow. The program opens with a reception at 11:30 A.M. Lunch is at 12:15 P.M., followed by the Congressional dialogue, which is to end by 2 P.M. Call 948-6444 for reservations or more information.
 
RECYCLING LESSON
 People are not the only creatures who can recycle their waste. Earthworms, sowbugs, millipedes and crayfish are equally resourceful in that regard, and a family program called "Meet the Recycling Animals" will explain all this on Saturday at 2 P.M. at the Greenburgh Nature Center.
In addition to a lecture by staff naturalists, there will be a tour of the current exhibition, "Westchester or Wastechester: Preserving Our Natural Resources," and an excursion into the nature center's fields, woods and ponds to examine first hand the creatures under discussion.
The center is on Dromore Road off Central Avenue, and admission is $3. Call 723-3470 for more information.
 
FIBER ARTIST EXHIBITS
 Eva Harper is a fiber artist who works in a wider variety of textiles than most people in her field. Her work can be seen at the Greenburgh Public Library at 300 Tarrytown Road in Elmsford through April 30.
Some of her things are wearable, others are suitable for framing or for various uses around the house as throws, pillows, hangings or spreads. She taught 18th-century textile arts at Philipsburg Manor for 19 years and conducted classes in various fiber disciplines at the New York Botanical Gardens.
In addition to patchwork, place mats, knitted vests and sweaters, all of which she endows with her own innovative techniques, she works in mola -- a time-consuming method of applique developed by the Cuna Indians of Central America. The fabric is applied in many layers, each one cut separately to create a different outline.
Her crewel embroidery is done in cotton instead of wool, creating a two-dimensional effect by building up the stitches -- many hundreds more of them than would be required by working in wool.
A piece of hers chosen for exhibition in 1988 by the Mid-Atlantic Fiber Conference -- organized yearly at various locations by several weaver's guilds -- was called "My Mother's Garden." It was woven on a loom like a tapestry but consisted entirely of rags. The result resembled a bas relief. "It looked like a garden path framed by plants," she said.

HEADLINE: ART;
Calling Forth the Shock of Recognition

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

 BODY:
FOR the last three or four years it has been one thing after another -- the student revolt in Tiananmen Square, the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Mandela came out of jail; Noriega went in. Haiti, having ousted the long-running Duvalier family, elected Aristide only to lose him in a coup.
This list is short but the one represented by news photos and clippings in the Gallery at Hastings-on-Hudson (478-4141) is long -- so long that it covers all the walls and several partitions. It was compiled by Jo Anne Seador, a photographer teaching at the School of Visual Arts and since 1987 the editor in charge of the library at Magnum Photos, both in Manhattan. 
 "Images That Speak of Our Time," as the show is called, may leave a stone unturned but viewers will have a hard time finding it. That is to assume they will have the energy to look, for hundreds of pictures taken at the critical moment make exhausting fare, because there is not only the tension of the moment but also the tension exerted by the photographer in capturing it.
Not that every image is a classic; in fact, few if any can be so categorized. It is, rather, a matter of their immediacy coupled with the shock of recognition they arouse in the viewer.
Take Stephane Compoint's shot of Texas technicians capping an oil well in Kuwait: this is all action, with everyone coated in oil. Yet color confers a Norman Rockwell-style robustness on the proceedings, which leads the observer to conclude that Sebastaio Salgado gets closer to the truth in his black and whites of the same operation now on view at the Yale University Art Gallery.
Photographic color conveys more information but it makes disaster picturesque. Were it in color, Leonard Freed's dead man on a Romanian sidewalk would be half the picture, notwithstanding the presence of the official who put the bullet in the victim's brain -- "in front of the photographer," the caption says needlessly.
The same goes for G. Pinkhassov's view of Felix Dzerzhinsky's statue being toppled by a crane at night. Dzerzhinsky founded the K.G.B. in 1927, and his larger-than-life effigy stood outside the headquarters of the secret police, presumably in Moscow. Statues seem to be the first to go in uprisings, and in this display, Lenin's gets its comeuppance in Russia as well as in Ethiopia. Furnishing Communist countries with the appropriate icons must have been as rewarding a business as keeping the British Empire in Queen Victorias, the majority of which, however, are still in place.
The most moving pictures come from Romania, a country that seems no better off for having disposed of its tyrant, Ceausescu.
Two particularly eloquent prints come from Ellen Binder, who recently won an award for her coverage of alcoholism in Russia. One is of a man in a psychiatric hospital for incurables who stands chained to his bed; the other focuses on a girl in a children's detention center who kneels on a floor that seemingly she has washed and turns her shaved head toward the photographer. Talk about "The Little Match Girl" and other child martyrs in Victorian literature.
It is all very well to rejoice in the demolition of the Berlin Wall -- German graffiti is neater and more legible than American, by the way -- and Guy LeQuenec's shot of fireworks over the Brandenburg Gate is terrific. But clearly, Communism's dissolution raises questions: can the globe physically accommodate millions avid to make up for lost time as consumers? What about the Wild West aspects of a free-market economy taking root in, so to speak, virgin soil, not to mention the volatile situation in East Africa? Whatever happens, there are certain to be photo opportunities galore.
Drawing on the archives of the agencies Magnum, SABA, Sygma and Visions, Ms. Seador and her assistants, Susan Franz and Linda Schneiderman, have succeeded -- perhaps more than they meant to -- in portraying a world convulsed. "Images That Speak of Our Time," not a jolly show, remains through May 10.
Across the Tappan Zee Bridge in Nyack is the Hopper House Art Center with a solo show by Sister Adele Myers -- her first. The founder and director of the now-defunct Thorpe Intermedia Gallery in Sparkill, Sister Adele is gradually making a name for herself with reliefs in mediums ancient and modern -- fresco and cement. That is, she builds the reliefs in cement laid over lightweight plastic armatures and emphasizes the forms with the flower-fresh colors that are only possible in fresco.
The largest are two steles seven and eight feet tall with surfaces that are slathered smooth, combed into horizontal ridges and garnished with gravel or left the consistency of congealed oatmeal. Both are plain except for a roughly 18-inch-long stripe shading from white to orange.
At the other extreme is the wall filled with tile-size pieces that range from a relief like a Japanese character on a white ground to something resembling a chocolate cake.
The artist concedes that she often feels like a baker, and some of these and the mid-size works look good enough to eat, especially the relief with diagonal ridges interspersed by lobster-pink strips and that work called "On the Wings of the Wind." The title of this may come from the Book of Psalms, but the shapes might as well be giant slices of cucumber -- 15 of them overlapping in a horizontal row and casting shadows on the wall.
The unwitting metaphors for food are a new development in the artist's work but so, too, are the cosmic implications in "As the Sun in the Temple." Here, half a disk painted orange and white nestles in a broad frame of cement, which is ridged like corduroy and is split corner to corner.
Also on view are several handsome abstractions -- flickering shapes, crosshatchings in fine lines -- each drawn in oil pastel over a neutral-colored rectangle and most bordered by lines of dots in metallic colors.
It is a fine display but one that needs a dark setting and dramatic spotlights, neither of which is available in the house that Edward Hopper called home. The show remains on view through April 26, but the gallery is onlyopen on weekends. Call 358-4381.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
What A Show! But How Low Can the Fed Go?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
You want action? You want quick profits? You want embarrassed market analysts? Just step right up and place your bets. Anybody can win. All you need is timing, or luck.
The world's financial markets may not be quite ready to hire carnival touts, but they might as well. Last week's action, with its reversals of fortune, may seem more familiar to denizens of Las Vegas than to readers of treatises on the efficient market theorem. 
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 fell 11 percent in four days, amid talk of recession and worse, then gained most of it back in one glorious session. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average had its worst day of the year but ended the week up 6.26 points, at 3,255.37.
The turnaround came after the Federal Reserve cut its target for the Federal funds rate to 3.75 percent from 4 percent. That sparked buying in New York, and New York's recovery encouraged Tokyo. If you wonder why letting banks borrow for a quarter-point less is the cure for all ills, then you're not in tune with the dominant belief that has sustained share prices in America for much of the past year.
"People believe that the Fed, with its $331 billion balance sheet, has the power to right the world's wrongs," said a skeptical Jim Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
The prospects for economic recovery might be better if the Fed were not so alone in its battle, but political gridlock and huge budget deficits seem to have ruled out a meaningful fiscal response in Washington, and the Bank of Japan evidently is determined to fight inflation even as prices collapse.
With or without help, however, Alan Greenspan is dedicated to keeping this recovery alive whatever happens overseas. The recent downward drift in the money supply, along with the obvious deflation of stock and land prices in Tokyo, had shaken confidence, so action was needed. Mr. Greenspan's Fed, said Mr. Grant, seems to be "willing to stop at nothing to head off a 30's-style collapse and prevent the failure of some of the more venturesome lenders."
That "stop-at-nothing" line could yet seem important. The Fed cannot push interest rates below zero, but if this is an era of deflation, and Olympia & York's problems would seem to argue that it might be, then even a zero Fed-funds rate could be a high real interest rate, and as such a deterrent to growth.
Unless and until that is proven, the markets may stumble along. Among Wall Street sayings, "Don't fight the Fed" is among the most reliable, and it is clear that the Fed wants prices to be high.
And with short-term interest rates low, Americans seem to be willing to buy stocks regardless of valuations. The theory, it seems, is that an 8 percent return is an entitlement that must be available somewhere.
Perhaps the wisest course is to stop trying to understand markets, and just sit back and enjoy them. Unlike the county fair, this show never ends.

Worry Around the World as Japan's Stock Market Wobbles 

These days, Japanese money managers are up late -- and it's not because of any partying. They are tossing and turning over the slow collapse of the Nikkei index of 225 stocks. It lost more than 11 percent of its value last week, before making most of it back. The Nikkei lost about 50 percent of its value since 1989. Those losses are staggering: hundreds of billions of dollars. And Japanese banks have been pummeled the worst. They lost about 40 percent of the value of their equity capital since the stock slide began. But what's keeping investors up nights outside of the Ginza, is worrying over where Tokyo will get the cash to cover its losses. "Since 1986, Japan exported about $502 billion of portfolio capital," said Carl Weinberg chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in New York. "We could see repatriations of that capital at the rate of $10 billion to $12 billion a month." he said. "Everybody thinks it's inevitable."
 
The Toff Wins a Squeaker
 
Last week, Britain's Conservative Party won a "magnificent victory, a victory many people thought was beyond our grasp," said Prime Minister John Major. It may have been magnificent, especially to Mr. Major, but in truth, the Tories squeaked by with only a 21-seat majority in Britain's 651-member House of Commons. But any win is sweet in politics, and this one may be viewed especially warmly in the White House. Since the days of Ronald Reagan, America's Republicans and Britain's Tories have been soulmates. The Tories also won while Britain is in a recession, and they did it -- in part -- by running against their own budget deficit. The Tories' platform also had a familiar ring: They won't raise taxes.

America's Ascendancy in Chips
 
While American and Japanese negotiators bicker about trade, the market has been working its magic. American chip makers have been winning back market share from Japan, analysts said last week. American companies have just under 40 percent of the world market. Japan has about 50 percent, according to VSLI Logic, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif. But America's share of the market is rising as Japan's falls. And the figures don't include so-called "captive" producers -- behemoths like the International Business Machines Corporation -- that produce chips mainly for their own use. Include captives and each country now has about the same market share, VSLI says. Each sells about $31 billion worth of chips. "It is possible to build a case now that you couldn't make five years ago," said Michael Borrus, of the University of California at Berkeley. "The American semiconductor industry is in a better position than the Japanese."

A Switch on Aircraft Subsidies
 
Two weeks ago, when European and American negotiators announced they had cut a deal on limiting subsidies to their aircraft manufacturers, many feared it was too good to be true. Negotiations have been under way for six years. Last week, their fears were confirmed. Each side is accusing the other of changing its mind. The Europeans wanted to limit indirect subsidies of American products to 4 percent of an airliner's development costs. The Americans now want to make it 5 percent. Indirect subsidies come from the military. Both sides still agree on limiting to 33 percent direct government subsidies of aircraft development, but not on whether those subsidies should be paid back. And some -- like Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, want no deal at all.
 
Olympia & York Out on a Limb
 
Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the big Canadian real estate developer, is saddled with $18.5 billion in debt and lots of vacant office space. Olympia needs cash. Its banks refused to extend a $430 million outstanding loan for another year until the company opens its books. (Olympia said it will do that later this week.) In the meantime, Li Ka-shing, the big Hong Kong property developer, said he is thinking of buying some of Olympia's properties. With personal assets of about $3 billion, Mr. Li has the cash to do it.

Domestic Uses of Foreign Aid
 
When President Bush announced that the world's wealthiest countries would give Russia $24 billion in aid, Japan politely termed Mr. Bush's figures "hypothetical." Tokyo -- counted on as a major donor -- has not announced what it will kick in. It is still negotiating with Russia over the return of the Kurile Islands. Now other parts of the package look murky. Last week, the Administration said the International Monetary Fund would pay $4.5 billion toward the plan. The British put that figure at $6 billion. The Germans said the I.M.F. would pay $5.5 billion. And Moscow isn't helping any either. Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of the plan from the Russian side, was sacked as Finance Minister by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. So why unveil the package now? Elections. "To a certain extent, everyone is addressing their domestic political audience," said a British official.

Explosions in London
 
Four explosions rocked the center of London's financial district last week, killing at least three people and injuring 50. London police suspected Irish terrorists of planting the bombs. The explosions took place a block from the Bank of England.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Reality Intrudes at G.M.
 
It sometimes seemed as if top management at the General Motors corporation lived in the corporate equivalent of Tibet. G.M. lost market share, shut down plants, said it would layoff 73,000 workers and lost $4.5 billion last year. But its leaders remained sublimely detached, perks intact. Last week, G.M.'s board of directors got tough. John G. Smale, former chairman of the Proctor & Gamble Company and a G.M. board member, was made chairman of the executive committee, a job formerly held by Robert C. Stempel, the company's chairman. Mr. Smale's new assignment meant a demotion for Mr. Stempel. Also demoted were Lloyd Reuss -- formerly president, now executive vice president, and Robert T. O'Connell. Mr. O'Connell was demoted to senior vice president from executive vice president. But John F. Smith Jr., head of G.M.'s profitable international division, was promoted to president last week. If the new junta doesn't put G.M. back in the black, Mr. Smith could replace Mr. Stempel as president, analysts say.

American Air Simplifies
 
Airlines operate in near-perfect competition. Since their products are roughly equal, their only edge is price. That kind of market, economists are quick to point out, is one in which most competitors teeter on the verge of extinction. Last week, to make its prices more attractive -- not to mention simpler -- American Airlines announced a new fare structure. Rather than 16 different fares to each destination, beginning tomorrow, American will offer only four, most of them cheaper than current fares. American, which projected 2 percent growth this year, expects the new fares to give it "3 or 4 percent growth in traffic," said Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman. Other airlines will match some of the fares.

Eyeball to Eyeball at Caterpillar
 
For five months, members of the United Automobile Workers union have struck Caterpillar Inc. The company told workers to return to their jobs last Tuesday or risk being replaced by nonunion workers. Only about 300 of its 12,600 workers crossed the line. Later in the week, talks resumed.
 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
Why Slow Growth Is Good
 
At least one advantage comes from wimpish levels of economic growth: prices hold flat. Last month, the Commerce Department's Producer Price Index climbed by only 0.2 percent, which translates into an annual inflation rate at the producer level of about 0.7 percent. Falling food prices pulled the index down and offset a steep rise in energy prices. As long as this recovery remains a 98-pound weakling, price are expected to behave. "We are forecasting good inflation news lasting probably until 1994," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
 
Though the Commerce Department's Consumer Price Index increased by a surprisingly strong 0.5 percent in March most analysts say well-behaved producer prices will keep consumer prices from rising steeply.

Bringing HDTV Into the Home
 
For those who like to spend time glued to the tube, high-definition television, which will bring movie-quality pictures to couch potatoes, moved a step closer to commercialization last week. The Federal Communications Commission outlined new regulations for introducing HDTV that allow broadcast stations to have an extra channel for 15 years. During that time, broadcasters will use one channel for HDTV and the other for regular TV. After 15 years, the stations will have to give up their second frequency and broadcast HDTV signals only. But broadcasters, sensing a windfall from that second channel, may be reluctant to give it up. "If broadcasters get a second allotment of spectrum, it will be a miracle if it ever comes out of their hands," said Dale Cripps, publisher of HDTV Newsletter, in Alsea, Ore.

Giving Life to the Economy
 
Dr. Frankenstein used electricity to put some life into his monster. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, can only use interest rates to make the economy's muscles twitch. Last week, Mr. Greenspan pulled one of those rates down. The Fed lowered the funds rate to 3.75 percent from 4 percent. Lowering the funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for short-term loans, is likely to drive down other rates as well. Why lower rates now? "The Fed has to be worried about keeping the little recovery we have going," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. "It cannot afford to have a "triple dip" or anything like that." Especially in an election year.

More Debt -- and Less
 
Consumers are a paradoxical lot. According to the Federal Reserve Board, consumers used their credit cards more in February -- they put $1.19 billion on plastic. But while they put new charges on the cards, they paid off other debts. Overall consumer installment credit -- including cards -- fell by $199 million in February.

Freeing the Natural Gas Market
 
Consumers can't exactly shop around for natural gas. The pipes go where they go. But last week Federal regulators changed the rules so companies that supply homes with natural gas can shop around for supplies and use the pipelines simply for transportation. That is expected to bring down prices. "This takes away the pipelines' monopoly to merchandise gas to the pipeline customers," said Edward J. Sondey, senior vice president for gas supplies at the Brooklyn Union Gas Company.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Is Japan Ready to Bottom Out?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Fiona Biggs, portfolio manager for the Dreyfus Strategic World Investing Fund, has been bearish on the Japanese stock market, and she looked very smart last week. The Nikkei index of 225 shares fell 10.6 percent through Thursday, to its lowest level since October 1986. The market was down 27.8 percent for the year and 57.4 percent since its all-time high at the end of 1989.
On Friday in Tokyo, however, Ms. Biggs was buying a few stocks as the Nikkei index surged 7.6 percent, regaining some of the ground lost earlier in the week. The rally was partly a response to the steep falls that preceded it. In addition, the rally on Thursday in New York of the Dow Jones industrial average, which followed an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, helped. 
 Ms. Biggs's buying is not a signal of a fundamental change of mind yet. But it is part of her preparation for a turn in the market. For her, the Japanese market has fallen far enough to uncover some good values, like Sony, Panasonic and NEC. But the broader economic conditions have not changed enough for her to want to bet on the market over all.
"I put in some of the names that I liked," she said. "But I kept my limits. I am not going to chase anything. I expect you will see a two- or three-day rally and then some consolidation."
Ms. Biggs is one of several bears who have been sifting through the rubble in Tokyo looking for bargains. She has missed some calls in Japan but has had a solid record in picking international stocks. At the end of 1991, Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group, ranked Dreyfus Strategic World as the No. 1 mutual fund in its group for the last three years.
There are others who, while they are not ready to renew long-term investing in Japan, think the market could rebound in the second quarter if the Japanese Government moves to cut interest rates further and takes other actions to support the economy and the stock market. This means that it may not be the time to bet against Japan. But this does not mean the market will not fall again.
"I do not think it changes the story over all," Michael Howell, head of global strategy at Baring Securities in London, said of the rally in Tokyo on Friday. While he expects the market to rally a little in the second quarter, it might then retreat later in the year. "Looking at Japanese monetary policy, I have not seen enough to convince me that we will see a sustained rally," he said. "The Bank of Japan clearly has to pour a little more gasoline on the fire."
Ms. Biggs looks at the Japanese market in two ways. One view is from the bottom, looking at individual stocks. The other is from the top, looking at the economy and interest rates. She said now is the time for investors to begin drawing up a list of stocks that are good values because of the drop in the overall market. "There are some securities that in the next few weeks will look good," she said, especially if the market retreats further.
But her list of good values includes only 10 or 15 stocks now. So she will be cautious. She said that once the list gets to 30 or 40 stocks, an investor would have better evidence that the market was near its bottom. "If you come up with only five or six companies that are good values, the market has further to go down," she said.
Her top-down approach is more negative because she sees problems in the Japanese economy in the future, including the restructuring needed to shift the engine of growth in Japan from capital investment and manufacturing toward consumer spending. This approach makes whole sectors, including automobiles and banks, look unattractive.
Ron Napier of Mitchinson, Napier Bedford & Company in London, consultants specializing in investing in Japan, also argues that the possibility of a quick turnaround in the Japanese economy is less likely than many analysts think.
"Before there is a rally, you have to see the signs of the economic bottom," he said. "But that could be delayed until next year if we are right about the investment cycle and the inventory cycle." He believes that Japanese capital investment, which powered the boom of the 1980's but is now in decline, will not recover fast. And he thinks that the buildup in inventories in Japanese manufacturing will mean a sharper dropoff in economic growth than expected.
Mr. Howell at Baring said he expected the stock market to rally 10 or 15 percent in the second quarter, a move that would bring the Nikkei to 19,000. It closed on Friday at 17,850.66. But he said that investors could quickly be disappointed unless there are signs that the Government and the central bank, the Bank of Japan, are really easing monetary conditions.
For him, current data, particularly money-growth figures, do not indicate the Bank of Japan is "seeking to ease monetary policy significantly," despite the recent cut of three-quarters of a percent in its official discount rate. In the United States, he said, the Federal Reserve has made its intention to fuel a recovery very clear, especially with its cut in rates last week. But not the Bank of Japan.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Building a Better Nuclear Nest Egg

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
The Yankee Atomic Electric Company in Bolton, Mass., announced recently that it will pull the plug on its controversial Yankee Rowe nuclear power plant. The utility decided it was simply impractical to spend the money required to refurbish the 32-year-old facility, whose continued operation has been opposed by environmental activists for years.
For the combatants in the long battle over Yankee Rowe, as is the case in most arguments about atomic energy across the country, the question of what to do about aging nuclear power plants provokes answers framed by politics, by economics, by scientific and environmental concerns. 
 But for a small set of Wall Street money managers who specialize in overseeing funds known as "nuclear decommissioning trusts," the debate over nuclear power comes down to a purely practical matter: When a power plant's life is over, will there be enough money to pay for a safe and decent funeral?
Unless Congress takes a fresh look at the limits imposed on these trusts, these managers warn, the answer to that practical question may become as cloudy and contentious as the rest of the nuclear power debate.
Public utilities are required by Federal law to set money aside to cover the highly unpredictable costs of shutting down and dismantling their nuclear plants in the future. So far, an estimated $3 billion has accumulated in these decommissioning trusts. At first glance, the trusts seem to be an odd sort of pension fund -- a fund to retire an elderly power plant. But a closer look reveals some remarkable differences.
For one thing, decommissioning trusts are not tax-exempt, as pensions funds are; they are subject to Federal taxation at the standard corporate rate of about 34 percent. Moreover, while corporations may list a pension fund contribution as a business expense for tax purposes, utilities only get to count trust contributions if the trust is a so-called qualified trust -- that is, one that abides by limits set by the Federal tax code.
Under these limits, qualified trusts may invest only in Unites States Treasury securities, municipal bonds and bank demand notes. No common stocks, no preferred stocks, no corporate bonds, no mortgage-backed securities.
Some state utility regulators impose even stricter rules of their own; a few require nuclear trusts to buy only in-state municipal bonds, which may be in scarce supply. The Federal limits do not apply to non-qualified trusts -- but many of the state restrictions do, and contributions to those trusts are treated less favorably by the tax collectors, as well. As a result, non-qualified trusts account for only about 20 percent of the total assets in decommissioning trusts.
Understandably, given the tax bite and the investment limits, most of these decommissioning trusts are invested in municipal bonds -- a portfolio choice that, while certainly conservative, seems unlikely to generate the amounts of money that may be called for in the years ahead, as the nation's nuclear power plants grow older. Over time, common stocks typically outperform both Treasuries and municipals.
For several years, a coalition of utilities, supported by regulators and by consumer and environmental groups, has been pushing in Congress to have the nuclear trust restrictions lifted. Gregory L. Nelson, an associate partner at Reid & Priest, a Washington law firm representing the coalition, said the group is also seeking a reduction in the tax rates that apply to the trusts, from 34 percent to 20 percent.
Those changes were incorporated into the most recent tax bill, which was vetoed earlier this year by President Bush. While there is almost no chance of a new tax bill emerging until after the election, Mr. Nelson said the coalition will continue its effort to get the investment limits and tax rate changed.
"Obviously, the more money that can be earned on decommissioning funds, the more you have available to do the work -- which is a social good," said Mr. Nelson. "And it would also lower the amount the utilities have to collect from their customers." (Or from their shareholders, if regulators prove intractable about rate increases.)
Whatever the procedural roadblocks in Congress, the proposals have the heart-felt support of most professional money-managers in this arcane but increasingly important field. "These restrictions are totally inappropriate for today's investment world," said Rust Muirhead of RCM Capital Management in San Francisco, one of the largest managers of decommissioning trusts. "If you build a plant for $2 billion, and 30 to 40 years from now you have to decommission it, how do you keep up with inflation?"
Some utilities can try to gain on inflation by putting all of their non-qualified trust accounts into equities, said James P. Meehan, a vice president at Delaware Investment Advisors in Philadelphia, another major nuclear trust manager. "But those are only a small percentage of the total. And sometimes state regulators do not permit even that."
Added to the difficulty of outpacing inflation is the problem of hitting an invisible target, said Daniel J. Fuss, executive vice president at Loomis-Sayles & Company in Boston, which handles a number of nuclear trusts. "No one really knows what the ultimate costs will be, and you may have to pay to maintain a site and guard it for a long, long time," said Mr. Fuss. "In fact, the decommissioning trust has many of the same investment management characteristics as the old cemetery trusts -- you have to be prepared to maintain a tract 'in perpetuity.' "
This specialized corner of Wall Street will be watching the Yankee Rowe experience closely for clues to how the future may play out for other plants, said Mr. Fuss. "I think a lot of the guidelines that have guided decommissioning trusts will be re-examined in light of this experience, and will have to change."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Small and Medium Are Beautiful

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Carlene Murphy, co-manager of the Strong Common Stock Fund in Milwaukee, specializes in smaller company stocks. She did exceptionally well swimming against the current in the 1980's and could do even better now that the tide seems to have turned.
The fund returned a sparkling 35.7 percent for the year that ended on March 31, compared with 14.6 percent for growth funds, on average. Before signing on with Strong in March 1991, Ms. Murphy and her co-manager, Richard T. Weiss, ran the SteinRoe Special Fund, which gained 14 percent annually for the previous five years, compared with 9.9 percent for the group. 
 They are top-flight managers who are very comfortable with small- and medium-capitalization stocks, says Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a mutual-fund research group. And they built their track record during a period of lean years for small-cap stocks, leading him to ask, "What can they do when they have a tail wind?"
Despite the recent run-up in small stocks, Ms. Murphy believes the sector will continue to shine. She says the economy will probably grow slowly for several years. The 80's, a decade of easy credit and abundant access to overseas markets, favored bigger stocks. This decade, the pendulum seems to be swinging back to smaller, more sharply focused companies that can grow with niche products even if the overall economy falters. Then too, mid-cap stocks have become the new favorites of institutional investors.
Two-thirds of the $75 million Strong Common Stock Fund is invested in companies with market capitalizations of less than $500 million; the remaining one-third has capitalizations of up to $2 billion. Ms. Murphy and Mr. Weiss also run the $170 million Strong Opportunity Fund, a more conservative fund, which reverses the proportion between small- and mid-cap companies. About one-third of the holdings of the two funds overlap.
Ms. Murphy describes her stock-picking approach as "growth at a price." The stocks resemble growth stocks because they grow at an average yearly rate of 20 percent. But she is like "value" managers in that she tries to buy companies for less than their probable worth. She has been buying shares selling for only 10 or 12 times estimated earnings, not the huge multiples that growth managers sometimes pay. The fund's price-earnings ratio is 13.5, about five points less than the market as a whole.
The Common Stock Fund is divided among seven sectors: energy (10 percent), retail (10), cyclical (18), financial (14), health care (8), technology (18) and consumer, including media and entertainment (22). The largest holding is only 2.5 percent of the fund. The managers like to take a stake of 1 to 2 percent in each company they hold. Cash ranges from 5 to 20 percent of the fund's holdings; right now, about 12 percent is in cash, mainly because the fund is growing so rapidly.
Ms. Murphy, who is 35 years old, studied French as an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Illinois. Dissatisfied with her job prospects, she became a research assistant at SteinRoe in 1980, where she was assigned to work with Mr. Weiss. At the same time, she completed her M.B.A. at the University of Chicago and then began co-managing the SteinRoe Special Fund in 1986. Mr. Weiss is among the largest individual shareholders in the Strong Common Stock Fund; Ms. Murphy has invested "nearly all the money that isn't invested in my house." Mr. Phillips said this commitment by the managers was uncommon but "a very healthy thing to see."
From a risk standpoint, Ms. Murphy said she and Mr. Weiss "spend more time assessing the downside than the upside." This means buying companies at a discount and selling before price-earnings ratios climb too high. Strong Common Stock owns 70 stocks.
The goal is to find neglected companies, based on the principle that the fewer the analysts following a company, the greater the return. The negative side of this approach is what she calls "estimation risk," the danger of having incomplete information because of narrow coverage. The danger is that the companies remain neglected; to avoid this, Ms. Murphy and Mr. Weiss look for companies with new products, ad campaigns or new management likely to grab Wall Street attention. In her travels, Ms. Murphy often gets royal treatment. "You wouldn't believe how many companies I see that haven't had visitors for years," she said.
While both pick stocks, Mr. Weiss concentrates more on the portfolios' "strategic direction." Many prospects are found in "quiet" areas of the stock market. Right now, one quiet area is oil. Because oil-and-gas prices are low, investors are avoiding the industry.
A second quiet area is small banks and thrift institutions. Many community-based financial institutions have clean portfolios and sell cheaply, Ms. Murphy says, while most investors concentrate on the problems of the big money-center banks.
The largest holding of the Common Stock Fund is Newbridge Networks, a Canadian company that sells high-speed voice and data transmission technology to large users. Next is Telefonos de Mexico. Then comes Wheatley TXT, which makes pumps and valves for the oil-and-gas industry.

HEADLINE: A Capitalist Free-for-All in Czechoslovakia

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
In Czechoslovakia, the most socialized economy in Eastern Europe, more than 2,000 large enterprises are on the block. The occasion is a Government auction meant to spin off everything from pollution-spewing steel works to the 700-year-old brewery that makes a great little lager named Budweiser.
The zealously capitalist Government has set tight deadlines for companies to either find foreign buyers or hand over their shares for a one-shot giveaway to the public. "They're privatizing the privatization process," said Daniel Arbess, from the New York law firm of White & Case, an adviser to the Government. 
 Much rides on the outcome of the experiment. If the whirlwind transition yields a burst of productivity, it could serve as the model for a dozen other centralized economies. If it gets mired in scandal or forces the hasty liquidation of seemingly viable businesses, hopes for a German-style economic miracle could be crushed.
Privatizing small businesses has proved relatively easy. An estimated 13,000 shops, cafes and the like have been restored to their original owners or auctioned off to the highest bidders. But with big enterprises, no one knows where to start -- how to price shares when there is no open-market track record for the enterprises, how to make sure managers don't manipulate the auction and/or its aftermath, how to attract capital to a country that has yet to create a securities market or a competitive banking system.
On the other hand, delay carries its own risks. Efficient companies may founder in the uncharted seas between central planning and free markets. "The driving force is time," said Charles Jelinek-Francis, an adviser to the Czech Republic.
Under the Government's plan, corporate managers, not bureaucrats, are obliged to take the lead on privatization. And by almost everyone's reckoning, the preference is marriage to foreign investors, with their dowries of 1990's management, marketing and technological skills. Volkswagen has embraced Skoda, the local car company. Air France has supplied CSA, the national airline, with fuel-efficient jets and credibility with travel agents. Kmart is trading cash, plus the opportunity to sell Czechoslovak housewares through its American branches, for a chain of local department stores.
Most firms, however, are slated to be given away to Czechoslovak citizens this year and next in a grand scheme that is the brainchild of Vaclav Klaus, the current Finance Minister and leading candidate for Prime Minister in the June elections.
Under his plan, each of the nation's 11 million adults had the right to purchase one voucher book for 1,035 crowns, or $36 at the current exchange rate. Some 8.6 million people elected to do so by the Feb. 29 deadline.
The books, looking rather like oversized checkbooks, contain coupons to be used in bidding on enterprises that the Government estimates have a combined book value of 260 billion crowns. Each voucher book, therefore, should be worth more than 30,000 crowns.
Once shares are distributed through a series of computerized auctions, their owners will be free to sell them to anyone. A second and last wave of voucher-driven privatization is planned by the end of 1992.
One potential pitfall is the lack of rules for disclosure or insider dealing. Another is the unexpectedly large role being played by newly created Czechoslovak mutual funds.
When vouchers were first offered, privatization officials guessed that only one-fifth of those eligible would participate. They did not reckon with the marketing savvy of the young, American-educated Viktor Kozeny. Mr. Kozeny's Harvard Capital and Consulting Corporation (no relation to the university) guaranteed a 10,000-crown return after just one year to anyone consigning a 1,035-crown voucher to the corporation's mutual funds. Soon, competing funds offered even juicier guarantees. But supersalesman Kozeny expects to end up with the largest single block, 20 percent of all vouchers bought.
The Czechoslovak Parliament's answer to this concentration of power was to limit a mutual fund's ownership to just 40 percent of any single enterprise, at least for now. But "the law is like a cheese," Mr. Kozeny scoffs, "full of holes."
Ivan Svitek, an adviser to Finance Minister Klaus (and no fan of Mr. Kozeny), admits that concentrated ownership of single firms is not necessarily a problem. Indeed, he believes that effective restructuring of individual enterprises will require control by motivated owners.
What may prove a problem is paying off fund shareholders in Czechoslovak crowns. The assets are there, if the enterprises are worth anything close to the 30,000-per-voucher book value. But cash?
Jan Vanous, a Czech-American who runs the PlanEcon consulting firm in Washington, argues that if investors demand their money, and the funds are forced to unload shares or assets, there could be a stock market meltdown in which foreigners could gain control of Czechoslovak businesses for just pfennigs on the mark.
Equally problematically, state-owned banks might intervene, lending money to individual funds against vouchers of unknowable value -- a process Mr. Vanous likens to Washington's bailout of savings and loans and which Mr. Arbess labels "reverse privatization." Or foreign banks might extend credit to the mutual funds, effectively allowing consumption-starved Czechoslovaks to trade their pieces of industry for Walkmans and package tours to Paris.
The central bank certainly has the power to stop a private-bank bailout, a fire sale to foreigners or a voucher-profit consumption binge. But Mr. Kozeny doubts that any Government agency is ready to take the blame for effectively nullifying the funds' guarantees of riches to millions of voters. Mr. Kozeny's own fix of choice: a stiff capital gains tax on voucher profits, to be waived if the money is reinvested rather than spent.
Many Czechoslovak analysts say that the troubling liquidity scenarios are a distraction from the even scarier scenario that motivated the Government to make its headlong dash to privatization: continued state ownership. If large-enterprise privatization is not well along by the time of the June elections, they warn, the transition could be postponed for years. And as Vaclav Klaus is fond of repeating, "When you drive through the mud, you do not slow down."
 
 
 
FROM HARVARD, THE ULTIMATE SALESMAN
 From button-down broadcloth to brisk and confident manner, 28-year-old Viktor Kozeny seems the very model of a young investment banker on the make. But even in the heady 1980's, few dreamed dreams as big as his and fewer still built great financial empires, even on paper, in a matter of months.
The head of Harvard Capital and Consulting, whose family emigrated to the United States when he was a teen-ager, is a graduate of Harvard College and has only a brief stint at the London investment firm of James Fleming to show on his resume. But unlike the Finance Ministry, Mr. Kozeny did understand one of the basics of investment banking. "It's necessary to pre-sell an initial public offering," he said, in a rare excursion into understatement.
In this case, pre-selling meant guaranteeing a 10-for-1 return for investors in his new mutual funds. It meant saturating television with advertising and recruiting some 22,000 salespeople, who in the great traditions of Amway and Tupperware passed on the good news to anyone who would listen.
Even in Czechoslovakia, such an effort does not come cheap. Some of the millions of dollars already spent, Mr. Kozeny suggested, came from his consulting business and some from his family. What if there is a rush of share redemptions? "We have offers from New York banks" to cover such an eventuality, he said.
Mr. Kozeny may well have saved the Government from the embarrassment of throwing a privatization party to which hardly anyone came. But that has not made him popular with privatization officials, who never imagined how potent his pitch would be. To them, the mogul-in-waiting hastens to offer reassurances. "We don't want to run the country," he says. "We want to make money." In the next breath, he is not so reassuring: "We want to stay out of politics as much as possible, but we will defend our interests."

HEADLINE: Stimulating Students Toward Science

 BODY:
As a science educator I would like to respond to Steven Weinberg's interview in Connecticut Q & A (March 15).
I absolutely agree with Mr. Weinberg that there is a shortage of scientists and a tremendous need to stimulate and attract qualified students to careers in science by offering them exciting and challenging opportunities to develop critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making skills through the scientific process. However, Mr. Weinberg would have you believe that animals are the best "vehicle for teaching the processes of science." 
 The scientific process is used in all sciences, not just the biological. Concepts and principles of physical, chemical, ecological, environmental and earth science are being taught to students through hands-on experiences that develop observational skills, formulate hypotheses, test those hypotheses, analyze results and draw conclusions.
In a biology course students use the scientific method in investigations on the molecular, cellular and multicellular level. Students perform biochemical analyses in investigations and many physiological studies on themselves. Is Mr. Weinberg suggesting that elementary students learn the scientific process by performing experiments on animals in their classrooms, when there are so many other hands-on experiences that could challenge and excite them?
Even to suggest that elementary-level students should experiment on animals is inappropriate and could prove to be traumatic at their delicate stage of development. Why the push for animal research in elementary classrooms? It appears to me from the article that it may be more of a question of economics than human and animal welfare, since he makes reference to companies in Connecticut that might relocate because there are not enough knowlegeable workers to staff them. Maybe these companies should re-evaluate biomedical research methods that might be of a concern to prospective employees.
A good way to learn about an organism is to have hands-on experiences, and young children in an elementary classroom might learn from observing, nurturing and caring for a classroom pet. However, there is a difference between a classroom pet and a research animal.
Every organism on this planet has achieved its present development and has functioned in its environment through millions of years of evolutionary change. Each organism has a unique role to play in the delicate balance of nature, and the human impact on that balance has already seriously threatened and endangered hundreds of species.
To remove any animal from its natural surroundings and cage it in a classroom, so children can make observations, is not providing the student with the opportunity to learn about the real world and life of that organism. Its existence involves its search for food and shelter and its struggle for survival against its predators. If you cage it, you have denied that organism the right to its evolutionary journey. The child will learn much more about the organism by observing it in its natural surroundings and seeing how it interacts with its physical environment and with other living organisms.
Furthermore, there are two statements that I believe are hypocritical and contradictory to Mr. Weinberg's beliefs. In speaking for the Educators for Responsible Science, he says that "we feel strongly about developing a sense of wise and humane stewardship of all forms of life." Promoting the use of animal research in elementary school classrooms, to remove animals from their natural environment, is a contradiction to that statement. If they truly believed this, then all animals studies would be performed as fieldwork.
Another disturbing statement is that "the animals used in research are not their cuddly little pets," since Mr. Weinberg might argue that animals are bred for research studies. However, many companion animals are used in research, and they once were someone's cuddly pet, because many of these animals were acquired from pounds, and oftentimes from precarious dealers for profit.
In today's environmentally conscious and concerned society, I believe we have a responsibility to instill in our students a respect for all living things. That respect will develop through an appreciation of the importance of that organism in its own right. Students need to study how organisms behave and function in their own environment, how they protect themselves and how they relate to other organisms. Mr. Weinberg gives the impression that animals are simply a tool for human use, and that concept is not conducive to teaching young children a reverence and respect for all forms of life.

HEADLINE: Treating Alcoholics In Russia

 BODY:
The article "Russians Learn About Helping Alcoholics" (March 8) was informative and inspiring in many ways, but it presented some inaccurate facts about what is actually progressing in the former Soviet Union with regard to alcoholism treatment and recovery. Your readers deserve to know the history and the facts about what is currently transpiring in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
In the 1970's the Soviet government acknowledged for the first time the devastating effect that the disease of alcoholism was having on its citizenry. The country reported four million registered alcoholics, most of whom were being treated with such primitive methods as punishment in labor camps, starvation or antiquated medical care. 
 More recently the number of alcohol abusers was re-estimated at more than 30 million, a virtual epidemic. In response to the concern expressed by both the United States and Russia about this problem, a delegation of American medical, psychiatric, education and administrative personnel from leading alcoholism-treatment centers traveled to Russia in 1989 to examine first hand this growing menace.
A second conference in Stamford, later the same year, fundamentally changed the way Russians viewed this disease. After visiting several American rehabilitation centers and seeing the latest in effective treatment, the Russians concluded that there is a better way, and that the time had come to learn more about it.
In 1990 the International Institute for Alcoholism Education and Training, a nonprofit organization, was founded to help address these problems. Working with a group of Russian colleagues, the institute opened the first westernized treatment center, the American-Russian Rehabilitation Center, in Moscow, in November 1990.
The American-Russian Rehabilitation Center is a 42-bed inpatient treatment center based on the Minnesota model and approved by both the current governments. The current director is an American, and the Russian staff has had extensive training both in the United States and in Russia.
The center offers inpatient and outpatient services that include group and individual counseling, a program designated for the family, educational lectures, after care, translated literature and recovery videos that have been dubbed in Russian.
In October 1991 the center celebrated its first anniversary. Hundreds of sober former patients traveled from miles away to participate in and talk about how their lives had been transformed. Many were far too familiar with the Russian alternatives and were now sober for the first time. The gratitude was overwhelming. Their successes gave the current patients a lot of hope.
This is just a beginning. There is still much work to be done. The International Institute for Alcoholism Education and Training applauds the efforts of other organizations, like Geunster House. At a time when there is so much economic, political and social turmoil in the Commonwealth of Independent States, it is comforting to know that treatment and recovery from the disease of alcoholism is increasing and spreading.

BYLINE: By John Durniak; John Durniak is a freelance writer, editor and consultant on photography.

 BODY:
"Change, change, change," is coming at the Image Bank, a New York picture agency acquired by the Eastman Kodak Company last fall. Those are the words of Pete Turner, a longtime photographer for the agency, which specializes in stock pictures used in commercial photography.
First, the Image Bank will move its corporate headquarters to Dallas in July, said Rex Jobe, the agency's new president. The office in New York will continue to be part of the agency's network. 
 The company is also determined to expand its global enterprise. Mr. Jobe has recently traveled to the agency's franchise offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Seoul, South Korea. "I will have flown 100,000 miles this year," he said. "Our business has to be worldwide."
Through franchising its offices, selling stock still pictures for advertising and publishing, and selling motion-picture stock film, the company grossed more than $60 million last year, and half of that came from its overseas operations. The Image Bank has 11 franchises in the United States, 1 in Canada and 65 in Europe. Rick Fleury, a company spokesman, estimated that in all, these offices have some 20 million photographs on hand and serve 30,000 clients.
Stock-picture sales do very well in bad economic times because using stock photos is cheaper than hiring a photographer. A stock photograph is a generic one kept on file, rather than a photograph made for, say, a specific advertisement.
Mr. Jobe has shut down unprofitable operations like the book-publishing division, which delivered books using Image Bank photographs, and has moved to improve communications between franchises and photographers. He has also made other efforts to stabilize the company financially. Like the move to Dallas.
The move will lead to "lower costs," Mr. Jobe said, "and we have easier access to both coasts." "Facilities in Dallas are state of the art," he continued. "Office buildings in the suburbs are excellent, and there's easy access to airports. We're internationally oriented, and people from all over this country and the world will be coming in to see us." Dallas also happens to be Mr. Jobe's hometown.
"We are remaking this company," Mr. Jobe said. "We are carefully monitoring changes of photography's directions. Our investments are being made for the next level of growth in this business."
And that means gathering new data on what types of pictures sell and researching new methods of transmitting images. Electronics and systems for holding photographs on compact disks will be forces in expanding the size of the stock-photo marketplace, company officials say.
The Image Bank's motion-picture division is also being reorganized. "The cinematography program is where still stock was 15 years ago," Mr. Jobe said. The company's film library has the work of more than 125 film makers, whose images are sold for television advertising and for use in motion pictures.
Mr. Jobe, 41 years old, started his first business in Dallas, the Color Place processing lab, which also has since added a computer graphics division, and he later added a second photo lab, Total Color in Dallas. He still owns both. Last year, Mr. Jobe, who also owned a four-state Image Bank franchise in the West, sold Eastman Kodak on the idea of acquiring the company. Kodak was interested, provided Mr. Jobe would assume the presidency. (To avoid conflicts of interest, he subsequently sold his Image Bank franchise.)
At first, staff photographers questioned the agency's new directions. But now, "all the fires are out," Mr. Jobe said. "I can put my attention elsewhere."
Mr. Turner, the photographer, admitted that he had some initial fears about the change. Now, he is a member of a group of staff photographers that meets monthly to discuss problems and new ideas.
In five to 10 years, computerized technology and satellites are likely to revolutionize how photos will be transmitted and used, Mr. Jobe said. "Change happens," he said. "If you're not changing, you're not dynamic."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
A New Sporty Coupe From Mazda

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
WHEN I think of the car that I have most wanted in my life, it is a model that was neither particularly exotic nor very rare. But it is still there in my fantasy, a new 1960 Cadillac coupe standing on the showroom floor at Mayo Motors in Trexlertown, Pa., glittering in its coat of dark turquoise paint.
At the time, and for me, the price was outrageous and the moment passed. What is very much with us in 1992, though, is a resurrection of the long-gone Cadillac's color. Along with a lot of other bright shades, blue-green is In with a capital I. 
 There is a turquoise car in the driveway right now, in fact. It is one of Mazda's latest offerings, an MX-3 sports coupe that is part of an intensive overhaul of the company's product line. And, when the roll-out is done, Mazda will have five new and completely redesigned models in the American market.
The MX-3 is a front-wheel-drive hatchback that is reasonably quick, that can carry four passengers in a pinch and that delivers as much as 35 miles per gallon.
According to the company, the new coupe "promises to give younger buyers a new way to express their individuality while staying within their budgets." Those budgets, of course, will have to be in the mid-teens, since base prices range from $11,000 to $13,800.
The variation has to do with the two models offered, a base MX-3 and the fancier MX-3 GS. The basic car also carries a four-cylinder engine, while the GS is powered by the only V6 in the small-sport segment.
The tester was a GS with the 1.8-liter six, which also is the smallest mass-produced V6 sold in America. Mazda engineers say the primary reason for development of the little six was its smoothness, particularly when compared to a four-cylinder engine of the same size.
Like the engine, the body was also made as smooth as possible, with design aided by a supercomputer. Slick contours and a low front end, plus short overhangs front and rear, give the car a solid, sporty feel and good aerodynamics, helped on the GS by a spoiler across the hatch.
From the front, there is a look that is almost animal, with cat's-eye headlights and a wide stance. Bright trim is absent, even around the grille, which is simply a slot across the nose. Bumpers blend into the body and are the same color, and the car has the alloy wheels that are de rigueur in this sort of vehicle.
Visibility is good, thanks to large glass areas, the biggest of which is the rear hatch. Unfortunately, the hatch is heavy as well, and even though it rises on gas struts, loading is a chore. The
liftover is part of that problem, since it is almost waist-high, meaning that cargo has to be lifted and then put down into a sort of well.
The back seat does fold flat, and the cargo cover that is hinged to the hatch can be removed. That improves carrying capacity, but the car is still less than practical as a hauler.
Inside, there are problems, too. First off, the car is low, somewhat cramped and hard to get into. The front buckets also are stiff, with very short cushions, and leg room is at a premium. Those things are factors of turning a small coupe into a four-seater, and they make a trip of any length something to think twice about. But rear passengers are even more unfortunate. The seatback is less a cushion than it is a padded wall between the interior and the hatch.
The other big complaint in the MX-3 is that it lacks an air bag and thus has motorized seat belts, with all the attendant annoyance and danger.
As an economical driver's car, though, the
MX-3 may be worth considering, either with the standard five-speed transmission or the optional automatic.
With 15-inch tires, anti-roll bars front and rear and fully independent suspension, it handles well. And, while the 1.6-liter four produces only 88 horsepower, the V6 puts out 130 horses, more than sufficient in a coupe that weighs only 2,500 pounds.
The black interior also was nicely put together, with color accents in the seating areas and soft gray cloth on the overhead. The tester's three-spoke wheel had cruise-control buttons on the right side of its hub, and the dash was neatly arranged around an optimistic 150-m.p.h. speedometer.
The GS also had full power equipment, including central locking and a power sunroof, and those are things to value in a small car. Most of all, of course, I liked the turquoise paint.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The British Message

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Any Democrat who thinks it will be easy to beat George Bush because this country is in a recession should look at the British election results. Economic misery is worse in Britain and has been going on far longer. Yet the Conservatives, in power for 13 years, won again.
Why? Of course there are many reasons for the Tory victory. But first among them, I am convinced, is that millions of Britons are now middle-class property-owners, more interested in raising their own living standards than in alleviating public squalor. 
 During the campaign, The Independent newspaper published a series of articles by well-known persons on how they would vote. Sir Claus Moser, the Warden of Wadham College, Oxford, said he was for Labor because of its "caring attitudes" on health, education and poverty. He continued:
"I'm looking for a government which cares crucially about our public services. Our general infrastructure is appalling and compares poorly with Europe, as everybody who travels knows. I look to Labor to give top priority to these, even if this does mean somewhat higher taxes. . . . I put all that higher than personal wealth."
Sir Claus was right about run-down public services in Britain: dirty streets, delayed subways, a struggling National Health Service. But he was evidently in a minority in being willing to pay for improvements.
As the campaign began, Labor's chief economic spokesman, John Smith, published detailed economic plans. A Labor Government, he said, would increase spending on the Health Service and other public needs, and pay for it by raising taxes on "the rich."
But the tax increases he outlined covered many who did not consider themselves "the rich." There would be increases on anyone earning over the equivalent of about $37,000 a year. The maximum income tax rate, on incomes over about $70,000 a year, would rise from 40 percent to 50 percent.
The Conservatives spent much of their campaign denouncing those tax plans. And the strategy worked. In exit polls many voters said they were troubled by Labor's tax proposals.
Mr. Smith, in short, paid for his honesty. He and others in the Labor Party may have learned what George McGovern did when he made his proposal in 1972 to tax away all inheritances over $500,000. Only a small percentage of Americans would have that much to leave. People who are not rich may nevertheless hope to do better -- and not want the Government to take it.
Another reason for Labor's disappointing showing was undoubtedly the historical baggage the party carries. Neil Kinnock, its leader, has done a remarkable job in pruning its extreme left. But voters still remember the Marxist rhetoric, and the excesses of union power. Perhaps it will just take time, and a new party leader, to give Labor the modern look of a European social democratic party.
History has also helped the Conservative Party by dividing its opposition. Before this century, it was Conservatives vs. Liberals. Then the Labor Party became the dominant force on the left. But the Liberals and successor parties, now the Liberal Democrats, continue to compete.
Because of Britain's voting system, with the winner in each of 651 districts going to Parliament, a third party gets few seats. Most of its votes, scattered around the country, are wasted. This is how the parties did last week in percentage of the popular vote and in the number of seats won.

	VOTE %	SEATS	CONS.	42	336	LABOR	34	271	LIB-DEM	18	20	The Liberal Democrats want to change the voting system to proportional representation, which will have given them about 117 seats. There will be increased pressure within Labor to support that profound change. For without some compact with the Liberal Democrats, Labor may have little chance to win.
The election, finally, was a personal triumph for Prime Minister John Major. He took over a tired and embittered party from Margaret Thatcher. Perhaps now, free of her ghost, he will be able to produce a Government more competent in economics and less negative in its most important policy: toward the European Community.

HEADLINE: Cleanup Project Can Be Inspiration

 BODY:
Mike Booth's splendid cleanup project in Long Branch by the unemployed, described in "How One Idea Solved Two Problems, Lifting a City's Spirits" (March 22), should inspire other communities to start similar ventures.
Mr. Booth's concern about Federal or state regulations concerning such projects prompts a question: how did our nation become the idol of the world years ago without all such regulations imposed by Big Brother meddling? 
 No wonder voters across the nation are staging a "bloodless voting-booth rebellion," to retire bungling bureaucrats to their home turfs. A big deregulation campaign is needed.
For over 30 years, I've been picking up litter daily. It helps keep my back in shape. Years ago, during winters, I wouldn't exercise. Then in spring, suddenly I'd do too much yard and garden work and end up in bed with back trouble. Not so now, exercising the back regularly.
By picking up litter, one is rewarded by seeing the area look better. It also keeps the litter from being washed by rains into storm sewers, thus ending up in our streams and the ocean.
My slogan has been "God made the earth beautiful, and it's everybody's job to keep it beautiful."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Election-Year Gridlock Fouls Washington Mood

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So far this year, Congress and President Bush have made one important law, enacting a second extension of unemployment benefits. The rest of the time they have been exchanging partisan insults and political declarations, sometimes in the form of bills and veto messages.
The House of Representatives, rarely a place for bipartisan legislative cooperation in the best of times, has been preoccupied for weeks with its dubious checks and uncertain re-election prospects. The Senate has been much more civil, but distracted by a sense that in times of staggering deficits there is little a legislative body can do about the nation's deepest problems. 
 And the White House has no shortage of political strategies, many of them involving middle-bore legislative proposals, but no legislative follow-through to speak of. For example, Mr. Bush has not held a single meeting with Democratic Congressional leaders on domestic issues, or any one domestic issue, this year.
There may be no plausible middle ground to find on some fundamental political issues. Mr. Bush supports term limits for lawmakers and they don't. Democrats want campaign spending limits and he rejects them. Democrats want to raise taxes on higher incomes to pay for cuts for the middle class, and he doesn't. An election year invites a sharpening of those differences, sometimes to extreme degrees. But that's what elections are for, to settle irreconcilable policy differences.
But on other questions, no one knows whether compromise can be found because there is no consultation. Health care is the issue lawmakers hear the most complaints about from their constituents. And it is exactly the sort of major issue where even a generally partisan Democratic leader like Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine acknowledges that "active, aggressive support" from the President is needed.
But Mr. Bush's modest health proposal, largely a knockoff of Senator Lloyd Bentsen's curbs on health insurance abuses, still has not been sent to Capitol Hill in bill form, though it was announced with much hoopla two months ago. And when they left town Friday for their Easter recess, Democrats were still treading water on the issue, with no consensus on a broader solutions, no roadmap for reaching one and an election-year concern that if they pass a slim bill that the President will sign, he will get political credit they would prefer to deny him.
A smaller example came this week when Lynn Martin, the Secretary of Labor, proclaimed her desire to work with Congress on more unemployment legislation and called for swift action, but refused to appear before the subcommittee writing the bill the House will consider the first week of May. But if some of the blame for the capital's newest cliche, "legislative gridlock," must be shared between Congress and the Bush Administration, there is quite a bit left over for Congress, especially the House, to claim for its own.
The atmosphere in the House these days is poisonous. Thursday's debates on campaign spending and House reform offered insults like "coverup" and "McCarthyism" far more often than they presented reasoned argument about how to fix the way lawmakers are elected or the way they do business.
Indeed, the most thoughtful statement of the day on politics and the House was issued, but not on the floor, by the 47th member of the House to announce this year that he would not seek re-election. Representative Vin Weber, a 39-year-old, six-term Minnesota Republican who is one of the House's most respected conservatives, but wrote quite a few overdrafts on the House bank, said he would not run again. He said he could raise $2 million, had his family and the party behind him, but had looked at himself and concluded:
"I'm simply not ready to put myself and my family through what is sure to be a vicious and highly personal campaign. Make no mistake. I know how to dish it out as well as anyone, but I don't want to. I don't want to face an entire campaign that focuses on nothing more than personal attacks, with no attention to the critical issues."
That's a fair description of the House itself these days. Each party sees its own frustrations and the other's hyperbole, but rarely stops and thinks about its own exaggerations or the other side's problems.
These days the Republicans are dishing it out, obstructing and being obnoxious, petty and personal on procedural and administrative matters. They are responding as best they can to being ground down by the Rules Committee Democrats who routinely rig procedures so Republicans hardly ever win a vote.
Mr. Bush often joins in, calling as he did Friday for "reform that is necessary because of the laxity of one-party control of the House of Representatives for 48 out of the last 52 years."
But that dominance is not the result of the sloppy supervision of the House bank or rules allowing proxy voting. It is not even the result of, though it is surely helped by, such perks as excessive franked mail. As Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, taunted Republicans Thursday night, Democrats control the House because they win more elections. That is the root of the Republicans' bad temper.
In the Senate, the frustrations are less partisan. When Tim Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, last week became the seventh Senator to announce retirement, his complaints about how tough it now is to legislate echoed, if inexactly, complaints from retiring Republicans.
The Senate, which has passed far more serious legislation than has the House so far this session, spent the week debating budget priorities. Several Senators sought to limit on how fast spending on entitlements would be allowed to grow. Liberal Democrats like Senators Mitchell and Edward M. Kennedy challenged this approach, arguing that the honest way to curb growing entitlements was to enact health care legislation that would control the explosion in medical costs behind soaring Medicare and Medicaid spending.
But in the end the issue was not settled over that fundamental argument. Instead, proponents abandoned it after the Senate voted to exempt the benefits for disabled veterans. It is, after all, an election year.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
In Connecticut, It's a Whole New April 15

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Everywhere else, tax season may be routine, but not here. At Connecticut's Department of Revenue Services, the first-ever filing season for the state's first-ever tax on wages is an exercise in controlled panic.
Since the 4.5 percent flat-rate wage tax was passed by a razor-thin margin in the Legislature last August, the tax department has careered from one crisis-etched deadline to another -- with pressures made all the worse by the atmosphere of hostility among many residents and deep ambivalence in the Legislature. 
 Because of a state hiring freeze, the agency has been able to fill only 45 of the 277 new positions it requested last year to handle the more than tripled volume of paperwork. State officials have warned that any resident filing between this weekend and the April 15 deadline could easily wait eight weeks for a refund.
With the future of the whole tax code still in question -- and some politicians still pledging repeal of the law in 1993 -- tax agency officials also fear that some residents may not be viewing the law as a permanent feature of the Connecticut landscape. As of late last week, less than half of the expected number of returns had come in.
And they're not even sure how many should come in. Having never processed a broad-based income tax before, agency officials lack the great psychological crutch of bureaucracies everywhere: a data base. Connecticut's tax collectors do not know how many people worked in the state in 1991 but lived elsewhere, or how much the final refund payout is expected to be. With nothing to guide them, officials don't know whether the flow of returns is behind schedule or not.
"It's the ultimate ratification of Murphy's law -- anything that you could imagine happening has happened," said A.J. Janschewitz, a spokesman for the tax department. "We're flying with no instruments."
Lawmakers and tax professionals generally praise the agency for its work in writing regulations and instruction books and printing forms over the eight months since the law was passed.
The tax code was enacted in the midst of a deep financial crisis on Aug. 22, after the state had operated for six weeks without a budget. Starting from scratch, the revenue agency had just nine days before the bill -- a last-minute compromise that few tax experts had even read -- became law. Payroll withholding began 30 days later, on Oct. 1. Five days after that, 40,000 screaming tax protesters converged on the capitol lawn.
"It's unfortunate that they had such little time to implement a bad tax," said William W. Wigglesworth, a principal at Tax and Business Services Inc., a tax-preparation company in Vernon, Conn. Mr. Wigglesworth said that aside from the delays in getting some forms, he has found few errors, but at least one major mystery: last year small business owners had one tax deadline; this year they have two, two weeks apart, with two returns that must be sent to two different Hartford addresses.
"I haven't the faintest idea why," he said.
Some glitches are not the state's fault. The Federal Government, for example, never got around to withholding money for the Connecticut tax last year from the paychecks of its workers in the state, according to Mr. Janschewitz of the tax department. That means that Federal employees, including nearly 13,000 postal workers, either saved to pay the Connecticut tax or are only now facing the grim reality of what they owe.
And a quality-control check conducted on Friday within the department revealed the latest snag: the private company hired to do data processing is making errors on about 10 percent of the returns it handles. One resident entitled to a $1.67 refund got a check for $167.
Some tax experts say that the number of people who had under withholding or no tax withholding at all is one reason why the tide of returns has lagged, since those people will definitely not be getting refunds and thus have reason to procrastinate. Another reason is probably simple unfamiliarity. Last month the agency logged 60,000 phone questions from taxpayers, more than would typically be received in a full year before the new tax law.

 By late last week, however, only about 41 percent of the projected 1.6 million returns had come in, compared to 53 percent in New York and about 75 percent at the Federal Internal Revenue Service.
The Legislature is also considering 113 pages of amendments to the tax code -- some that are purely technical, to clean up mistakes, and others that go to the basic issue of whether the state should tax wages at all.
One bill, which the co-chairman of the General Assembly's tax writing committee, Representative Richard T. Mulready, has given a 50-50 chance of success, would lower taxes for most residents by raising the rate for the wealthy. It would then phase the tax out entirely at the end of next year, while allowing residents a referendum on the issue even as the law is heading toward its automatic sunset.
The Republican Party has begun a drumbeat to elect a new Legislature in November pledged to repealing the law even sooner, and last week the state party chairman, Richard Foley Jr., encouraged all comers.
National tax experts say that with continued pressure on state governments in the 1990's, other states without income taxes, such as New Hampshire, Tennessee and South Dakota, might be forced to follow Connecticut's lead.
Mr. Janschewitz said his advice to revenuers everywhere would be to "beg, borrow and plead with your legislature for as much time as possible, because the calendar is your enemy." And then, he said, "fasten your seat belt -- there's turbulence ahead."

Hispanic Politicans Seek a Recipe for Raw Numbers

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
The "geraldomander" is what some in Texas call the 29th Congressional District, which was created for the express purpose of giving Houston's Hispanic voters a voice in Washington. Zigging and zagging across the city to encompass Hispanic enclaves, its jagged lines are said to resemble a drawing of the winged Aztec god Quetzalcoatl.
Across the country Hispanic groups are bidding for increased political power through the redistricting process, based on the 1990 census, to demand greater representation at every level of elected office from school boards to Congress. 
 With unusual unanimity, communities as diverse as the Puerto Ricans of the Bronx and Mexican-Americans in California's San Joaquin Valley have pursued a strategy that began with efforts to ensure the fullest possible count of Hispanic residents in the census, then shifted to courts and state legislatures for redistricting battles. The strategy has now entered its final phase with the 1992 election season. Altogether, it represents the largest effort at political empowerment under way by an American minority group. It is also an element in the process of cultural change as these communities try to find a niche in American society.
Houston's 29th Congressional District illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of one part of the strategy, the drawing of districts that give minorities a chance to win elections whenever possible, as required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Nationwide, the Latino population grew by 53 percent between 1980 and 1990, from 14.6 million people to 22.4 million, a growth rate more than five times the national average. In Houston, the country's fourth largest city, Mexican-Americans and other Hispanic residents represent 28 percent of the population of 1.7 million, but until now have had little chance at a Congressional seat.
Such raw numbers are required, under the Federal law, to be taken into account in redistricting. The figures, however, include huge numbers of immigrants and young people -- and in elections, only voters count. Within the zany lines of the "geraldomander," 60 percent of the people are Hispanic, but they account for only 35 percent of the registered voters.
There is no guarantee that this district will elect a Hispanic Congressman. Clark Kent Ervin, who is black, defeated a Hispanic hopeful in the Republican primary last month. In a Democratic primary runoff Tuesday, City Councilman Ben Reyes, Houston's senior Hispanic politician, faces a close contest against State Senator Gene Green. The mere possibility that Houston's Hispanic voters might fail to elect one of their own points up the problems Latinos nationwide have encountered as they try to translate population numbers into political clout.
A study of census and voting figures recently published by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials shows that Hispanic political influence is limited by demographic facts.
 
Why Low Turnouts?
 Nearly 38 percent of all Hispanic adults are non-citizens. Combined with low registration figures, this means adult Hispanic immigrants actually outnumber the 4.4 million Hispanic citizens registered to vote. And, compared to the nation as a whole, Hispanic voters are younger, poorer and worse educated, all factors associated with low turnouts.
Hispanic leaders also see themselves opposing a legacy of discrimination. "Court decisions in many states show that Hispanic votes have been diluted by the way districts have been drawn in the past, and that when the Voting Rights Act is applied, Hispanics can achieve representation," said Harry Pchon, director of Naleo.
The current round of redistricting has brought mixed results. There are new Hispanic Congressional seats virtually assured in Chicago, Los Angeles and San Antonio and, if Mr. Reyes wins in Houston, there will be 14 Hispanic members in Congress, up from 10. Another seat is possible in New York where the redistricting process is still under way, and perhaps another in northern New Jersey where strong Hispanic candidates are expected to contest the seat that Representative Frank J. Guarini recently said he would give up.
But there were widespread hopes that California, with the largest number of Hispanic voters by far, would produce as many as three or four new seats instead of just one.
 
Getting Involved
 "We have a lot of people who don't bother to vote even though they are citizens and we have a lot of immigrants who could become citizens but don't bother to do that," said Andy Hernandez, director of the Southwest Voters Registration Project, a San Antonio-based organization that has led several major redistricting efforts. "Redistricting gives them a reason to get involved in the political process by showing them they can elect their own representatives. It creates a climate of inclusion, and it is shaping the identity of our community for citizen and immigrant alike."
As they assess what has been accomplished so far, some Hispanic leaders have begun to suggest that new strategies are needed.
Linda Chavez, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization in New York, argues in her recent book "Out of the Barrio" that Hispanic residents have to find ways out of their ethnic enclaves and assimilate more fully. Redistricting efforts run counter to this goal because they rely on concentrations of voters.
Ms. Chavez agrees that Hispanic voters should have the right to elect Hispanic officials. "But," she writes "in order for this political strategy to work, Hispanics must remain in the barrio. It is a political victory that can be won only at the expense of the ultimate social and economic integration of Hispanics in this society."
Others, such as Arturo Vargas, a vice president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, argue that the existing strategy needs to be expanded. "In the past our focus has been on the census, redistricting and elections," he said. "But now we have to add a fourth element with a major naturalization campaign in which we devote much greater resources to encouraging the immigrants in our communities to become Americans."

Details Aren't the Crux of the Caterpillar Strike

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill.

 BODY:
As the strikers at Caterpillar Inc. walk the picket line together in the pre-dawn darkness, they often recount their 207-day strike in 1982 and the 80-day strike in 1979. Striking is nothing new to these 12,600 members of the United Auto Workers. Yet this time much is new in their dispute with Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction machinery, with ramifications unforeseen a few weeks ago. Now the talk on the line inevitably turns to what, for many, has become the most vexing question: what has brought them and their company to this precipice?
The strikers are not the only ones asking the question. Though loath to admit it publicly, many people involved in this drama -- from Caterpillar's managers, shareholders, customers and competitors to Wall Street analysts -- wonder why the union and management have collided so deliberately. The strike, many suggest, could be one of the crucial chapters in the history of the American labor movement, perhaps the Patco of the 1990's, as some have suggested, in a reference to President Reagan's replacement of striking members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization a decade ago. But it is too soon to tell. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service announced Friday that company and union officials would resume negotiations tomorrow. And many people who have studied the confrontation contend that when the larger philosophical issues are set aside, the workaday items that would be left in the conflict appear resolvable. 
 People who have studied the details of the company's offer and the contract signed last year by the United Auto Workers and Deere & Company estimate that the disagreement centers on less than $1,000 a year per employee, a few additional hundred dollars a year in medical premiums and a host of other, less weighty issues. Yet union and management are espousing larger philosophical objectives. Caterpillar is challenging the union's strategy of "pattern bargaining," in which a contract reached with one concern in an industry sets the standards for bargaining with others. And the union, its leaders say, is fighting for its survival, positioning itself for next year's contract negotiations with the big three automobile makers in Detroit.
"The difference between the two sides is purely philosophical and conceptual and not really based on detail," said Allen Luther Webster, an economist and professor of finance at Bradley University here. "One gets the impression that if the union were to relinquish its stand on pattern bargaining, the contract they would eventually reach with Caterpillar would be a whole lot like the one they would get under pattern bargaining."
That analysis has added to the frustration of the strikers, many tormented by facing a decision to either cross the picket line or see their incomes sacrificed, possibly forever. Finding new jobs with salaries of $35,000 or more will be particularly difficult.
For Caterpillar, the dispute represents a frontal assault on the tradition of pattern bargaining. The company insists that with nearly 60 percent of its products sold to customers overseas and 75 percent of them made in the United States, Caterpillar cannot have labor costs that unfailingly mirror those of other companies that have far lower levels of exports. It maintains that a fairer comparison would be the labor costs of its major competitors, particularly Komatsu Ltd. of Japan. Caterpillar can be seen as taking a stand for the remaining industries affected by pattern bargaining. The practice -- once common in such industries as steel, tires and automobiles -- has waned, principally because of the growing competition with industries outside the country where labor rates have been far lower. If Caterpillar ends its practice of falling in line with the industry pattern, so too, can General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
 
Inventory Declines
 The strike comes at a crucial time. Caterpillar lost $404 million last year, mainly because the recession crippled demand in the United States and growth overseas was lackluster. While the company built inventory in anticipation of a strike, it has been whittled down considerably. And the company does not want to miss the expected rebound in demand as it seems the United States economy is slowly starting to make headway.
For the U.A.W., there are several issues. The union, which lost more than a half million workers in the last 15 years, is attempting to re-assert its strength, positioning itself for the negotiations with automakers. A setback at Caterpillar, which employs less than 2 percent of the union's membership, would spell disaster down the road, union leaders assert. The union's position also tests the influence of its more conservative wing, which is less inclined to accommodate industries' demands for more flexibility in wage patterns and work rules. That strategy of flexibility, illustrated by the union's role in the innovative Saturn project at General Motors, has been pursued by many in the United Auto Workers leadership.
"But the U.A.W. is being pulled in two directions," said Thomas Mahoney, professor of management at Vanderbilt University. "This will determine what course the United Auto Workers will follow for the next decade. Whether it will follow a more militant, confrontational line or a more accommodationist line."
Many strikers may care deeply about these issues, but they are more concerned about their immediate needs. .
"It just seems like they could settle this if they really wanted to," said George E. Petty, a 46-year-old heat treatment technician at the company's plant in East Peoria who has worked for Caterpillar for 27 years. "But it seems that each side has some other agenda."

HEADLINE: What's Good for General Motors?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The troubles at General Motors spilled over into the boardroom last week, when the giant automaker's chairman was removed as head of a powerful board committee and its president was demoted. Chairman Robert C. Stempel had announced plans in December to shut down 21 plants and cut 74,000 workers from the payroll. But declaring that "a more aggressive management approach" was needed, the board served notice that the overhaul of the company was not going fast enough.
The moves were clearly a reprimand for Mr. Stempel. Not only did he lose his post as head of the board's executive committee, replaced by John G. Smale, a director who is a former chief executive of Procter & Gamble, but the unseated president, Lloyd E. Reuss, had been fulsomely praised earlier this year by Mr. Stempel, saying "Lloyd's my man." 
 The G.M. shake-up last Monday sent a ripple across corporate America, where outside directors, often under pressure from institutional investors, are being pressed to get tougher with managers. That the directors dressed down the top executives at G.M., long known as one of America's most clubby companies, gave added weight to the gesture.
So why now? The answer is the scale of the problem G.M. faces, as the economy remains sluggish and consumers reluctant to buy cars. G.M. had a $4.5 billion loss last year, the biggest in corporate history. It shares its problems with Ford, which lost a company record $2.3 billion last year, and Chrysler, which lost a record $795 million. Chryler's board last month plucked an outsider, Robert J. Eaton, head of G.M.'s profitable European operations, to be its next chief executive, while telling Lee A. Iacocca that his Dec. 31 retirement date was firm.
But the stakes are highest at G.M., the nation's biggest automaker and largest industrial employer.
G.M.'s week of woe had a Long Island coda: John McNamara, a G.M. dealer in Port Jefferson, was accused of fraud in procuring hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from the company's finance unit, General Motors Acceptance Corporation. G.M. claims Mr. McNamara owes the company $436 million. With a dealers-- or corporate financial controls -- like that, who needs the Japanese?

HEADLINE: UNEASY CHOICES;
Clinton, Among Others, Prevails With the Help of Grudging Voters

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Given what he had gone through in the preceding two weeks, quadruple victory was especially sweet for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas on Tuesday. He won the big one, the New York Presidential primary, by a good margin, added Wisconsin and Kansas to his string and even prevailed in the non-binding Minnesota "beauty contest." He fairly glowed with bonhomie.
Unless some unforeseen disaster befalls his campaign, Mr. Clinton is going to be the Democratic Presidential nominee. Paul E. Tsongas as much as conceded that when he announced on Thursday that he had decided against getting back in the race. Edmund G. Brown Jr., Mr. Clinton's only active rival, concedes these days that he finds it difficult to put together a scenario for his own triumph. 
 That should be great news for the Democrats, who have longed for an early resolution of their contest. Ronald H. Brown, the party chairman, thinks it's essential to start soon on the development of a fall contest against President Bush -- fashioning programs, raising money, fleshing out campaign staffs.
But if that's so, if Mr. Clinton is on the verge of a famous victory, why are people so uneasy with the course of the campaign so far?
A considerable segment of the public is uneasy, it would seem, because it has developed deep-seated doubts about what kind of man the Arkansas Governor is. People told interviewers at the polls in New York that they doubted that he had the integrity needed to be President (46 percent of the Democrats), and that they wished they had other choices (66 percent). Close to a third backed Mr. Tsongas, a ghost candidate with no advertising and only a couple of speeches. Almost three-quarters of the eligible voters stayed home.
 
Doubting Nixon
 The doubts are not as profound as those many had and have about Richard M. Nixon; Mr. Clinton hasn't been on the national scene very long. But they are not wholly dissimilar, as the resemblance between "Tricky Dick" and "Slick Willie" suggests. If Mr. Clinton is to shake off the character issue, he will have to distract the electorate and stop sounding, as an old law-school friend puts it, "like a Big Man on Campus who thinks he can talk his way out of anything."
Democratic pros aren't worried about Mr. Clinton's character. They know him and, for the most part, like him. But they can read the polls, and they fear that he will prove unable to beat Mr. Bush, unable even to help Democrats in Congress hold their seats in the face of evident distaste for incumbents. That explains the reluctance of people on Capitol Hill to endorse him, even though they see his nomination as almost inevitable. The endorsements will come, but not quickly and not gladly.
Former Vice President Walter S. Mondale said the other day that in his long political career he had never seen the public so disgusted with politics and politicians, so reluctant to repose any faith in government, so dubious about the possibilities of their lives and their children's lives improving.
Mr. Tsongas and other outsiders have benefited from that environment, but in the end, Mr. Clinton, a professional politician despite his efforts to avoid that label, managed to prevail. Likewise Mr. Bush. And likewise John Major in Great Britain, who last week managed to pull his Tories through to a fourth straight general-election victory, a feat unprecedented since Napoleonic times.
All politics, they say, is local, but there is clearly an unsettled political mood right across the Western world. It would be surprising if there were not; economies almost everywhere have been reeling, with widespread unemployment and near-record foreclosures on homes. That has been happening, furthermore, at a time when the West has been trying to readjust its values and priorities to reflect the disappearance of the great Communist threat.
"Government no longer looks to the average European or American like the heroic defender of the ramparts," said Robert Hormats, a managing director of Goldman Sachs International who has worked for several Presidents. "The generation that looked to government to rebuild after the war is dying out. And most governments find themselves unable to fulfill the expectations of rising generations for broader government services."
The normal impulse in times of discontent, of course, is to "throw the bums out," in the pungent American phrase, and replace them with the opposition. But that has not been happening automatically this year. The great parties of the center-left and center-right are in trouble.
No longer concerned about whose finger rests on the nuclear trigger, voters seem more interested in economic affairs and less worried about the capacity of parties or leaders to devise and carry out complex international strategies.
In local elections last Sunday in two German states, Schleswig-Holstein in the north of the country and Baden-Wurttemburg in the south, voters took out their frustrations over the course of events on both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats. The beneficiaries were the environmentalists on the left and a pair of extremist parties on the right that promised to do something about the flood of asylum-seekers from Eastern Europe.
In France, resentment over foreign residents, largely economic , has helped to fuel the rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen, a charismatic right-wing orator who, like the German extremists, promises simple solutions. President Francois Mitterrand's Socialists have fared so poorly in local elections that he replaced his Prime Minister in a desperate move to turn things around.
In Italy, regional tensions generated an electoral windfall not for the Christian Democrats or the Socialists but for the Lombardy League, a group that seeks autonomy for the wealthy north because of alleged links between the Government and the Mafia in the south.
 
British Similarities
 Election-week polls suggested that something similar might happen in Britain, with the Conservatives and Labor battling to a near-draw and a small third party, the Liberal Democrats, holding the balance of power. But in Britain's winner-take-all system, third parties seldom do as well on election day as in the polls because people fear wasting their votes. (H. Ross Perot may find the same phenomenon here come November).
If the trend is international, in other words, the way it works is governed by local details. The Tories were helped not only by the electoral system, but also by other particularly British phenomena -- the Labor party's old reputation as a wild and woolly bunch, which the party leader Neal Kinnock was never quite able to eradicate, and the tremendous number of seats Labor needed to gain to reach a clear majority.
"Protest votes are as hard to cast in general elections in Britain as in the United States," said Peter Jenkins of The Independent, who is a leading political columnist. "But make no mistake, this was a choice for a lot of voters between a repugnant government and an opposition that people didn't trust."
Such is the case in the United States as well. President Bush was obviously delighted that Mr. Major had won, congratulating him on "a sterling victory," not least because he, too, is a relatively colorless, centrist conservative who succeeded an ideological superstar. No doubt Mr. Bush hopes he, too, will seem the more reasonable choice this fall. But Mr. Clinton has the potential to represent a greater break with the past than Mr. Kinnock did. In Britain, it was Mr. Kinnock who proposed higher taxes; in the United States it is Mr. Bush who has already done so.
In a season of discontent, the trends change direction as often as a shallow, meandering river. So it has been in the Democratic campaign, and it may become the pattern in the fall showdown between Mr. Bush and, as now seems likely, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot. The President is April's favorite, but he would be foolish to think that that is enough.

Life Can Be Sweet on Europe's Subsidized Farms

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: OFFOY, France

 BODY:
Standing in the midst of the great green wheat fields of Picardy with the pungent stench of fertilizer in his nostrils, Dominique Mathieu condenses the myriad intricacies of Europe's agricultural policy into a single phrase:
"The more wheat I produce, the more I'm paid," says this French gentleman farmer in a tawny jacket. "It's as simple as that." 
 But thereby hangs a complex tale. It involves charges and countercharges of unfair subsidies between the United States and Europe, intractable discussions on agricultural reform, and a clash in world trade talks that is clouding trans-Atlantic relations and holding up a conclusion of the so-called Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Tranquil as this rural scene appears, with its furrowed fields stretching away to distant church spires, it has in effect become one of the ultimate theaters of the conflict affecting the world's $4.5 trillion in annual trade. And, in the post-Soviet world, trade is a subject for the sort of big-time summitry once reserved for arms. Economists and others have observed that the subject of trade has assumed an entirely new level in diplomacy.
The level, as it happens, of Mr. Mathieu, who lives in the middle of Europe's breadbasket. A prosperous man who also boasts a citrus farm in Texas, he owns 1,175 acres of very fertile land about 80 miles north of Paris on which he raises wheat, beets and potatoes.
Mr. Mathieu, like the 12-nation European Community's other 12 million farmers, does business under the terms of the so-called Common Agricultural Policy. This was introduced 31 years ago to insure Europe's self-sufficiency in basic foodstuffs and prevent the desertion of the countryside. It has served its purpose, but has also become unwieldy and costly. Last year, 63 percent of the Community's $70 billion budget was spent on agriculture.
Some of this money helped Mr. Mathieu make a nice living. He says he has profit margins of 15 percent on annual sales of about $1.2 million. He sells his entire wheat production to a big local cooperative called Agro Picardie at a price, guaranteed by the Community, of 100 francs -- $18 -- for each 100 kilograms, or about $163 per ton. This, he said, compares to a market price of about 60 francs -- $10.90 -- per 100 kilograms, or $99 per ton. Agro Picardie then exports at world market prices and gets a Community subsidy to make up the difference. Last year, France, the Community's largest grain producer, earned $5.2 billion from grain exports, its third largest export item behind cars and auto parts. Local grain farmers are thus able to ship as much wheat as they can produce to Agro Picardie -- a fact that leads Mr. Mathieu to use fertilizer at least three times a year and secure yields three or four times higher than American wheat farmers. The results have been dramatic. In a decade, the Community's share of the world wheat market has risen from 16 to 21 percent and the American share has tumbled to 31 percent from 46. The Community's share of all agricultural trade grew to 18 percent from 14 percent between 1983 and 1990, while America's dropped to 19 percent from 23 percent, according to United States figures.
Community farmers, led by the French, do not dispute that their share of world markets is growing. But they say American agriculture is equally subsidized. "This is all about the U.S. quest for hegemony in the world grain markets," said Alain Jeanroy, the director of the French Association of Corn Producers. "U.S. farmers are just as subsidized as we are and they want everything."
Farmers in the United States are indeed subsidized under the so-called Deficiency Payment System. But there is a difference: The European system encourages unlimited production by guaranteeing an above-market price for all produce, while American farmers have to take some land out of production to receive subsidies and there are limits on how much they may receive. One study by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that subsidies represent 50 percent of the value of all agricultural production in the Community, compared to 30 percent in the United States.
A proposal by Arthur Dunkel, the director general of GATT, to cut the volume of subsidized agricultural exports by 24 percent -- a measure that would affect Europe and particularly France far more than the United States -- is now the chief sticking point in the GATT talks. Put bluntly, Mr. Mathieu and other farmers perceive a direct attack on their livelihoods, and the French Government sees a threat to over $5 billion worth of annual export revenue.
Nonetheless, while their position on GATT seems firm, European farmers do see the need for changing the common agricultural policy. With vast mountains of grain, butter, beef and other products being piled up under the current system, and the Community budget under strain, they concede that a gradual reform is needed. The Community commission wants to shift to a policy more like the American, under which farmers would receive payments for taking land out of cultivation and subsidies would often be tied to the size of farms rather than the amount produced. "Maybe when we have similar subsidy systems, it will be clearer what each side has and easier to compromise," Mr. Jeanroy suggested.
But time presses. A GATT failure would lead to more protectionism, lost growth, more difficulties for Eastern Europe and trans-Atlantic tensions. In Washington on April 22, President Bush and Jacques Delors, President of the European Community's Commission, are to try again to bring the five years of GATT talks to a successful conclusion. But first they will have to deal with the likes of Mr. Mathieu, who prefers the slow and steady pace of the seasons to abrupt decisions. "I cannot accept an overnight change," he said, gesturing to the expanse of his farm. "The problem is the U.S. lost its share of the world market and it wants it back."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Why Japan's Influence Doesn't Match Its Economic Power

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
In East Asia no less than anywhere else, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Communism was supposed to lead to vast new influence for Japan, the region's economic superpower. But recent months have shown, instead, just how deeply Japan remains mired in the debates and anxieties of the past.
At least to its neighbors, the new Japan looks suspiciously like the old Japan. And in Japanese eyes, Asia is still a place for caution, if not paralysis. "The cold war is at an end, but Japanese don't really know how to disengage from it," said Terumasa Nakanishi, professor of international relations at the University of Shizuoka. "We lack any kind of national consensus on how to act." 
 Some of Japan's self-confidence has been deflated, in any case, by its poor economic performance recently. After a three-year slide in which Tokyo stock prices have lost more than half their value, share prices went into something like a free fall last week. Despite a rebound Friday, fears persist that the current mild recession could deepen and drag down the world economy. Privately, Japanese leaders say this may be a bad time for bold actions, especially costly ones.
Toward Russia, for example, financial concerns are an impediment to direct Japanese participation in an economic bailout. But the main concern here is still political. The same dispute over four tiny islands in the Kurile chain that has blocked improvement of relations since the end of World War II, when the Soviet Union seized them, has resisted all recent attempts at a settlement. Though negligible in strategic value, the islands are a powerful symbol of past unresolved grievances.
Japanese politicians, especially nationalists, say the final chapter of the country's climb back to legitimacy after defeat cannot be written until the islands are returned. But diplomats have begun reluctantly to conclude that with Russian nationalism flaring anew in Siberia, President Boris N. Yeltsin may find it more difficult to give up the islands than even Mikhail S. Gorbachev did.
The practical effect is that Japan continues to be a reluctant partner in the Western scramble to assemble a package of assistance to help Mr. Yeltsin out of his economic problems. The $24 billion aid package announced 10 days ago by the United States and Germany made Japan decidedly uncomfortable. Japanese diplomats said it was inappropriate to announce the package because all the details had not been worked out, and because a premature announcement might send the wrong signal to the Russians: that they had the money in hand and could ease up on austerity.
 
'Political Constraints'
 Japanese leaders said that although Tokyo would join multilateral efforts to stabilize the ruble, Japan would not increase its own aid beyond what it announced last year after the failed coup against Mr. Gorbachev. "We face political constraints," said Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata.
There has also long been talk here of investing in the exploration of natural gas and oil in eastern Russia or other parts of what was the Soviet Union. But it remains just talk. Japanese industrialists, cautious in normal times, are not about to invest during the current recession in a resource for which there may not be a need until well into the 21st century. They also look to the Government for insurance or guarantees, and Japanese leaders are not ready to cooperate until the territorial issues are resolved.
But Russia is not the only place over which Japan is showing caution. Many people had expected Tokyo to play a role in rebuilding Cambodia. Indeed, Yasushi Akashi, a United Nations diplomat who heads the peacekeeping efforts there, expects his country to pay for at least one-third of the cost of stationing troops. But for now it looks as if Japan will not send its own troops, despite the best efforts of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. As in the Persian Gulf war last year, Japan will help foot the bill without putting its people on the line.
The Cambodians say they would like Japanese troops, if only in a logistical role, but other Asian nations are less sure. Last week, Jiang Zemin, the Chinese Communist Party General Secretary, visited Japan and, in diplomatic language, recommended caution. The idea of Japanese troops going overseas for the first time since World War II was a "sensitive" issue for "well-known reasons," he said.
If Japanese officials were disappointed that Mr. Jiang was not warmer to Japan's playing a more robust role in the region, Japanese relations with other Asian countries are also troubled. A growing trade imbalance with South Korea is rankling President Roh Tae Woo and other leaders in Seoul. And three years of intensive efforts to improve ties with South Korea have resulted in more tensions than ever, this time over Japan's dismissal of claims for compensation by South Korean women who say they were kidnapped from their communities and forced to become sex slaves for Japanese front-line troops during the war.
Because it continues to be dogged by the past, Japan has had a hard time implementing its pledge to join a "global partnership" with Washington to combat poverty and tyranny in the world. Not only does Japan refuse to criticize China on human rights, but it has also looked the other way when Burma and Thailand suppressed their democratic stirrings.
Japan had pinned a lot of its hopes for a new order in Asia on a long-planned visit by Emperor Akihito to China later this year. But because of lingering Korean and Chinese resentments, the visit is now uncertain. What was to have been a symbol of the progress Tokyo had made in being accepted has thus instead become a victim of the lingering doubts in Japan's own backyard.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong-China Fence: No Barrier to Commerce

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
The wire fence between Hong Kong and China is as sturdy as ever, but it no longer seems to be much of a barrier. Telephone operators for Hong Kong may soon be based in China, and already some citizens here are finding that it would be cheaper to spend eternity in a burial plot in China.
With the growing integration of Hong Kong and southern China's Guangdong Province, an economic partnership is emerging that in the coming years may become a formidable force in Asia. Hong Kong is becoming the financial capital for southern China, and it sometimes seems that Hong Kong is taking over China instead of the other way around. 
 While many people in Hong Kong still worry deeply about China's plans to assume control over the territory beginning on July 1, 1997, when Britain's 99-year lease expires, there also is a sparkle of hope these days with the growing recognition that the merger will create opportunities as well as dangers for Hong Kong. That new burst of optimism has sent the local stock market rising about 25 percent since last fall, and real-estate prices have doubled in some residential areas in the last year and a half.
"Hong Kong is the prime driver of the greatest economic takeoff in world history," said William H. Overholt, executive director at Bankers Trust Company in the territory. "It's much more important to China than New York is to the United States."
 
Selfless Hero Meets Rolls Royce
 Such enthusiasm is far from universal, and the general improvement in the public mood -- which was bleak for long after the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in June 1989 -- may be fickle. Apprehension is certain to grow in the tense final years before the hand-over of power from Britain to China. But for now, many seem to believe that the considerable political risks of integration may be matched by substantial economic benefits.
"The sky is the limit," said Richard Y. C. Wong, director of the Hong Kong Center for Economic Research at Chinese University, adding that Guangdong Province is coming to recognize its dependence on Hong Kong. "If Hong Kong were to disappear in an earthquake, China's economic activity would slowly grind to a halt. There is no economic center in China."
The growing integration reflects a remarkable synergy between a monument to capitalism and a bastion of Communism, between a society that flaunts diamond rings and Rolls Royces and one that is supposed to emulate the selfless soldier-hero, Lei Feng.
In part, the surge of optimism is a tribute to Hong Kong's historic vitality and resilience. Repeatedly in the lives of people here -- after the Communist Revolution in 1949, the 1967 Communist-inspired riots, the stock slump in the early 1970's in which shares lost more than 90 percent of their value, the gloom during tough negotiations in the early 1980's over Hong Kong's post-1997 future -- prospects have seemed grim, only to improve with time.
 
Manufacturing in China
 "On a bad day when I think it isn't going to work, I freshen up my memory with what we have actually done in Hong Kong, what are we, how strong are we and how prepared are we for the future: you've got to look at history a little bit," said Simon Murray, group managing director of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., during an interview in his big-windowed office.
"Hong Kong, five and a half million people, piece of land not much bigger than a large Texas cattle ranch, no natural resources, not even enough water to drink," he said. "And here we are, the 11th largest trading nation in the world. That ain't bad for starters."
A tiny, barren patch of land that seems to grow buildings rather than rice, Hong Kong has had to turn to China for decades for its daily food and water. But in recent years, that dependence has blossomed into a formula for economic growth.
In a bid to remain competitive on world markets, Hong Kong has moved its manufacturing base to Guangdong Province across the border: Hong Kong shares its brains and expertise and gets cheaper land and labor in return. The result is that total exports from Hong Kong -- including goods made in China en route to the outside world -- have soared nearly 20 percent on average in each of the last four years.
 
Capitalist Influences
 The economy here still depends heavily on the United States, whose appetite for toys -- including Barbies, G. I. Joes and Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles spinoffs -- as well as electronics, watches, clothes and other products, accounted for nearly 23 percent of the territory's total exports last year.
But China is an even more significant trading partner. Last year, it took 27 percent of Hong Kong exports -- many of them parts that are assembled in China and then exported -- and a total share in Hong Kong's trade of 32.4 percent.
Through frequent contacts, Hong Kong's lifestyle and values are being projected throughout Guangdong. There is a yearning in Canton and other cities for the wealth and sophistication in the territory, and perhaps as a result the most popular music in Guangdong is that of Hong Kong singers, the most popular books include many Hong Kong titles, and out-dated Hong Kong fashion magazines are passed around among friends as treasures. Even the Cantonese dialect as used in Guangdong is picking up some Hong Kong expressions.
"Hong Kong people have had a real impact in Guangdong," said a Cantonese businessman posted in Hong Kong. "But Guangdong hasn't had any influence on Hong Kong. We can easily absorb capitalist influences, but socialism doesn't have much to offer Hong Kong."
While Hong Kong may continue to profit significantly from links with China, economists and analysts acknowledge that that dependency also carries problems and high risks.
 
Role of Trade Status
 About 1,150 people are still emigrating from Hong Kong each week, contributing to a significant labor shortage. The shortage lures waves of Chinese illegal immigrants. Last year, Hong Kong turned back 33,000 Chinese and the number was 5,000 in the first two months of this year.
Hong Kong admits a small number of legal immigrants from China, but the vast majority are illegal immigrants who often turn to crime, and criminal gangs on both sides of the border are forming partnerships in the same way as orthodox businesses. Last year, more than 10 cars were stolen from the territory each day -- among them Mercedes-Benzes stolen at the rate of one nearly every 40 hours. Many of them were smuggled to China on powerful speedboats that travel at night without lights. Smugglers can make enormous profits by selling those cars on the Chinese black market.
Another indication of the integration of Hong Kong and Guangdong are the joint ventures in bank robbery. Criminal gangs from Guangdong, sometimes working with local thugs, cross illegally from China in the morning, rob a Hong Kong bank or jewelry store in midday, and return to safety in China in the evening.
Partly because of proximity, this territory chugs and churns on events in China. The local stock market is much more likely to zigzag on news from China rather than from Japan or the United States. One continuing source of fear in Hong Kong is the risk that the United States will punish China for its human-rights abuses by cutting off low tariffs known as most-favored-nation trade status. That would have a major effect on Hong Kong, through which much of Chinese-American trade passes.
 
Cross-Border Investments
 One reason optimism has soared lately is the January visit by Deng Xiaoping, China's 87-year-old senior leader, to the cities of Zhuhai and Shenzhen, right across the border from Hong Kong. Mr. Deng reaffirmed the market-oriented development strategy of Guangdong, and asserted that Hong Kong could keep its capitalist ways not just for 50 years after 1997, as he had earlier said, but for 100 years.
Such comments boosted the stock market, and the property market has also been rising. One banker who purchased an apartment in a middle-class area for nearly $250,000 in the summer of 1990 has seen her home more than double in value.
"Agents call me all the time and they leave messages in my mailbox," the banker said. "People are willing to pay more than $500,000 for my place now. Unfortunately, I have to live there so I can't sell it."
The property boom is beginning to subside and commercial real estate prices have not done nearly as well. But Hong Kong investment in China hardly shows signs of ebbing. In the first nine months of last year, Hong Kong invested $1.4 billion in China, compared to $1.89 billion for all of 1990, according to Chinese statistics. Total Hong Kong investment in China in the 1980's was about $23 billion, economists here say, with about 80 percent going to Guangdong Province.
 
A Generation's Confidence
 Industry experts say 80 percent of Hong Kong's toy manufacturers have operations in Guangdong. In Hong Kong, only 680,000 of the territory's workers have jobs in manufacturing, but across the border, some three million Chinese work in manufacturing industries for Hong Kong companies, according to the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.
Yet for all the opportunities created by integration with China, many Hong Kong residents remain wary -- and remember that the territory is largely populated by people whose parents already fled Communism once.
"A lot of industrialists here came from Shanghai" and are deeply suspicious of the Communists, said Paul M. F. Cheng, chairman of Inchape Pacific Ltd.
"But my generation went to the U.S. or the U.K. and came back with a lot of enthusiasm and confidence. The older generation said, 'I've been through it once.' We said, 'Don't worry.' "
Mr. Cheng continued, "Tiananmen Square jolted our generation, so even though the optimism has returned, it's guarded."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
BUSH ATTACKS WAY UNIONS ARE USING NONMEMBERS' FEES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
In a move long sought by conservatives, President Bush will soon take steps to prevent labor unions from using money collected from nonunion workers for political activities that those workers oppose.
In a speech planned for Monday, Mr. Bush will describe his actions as a way to enforce a 1988 Supreme Court decision that held that workers who choose not to join a union may not be required to pay for any union activities other than collective bargaining and representation on labor-management issues. 
 The measures are intended, in part, to limit the activities of unions in support of Democratic candidates this year. Labor leaders vehemently oppose the restrictions, saying that the rules will impose an undue accounting burden by requiring unions to keep detailed records of spending in different categories. The labor leaders also say that Mr. Bush is pandering to the right wing and that his plan will impede unions' legitimate political activities.
 
$2.4 Billion a Year
 White House officials estimate that the President's actions will eventually keep $2.4 billion a year out of union coffers and in workers' pockets. The actual amount depends on many factors, including the number of workers who demand refunds. Labor economists estimate that 17 million workers belong to unions and nearly two million nonmembers are represented by unions in collective bargaining.
A White House official said President Bush's actions would "protect workers' rights recognized by the Supreme Court" in the 1988 case, Communications Workers of America v. Beck.
Harry E. Beck, an electronics technician whose feud with the union led to the 1988 decision, said that he had been invited to the White House for Mr. Bush's announcement on Monday and that he planned to attend.
 
No Effect on Union Members
 Unions endorse Democratic candidates far more often than Republicans. "There's no doubt about that," said Laurence Gold, general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. But public opinion polls show that Republican candidates have won about one-third of the votes of union households in recent Congressional elections, and slightly more than that in Presidential races.
In many states, workers who do not belong to a union but are covered by a union contract may be required to pay dues or fees to the union. Under the new policy to be announced by Mr. Bush, such workers may request and obtain a refund of any portion of their fees used to finance political work, lobbying, organizing activities or social and charitable events.
The refunds are not available to union members. A member of a teachers' union, for example, could not get a reduction in dues if he or she objected to the union's political activities. But members could resign from a union and get a reduction in fees if they did not want to pay for its political activities. Or members could work within the union to change its policies through debate and voting at union meetings.
Under Federal law, unions may not use dues for direct campaign contributions. But they can use the money to mobilize workers through such activities as telephone banks, newsletters and tapes supporting particular candidates and get-out-the-vote drives, including transportation to the polls.
Mr. Bush intends to issue an executive order requiring Federal contractors to post notices telling employees of their right to object to unions' use of their money for political activities.
In addition, he will order the Labor Department to require unions to report separately on the amounts they spend for political activities, lobbying and contract negotiations, so workers can identify spending for any political purposes they oppose.
 
Action on Complaints
 Finally, Mr. Bush is urging the National Labor Relations Board to speed the handling of workers' complaints about union spending.
As an example, a skilled aircraft mechanic, who earns $25 to $30 an hour, now pays union dues of about $30 a month to the International Association of Machinists. Union officials said that a nonmember who objected to paying the full fee could get a reduction of 20 percent, or $6 a month, representing the amount used for lobbying, organizing and political activity.
The theme linking all the actions planned by Mr. Bush is that no workers should be forced to have money taken out of their paychecks to help politicians that they disagree with.
Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the steps planned by Mr. Bush demonstrated "his willingness to pander to union-bashing, right-wing extremists in his party." But Administration officials note that it was a liberal Justice, William J. Brennan Jr., who wrote the 1988 Court decision saying nonunion workers may not be required to finance the political activities of a union with which they disagree.
In an interview, Mr. Beck, whose suit led to the ruling, said: "I am glad that President Bush is instituting employee protections that were granted by the Supreme Court in 1988. But I wish he had moved sooner. People are losing jobs and being harassed because they are trying to invoke their rights under that decision."
An Administration official said, "We want to make sure workers know that they have these rights, and that they needn't fear intimidation if they exercise them." The official spoke on the condition that his name not be used because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters prior to Mr. Bush's speech on Monday.
Mr. Kirkland said Mr. Bush's actions would weaken unions and undermine workers' rights. "It is laughable for the President, after vetoing unemployment insurance improvements and failing to show concern for the millions of jobless in the longest recession since the 1930's, now to pretend that he's the friend of workers," Mr. Kirkland said.
Allison Beck, general counsel of the International Association of Machinists, said Mr. Bush's plan would impose "a tremendous burden" on unions. "The President's order could very well mean that every one of our 1,450 local lodges will have to hire an accountant or auditor" to keep detailed records of spending, said Ms. Beck, who is not related to Harry Beck.
The machinists union has 550,000 active workers on its membership rolls. About 550 nonmembers have objected to the use of their fees by the union.
Timothy M. McConville, vice president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which provides legal aid to workers who feel their rights have been violated, said: "The Supreme Court gave employees the right to cut off use of their compulsory union dues for politics, but the performance of the National Labor Relations Board in enforcing that decision has been terrible. There are hundreds of cases at the board, some pending for five or six years, and the employees who brought them are still waiting for relief."
Jerry M. Hunter, general counsel of the board, said his office had found merit in more than 300 complaints by employees who said their rights were being violated by unions.
Mr. Hunter said the agency had not carried out the Supreme Court decision as quickly as some people might like because "the Court created a whole new area of the law, and it took some time for us to plow through all the cases that were pending at the board." Many cases had been "put on hold, pending the outcome of the Beck case in the Supreme Court," he said.
Under many contracts, employees who do not wish to join a union must pay fees to the union, known as agency fees, equivalent to union dues.

HEADLINE: Ex-Soviets to Get a $12 Billion Loan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
The World Bank plans to lend $12 billion to $15 billion to the former Soviet republics by 1995 to bankroll food and oil-production projects and pay for critical imports like spare parts, according to the international lending institution's president.
The official, Lewis T. Preston, said that by the end of December, the World Bank expects to have lent $1.5 billion of the $24 billion in assistance pledged in a seven-nation package announced by President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany on April 1. 
 After that, loans by the bank to the republics will increase until they reach an annual $4.5 billion to $5 billion three years from now, Mr. Preston said.
His remarks, made Thursday during his first interview since he was named to the job a year ago, represent the first time that the World Bank has set forth specific figures and dates for how much it is prepared to contribute. The numbers were roughly in line with expectations.
The Bush Administration and other Western governments, short of money and struggling to cope with economic weakness at home, have increasingly looked to the bank and to another major agency, the International Monetary Fund, for aid to the republics.
The first World Bank loan is likely to be a credit to Russia at the end of June for the purchase of imports like spare parts for machinery, Mr. Preston said.
To limit the possibilities of fraud and corruption, the bank will probably not lend the money directly to the republics' governments. Instead, it will pay the bills for specific import shipments that its staff believes necessary, and require eventual repayment with interest by the republics. This is standard practice for the World Bank.
Later loans will be made for farm and energy projects in order to increase food and oil production, he said, declining to discuss specific loans and amounts. Officials of the former Soviet republics have been slow to suggest projects because their best economists are trying to solve monetary problems first, said John P. Hardt, the senior specialist in the region's economics at the Congressional Research Service.
The World Bank was created at the end of World War II to help finance the rebuilding of Europe. Since the late 1950's, it has specialized in helping the world's poorest countries. Some of these nations now worry that the most qualified development economists will be assigned to work on problems of the former Soviet republics.
"There is a fear, there is a danger, that the best staff" of the World Bank will be diverted to aid for the former Soviet lands, said Charles M. Nyirabu, Tanzania's Ambassador to the United States. He acknowledged that no one in the bank's Tanzania section had been transferred and that lending to his country had not been cut back.
Mr. Preston was asked to explain why his organization should focus on the former Soviet republics, rather than the third world, unless this was a way to oblige the biggest donor nations.
"There is so much to do, there clearly isn't enough in the way of resources," he said initially. "The donors are going to be cautious in terms of their own budgetary programs."
Pressed for a further explanation, he responded that the European economies would benefit from growth in the republics' markets. Asked for his view of the World Bank's mission, Mr. Preston replied that it was "the alleviation of poverty." Only three of the former Soviet republics qualify as very poor countries eligible for loans at the bank's most preferential rates, he said.
World Bank officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the new section of the bank for the former Soviet republics had been given its choice of employees, and that the best and brightest bank officials were volunteering for the section because they thought they would be visible there.
Mr. Preston initially responded that the bank's senior management had prevented this from happening by screening proposed transfers. But a World Bank official who insisted on anonymity said none of the transfers had been blocked. Later in the interview, Mr. Preston said that "if there's a diversion of resources, it's human rather than financial."
The bank has moved more slowly than the International Monetary Fund to address the republics' economic ills, in part because it had indicated a greater willingness to heed the Bush Administration's initial opposition more than a year ago to a role there for the lending institutions.
The World Bank focuses on specific projects and sections of poor countries' economies, while the International Monetary Fund concentrates on policies like insuring a stable currency.
 
Must Give to Receive
 Mr. Preston said the I.M.F.'s leadership was to some extent inevitable because it determines the formula controlling how large a stake in each institution an applying country may obtain.
The size of the stake depends on a country's economy, with affluent nations allowed to pay for larger stakes and then borrow more money.
Mr. Preston said that he expected the former Soviet republics to buy a total of 5.15 percent of World Bank shares, led by Russia with 2.99 percent. Ukraine will have a stake of seven-tenths to eight-tenths of 1 percent, and Kazakhstan, two-tenths of 1 percent, he added, declining to indicate figures for the remaining republics.
Purchasing the shares requires commitments by the republics to make up to $9.3 billion available to the World Bank if required. But only $560 million in immediate cash is required, and most of that can be paid in rubles, a bank official said.
The World Bank's board of governors will most likely vote to admit all 15 republics at the end of this month, a few days after the I.M.F. takes similar action, Mr. Preston said.
