HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Yeltsin Duels the Old Guard

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
In the wake of his victory at the polls, President Boris Yeltsin seems to be doing a very smart thing. He's giving the surly Parliament, dominated by ex-Communists, a chance to negotiate its own suicide -- before he tries to kill it outright.
"If there is a one-in-a-thousand chance that the present deputies will accept the referendum results and take this path of constitutional reform, [we] are obliged to give them this chance," was how Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai explained step one. Then came the twist into step two: "I'm not saying it will necessarily work." 
 Such a strategy preserves constitutional niceties, which many Russians will appreciate. It also goes down well with Americans, forever finicky about legalities. And it leaves parliamentary hard-liners worrying whether Mr. Yeltsin now actually has the power to override them, if push comes to shove.
Many Yeltsin loyalists and key U.S. Russian experts, however, don't like the two-step strategy. They want him to act right away on the mandate given by a solid majority of voters in Sunday's referendums -- to dump the old Soviet Constitution, hold new elections, get rid of the existing Parliament and go full speed ahead with economic reforms.
While Mr. Yeltsin should resist these all-in-one-step advocates, he ought to keep their arguments very much in mind.
"The votes were somewhere between a reprieve and a mandate," argued Michael Mandelbaum, a Clinton adviser on Russia. "But Yeltsin has to treat it as a mandate and take decisive action now. The situation in Russia will get worse in any event, and if he hoards his power, it will get worse in a destructive way."
The thinking of one Russian expert, Stephen Sestanovich, followed similar lines. "Yeltsin should overcome his democratic nature and capitalize quickly on the vote," said the former adviser to President Reagan. "If not, he'll be back to where he was months ago -- in a dead-end bargaining process with Parliament and steadily losing power."
They're right to warn Mr. Yeltsin about getting trapped in another unseemly slugfest and stalemate with Parliament. They're also right to urge him to move swiftly and not get trapped in an endless bargaining process. But they're wrong to be quite so impatient, and to skip the chance to persuade Parliament to go along with its own demise.
Obviously it would be better for a nation struggling to establish constitutional norms to follow the law. And the law, albeit the old Soviet one, does require parliamentary consent to change the Constitution and hold snap elections.
What's more, it might actually be possible to gather the necessary majority to change the system legally. Parliament contains many former Yeltsinites who favor reforms but felt Mr. Yeltsin was going too fast. These reformers must have been impressed by Sunday's vote and could be brought back into the Yeltsin fold. And he needs them to forge a future ruling majority -- whatever this hard-line Parliament decides to do.
It's also possible that many anti-Yeltsin conservatives will be tempted to cut a deal to keep their seats in the next parliament. A new constitution will have to establish new voting procedures, and Mr. Yeltsin can use that bait to strike a bargain.
Mr. Yeltsin, his old reform allies and some conservatives should also seek common ground on basic policy. Russia requires revolutionary change, but Russian history and culture call for a period of adjustment. These are contradictory notions, but unless Russian leaders manage the contradiction, they will face endless political deadlock -- and perhaps revolutionary violence.
Clinton officials are well aware of the contradictions and pitfalls. And they are wisely keeping their advice to themselves. "Yeltsin understands Russian politics better than we do," one said. "And our main job now is to deliver the billions in aid we promised him."
It's not clear whether promises of Western aid helped Mr. Yeltsin in the referendums. But they didn't hurt.
To actually receive the aid, Mr. Yeltsin would do well to exhaust all reasonable paths to constitutional change. After that, Russians and Americans alike will be ready for him to lower the people's boom on Parliament.

HEADLINE: Why New York's Sanitation Workers Earn More Than Police

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In your editorial "The Police and Election-Year Politics" (April 17), you relied strictly upon figures supplied by New York City that are misleading. The city's comparison of police and sanitation workers' pay cavalierly ignores three weighty components of sanitation worker income: holiday pay, night shift differential and sanitation's double-time rate for overtime. These, coupled with gain-sharing bonuses, enable sanitation workers to earn greater annual income than police officers.
While you consider this methodology "a strange way to calculate wages," economists, arbitrators and even city negotiators normally factor in the calculations used by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to determine total earnings. Moreover, your assertion that police officers "earn $11,000 more than sanitation workers do" is absurd. 
 If you had bothered to check, you would have learned that the city's pension contribution is $10,000 higher for police than for sanitation because of the city's own fiscal irresponsibility. Since the city has failed to pay the full contribution required to keep the Police Retirement System actuarially sound, in recent years the city's rate of contribution has increased dramatically to compensate for unfunded liability.
The sanitation pension fund, on the other hand, has received an adequate share of city contributions. Consequently, by no stretch of the imagination should pension costs be included in the wage comparison.
In terms of what percentage of the respective work forces receive certain benefits, 40 percent of police officers have less than five years' service and do not receive a longevity increment of $2,000. As a result, all sanitation workers -- irrespective of seniority -- earn more than almost half the police officers.
More convincing is that New York City sanitation workers earn 50 percent to 100 percent more than their counterparts throughout the metropolitan region and nation, while New York City police officers earn 20 percent to 50 percent less than their counterparts throughout the metropolitan region and nation. In other words, the city has acknowledged that its sanitation workers are the finest in the nation by granting them appropriate remuneration, but has been less than magnanimous toward its police officers. Perhaps that is why 100,000 candidates filed for the last sanitation workers' exam, whereas only 50,000 (after an extended delay) filed to take the upcoming police test.
As you know, the P.B.A. cannot strike and will not engage in any other action that might jeopardize public safety. Our only legal recourse is to appeal to the public through a media campaign.

HEADLINE: VAT's Offer a Way to Conceal the Tax Burden

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"New Tax on Goods Is Weighed to Pay for Health Care" (news article, April 15) reveals that the White House is considering the imposition of a value-added tax to raise revenue for President Clinton's health-care reform. Having lived under a VAT for several years in England at university, I hope such consideration will prove slight.
Value-added taxes are "popular" in Europe only in the sense that a number of avaricious bureaucracies thereabouts have recognized the political expediency in obscuring the full weight of the tax burden they impose upon their citizens. Whereas an income tax is the traditional benchmark of taxation, it is sometimes difficult to recognize the true cost to the individual reflected in rising consumer prices. 
 To many American taxpayers, Federal taxes will seem unchanged, and the cost of goods higher. Economists may point up the average tax burden at various income levels under the prospective scheme, but the results are likely to be more accessible to their fellow economists than to those most directly concerned. Unlike a rate increase, VAT's provide a useful shield from popular criticism: the ire of the taxpayers being conveniently redirected from its proper target, i.e., a spendthrift or unresponsive Administration, toward blameless shopkeepers or auto manufacturers.
VAT's may be "democratic," that is to say proportional, in terms of consumption, but are intrinsically regressive vis-a-vis income. A VAT can, of course, be constructed to weigh less heavily on those with low incomes, by exempting food, housing and other essentials.
Much ink has been spilled concerning Mr. Clinton's extravagance when it comes to pork-barrel expenditures. These expenditures appear almost trivial compared with those of a health-care plan that your article estimates may run to $100 billion per year. American taxpayers may be amenable to sacrifice; it does not follow that they yearn for the knife. In any case, if the President has faith that they are behind his health-care reform, why not let his constituents see in the clearest way possible precisely what it is that they are being asked to bear?
One is tired of supporting politicians who lack the backbone of an angleworm, and I believe this latest report provides Mr. Clinton an opportunity to demonstrate both his spirit and integrity. The President knows his campaign promises led the public to believe that he intended drastic cuts in Federal spending -- for instance, in the welfare program. I trust he feels strongly enough about his pricey health-care scheme to fund it openly, rather than try to do so in such a way as to conceal its true cost.

HEADLINE: VAT's Offer a Way to Conceal the Tax Burden;
Making It Progressive

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A value-added tax, which President Clinton contemplated recently, is a proper fiscal measure to pay for the health care of the 36 million uninsured Americans, reduce the budget deficit and stimulate saving and investment. Such a consumption tax, which is paid for by the manufacturers at each stage of production, and ultimately passed on to consumers, can partially replace income and other taxes.
A European-style VAT can be progressive, with low rates for widely used basic goods and services, and high rates for luxury and unhealthy goods (tobacco, alcohol, gasoline). In the European Community, it is a requirement for all members to have a progressive VAT (varying from 6 to 16 and 36 percent). To ease the burden on the poor, certain items, such as food, housing and other necessities, can be excluded from VAT, as they are presently excluded from state and local sales taxes. 
 Eventually, the VAT can partially replace personal and corporate income taxes and encourage work incentives. Private saving is currently low (about 2 percent), compared with Europe and Japan. Therefore, consumption, which is the tax base for the VAT, is relatively high and it does not make much difference if income or consumption is taxed. However, a 3 percent VAT can generate more than $60 billion a year in revenue.
Moreover, it discourages excessive consumption and waste, encourages saving and investment financing, and, depending on the elasticity of imports, improves the United States balance of foreign trade. This means that sooner or later the VAT will infiltrate the American tax system.

HEADLINE: U.S. Asked Saudis to Aid Palestinians

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
To lure the Palestinians back to the Middle East peace talks, the Clinton Administration recently asked Saudi Arabia to resume the financial aid that it had cut off during the Persian Gulf war, senior Administration officials said today.
One American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United Stateseffort had been a critical element in getting the Palestinians to resume the talks. 
 But Administration officials and Palestinian leaders say that although the Saudis agreed to the American request, they continue to balk at restarting contributions to the Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories.
Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations, confirmed today that the United States had promised to help get the funds flowing again, but that the pledge has yet to bear fruit. Ms. Ashrawi hinted that continued Palestinian participation could hinge on whether the payments are delivered.
"It's at a very critical stage right now," Ms. Ashrawi said, referring to the aid pledge. "If it's not kept now, things could fall apart still."
 
U.S. Did Not Solicit Funds
 White House officials stressed that the Administration did not agree to solicit funds for the P.L.O., an effort that would likely be unacceptable to both the Israelis and the Saudis. Instead the Saudi aid was to be given directly to Palestinian charities and other organizations.
After Yasir Arafat's decision to support President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, the Saudis and other gulf states cut off subsidies that amounted to about $6 million a month.
"The Saudis are adamant about not restoring funds to the P.L.O.," an Administration official said.
Economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have seriously deteriorated since the gulf war. In addition to direct subsidies, the Saudis and a number of Arab governments, including the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Egypt have refused to pay taxes collected on Palestinian workers living in their borders to the P.L.O.
 
P.L.O. Spending Sharply Cut
 While some private donations from Palestinians living abroad continue to be sent to the occupied territories, and the Saudi Government still funds some small charities in the West Bank and Gaza, the halt in the subsidies to the P.L.O. has sharply reduced the amount of money the organization has been able to funnel into the West Bank and Gaza. Some reports have said that P.L.O. spending in the territories has dropped to $45 million annually from $120 million before the gulf war.
The economic woes of the West Bank and Gaza have been exacerbated by Israel's decision on March 30 to seal off the territories after a spate of attacks in which several Israelis were killed. That decision has prevented more than 100,000 Palestinians from traveling to jobs in Israel.
"The Palestinians asked us to see if we could sensitize the Saudis to this," a State Department official said. "We did pass on the message that there is a need to get funds flowing to the occupied territories, and I stress not to the P.L.O."
Officials said the promise to approach the Saudis was made during a recent meeting between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Faisal al-Husseini, a Palestinian from East Jerusalem who was recently added to the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. They said Israel had been told of the offer and raised no objections.
 
U.S. Set Up Meeting
 According to Administration officials, the United States set up a meeting between Mr. Huseini and Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi Foreign Minister, in Cairo during the weekend of April 17, at which a promise of Saudi funds was made. But, so far, the Saudis have not followed through on their assurances.
"There is still ill feeling on part of the gulf states because of the P.L.O. position" during the war, a State Department official said. "Those funds, either the taxes or the direct funds flowing to the Palestinians have not been forthcoming."
A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy declined to comment on the report.
As the latest round of the peace talks entered their second day, Israel agreed to permit 30 Palestinians who were deported between 1967 and 1987 to return home. In a statement, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel said a review of the cases of the 30 exiled Palestinians determined that "they were neither involved in terrorist attacks in the past nor were they active in hostile terrorist activity during the course of their deportation."
The 30 were drawn from a list of 55 Palestinian nationalists who were expelled from the West Bank and Gaza that was submitted to the Israeli Government by Palestinian negotiators.
American officials said that there will be a continuing review of other deportees and that other names will be considered. They also said they hoped the return of the 30 Palestinians, who could come home within a week, would help defuse the issue of the 396 Palestinian who were expelled in December and are still in southern Lebanon.
At a news conference where she read the list of the 30 names, Ms. Ashrawi said, "We feel we have begun unraveling the whole policy of deportation."

HEADLINE: Real Estate Funds Lure Investors

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
As banks, developers and others flee in terror from their troubled property investments, some people are snapping up these assets, eager to cash in on a potential recovery in real estate at a time when low interest rates make other investments less appealing.
Rather than buying properties directly, many people are investing in a real estate investment trust, a kind of mutual fund that buys real estate and passes any profits on to its investors. These trusts, known as REIT's, are risky, and investors in them suffered spectacular losses in the mid-1970's and late 1980's.
 
Surge in Investment
 Today, the trusts account for just a fraction of the real estate market, but they are experiencing explosive growth. So far this year, REIT's have grown an extraordinary 25 percent, versus 21 percent for all of 1992. The market capitalization of the 140 or so publicly traded REIT's soared to $19.7 billion at the end of March, from $15.7 billion at the end of 1992. 
 The influx of money is welcomed in real estate circles, where an overabundance of properties -- including many vacant or partly filled buildings -- is still depressing prices. "REIT's are one of few ways in which significant amounts of reasonably priced capital is made available to the real estate markets," said John Pattillo, analyst in the Penobscot Group, an independent analyst group based in Boston. "And real estate does provide disproportionately higher yields as compared to other asset classes right now."
But for investors, there are more than a few risks in these vehicles, in which a group of buildings or mortgages is combined into a trust that offers shares to institutions or individuals. The process creates an entity that resembles a corporation, whose stock can be readily bought and sold.
 
Smashing Quarter
 Right now, the rewards appear great. Publicly traded REIT's produced an average return of 19.11 percent in the first quarter, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, compared with a 3.66 percent return on the Standard & Poor's 500 index of stocks. As with any investment, however, returns vary widely by company.
The current wave of REIT's started in late 1991, with an offering from a Long Island shopping center company. The Kimco Realty Corporation, based in Roslyn, wanted capital for expansion, and set up a REIT based on the bulk of its portfolio. It raised $135 million. Kimco's shares have risen from $20 then to $33.75 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Since Kimco's offering, $7.5 billion in initial and secondary offerings has flowed into the REIT market, $5.3 billion of that in the last six months, according to the trade association.
 
Underlying Assets
 The REIT's come in many varieties. Equity trusts, which account for about 44 percent of the industry, own real estate only, and receive revenue mainly from rents. Mortgage trusts, which derive income from interest earned on property loans, are 47 percent of the industry. The rest are hybrids.
The nation's biggest REIT, New Plan Realty Trust, has $1.2 billion in market capitalization and owns shopping centers and apartment complexes; it dates to 1972. The REIT with the best performance in the first quarter, according to Bloomberg Business News, was Koger Equity Inc., which had a 78.4 percent return. The REIT, which was begun in 1988 in Jacksonville, Fla., is about to double its portfolio of office property to 8.5 million square feet by acquiring Koger Properties Inc., a developer spun off by Koger Equity four years ago that has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1991.
The poorest performer in the quarter, Bloomberg said, was Angeles Mortgage Investment Trust, whose shares -- minus dividends -- fell by 76.3 percent after it said that 40 percent of its $87.5 million loan portfolio would not be repaid.
Under the 1960 law that established REIT's, the trusts are not taxed as corporate entities, but are required to pass on 95 percent of their earnings to shareholders as dividends and to have at least 75 percent of their total assets in real estate.
The changes in tax law in 1986 reduced the incentives for holding real estate privately, thus helping the publicly held REIT industry. But the 1986 law was, at the least, a signal of the real estate crash, and some would say a contributing factor. The resulting depression in property prices hurt REIT's, along with the rest of the real estate sector.
While the latest boom in REIT's started with individual investors, institutional investors like pension funds have followed suit. Some of the big investors were burned on previous real estate investments, and remained concerned about having huge assets like buildings and mortgages that are hard to sell. The trusts allow institutions to put their money into real estate and back out when they wish, a distinct advantage over direct property acquisitions or investments in pools of properties assembled by an insurance company.
"The market is now willing to value REIT's, and therefore, their underlying real estate, at values that approximate or exceed private market values," said Ned Davis, senior vice president at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company. "So the REIT has created for the institution looking to own real estate a liquid trading mark-to-market asset, as opposed to an illiquid asset that cannot be readily disposed of."
The boom is also being driven by an unusual combination of circumstances.
"Right now, there's an unprecedented window of opportunity," said Sam Hillers, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Company. "Because interest rates are low, these companies can go into the capital markets and raise money at very low rates relative to the yield they get on new investments. Because of the depression in commercial real estate, you're able to buy pretty good properties at yields of anywhere from 8 1/2 to around 10. If you can go out and raise money at 5 or 6 percent, and with that buy investments that yield nine and a half percent, you're not even in the real estate business -- you're in the investment banking business. You're making money on that spread."
 
Is the Bloom Off?
 The billion-dollar question is, will returns continue to rise? In all likelihood, that question was asked in the early 1970's and in the 1980's, before the last two big REIT crashes. The answer depends on a host of factors, including the quality of assets and management, the recovery of the economy and the overbuilt real estate market, and the direction of interest rates and rents.
Although many of the recent returns have been startlingly high, analysts say they may not last. Some analysts predict that the quality of assets in newly formed REITs will deteriorate over time, or that rising interest rates will slam returns, bringing a crash and disappointing many investors.
Besides, not every REIT is a star. Returns are affected by the fund's management, the type of real estate in the fund and the level of risk. Occupancy rates are generally higher, for example, in residential properties than in commercial real estate.
"I think it's inevitable that you are going to get some schlocky operators with second-rate properties that can talk a second-rate investment banker into doing deals for them," Mr. Kirby said. "But on average, I think that now we have better companies than what we've had in this sector before."
Early investors in REIT's enjoyed good profits. But the dangers were clearly demonstrated in the 1970's, when the real estate markets collapsed. REIT shares started to plunge in January 1973, and by the end of 1974, they had lost more than 80 percent of their value. Another crash in the late 80's did less damage, but served to remind investors of the pitfalls.
One indication of the strength of a REIT is the name of the investment bank attached to it. Merrill Lynch dominates the market, followed by Goldman Sachs; Morgan Stanley; Kidder, Peabody; Alex. Brown, and Dean Witter, and they can afford to be selective.
"If you see some smaller firm that has never done a REIT deal before, you have to ask, 'I wonder why the big boys didn't get this one?' " Mr. Kirby said.
 
The Rate Factor
 Another item to ponder is the direction of interest rates. Low interest rates are good for REIT's, which tend to have considerable short-term debt, meaning that their interest costs vary sharply with changes in rates. Also, the direction of interest rates affects the relative attractiveness of bonds, which is part of the REIT success equation.
In any case, REIT supporters, including Richard B. Saltzman, a managing director of Merrill Lynch, say REIT investment will continue to increase, representing a permanent shift away from real estate ownership and toward securitization.

HEADLINE: Ex-Amex Head Gets S.E.C. Job

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
After long deliberations, the Clinton Administration today nominated Arthur Levitt Jr., a publisher and former head of the American Stock Exchange, as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The selection of Mr. Levitt had been expected for weeks, but was held up by a number of factors: the required review of his finances; a politically sensitive decision to pass over an aide to Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and a backlog in reviewing candidates for a long list of other Administration financial positions that remain unfilled. 
 The Administration has been trying to appoint members of minority groups and women to more key financial posts, and for some time the front-runner to replace Richard C. Breeden as S.E.C. chairman was considered to be Consuela Washington, a black woman who works for Mr. Dingell on a House committee that oversees the agency's work.
 
Raised Funds for Clinton
 But Mr. Levitt, 62, had worked with the powers of Wall Street for many years and had substantial backing. He also helped raise millions of dollars for the Clinton campaign.
Among the publications owned by the Levitt Media Company of New York is Roll Call, a newspaper covering Capitol Hill. It was not clear what steps Mr. Levitt might have to take to sequester himself from the company, which is not publicly traded, during his S.E.C. tenure.
Mr. Levitt is the son of Arthur Levitt, who served as New York State Comptroller for 24 years from the 1950's through the 1970's.
For months, commissioners and staff members of the S.E.C. had been awaiting word of a new chairman. Mr. Breeden, a Republican who was appointed S.E.C. chairman by President George Bush in 1989, had extended his planned departure from the independent regulatory agency, where he had closely allied himself with the Bush Administration.
 
An Interest in Entrepreneurship
 Mr. Levitt's nomination goes to the Senate for confirmation. Although it was difficult to say what effect Mr. Levitt's selection would have on the agency that regulates trading in stocks and bonds, some areas of his background might provide clues.
For example, he has had a longtime interest in growing, entrepreneurial companies like those whose shares are commonly traded on the Amex.
He has been the head of New York City's Economic Development Corporation, and last summer, in an article with Roger C. Altman on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, called for the city to work more closely with the private sector to create jobs. Mr. Altman, who at the time was an investment banker and head of the Mayor's Management Advisory Task Force, is now Deputy Treasury Secretary in the Clinton Administration.
 
New Long-Term Issues
 This year, the S.E.C. is to present a study that it has touted as a road map for the industry in the 21st century. Perhaps the biggest long-term question facing the agency is how the securities markets will evolve at a time of new ways of trading and new financial instruments.
Among the issues are the role of trading outside the established exchanges, which is becoming easier with high-capacity computing and telecommunications, and the increasing variety of complex financial instruments, known as derivatives, whose trading volume is growing rapidly. In a speech earlier this month to securities executives in New York, Mr. Levitt listed both of these issues among his concerns.
His record suggests that he would not be averse to regulating the industry; as Amex chairman he approved of heavy spending on surveillance and regulation of market participants.
While the Amex held strong positions on contested issues before the S.E.C., some who know Mr. Levitt said today that they considered it unlikely that his previous role would color his decisions in his new job.
Mary Shapiro, an S.E.C. commissioner, said that Mr. Levitt's background at the Amex would not necessarily dictate his point of view. She said new commissioners typically adopt a broad perspective on the regulation of the sometimes fractious securities markets. "It is all the exchanges, and the corporate issuers, and the brokers, and the public -- first and last, the investors," she said.
Ken Liebler, who for four years in the 1980's was president of the Amex while Mr. Levitt was its chairman, called him "a master of consensus."
 
Political Resentments
 As chairman, Mr. Levitt may be called on to heal of some of the rifts that developed at the S.E.C. in recent years.
Mr. Breeden's strong hand on the reins of the agency -- where the chairman can set the agenda but must win votes from a majority of the five commissioners who come from both major political parties -- seemed to breed resentment among some political appointees and career employees.
One Republican commissioner, Edward Fleischman, quit a year ago in a public break with the chairman. Mr. Fleischman had disagreed with Mr. Breeden on issues ranging from corporate disclosure to regulation of banks, often asserting that the agency had taken on too much power.
While pushing the agency's agenda, Mr. Breeden was often at odds with the Treasury Department over banking and securities regulations, taking the view of the securities dealers over those of the banks where they competed.
In the months leading to last year's election, he was criticized by some for aligning the independent agency with the interests of the Bush Administration.

HEADLINE: PACE OF ECONOMY SLOWED MARKEDLY IN FIRST QUARTER

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The economy grew at an unexpectedly slow annual pace of 1.8 percent during the first three months of the year as consumers retrenched from last year's unusual holiday spending binge and the military sector posted its biggest drop in 20 years, Commerce Department figures showed today.
Economists in and out of the Government said the figures suggested that growth would continue, but too slowly to have much effect on unemployment. 
 But they said the slower growth, down from a 4.7 percent rate of expansion during the final 1992 quarter, was more severe than expected. They predicted that many analysts would trim forecasts for the spring and summer, particularly in light of swelling inventories.
 
Ammunition Against G.O.P.
 The Clinton Administration, which has been citing each batch of poor or lackluster economic news as evidence of the need for its program of Government stimulus, continued in this vein today even as it acknowledged that special factors, including the March blizzard in the East, aggravated the slowdown. The slower growth gives the President powerful new ammunition to attack Republicans for scuttling his stimulus program. [News analysis, page D6.]
"It proves we were right," the President said, referring to ax@ for summer jobs and other spending measures that have been blocked by Senate Republicans.
The relatively weak 1.8 percent rate of increase in G.D.P. -- the total value of goods and services produced within the nation's borders -- was not only below the 2.5 percent or so expected by most analysts but was somewhat unsettling to economists in its composition.
"I thought this was a real disappointment -- real final sales in the private sector actually fell," said Donald H. Straszheim, a top economist at Merrill Lynch. "It looks to me that this is weaker than weather alone would have explained."
 
No Basic Change Seen
 But two longtime Washington economists, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, agreed that today's reports did not fundamentally alter the economic landscape.
Herbert Stein, chief economic adviser to President Nixon and now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called last winter's growth "surprisingly low," but added, "It doesn't affect my basic outlook that we'll have a moderate recovery."
Charles L. Schultze, President Carter's top economic adviser, now at the Brookings Institution, said that the figures, properly interpreted, were "consistent with nonbooming, moderate" expansion.
In a briefing, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said she found what she called "some signs of genuine weakness" in the recovery but it was "a little too early to judge" how serious these were compared with the weather and other presumably transitory factors.
Separate reports today showed a surprisingly robust gain of 4.8 percent in sales of new homes in March and a modest decline last week in first-time claims for unemployment insurance.
And inflation, as expressed by a fixed-weight price index for gross domestic purchases, climbed a half percentage point, to 3.4 percent , mainly reflecting a pay increase for Federal workers.
 
Eighth Straight Advance
 The rise in G.D.P. was the eighth straight quarterly advance since the official end of the latest recession in March 1991 but was markedly weaker than the two previous quarters.
As expected, consumers retrenched after letting holiday spending outstrip incomes; spending on personal consumption -- about two-thirds of economic activity -- edged up only 1.2 percent after jumping 5.1 percent in the October-December period.
Indeed, it took a stunning $26 billion jump in inventories -- one almost certainly exceeding the need to replenish shelves depleted by holiday shoppers -- to prevent G.D.P. from contracting, the National Association of Manufacturers figured.
Rising inventories have the effect of enlarging G.D.P. somewhat artificially since goods are counted as output even if they remain unsold. Excessive inventories must then be worked off before companies place new orders.
Analysts were somewhat baffled by the huge drop in military goods -- excluding it would have resulted in a 3.5 percent rate of G.D.P. -- but nobody expected declines of such magnitude to be repeated. One possible reason was higher election-year spending on military procurement followed by a government transition in which many top procurement jobs remained vacant.
At the same time, however, the shrinking of the military establishment is thought likely to continue for years.
 
Drop in Trade
 Another source of drag in the first quarter was a sizable deterioration in international trade. Exports were especially weak, falling at a rate of $10.7 billion, after rising $12.4 billion in the October-December period. This is attributed largely to weakness in the economies of many of the nation's trading partners, a situation not yet clearly improving.
The main source of comfort in today's report, analysts said, was another solid increase in corporate investment in new equipment. This rose at a rate of $8.1 billion, or 8.6 percent, perhaps killing any prospect of reviving the Administration's proposal for a new investment tax credit.
Today's report also showed that consumers rebuilt their savings during the quarter, raising it to 4.8 percent of disposable personal income from 4.4 percent.
The slowdown in first-quarter growth was markedly less severe when expressed in current dollars than when adjusted for inflation and expressed in constant 1987 dollars. Current-dollar, or nominal, G.D.P. rose at a rate of $77 billion, or 5.2 percent, compared with a fourth-quarter spurt of $103.3 billion, or 7.1 percent.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the first quarter of 1993 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: U.S. Would End Cutting of Trees In Many Forests

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RESERVE, N.M., April 29

 BODY:
Under orders from the White House to try again to put Federal timber sales on a sounder economic footing, the United States Forest Service has proposed changes that would end logging in more than a third of the national forests by 1998.
Environmental groups and other opponents of the timber sales have long argued that the Government charges too little and provides too many services to companies that log national forests, at a cost to taxpayers at hundreds of millions of dollars a year. 
 Top Clinton Administration officials have said they want to raise fees or halt logging, but they backed off earlier plans to push such proposals in the face of Congressional opposition.
 
Would Affect 62 Forests
 Now F. Dale Robertson, the chief of the Forest Service, has developed a plan, which he sent this week to Federal forest managers and some timber industry executives, to end low-price logging on 62 of the 156 national forests.
If the White House approves the proposal, which could be put into effect without Congressional approval, it would mean a huge political victory for the national environmental movement.
The national forests provided 7.3 billion board feet of timber last year, or roughly 12 percent of the 58 billion board feet used in the United States. If the plan is put into effect, timber harvest on Federal forests would drop to 4 billion to 4.5 billion board feet by the end of the decade. That would be less than 5 percent of timber production if the amounts of lumber and paper used by Americans increase as expected.
While a reduced timber supply could affect wood prices nationally, the policy means profound changes here in Reserve, near the Gila National Forest, and in dozens of other communities where logging jobs would be lost.
The proposal affects more than 60 million acres of forest land in 23 states and would be one of the most significant change in how the public forests are managed in the 88-year history of the Forest Service. Agency officials said that those forests were chosen as the clearest examples of areas where current logging practices cost the Government millions of dollars.
 
A Region Heard From
 In February, President Clinton announced a program to end the long tradition of encouraging logging, mining and ranching on public lands through tax breaks, subsidies and other economic incentives. Mr. Clinton tried to increase the costs to logging companies of harvesting timber in national forests as part of his budget proposal, but after objections by Western Democratic senators the President dropped it from the budget earlier this month.
At the time, though, White House aides said the President was not giving up and would seek to put his stamp on the public lands through legislation and administrative actions. The proposal from the Forest Service, a division of the Department of Agriculture, is the first attempt yet made public by one of the Government's natural resource agencies to comply with the President's directive.
"The President's direction to us is to eliminate below-cost timber sales and to phase it out over four years," George Leonard, the associate chief of the Forest Service, said today. "He knows the effect this will have on the ground. The President sat out there in the Northwest for six or eight hours a few weeks ago, and half of that was devoted to impacts of lack of timber on communities and people."
 
Environmentalists Encouraged
 Mr. Leonard said that the final decision has not been made on which forests will end logging and that the White House had not yet reviewed the list sent to forest managers.
The national forest system was established in 1905 by drawing new boundaries around the great stands of timber left on lands largely owned and managed by the Department of the Interior. For most of its history, national forests were almost entirely devoted to making grazing, mineral and timber resources available to industry. The Government made money by opening large tracts and offering them to the highest bidder.
But in the 1970's, according to Forest Service staff members here, the cost of preparing the tracts of timber for bid and sale began to climb as environmental groups and Congress asked more from public-land managers.
Rangers in the Gila say it now typically costs $100 per thousand board feet to prepare all the scientific, environmental, and engineering documents for a timber sale. The Government typically receives $70 to $90 a thousand board feet in a timber sale.
Prices cannot be raised easily because the process of establishing appraisals on timber and setting bid prices is rigidly controlled.
 
Encouraging Great Harm
 Groups like the National Audubon Society, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society and the National Wildlife Federation have argued for more than a decade that trees from Federal forests are being sold to timber companies at below their market value. They say the subsidies encourage logging practices that cause unsightly clear-cutting and great harm to wildlife, streams and mountain slopes.
Staff members of these groups today supported the Forest Service's efforts. "The Federal timber program does not contribute to community stability no matter how you define it," said Jeffrey Olson, an economist with the Wilderness Society in Washington.
But critics of the proposal said Mr. Olson and other environmentalists are taking a narrow view that fails to recognize the consequences for millions of Americans.
"They think in Washington that what they are doing is good for everybody," said Danny Friar, the Catron County manager who lost his timber job here a year ago. "They don't know that what they do there has consequences here. People's lives are at stake."
In urban areas, several economists said today, lowering the supply of timber from national forests could increase prices for lumber, paper and other products. Last month, partly as a result of dwindling supplies from the Pacific Northwest, where timber production has been cut by efforts to protect the northern spotted owl, lumber prices reached nearly $500 per thousand board feet, a record.
And leaders of rural communities, which are dependent on timber from Federal forests, said the elimination of subsidized sales would be devastating. "The fact is that we just got back to work yesterday; this is just another thing hurting us," Jerry O'Neal, a logger from Reserve who was hauling timber to another mill, said today. "I've been doing this for 30 years and I've never seen nothing like it."
 
Effects Already Obvious
 A good example of the sort of changes hundreds of communities, particularly those in the West, might expect is occurring in this town 200 miles southwest of Albuquerque that is surrounded by the Gila National Forest, one of the 14 forests the Government has designated for ending subsidized sales starting in October.
Only four years ago, logging in the Gila forest supported a timber economy that included a mill with 90 workers, more than 140 loggers and truckers. But environmental concerns, among them the protection of the Mexican spotted owl, a threatened cousin of the Northwest's northern spotted owl, have caused the Government to cut the amount of timber sold on the forest by more than 60 percent since 1989.
In March, the timber mill here closed, throwing 40 people out of work. At least 50 other jobs were lost in the businesses that serviced the mill and the trucks that brought the logs to it. Five businesses on Main Street shut permanently. If timber subsidies are ended in October, what little is left of the industry will disappear, said city leaders.

HEADLINE: Bosnia Rivals Set New Talks As U.S. Weighs Action Plans

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The United Nations announced today that the three warring factions in Bosnia and Herzegovina will resume talks this weekend on ending the conflict, and President Clinton summoned the United States' top military commanders to the White House for a final review of options on ending Serbian aggression.
The talks, which are to begin in Athens on Saturday, would give Bosnia's Serbian nationalists a chance to make peace before the United States and its allies decide on a tougher course of action. 
 Mr. Clinton, who met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, is scheduled to make his final decision on a more aggressive policy after meeting with his top national security advisers on Saturday, senior White House officials said. He then plans to dispatch Mr. Christopher to European capitals to brief the allies and try to win support for the American position.
 
U.S. Plans Unchanged
 Mr. Christopher excused himself from the White House meeting to tell reporters that the President was unswayed by the announcement of the resumption of talks on a peace plan drawn up by the international mediators Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen. "It does not change our plans at all," Mr. Christopher said. "What we need from the Serbs, both the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs from Serbia, is deeds, not words, so we'll be proceeding with our plans." He added that it was "important that the United States fix its decision and then talk to our allies about it."
When asked when Mr. Clinton will make his decision, Mr. Christopher said, "He said the decision would be by the end of the week, and I think Saturday is the end of the week."
After the meeting, President Clinton said, "Let's see what happens. Let's see how serious they are."
Referring to the Serbs, he said: "They've said things before and not meant it. If they mean it now, so much the better."
 
Move by Bosnian Serbs
 The peace talks in Athens were made possible by a decision today by the Bosnian Serbs to reconsider the peace plan in their parliament next Wednesday, said Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for the international mediation team headed by Mr. Vance and Lord Owen. Last Monday, the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament rejected the plan, which has already been signed by the other two warring parties, the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats.
Mr. Eckhard said that the Serbian, Croatian and Muslim leaders of Bosnia, as well as the presidents of Croatia and Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia's component republics, Serbia and Montenegro, will be represented at the talks. The discussions "will give all parties a chance to discuss how the plan meets the various security concerns of all parties, especially the Bosnian Serbs."
The decision of the Bosnian Serbs to return to the negotiating table could mean that they have changed their position on the plan, which calls for 10 semi-autonomous provinces divided largely along ethnic lines. On the other hand, it may just represent a last-ditch effort to forestall foreign military intervention while the Serbs consolidate their territorial gains.
 
Pressure From Milosevic
 The move comes amid increasing pressure from the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, who has apparently threatened to cut off economic and possibly other kinds of assistance to his clients, the Bosnian Serbs. Mr. Milosevic, in turn, has come under pressure from Russia, a traditional Serbian ally, which has insisted that the Serbs work to end the fighting in the Balkans.
The fact that Mr. Milosevic has suddenly emerged as a backer of the Vance-Owen plan has surprised many Serbs. He is widely perceived as the man principally responsible for fomenting the Bosnian war, but he now appears convinced that the time has come for his Bosnian clients to change their strategy and accept the peace plan.
Diplomats and politicians in Belgrade today debated Mr. Milosevic's sincerity. His emergence as an advocate of peace contrasts sharply with his past role.
 
'Breakthrough' or 'Fake'
 "Is it a breakthrough for Lord Owen and the world, or is it empty theater?" a European diplomat asked. "I can't believe that it's all fake. I think Lord Owen has made Milosevic understand how serious the situation has become. The question is whether the Bosnian Serbs will go along. Some of them are fatalists who believe the historical hour has come for them to triumph or be wiped out, and they are not in a mood for compromise."
The announcement of the meeting came on a day of hectic diplomatic activity, last-minute attempts to stall military intervention by the United States and its allies, and consultations among the Western capitals on what to do next in the Balkans.
In an apparent effort to delay stronger Western action, Moscow sent messages to Washington and major European capitals proposing an international conference on the Balkans in Geneva next week. Despite a strong desire to get the Russians to go along with any allied action, both Washington and London responded unenthusiastically to the idea, American and British officials said.
 
Parley Called 'Ppremature'
 "At this point, we think that convening another international conference would be premature," said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman. He added, "We believe that our own review, our own decision, should be made" and that "we should have a chance to get together and talk to them about the further steps before we decide to call another meeting."
In the last two days, Mr. Christopher has conducted a busy round of consultations, both by telephone with various foreign ministers and on Capitol Hill. He has called the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Canada, Germany and Russia to discuss American options, which include the arming the Bosnian Muslims and the possible use of air strikes to freeze Serbian gains.
Although France and Britain have softened their resistance to air strikes, there remains considerable opposition to the idea of lifting the embargo for the Bosnian Muslims, for fear that such an action would intensify the conflict.
For example, Barbara McDougall, Canada's Foreign Minister, told Mr. Christopher in a telephone conversation on Wednesday that while Canada is prepared to take stronger action to bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table, it remains opposed to lifting the arms embargo, Canadian officials said.
 
France Favors Embargo
 The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, also told Mr. Christopher in a phone conversation on Wednesday that the French Government remained opposed to lifting the arms embargo.
Although senior officials in the British Government have also opposed arming the Bosnian Government, a British official said that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told Mr. Christopher that his country would go along with Mr. Clinton's final decision. Indeed, in the first public indication that Britain may be more flexible, Mr. Hurd told the House of Commons: "We have to stick together as we consider these options. We're not going to allow the Atlantic alliance to fracture on this issue."
Mr. Christopher and President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, have argued in White House meetings that arming and training the Bosnian Muslims may take some time, and that air strikes may be necessary to hold off the Serbs in the interim, according to senior Administration officials familiar with their thinking. The argument continues that if air strikes succeed in halting Serbian activity on the ground and promoting a diplomatic settlement, the arms may never have to be sent, these officials added.
 
War Powers Asserted
 Mr. Christopher, Mr. Lake and Mr. Aspin consulted with House Democratic leaders today on how to win Congressional support for whatever Mr. Clinton decides. Ninety-one members of the House, citing Congress's power to declare war, later released a letter urging Mr. Clinton to seek Congressional authorization under the Constitution before ordering any offensive action.
Mr. Christopher also invited lawmakers to lunch today to solicit their views. One of them, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said that he still did not get the impression from Mr. Christopher that the Administration had decided on its policy.
"Nobody can figure out what is the endgame, what is the goal," the Senator said. "The Secretary certainly wasn't answering that question. About all I could tell him was that there might be a narrow consensus for some course of action, but the President will have to stick his neck out and explain it to the American people."
 
Balkan Update
 In SARAJEVO, a United Nations spokesman said yesterday that monitors had reported intense fighting between Muslims and Croats near BUSOVACA.
In WASHINGTON, President Clinton met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and Secretary of State Warren Christopher for a review of options on ending Serbian aggression in BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA. Mr. Clinton is to make his final decision on a tougher policy after meeting with his top national security advisers on Saturday.
And in NEW YORK, the United Nations announced that the three warring factions in Bosnia would resume peace talks this weekend in Athens. The talks were made possible after the Bosnian Serbs decided to reconsider the Vance-Owen peace plan next Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Clinton's 100th: A Good Day for Picture-Taking

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
It is true that President Clinton has lately been preoccupied with fighting budget wars, plotting military interventions and defending himself against a spate of criticism on the first months of his Presidency.
But on his 100th day in office, the President's schedule was sublimely typical of the peculiar way a President spends his days: a little politics, a little posturing, a bit of consulting and a lot of high-profile handshaking. 
 Thursdays are usually grip-and-grin day at the White House, when the President invites teachers and students and basketball teams -- and occasionally foreign royalty -- to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The resulting photographs adorn walls around the world.
For Bill Clinton, who appears to like handshaking better than almost anything, today was a ripe opportunity. King Juan Carlos of Spain and his Queen, Sofia, dropped by. And eight Lubavitcher rabbis from around the country ambled into the White House and presented Mr. Clinton with a yarmulke inscribed with "President Clinton" in English and Hebrew along with a gift from the 91-year-old Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson: the dollar bill he customarily dispenses as a symbol of charity.
As Mr. Clinton, perhaps reluctant to leave the sunny world of picture taking, modeled the skullcap, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary Les Aspin and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had come to talk about Bosnia, cooled their heels in the hallway nearby.
They merely wanted to talk about Bosnia.
 
Spin on the News
 Mr. Clinton, who passed up his normal early morning jog, did not miss the opportunity to make his pitch for his economic plan. In an unusual demonstration of bad news giving way to positive spin, he and his chief spokesmen all rushed to draw attention to the signs of slowdown in the economy.
"It proves that we were right in both reducing the deficit and in trying to create some jobs right now in this economy," he said.
Hoping for another positive headline, Mr. Clinton also used his appearance at the Justice Department to tout the pace of his appointments, which he said has been unfairly demeaned.
The 100-day yardstick seemed to weigh heavily on the Presidential mind. First he declared that it is not a rational category for judging his Administration. Then he hastened to offer proof that he was well ahead of previous Republican Presidents in seeking Senate confirmation.
 
Scorecard on Appointments
 "This may surprise you, if you've been reading the press reports, but with these appointments our Administration has in 100 days nominated 172 people for consideration by the Senate," he said. "At the same point in their Administrations, President Reagan had named 152 people and President Bush had named 99. By any measure we're doing a fairly good job in staffing up the Administration with high-quality folks."
Later in the day, Mr. Clinton returned to the topic of the mixed reception his ambitious agenda has received in Washington. "It may be that we can only do one thing at a time in this town," Mr. Clinton said later to members of his health-care task force who gathered on the South Lawn of the White House for a reception this afternoon. "That may be. But I'm not prepared to acknowledge that."
At another time, he took advantage of the sunny weather to reach for a few more fingertips after introducing a raft of new Justice Department appointees and listening to his Attorney General Janet Reno praise his commitment to justice.
"Are you kidding?" he said to a reporter who inquired about his spirits. "It's a wonderful day."
 
Display of Vintage Clinton
 This was vintage Clinton. Earlier in the day, he had been reined indoors, anchored to a chair in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, where he had to explain to Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee why they should support the new taxes he has proposed.
The 100-day formulation has been an awkward one for the Clinton White House. The President himself had promised during his campaign that the period would be an explosive one unparalleled in recent history. But spinning the last two weeks into good news has proved difficult.
"I learned that things are not going to change quite as fast as I wanted them to," Mr. Clinton said today.
But he has learned one lesson. When George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, was asked what the President planned for the next 100 days, he first suggested that the President might undertake an all-day reading of his campaign policy treatise, "Putting People First."
Then he laughed, "He's not going to count the days."

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 11.62 Points, To 3,425.12

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market was mostly lower yesterday in dispirited trading, largely in reaction to expected, but nonetheless discouraging, news on the state of the economy. But most major indexes closed up modestly in quiet afternoon trading.
An exception, albeit a modest one, was gold stocks. Gold for June delivery climbed $3, to $357.40 an ounce, another recent record. Newmont Mining was up 3/4, to 47 7/8; American Barrick was up 3/8, to 21 3/4, and Echo Bay Mines was up 1/2, to 7 3/4. Echo Bay was the most active stock on the American Stock Exchange, with 1.36 million shares changing hands. 
 Before the opening bell, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product grew by only a 1.8 percent annual rate for the first quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average promptly plunged as much as 20 points. But in the last 15 minutes of trading, the Dow, aided by computerized buy programs, rose sharply, closing up 11.62 points, to 3,425.12.
The Dow Jones transportation average fell sharply in large part because of poor first-quarter earnings at UAL, parent of United Airlines.
As has been the case for the last few weeks, investors were sorting through earnings news for clues on where to invest, but the trading trends seemed to indicate that the market as a whole was returning to its indecisive ways, with no stock groups to lead a rally.
There were no shocks yesterday to equal Wednesday's news of the abrupt resignation of Christopher J. Steffen, Eastman Kodak's chief financial officer, but General Motors' strong first-quarter profit was an agreeable, if unrewarded, surprise. At 4 million shares, G.M. was the fifth-most-active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, but it closed down 1 3/8, to 41.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed up 0.58 point, to 242.48, and volume on the Big Board was 249.8 million shares, compared with Wednesday's 268 million shares. The Standard & Poor's 500 closed up 0.87 point, to 438.89, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.99 points, to 418.75. The Nasdaq composite index was up 0.29 point, to 658.45.
The Dow was lifted by four stocks closing up 1 1/4 or more: Caterpillar, Philip Morris, General Electric and Allied Signal. Caterpillar closed up 1 3/4, to 68 7/8, on no discernible news. Philip Morris stock, the third most active on the Big Board, rose 1 5/8, to 47 1/4, after an upbeat annual meeting.
General Electric stock rose following Wednesday's signing of a $750 million, four-year contract by its NBC subsidiary with the National Basketball Association that is designed to insure a profit for the television network. G.E. closed up 1 1/4, to 91 5/8. Allied Signal rose 1 1/4, to 63 1/2, on no discernible news.
Tending to drag down the Dow were General Motors, as well as Union Carbide, after some chemical analysts reduced their ratings further from hold to sell.
The Dow Jones transport index was dragged down by UAL, whose price drop of 4 7/8, to 140 5/8, caused all of the decline in the index. The airline reported a wide first-quarter loss, underscoring investor concerns about a fare war in the industry.
The most active issue on the Big Board, with trading volume of 10.3 million shares, was the American depository receipts for stock in Telefonos de Mexico. During the week, Telmex has moved up steadily on the most-active list, as disappointment with the telephone carrier's first-quarter earnings and concern over the United States' passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement have battered it. Telmex closed up 1/2, to 48, after the company announced a stock buyback plan.

HEADLINE: In Shadow Of Derby, Bid to Save The Sport

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 28

 BODY:
Amid the dawn's sweet blend of hot coffee and horses shimmering through their workouts, Gina Smith watched from the back-side rail at Churchill Downs this morning, looking for a glimpse of her own future in thoroughbred racing as much as for a favorite in Saturday's Kentucky Derby.
"Studying the bloodlines, you see so many good horses," mused Ms. Smith, a 22-year-old business major in one of the most unusual university programs in the country, the equine administration curriculum of the University of Louisville. The program seeks to academically breed some fresh management blood and winning ideas into a racing industry deeply troubled by the spread of legalized casino gambling around the nation. 
 All this week, as the moguls and hot walkers of thoroughbred racing savor the morning workouts and congregate in the special congeniality of the back-side barns, students from this specialized business management program have been taking breathers from cramming for final examinations. They briefly duck out on such subjects as equine economics, law and taxation for quick reminders of the splendid horse flesh that they are vowing to market, promote and manage to renewed pre-eminence in a rapidly evolving world of high competition forAmerica's wagering dollar.
 
Young Academic Lineup
 In the bluegrass morning, a sample look at these academic foals being trained for the front-side offices of racing seems at least as promising as any morning line in the industry:
*Bettina Cohen, reared in Elmont, N.Y., in the shadow of Belmont race track, interested in organizing financial and welfare programs for the tracks' underclass of back-side workers as part of a more enlightened executive outlook . . . handicaps races for pleasure . . . some of her reporting on the need for a more nationalized race industry has been published in the authoritative Thoroughbred Times.
*David Ferguson, who surveys breeding-farm ledgers after classes and has been documenting the stud masters' preoccupation with bloodlines and neglect of modern bottom-line accounting and investment methods he wants to pursue . . . says the fun and toughness of the race-track curriculum is exemplified by Kent Hollingsworth, one of the industry's most respected racing writers, editors and lawyers, lately teaching the equine-law intricacies of yearling auction bidding.
*Stephanie Young, 31, a chestnut-haired former jockey . . . a hot apprentice four years ago who was thrown during a race and studies now in a wheelchair . . . moved up from her start as an 11th-grade dropout to currently run a 4.0 average in the business school . . . needs help in mounting a horse but still manages to ride for fun with her powerful jockey's arms . . . "I was good you know," she said. "As good as I was riding, I'm going to be that good on the front side." . . . working on a research paper about the threat to racing from Indian and riverboat casinos.
*John Cook, a promising 24-year-old raised by horse owners . . . already has done three years' stock brokering on his own . . . did teen-age summers of hot walking and grooming horses after their workouts, plus undergraduate forays of purely investigative casino gambling . . . aims to pioneer in "simulcasting" management -- a save-the-race-tracks strategy for high-grade, live televising of races to networks of national tracks bolstered with their own casino games and fresh marketing initiatives . . . "The industry as a whole needs to come together. It lacks enough people willing to change." . . . recreation includes systemized speed-number handicapping, a not-so-rarefied pleasure, he insists, that tracks must promote for the more sophisticated bettor while also exploiting lottery gamblers through new random-number horse bets.
 
9 Specialists on Staff
 These students and 65 more in the business school's equine administration department are prodded and coaxed through the academic turns of the five-year-old program by a faculty and staff of nine specialists led by the department chairman, Dr. Robert G. Lawrence, a horseman, agrarian economist and gambling-industry expert.
At pre-Derby morning workouts, the professor studies and presses the human flesh in one of the surpassing social rites of the thoroughbred season. The back-side morning chatter about horses is heightened by the occasional muted gallop of a Derby contender being tuned up in short bursts, its yellow saddle blanket a princely signal of its stature. After each test clocking, trainers hold forth like political spin doctors over at the barn doors as the steaming thoroughbreds are calmed and cooled by their retinues.
"Our students aren't exactly nose-kissers," Dr. Lawrence said, enjoying the horses but emphasizing that mere romance with the beauty of thoroughbreds is hardly enough to get a student through a curriculum that requires double courses in economics and accounting plus statistics and calculus studies as prerequisites.
"This is a pivotal moment for racing," he said, citing the fall in horse-auction prices and breeding activity in the current economy and the boom in legalized gambling on Indian reservations and riverboats pressing ever more deeply into the race tracks' betting action. The thoroughbred industry must rebound with a more unified strategy and fresh executive talent to adjust to the loss of its near-monopoly over the public's betting habits, he said.
Professor Hollingsworth added, "What will bring back this industry, any industry, is youthful vigor and a tad of academic reinforcement."
And a little nose-kissing can't hurt, according to Heather Wilson, riven this week between her customer relations internship at the track's front side and her handicapping trips over to the back-side barns where the horses gleam with the promise of champions.
"The horses are beautiful; they're dangerous," Ms. Wilson said, happily anticipating a career at the races. "You just can't get away from them."

With him at Churchill Downs was Gina Smith, a student. (Ben Van Hook for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Rose 4.8% in March

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Sales of new homes posted a surprising rise in March, advancing for a second straight month despite bad weather in much of the country, the Commerce Department said today.
Sales were up 4.8 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 637,000 units, after a revised 1.8 percent rise in February. Previously, the department said sales in February were up 4.6 percent, to a rate of 595,000. 
 The department also revised January sales to show a smaller decline of 9.8 percent, to a rate of 597,000, instead of the 12.7 percent plunge it previously reported.
The March gain was unexpected. Wall Street economists had forecast a decline to a sales rate of 570,000 units instead of a gain. The big snowstorm along the East Coast was expected to put a damper on March business. Though sales in the Northeast and the South were weaker than in February, sales in the West and the Midwest were stronger.
Mortgage rates in March averaged a moderate 7.5 percent, and, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, they were still falling at the end of the month. Last week, rates were down to 7.38 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate loan.
In the West, new-home sales jumped 21.9 percent, to a rate of 184,000, while in the Midwest, they were up 17.8 percent, to a rate of 126,000. But in the Northeast, sales fell 20.3 percent, to a rate of 51,000 in March, and in the South, they were down 2.8 percent, to a rate of 277,000.
March's seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 637,000 units was up 15.4 percent from that of a year ago.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Losses by UAL Deepen In Year's First Quarter

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, parent company of United Airlines, reported a larger than expected loss yesterday, injecting a sour note into a growing chorus of optimism for a recovery in the domestic airline industry.
Nevertheless, United attributed much of its net loss before special charges -- $138 million, or $5.92 a share, compared with a similar net loss of $108 million, or $4.52 a share, a year earlier -- to its extensive trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific operations. On those routes, its business fell almost 10 percent in the quarter. 
 By contrast, the domestic business of the Chicago-based carrier improved, with increased traffic and lower costs.
"There are some nice surprises in there, but they didn't swing the results," said John R. Stodden, an analyst with Duff & Phelps in Chicago. "Everything was working against them in the Pacific." In this category, unfavorable foreign-exchange rates for the dollar produced $22 million in losses this quarter, compared with $20 million in gains in the first three months last year.
 
Analysts, and Stock, Jolted
 The results included a substantial number of the special charges. Still, the first-quarter loss, which came on a 12.2 percent rise in revenue, to $3.33 billion, surprised many analysts.
UAL's shares dropped $4.875 yesterday, to $140.625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. While airline issues have been rising as a group on tidbits of positive news in recent weeks -- such as American Airlines' narrower than expected loss and strong March traffic figures -- other airline shares remained largely unchanged yesterday.
Analysts reasoned that investors considered the poor showing at United, the nation's second-largest carrier, a result of international problems that affect it more than other airlines.
Although United's operating expenses per available seat-mile dropped 2.6 percent, to 9.62 cents, and its operating loss narrowed 28 percent, to $121 million, the carrier said that its cost-cutting program was still insufficient to become profitable.
"We continue to move forward with plans to reduce further our costs by making structural changes to the company," said Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's chairman and chief executive.
United also said yesterday that it had reached an agreement with Airbus Industrie, the European plane maker, to slow deliveries of its A-320's and retire other aircraft more quickly. "Until the economics of our domestic flying improve, we will continue to reduce our planned capacity in U.S. markets to help return United Airlines to profitability," Mr. Wolf said.
While cost-cutting is important to achieving that goal, analysts said that United needs to improve in its Pacific markets, particularly its flights to and from Japan.
"It doesn't seem that will get better in the near term," said David Pizzimenti, an analyst at the Nomura Research Institute.

HEADLINE: Group of Seven Urges Yeltsin to Push His Reforms

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Finance ministers from the major industrialized nations urged President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today to use his victory in the referendum last weekend to press ahead faster with reforms to create a market economy.
After the finance ministers met in Washington, several officials said Russia would be able to take maximum advantage of the $28 billion in aid that the Group of Seven promised it only if it pushed rapidly ahead with change. 
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was host of today's Group of Seven meeting, said Mr. Yeltsin should use his mandate from the referendum to assert more control over his nation's central bank to make sure it does not continue printing so many rubles that it fuels hyperinflation.
"There was agreement that Russia has a major responsibility to get control of its inflation rate," Mr. Bentsen said at a news conference after the meeting. "There was a feeling that this victory by Yeltsin would strengthen his hand at home."
 
More Aid Discussed
 Group of Seven officials said that at the meeting they had discussed ways to pledge more aid to Russia, and focused on plans to develop a fund of at least $2 billion to help finance privatization of government-owned enterprises.
A senior Treasury official said that "the clear sense is that now is the time for the Russian Government to take the necessary steps, stabilizing prices, promoting private enterprises" to make the Group of Seven's aid program "maximally effective."
The tone of the meeting was far different from that of several years ago, when the seven nations often bickered because the United States was reluctant to cut its deficit and Germany ignored pleas to cuts its interest rates. The Group of Seven includes the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Germany and Japan.
 
New Cooperation Seen
 Hanging over the meeting was today's news that the American economy grew by a sluggish 1.8 percent in the first quarter, down from a robust 4.7 percent in the previous quarter.
Mr. Bentsen said, "The decline in U.S. exports in the first quarter -- which shaved almost a full percentage point off the gross domestic product -- illustrates why we have a large stake in faster economic growth in other countries."
In their communique, the finance ministers trumpeted a new sense of cooperation, praising themselves for cutting interest rates and taking other steps to spur growth at home and around the world. The ministers added, however, that further moves to fuel growth were needed.
"We need to make sure that for the first time in four years, forecasts of a reasonable rate of growth around the world come to pass," a senior Treasury official said.
American officials said they expected Japan to take measures beyond its $116 billion stimulus package to lift itself out of a slump. This, they said, should lead to more imports by Japan, thus helping to reduce trade tensions and Japan's $49 billion trade surplus with the United States.
In recent weeks, Mr. Bentsen has clashed with Tokyo after Japanese officials angrily accused Washington of seeking to push up the yen to help reduce Japan's trade imbalances. On Tuesday, the Treasury Department asked the Federal Reserve to intervene in financial markets by buying dollars to help stop the yen from rising further. A stronger yen hurts Japan's exports by making them more expensive, and Japanese officials feared that this would drag down their ailing economy.
Mr. Bentsen said that the economies of Europe and Japan were growing more slowly than that of the United States, and that their economic weakness caused them to import fewer American goods than they otherwise would. He added that Japan's large trade surplus "remains a drag on growth."
"If we work together, we will grow together," he said.
The officials once again vowed to complete the Uruguay Round, a 112-nation round of trade talks that began in 1986, with some officials saying they hoped to finish it by the end of this year.
"The further opening of the international trading system is indispensable for maximizing world growth," the communique said. "A successful growth strategy requires prompt and appropriate conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Protectionism retards growth and must be resisted."
Mr. Bentsen said the Clinton Administration's moves to cut the budget deficit have given the United States more credibility at Group of Seven meetings and made it easier for it to lead. American officials said officials from the other nations were eager for America's economic recovery to continue and for Mr. Clinton's economic package to win Congressional approval to make sure that the United States cut its deficit.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Health Plan a Headache for Congress

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
As the unveiling of President Clinton's health-care plan approaches, the anxiety level is rising on Capitol Hill. Excitement over the prospect of truly radical reform is tempered by the recognition of the political difficulties, the perils and the stakes.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, summarized the matter neatly this week: "Not only has the President bet his future on this question, but he appears to be betting our futures also." 
 The immediate issue is the timing of the release of the health-care plan, now widely expected in late May. Since the plan is expected to include new taxes, some House leaders fear that introducing the proposal in May will make it much harder to pass Mr. Clinton's previously announced taxing and spending proposals, which are scheduled for a vote just before the Memorial Day recess. Those concerns were reiterated Wednesday night at a dinner at the White House attended by influential Democratic committee and subcommittee chairmen from the House.
 
Nervous About Plan
 There are also jitters about the health-care plan itself, and the enormous task of comprehending, explaining and defending a measure that will restructure one-seventh of the nation's economy. Much of this simply reflects the growing recognition on Capitol Hill that Congressmen are venturing into territory that is truly unknown.
They hope it is another Social Security; they fear that it is another Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, which was intended to protect the elderly against the costs of catastrophic illnesses, but caused such an uproar over its taxes that Congress repealed it the following year.
"Nobody wants to be stampeded," said one aide to the House Democratic leadership, noting that the questions were numerous and careful in the Democratic caucus.
Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, sent some signals of his own this week in remarks that seemed intended to both warn the White House and protect Congress from unrealistic deadlines. "I think it's more important to get it right than to get it on time," Mr. Foley said in a speech to news executives.
While blithely insisting they will stick to their schedule, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, who heads the health-care task force, are beginning to take note of the Congressional nerves. Clinton spokesmen insist that Congressional briefings at this point in the process were all part of the grand plan, but the pace of the legislative courtship this week is striking.
On Friday, Mrs. Clinton will brief the entire Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, on the emerging health-care plan. Last weekend, the Clintons briefed Senate Democrats at a Virginia retreat.
On Wednesday night, the President and First Lady held a dinner for the top Democratic leaders in the House, the prime movers of the House Ways and Means Committee, and the chairmen of several other important committees.
"It really was another highlighting of their desire to do health care," said Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, the Connecticut Democrat who is a member of Ways and Means and the Democratic leadership, who was at the dinner. She added that both she and Mr. Rostenkowski urged that the Clintons allow the major taxing and spending bill, known as a reconciliation bill, to get through the House before unveiling the health-care plan, but there was no commitment from the Clintons.
"It's not that we don't want to do the bill," Ms. Kennelly said of health care. "We want to do it right."
Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, said: "The President wants to get this done this year; that's what the meeting was about. First of all, why we should, and how could we help him do it."
It is, of course, possible that the timing dispute could be finessed in the House; the task force could report to Mr. Clinton in late May, thus abiding by the White House's self-imposed deadline. Mr. Clinton could then withhold the announcement of the final plan until after Memorial Day.
 
Bit of Culture Clash
 Harder to finesse will be the substance of the plan itself, and the theory on which it is premised: the blend of market forces and regulation known as managed competition. So far, it has been a highly esoteric discussion, and one with few details, and that has caused some grumbling from lawmakers. There is, some Congressional staff members suggest, a bit of a culture clash between Ira C. Magaziner, the top task force staff adviser and organizational guru, and some members of Congress.
At one meeting with leading House members, one Democrat said: "Ira was saying, 'Yes, there's a lot of decisions for the President to make; that he was drawing up a decision tree and had not completed it yet but that it had 723 branches.' And you could just see the look on some of these guys' faces."
Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat, frets, "My fear is that managed competition is the kind of idea that an academic would hatch up; it appears good on paper, but you get around to implementing it, there's problems."
Mr. Rostenkowski, who said he was committed to working with the President, nevertheless warned in a speech this week: "We must try to answer many of the questions being posed by critics. We need to create a comfort level where people don't believe they're embracing a tremendous gamble and betting the future of the American health-care system on it."
 
'We Ought to Move Ahead'
 For all the worries, many Democratic leaders said there was genuine enthusiasm on Capitol Hill to push ahead with overhauling the health-care system. In the Senate, where some lawmakers have been steeped in the health-care issue over the years, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota said, "I think it would be counterproductive to delay at this point."
Mr. Daschle, who is co-chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, added, "There are concerns, and obviously we have to address them, but I think the overwhelming consensus on both sides of Congress is we ought to move ahead."
And Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said after the White House dinner Wednesday night: "If this bill can be accomplished it will be the biggest domestic legislation since Medicare or the Social Security Act of 1935. You don't do this every day, or every 50 years. That creates anxiety. But it also creates anticipation and excitement."

HEADLINE: Diplomats, and Aristide, See an End to Haiti Impasse

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Diplomats said today that military leaders in Haiti had signaled their readiness for a new push to end the country's political stalemate, and the ousted President said he was increasingly confident that he would soon return to office.
In an interview in the Georgetown apartment that has been his home for over a year, the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, also gave the first explanation of an offer of amnesty for his opponents; diplomats say the amnesty is a key to a negotiated transfer of power in Haiti. 
 Two weeks ago, the military commanders rejected a settlement based on a similar amnesty offer, which was first made in a brief statement broadcast to Haiti by shortwave radio. But diplomats involved in the negotiations said they have received a letter from Army leaders saying they were misunderstood and asking for the talks to continue.
In the interview, Father Aristide said of the military leaders who overthrew him, "I will not put them in jail or pursue them." He also said his enemies in the military would be free to remain in Haiti after his return.
 
Justice, He Says, Not Vengeance
 But President Aristide, who was overthrown by soldiers in a violent coup in September 1991, said the Haitian Constitution prevented him from protecting coup leaders from suits by victims of political violence.
To accusations of having tolerated mob violence by his avenging supporters, Father Aristide, speaking confidently in English, said: "People who are victims will not have to get justice for themselves. That would be vengeance, that would be retaliation. They will have to look to institutions to seek justice."
After pressing Father Aristide to grant the amnesty, people familiar with the negotiations for his return said Washington had applied strong behind-the-scenes pressure on Haiti's military to accept a settlement.
Members of Congress and others who have been briefed recently say President Clinton's special adviser on the Haitian crisis, Lawrence A. Pezzullo, had expressed great confidence that the diplomatic pressure would speed a resolution. The mediators, sponsored by the United Nations, are expected to return to Haiti soon.
 
Two Models
 Although some diplomats and international financial experts have said that big profits from drug trafficking and other contraband were a factor in leading the military leaders to reject previous offers of a settlement, officials familiar with the negotiations say Washington is now confident the talks are back on track.
After a briefing Wednesday, one congressman said of Haiti's military leaders, "They are weak enough in the knees and realize that Clinton will break their backs in a heartbeat."
Echoing the statements of diplomats, Father Aristide said Haitians who sought justice for the loss of relatives and property in political violence would have to await the rebuilding of the corrupt and ineffectual judicial system, a key objective of international plans to stabilize the country.
Father Aristide's rejection of revenge and retaliation was one of many statements in the 90-minute interview urging reconciliation between Haiti's deeply divided rich and poor and sharply opposed political currents of left and right.
As faxes repeatedly arrived on the machine in the living room of his small, carpeted apartment, the President said he had been particularly inspired during his 19-month exile by the South African leader Nelson Mandela and King Juan Carlos of Spain, who he said had helped navigate their countries through difficult political transitions.
"What we have to do and what he did was have the technical ability to make every single citizen feel comfortable," Father Aristide said of King Juan Carlos, who oversaw Spain's change from fascism to democracy. "In the light of their experience we are encouraged, because we must do all that we can to assure all of us. The President must be the President of every single citizen."
 
Poor vs. Rich
 Reeling off statistics that he said likened the disparity between rich and poor in Haiti to apartheid, Father Aristide said of Mr. Mandela, "We are proud of all those who choose non-violence as the way to change."
Throughout his nearly eight months in office before the coup, many among Haiti's privileged classes said they felt that President Aristide, a populist Roman Catholic priest, was willing to justify almost any behavior by the poor if it helped them get what they saw as economic and political justice.
In recent weeks diplomats have said that fears among the small Haitian elite that have sprung from this perception are so strong that Father Aristide would need to exercise "Lincolnian statesmanship," as one put it.
Throughout the interview the President, looking relaxed and self-assured, appealed to those among Haiti's wealthy who would listen, urging them to take a role in rebuilding the country.
"Let us not put the focus on that past, but look at building a better future, and one President cannot do that alone," Father Aristide. "I think today how happy the people will be when they are freed from the coup leaders. Things will be good even for the financiers of the coup."
 
Stability Comes First
 It is widely believed by diplomats and human rights experts that some of Haiti's wealthiest business people provided financial backing for the officers who led the coup.
"Having a new beginning of political stability, which is indispensable, the businessmen will have a new climate, which they want and need," the President said, seeking to assure even those who have been most hostile to him. "They will have it. We need it."
In addition to Father Aristide's offer of an amnesty, the emerging outlines of a political settlement call for a sweeping overhaul of the military, removing most of the President's bitterest opponents. The plan also calls for the retraining of a reduced Army and a civilian police force.
In a bid to reassure members of the military who are nervous about a reshuffle, Father Aristide said that in choosing new commanders, he would stick to military regulations on eligibility. "This doesn't mean that we can take someone who is our friend," he said. "Once we respect principles, this will all happen very naturally."
 
Picking a Prime Minister
 The President said he had also narrowed his choice for Prime Minister to a few names, and was "not looking for someone who will come from my pocket." Instead, he said, he would choose someone with advice from the business sector "in a balance that helps make them secure."
Although he has not made a final decision, Father Aristide said the choice could be made quickly.
"It is a matter of picking up the phone and speaking to this one, that one and the other one, and hearing them out," he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
G.M. Posts Half-Billion In Profits

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 29

 BODY:
With revenue up and many costs down, the General Motors Corporation yesterday reported first-quarter net income of $513.2 million, in contrast to a loss a year ago.
That completed a good first quarter for the Big Three auto makers. On Wednesday, the Ford Motor Company reported its best quarter in several years; last week, the Chrysler Corporation reported strong operating earnings. 
 G.M. executives said they were encouraged that the results showed improvement, particularly in contrast to the losses generated in the last few years by the company's North American operations. In North America, earnings before interest, taxes and a charge for future liability for employee benefits was $525 million, compared with a $992 million loss a year ago -- a positive swing of $1.52 billion.
 
 
Stock Falls $1.375
 "This is quite an accomplishment, especially in a ho-hum automotive market and with the weak car lineup Jack inherited," said Wendy Needham, automotive analyst for Smith Barney in New York.
But if some analysts were pleased, investors were less so, and G.M.'s stock price fell $1.375, to $41, with more than four million shares traded.
On Friday morning, G.M. executives will tackle a more pressing matter, formally responding to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's proposal that 4.7 million G.M. pickup trucks be recalled because of the danger of fire in side-impact collisions. G.M. will vigorously contest the Government's preliminary finding, and a formal investigation may follow, including a public hearing that G.M. would prefer to avoid. [Page D2.]
Just as the North American operations of G.M. are beginning to perk up, its overseas business is headed down, mostly because of weak economies in Europe. Net income from international operations was $165 million in the quarter, down from $482 million.
 
 
On Track to Break Even
 John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive since April 1992, has promised to make the company's operations break even in 1993, excluding interest, taxes and the effect of an accounting change to reflect the cost of future retiree benefits.
"Our first-quarter results are on track consistent with achievement of this very aggressive objective," Mr. Smith said. "We won't let up as we continue to work toward our 1993 target."
General Motors said its revenue for the current quarter rose 8.4 percent, to $34.96 billion, from $32.26 billion last year.
On Wednesday, G.M. shares had risen $2, as the company's Hughes and Electronic Data Systems subsidiaries reported combined profits of nearly $600 million.
On a per-share basis, earnings attributable to G.M. common shares were 42 cents a share in the quarter. Last year, G.M. lost $166.7 million, or 53 cents a share, before a $20.9 billion charge to account for the cost of retiree benefits. That created a $21 billion loss in the first quarter of 1992.
G.M.'s share of the United States vehicle market dropped to 33.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with 34.5 percent a year earlier, but the company said most of the drop could be attributed to fewer sales to fleet customers. Rebates are averaging about $940 a vehicle, compared with about $1,000 a year ago.
G. Richard Wagoner, General Motors' chief financial officer, said the auto maker was making headway in reducing costs among suppliers and in internal operations. But he warned that contract negotiations this summer with the United Automobile Workers union "could have an impact" on the company's earnings progress.
As the three-year labor contract draws to a close, G.M. has been quietly trying to persuade the union to consider ways to reduce health-care outlays for workers. But at a U.A.W. planning meeting this week, union leaders loudly warned against tampering with health-care benefits.
Mr. Wagoner said G.M. projected that Europe would remain profitable this year, even though it expects European economies to remain weak for the rest of 1993. "We are well positioned against our European competitors," he said. "and we've been getting great reviews of our new Corsa," a small car.
 
Big Pension Obligation
 While asserting that G.M. had strengthened its balance sheet by bringing cash and debt balances into rough parity at about $8.5 billion, Mr. Wagoner acknowledged that the auto maker's $12 billion pension liability remained a paramount issue "in front of us and our board."
"We have a plan to be very heavy contributors to the plan for the next six to seven years," Mr. Wagoner said, though he declined to specify amounts.
For the quarter, G.M. sold 2,017,000 vehicles worldwide, compared with 1,892,000 last year.
But gross profit margins -- sales minus the cost of goods sold, excluding administrative overhead -- were better, too -- 14.2 percent compared with 12 percent last year.
On Wednesday, the Ford Motor Company reported earnings of $572 million, or $1.02 a share, its best quarter in nearly three years. And last week the Chrysler Corporation reported first-quarter operating profits of $530 million, although a $4.68 billion write-off for retiree health care resulted in a $4.15 billion loss.

HEADLINE: East Europe Still Waits For the Capitalist Push

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
Three years after the collapse of Communism, the warm welcome and private investment that most Eastern Europeans expected from the European Community countries have fallen far short of their expectations.
Fears that German companies would virtually take over the economy of central Europe have so far not been confirmed. The foreign capital that has come in from Germany, the United States and elsewhere is billions of dollars less than the estimated need to restructure economies driven by Communism for 40 years, and efforts to take advantage of Eastern Europe's cheap labor and sell goods to Western markets have produced a protectionist backlash. 
 Some people here are beginning to think that well-off Western Europeans are not willing to sacrifice to make it possible for Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and others to join their cozy and comfortable club.
"The process of rapprochement has to be a two-way street," said Ivan Busniak, a Czech Foreign Ministry official. "It is not only we who have to change; the Western Europeans have to change, too."
 
Steelworkers' Discontent
 This winter, steelworkers in Germany, France and Britain have staged protests demanding protection for jobs many see as endangered by competition from the east. Despite affirmations that the European Community welcomed Eastern Europe's transition to a market economy, the Western trade group has recently strengthened its tariff barriers against cheap food products, textiles, and coal and steel from Eastern Europe.
Yet as Dr. Andreas Gummich, an analyst for Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt, pointed out, these are the very areas where Eastern Europeans want to try to exploit their best trading advantage -- low labor costs.
"Agriculture, textiles, and coal and steel make up 75 percent of the exports for the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary -- the very same areas in which the European Community is most highly protective," Dr. Gummich said.
[On April 22, European Community negotiators agreed to set quotas for Czech and Slovak steel imports this year that are only a little more than half 1992 levels. Punitive tariffs would be imposed on any excess, community officials said.]
Wide repercussions also followed a ban that the European Community imposed April 8 on meat and dairy products from Eastern Europe, ostensibly because of fears of contamination from hoof-and-mouth disease.
"This embargo is protectionism and does not reflect the political promises of the West," the Czech Trade and Industry Minister, Vladimir Dlouhy, said. Czech authorities protested that the last case of the disease in their country was in 1974, and retaliated with a ban of their own on imports of meat and milk products from the European Community. Hungary and Poland reacted similarly.
 
Which Way to Look
 The lesson, the leader of the former Communist Party later wrote to Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, was that the Czech Republic's best friends were not in the West but in the former Soviet Union, and that policies should be changed to reflect this reality.
Poland and Hungary all have association agreements with the European Community to prepare the way for eventual membership after the turn of the century. The Czech Republic and Slovakia have been negotiating new accords following the breakup of the Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992.
"I don't think we should even be trying to join the European Community now," said Pavel Dvorak, a former Czech tourist guide who has built a small business from the proceeds of a set of slot machines he bought after Communism fell. "The only advantage we have is our low labor costs, and we'd lose that advantage if we joined too soon."
Fears of German economic domination of the region also abound. Germany is now central Europe's largest trading partner, with a volume of about $10 billion with Poland and the former Czechoslovakia and about $5 billion with Hungary last year. But when it comes to investment, the biggest worry here now is not that there will be too much German investment, but too little foreign investment altogether.
 
Little Foreign Investment
 Total direct foreign investment in the Czech Republic since the fall of Communism has amounted to only $1.6 billion. In Hungary it is $4.8 billion, and in Poland $1 billion, according to the German central bank. Only in the Czech Republic do the Germans have the largest investment, and even here, the United States invested more in 1992 than Germany did. One reason is that German investors have concentrated on the former East Germany, pouring in $107 billion since 1990.
But with privatization of most Czech heavy industry still not yet accomplished, foreign investment could become more significant in the next few years. A privatization process that has distributed formerly publicly owned companies to individual Czech investors, who paid nominal amounts for the right to buy shares, will distribute the first stock certificates next month.
Some worry that the Germans will yet become the dominant economic factor in central Europe. "The Germans are working systematically, step by step, to increase their influence here," said Mr. Dvorak, who is an official of the Union of Czech Entrepreneurs. "We need somebody strong to help us avoid complete dependency. Where are the Americans? Where are the Japanese?"
The Czech Republic's President, Vaclav Havel, made light of such remarks. "On the one hand," he said in an interview with Munich's Sud deutsche Zeitung, "you hear a lot of talk about the 'German danger,' and about how we could be economically occupied by Germany. On the other hand, a lot of businesses have a German sign right underneath the Czech one."
Mr. Dvorak handed out a business card that was printed in German.
 
VW Buys Into a Plant
 The biggest single foreign investor in the Czech Republic is Volkswagen, which bought a 31 percent interest in the giant Skoda automobile plant in Mlada Boleslav, 40 miles northeast of Prague, and has so far invested $163 million in it. Volkswagen will put in another $313 million next year, and by 1997 it will have built an entire new factory with a total investment of more than $3 billion, according to Dr. Milan Smutny, a spokesman at the factory.
"It isn't the Germans' fault that they're making so many investments here," Dr. Smutny said. "It's the fault of other countries for not coming."
Last year, Philip Morris restored some balance to the foreign investment equation, buying the former Czech state monopoly on tobacco products for $398 million.
But compared to the $9 billion that foreign companies have earmarked for investment in the oil-producing former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, the $7.4 billion for the three most economically advanced eastern European countries seems like small potatoes to the people who live here.
"The Germans want to use us as a gateway to the vast Soviet market," said Vladimir Jindra, an adviser to the president of the Czech central bank.
 
Seeking Cheap Labor
 German entrepreneurs and financial analysts say what they really want is something much simpler: cheap labor. The average worker at the Skoda automobile works, for example, costs Volkswagen $220 a month, compared to more than $4,000 at the company's German headquarters in Wolfsburg. Overall labor costs in Czechoslovakia are a tenth of what they are in Germany; in Hungary the ratio is one to six, and in Poland one to eight, according to German central bank research.
By 1995, Volkswagen expects to double the productivity of its 17,100 Czech workers and make 450,000 cars, hoping to sell about two thirds of them in eastern markets and a quarter of them in Western Europe.
But if European Community protectionist trends continue, some economists say, the strategy will fail. "The Germans ought to be pressing for more openness by the E.C. to products from these areas where they want to transfer their production costs," said Richard Portes, director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London.
Instead, the Germans have so far gone along with greater protectionism. "I think we'll be ready to join before the E.C. is willing to accept us," Mr. Klaus, the Czech Prime Minister, said.

HEADLINE: Yale Students Urge a Trustee to Quit After Company Is Fined

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, April 29

 BODY:
Student pressure is growing for the resignation of a longtime Yale University trustee whose company pleaded guilty last month to cooperating with Arab countries in their economic boycott of Israel.
The student government and the student newspaper have called on the trustee, Vernon Loucks, to step down. A newly formed group, Students for Business Ethics, has collected more than 900 signatures on a petition seeking his resignation. 
 Mr. Loucks is the senior fellow of the Yale board and chairman of the university's five-year $1.5 billion fund-raising drive. He is also chairman of Baxter International, the world's largest medical supplies company.
On March 25, Baxter agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and $6 million in penalties for violating Federal laws by providing Arab nations with details of its business dealings with Israel and of its charitable contributions there. Baxter, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., violated the laws in an effort to get off an Arab blacklist that had limited its business opportunities in the Middle East.
While Mr. Loucks was not directly implicated, some students have said that any wrongdoing on the part of Baxter International reflects badly on Yale because of Mr. Loucks's important roles at the university.
An assistant to Mr. Loucks said he was out of the office and could not be reached for comment. But he has said that he does not intend to resign, and he told The Yale Daily News, the student newspaper, last month, "I don't see anything that impairs my functionality."
Andy McStay, the author of the student government letter asking Mr. Loucks to resign, said, "Administrators didn't seem to think anything was wrong, even to the point of not chiding him gently. I realized that it was going to be up to the students to press the issue."
The editors of The Yale Daily News wrote that Mr. Loucks's continued presence on the board would "send the message that the university totally tolerates disregard for the law." They called on him to resign by July 1, when Yale's new president, Richard Levin, will take office.
As the senior fellow in the corporation, Mr. Loucks, who graduated in 1957, leads the board in setting policy and serves as its spokesman. A trustee since 1979, he is its longest-serving current member, and his term expires in 1998.
Fellow board members and Yale administrators have been supportive of Mr. Loucks. Joseph Gall, a trustee, called Mr. Loucks "a person of enormous personal integrity whose devotion to Yale, to the Yale Corporation, and everything that has to do with the university has been absolutely outstanding."
Fred Rose, a trustee, said that the business dealings of Baxter do not reflect on Yale. Yale's acting president, Howard Lamar, supported Mr. Loucks, adding, in a statement, "We hope he will continue to serve."
Matthew Beredo, the student government president, did not support the resolution asking Mr. Loucks to resign. Mr. Beredo said that undergraduates do not have enough perspective on the issue. "The U.S. court system did not implicate Mr. Loucks directly. I find it very difficult for the student government to go about doing that," he said.

HEADLINE: A Top Financier With a Passion for Brand Names

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Fayez Sarofim is not about to abandon his investment principles when he shops for mouthwash. His local Walgreen's drugstore in Houston asks $2.69 for its private label, $4.99 for the leading brand. "Which one do I buy?" he said. "Listerine. I wouldn't even think of buying the knock-off."
No problem for Mr. Sarofim, whose net worth tops $600 million. He built that fortune by becoming the nation's leading investor in brand-name companies: the makers of Coca-Cola, Tide, Listerine and, most of all, Marlboros. With $26 billion under his management as well as a heavily advertised Dreyfus mutual fund, Mr. Sarofim has become something of a brand name himself.
 
A Discount Buyer
 From the end of 1983 through 1992, Mr. Sarofim did better than 94 percent of all other money managers, according to a report provided by SEI Associates to one client, the Mississippi state pension fund. 
Now, as consumers turn away from brand-name products and investors dump brand-name stocks, Mr. Sarofim is the major victim. Last year, he fell to the bottom 20 percent among money managers. In Philip Morris alone, his investment firm, Fayez Sarofim & Company, lost about $475 million on "Marlboro Friday," the day early this month when the company cut the price of its most profitable product.
Let others proclaim the decline of the great labels. Let them load their shopping carts with Brands X, Y, and Z at Sam's Club or Pathmark. Mr. Sarofim has responded by buying more of his favorite stock-market merchandise, at discount prices.
"They've taken quite a licking," Mr. Sarofim said of his cherished stocks, his low rumble of a voice rising scarcely a decibel. "But in the past, when you've had a disappointment, that has created an opportunity to buy."
At Philip Morris in particular, he said in a recent interview, "nothing has really changed except the price quotation in the newspaper."
If the consumer products marketers decide to run commercials for their shares instead of for their detergents and deodorants, they could find no more resolute pitchman than this 64-year-old native of Egypt. "If you look at a Warren Buffett, what are two of his largest holdings? Coca-Cola and Gillette," Mr. Sarofim said, adding that he was into Coca-Cola first (and probably Gillette too, judging from public filings).
His own habit of stuffing pantry, medicine chest and refrigerator with brand names comes less from his wealth ("I keep track, but I don't disclose") than his foreign origins, he said. "The educated consumer goes for the private label. The immigrant like myself goes for the brands."
The brands still have plenty of vigor at home, he said, and virtually limitless potential abroad. Billions of Russians, Chinese, Indians and Indonesians are just learning the pleasures of Marlboros and Cokes. He grants that in the United States, brand names will grow more slowly, but blames the economy's sluggishness for their retreat.
"I'm one who believes in brands. I'm sure Diane would rather buy branded clothes than knockoffs," he said, gesturing toward Diane M. Coffey, the Dreyfus director of corporate communications nearby on a couch. "Is that right, Diane?"
She glanced down at her perfectly presentable, navy pleated skirt of perhaps suspect origins and said, "Well, yes for a good price. But I'd take a knock-off if it looked like the real thing."
Mr. Sarofim frowned, prompting her to try again. "But if you're talking about Coca-Cola," she said, "I'd rather have a Coca-Cola than a . . . "
"Than a Sam's Cola," he said.
 
Harvard and the High Life
 Mr. Sarofim is an educated consumer himself, courtesy of Harvard Business School. He has run his own money management firm, based in Houston, since 1958, serving public and corporate pension funds and university endowments. Some other money managers call him the Sphinx for his origins as well as his aura of timeless, serene wisdom.
In Houston, where many oil and real estate fortunes have evaporated, an art collection stretching from El Greco to Abstract Expressionism attracts attention. So did his recent party that filled the Houston Museum of Fine Arts with tables serving everything from tamales to Peking Duck, all chased by $100-a-bottle Louis Roederer Cristal Champagne.
Mr. Sarofim seemed at home in New York as well, one morning last week, as he pulled his latest performance figures from a fax machine in his suite at the Carlyle hotel.
His success in energy stocks and then consumer and drug stocks made him one of the premier money managers of the 1980's. His public renown blossomed after Howard Stein, the Dreyfus chairman and a friend, succeeded in recruiting him to manage the Dreyfus Appreciation Fund. Mr. Stein, who had been trying for years, said the consent came in 1990 only after three bottles of wine over dinner at New York's Le Cirque.
Brassy advertisements -- with Mr. Sarofim's name the size of a market-crash headline and his picture -- have helped the fund grow from $40 million then to about $230 million now. For this, Mr. Stein suffers phone calls in which Mr. Sarofim compares his own net worth with that of the entire Dreyfus company. Sarofim $600 million, Dreyfus $800 million, by his friend's most recent accounting.
 
'Felt a Lot Poorer'
 On Marlboro Friday, Mr. Sarofim lost some ground.
"I felt poorer," Mr. Sarofim said. "I felt a lot poorer."
The treasurer of Philip Morris called that day -- a day the stock fell $14.75 -- to reassure Mr. Sarofim about the durability of the company's prospects and its generous, $2.60 annual dividend -- assurances he passed on in letters to his investors. Some of them nervously phoned him, Mr. Sarofim said, but none have withdrawn.
Those investors who stayed with him through the early 1980's watched his huge holdings of energy stocks plunge, then recover in the industry's merger binge, said Eddie B. Vandiver, the deputy director of investments at the Public Employees Retirement System of Mississippi.
For stocks in general, Mr. Sarofim still has all the vim of a Pepsi-Cola Uh-huh Girl. His forecast last year that the Dow would hit 10,000 by the year 2000? "That's very doable," he said. Even if the market's annual returns fall to about 12 percent, from 15 percent-plus in the 1980's, he said, the Dow will still crack 7,000.
Mr. Sarofim's high-domed features have recently been absent from Dreyfus advertisements, however. The company says it has planned all along to feature other funds, with no reflection intended on the value of the Sarofim name.
The owner of that name, however, is suffering some symptoms of publicity withdrawal. "I miss seeing myself," he said.

HEADLINE: Peekskill Tries a Creative Approach to Revival;
Welcoming Artists Fill Vacant Spaces in Hopes of Invigorating a Shopping District

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL, N.Y., April 26

 BODY:
Larry D'Amico's recent decision to relocate his life and work to a crumbling, 148-year-old former church in downtown Peekskill prompts an immediate question: What's a nice landscape painter like you doing in a place like this?
After all, the retail hub of this small city on the Hudson seemed to be near death's door as recently as two years ago. That was before Ralph DiBart, a planner on retainer to the city, concocted a scheme to resuscitate downtown Peekskill by converting it into an artists' enclave. 
 To the pleasant surprise of many skeptics, it seems to be working.
 
Large Spaces, Low Rents
 Over the last 18 months, the city has persuaded 40 artists from places like SoHo and Long Island City to pack up their brushes and move their studios, and in many cases their homes, into the vacant shops, offices and warehouses of this community in northwestern Westchester County.
The influx of creative talent -- drawn in part by large spaces available at relatively cheap rents -- has been accompanied by the opening of seven galleries and the arrival of other related businesses, including a bookstore, a marketing-design company, a performing arts space and, soon, an art school.
"There is a sense of mission," said Lillie Mikesell, owner of Bywood Publishing, a small printer of books that opened in Peekskill last fall and recently unveiled its own art gallery. "It's trying to rethink a community from the ground up."
Peekskill's efforts are noteworthy on two levels. While other communities in the metropolitan New York region have rejuvenated their Main Streets by attracting more traditional retail businesses, like antique shops or specialty stores, Peekskill is believed to be the only municipality that has focused exclusively on artists as the key to its survival, said Chester Rapkin, professor of urban planning emeritus at Princeton University.
 
Artists Welcomed
 What is also special, Dr. Rapkin said, is the lead role that Peekskill city officials have played in building a neighborhood of artists virtually from scratch. Most creative hubs -- in places like SoHo in Manhattan and the Old City in Montreal -- were pioneered by artists, who then lobbied public officials for the zoning changes needed to live and paint there, he said.
But in Peekskill, it is the city officials who are doing the lobbying, taking out ads in The Village Voice to lure artists and then escorting them through every step in the relocation process, from finding space to bargaining with landlords to securing loans.
"The building inspector has been helpful, rather than a hindrance, which is something you don't run into a lot," marveled Mr. D'Amico, the landscape painter, taking a break from hammering the beams that will make the former church, with its 20-foot ceilings, both a residence and studio.
"To welcome artists into a community is unique," he added. "Artists are looked upon as renegades in most communities. It's definitely different here."
Mr. D'Amico and his girlfriend, Sone Tower, who is also a painter, are joined in town by an eclectic collection of colleagues, including Linda Jean Fisher, who creates collages, including one that splices together definitions and images from a dictionary; Mariah Fee, a painter who uses oil and wax to illustrate "fertility," among other themes, and Deborah Settles, whose shop, Cultural Xpressions, sells jumpsuits that she has enlivened with African prints.
 
A Different Sort of Skyline
 After 11 years in Long Island City, Carla Rae Johnson, a sculptor, relocated to Peekskill last spring because she could rent a lot more studio space for much less money. Ms. Johnson -- who occasionally makes the hour-and-a-half drive to a gallery in SoHo that she is associated with -- said she feared she would miss living in the shadows of the Manhattan skyline. But that has not been the case.
"I go to the river," she said, referring to a waterfront that boasts a spectacular view of Bear Mountain State Park, "and there's a whole skyline down there that's completely different from New York but every bit as dramatic."
Dr. Rapkin, who has studied SoHo, among other artists' districts, predicted that the artists in Peekskill will bolster the local economy, particularly by luring buyers and browsers of art into town and providing an instant market for new service businesses.
Raymond Pisanello, the co-owner of Jasmine's Marketplace, a 6-year-old restaurant and gourmet food shop, said his business has doubled over the last year, partly because of the tours of artists' studios that the city has organized on a number of weekends.
"My spirits are definitely lifted," said Mr. Pisanello, who had once contemplated closing.
Mr. DiBart, the planner hailed for bringing Peekskill back to life, said the growth should continue. Soon, the Westchester Art Workshop in White Plains, a joint venture of the state and county, is expected to open a branch in a former department store here, offering classes in computer imagery and digital photography, he said.
And, armed with a $10,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, the city is studying plans to convert a vacant lot into dozens of apartments, complete with workshops, for artists and their families.
Fran Gibbs, Peekskill's deputy mayor, is one of many people who describe being bowled over by the swirl of activity.
"All of a sudden," she said, "we're an attraction again."

HEADLINE: In Sluggish Growth, a 2-Edged Sword for Clinton

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The surprisingly weak economic output figures for the first quarter give President Clinton powerful ammunition to attack Republicans for scuttling his economic stimulus program.
But the bad news turns up the heat on him to deliver -- and soon -- on his promise to create jobs and prosperity. 
 Within the Administration, the reaction to the weak figures of 1.8 percent first-quarter growth was "I told you so." Administration officials seized on the disappointing numbers to argue that some stimulus is needed and to lash out at Senate Republicans for blocking the President's $19.5 billion jobs package.
"This is an anemic, no-jobs, slow-growth recovery," said Leon E. Pan etta, the White House's budget director. "It should be obvious that the recovery needs a significant boost. Unfortunately, a minority of the Senate is still standing in the way."
 
 
Political Risk
 While Administration officials argued that the poor first-quarter performance would make it harder for Republicans to oppose a revised jobs package, sluggish growth could spell serious trouble for Mr. Clinton in the longer term. He won the White House with a promise to revive the flagging economy, and the success of his Administration could hinge on whether he delivers.
A few more dismal periods like the first quarter and Americans may conclude that Mr. Clinton is no better at managing the economy than was President Bush, who lost in November largely because he presided over years of anemic growth.
Republicans were quick to place blame for the sluggish first quarter at Mr. Clinton's doorstep, saying his various proposals to raise taxes caused consumers and companies to cut spending.
"The American people are grading the President with their pocketbooks," said Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader.
Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, said, "What these figures reflect is that people who are going to spend money, whether individuals or companies, are scared of the mammoth new taxes that have been proposed."
 
 
Reviving a Jobs Bill
 After cutting through the political rhetoric, one thing seemed clear: the disappointing numbers make it more likely that Mr. Clinton will put forward a revised emergency jobs bill, albeit a smaller one. Administration officials and Congressional Democrats said such a package would probably include more money for summer jobs and for roads and other public works.
"I think he's going to push for something on jobs," said James Carville, a political adviser to the President. "He would have pushed regardless, but today's numbers will only strengthen his pre-existing resolve."
With today's numbers, Administration officials renewed their argument that it is vital to speed up growth to make it easier for the nation to withstand the pain of deficit reduction. They said the economy was like a patient who needed to be strengthened before going under the scalpel.
"We have said all along that we're not satisfied with the state of the economy, and we shouldn't play politics or take risks with the recovery," said Gene Sperling, the President's deputy assistant for economic policy. "This greatly confirms the President's argument that it makes sense to take out some insurance against a future decline and give the economy a little bounce to get job creation going."
 
View of Many Economists
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said that in light of the torpid quarter, she did not anticipate "a significant reduction" in the jobless rate. In the view of many economists, growth must be at least 2.5 percent for unemployment to start falling.
Many economists also believe that lower interest rates -- one result of deficit reduction -- are more effective at creating jobs than Government stimulus. And Administration officials noted that the recent drop in interest rates helped to produce the jumps in capital investment and new home sales announced today.
But if the economy continues to slither along over the next few months, economists said, it might become more difficult for members of Congress to vote in favor of painful measures to cut the deficit.
Ms. Tyson, for one, was optimistic that lawmakers would not flinch at deficit reduction. "I don't see why one quarter of weaker growth would undermine that commitment," she said.
 The Administration denied responsibility for the sharp drop in growth, from 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter. They made the intriguing argument that Mr. Clinton was partly responsible for the fourth-quarter surge, but blameless for the first quarter.
Growth in the fourth quarter was strong, they argued, because consumers felt a burst of confidence as a result of Mr. Clinton's victory. One aide called it a "charisma-led Christmas shopping spree." It was only natural, they explained, that consumers would spend less in the first quarter because their fourth-quarter spending rose far faster than their take-home pay.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fell Last Week

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to 349,000 from a revised 356,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said today.
Economists, who had been expecting a higher number of claims, said the figures suggested strengthening in the labor market. The 356,000 claims for the week that ended on April 17 were revised downward from the 359,000 reported initially. 
 The four-week average of new claims fell to 352,500 from 360,000 the previous week, the department said. Economists usually focus on the average as a more accurate barometer of the labor market than the more volatile weekly figure. At the start of April, the four-week average for new jobless claims stood at 363,250.
Two states reported increases in claims of more than 1,000 in the week that ended on April 17, the latest period for which these data are available. They were New York with 2,653 and North Carolina with 1,844.
Among the 11 states with decreases of 1,000 or more were Pennyslvania with 4,665, Alabama, 3,149, California, 3,067, Florida, 2,506, Missouri, 2,347 and Oregon, 1,475.

Treasury Notes and Bonds Move Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury bonds and notes rose yesterday as the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the first quarter of the year.
The price of the 30-year bond was up 13/32 , to 1044/32 , as the yield dropped to 6.88 percent, from 6.91 percent Wednesday. The rally was sharper among shorter maturities. For example, the new 3.875 percent two-year note, which was auctioned Tuesday, was up 5/32 as the yield dropped to 3.78 percent, down from 3.86 percent Wednesday and the 3.88 percent at which the note was auctioned. 
 The new 5.125 percent five-year note, which was auctioned Wednesday, also rallied, indicating that the dealers who bought the notes this week forced the price down and the yield up enough before the auction to assure themselves a decent profit. The yield on the five-year note fell to 5.08 percent yesterday, from 5.18 percent, as the price rose 10/32 .
While the report on the pace of growth in the first three months of the year was the main news, traders and investors were presented with an assortment of contradictory economic signals, which seem to summarize the uncertainty about the course of the economy at present. So the rise in prices may have also been a response to the fact that the market was on a downtrend for the last seven trading days.
In addition, the fact that the two monthly Treasury note auctions were over helped lift the market.
The nation's gross domestic product grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, which was down from the 4.7 percent pace of the last quarter of 1992 and below the consensus forecast, which was around 2.5 percent.
 
Rise in Rate of Inflation
 But in the same report, the Government reported that the rate of inflation rose in the beginning of 1993, with one measure rising to 3.3 percent from 2.3 percent in the first quarter.
"I was surprised that the market was higher on that" inflation news, one bond trader said.
But the performance of the market did show that traders and investors focused on the slow growth rather than inflation. This was reflected in the performance of shorter-term maturities, like the two-year note, which outperformed Treasury bonds. With yields on shorter maturities falling more than the yield on the 30-year bond, the spread between the yield on two-year notes and 30-year bonds widened. Yesterday, the spread rose to 310 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, up from 305 basis points the day before.
If the market had been more concerned about inflation, this spread between long and short yields, which is the yield curve, could also have steepened. But the widening of the spread would have been caused by an increase in the yield on the 30-year bond while shorter-term rates held steady or moved up much less. But yesterday, the curve became steeper, with the short rates falling in response to slow growth and bond yileds rising, but much less.
Some analysts said that the slow growth in the first quarter would put new pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy. And the Clinton Administration said the report showed the need for its economic stimulus program, which Republicans in the Senate have blocked.
But Richard B. Hoey, the chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation, said that the G.D.P. data did not indicate that the economy was growing too slowly. "The front line numbers don't support a new recession; they don't support a strong recovery," he said. "They are consistent with a kind of neutral bond market."
Adding to the mixed economic news was a surprisingly strong jump of 4.8 percent in new-home sales in March and a drop of 7,000 to 349.000 in the latest week's report on initial jobless claims.
As the week ends the focus will turn to the two important announcements next week. One, on Wedensday, is the details of the Treasury's quarterly auction. Traders are waiting anxiously to see if and how much the Treasury will reduce the size of the 30-year auction. On Friday, the Labor Department will issue the April employment report, which will be the first indicaiton of whether the slowdown of growth in March is continuing or just weather related.
"The issue is are we coming back to growth from the March level or not," said Alan Levenson, money market economist at UBS Securities.
Following are the results of the Treasury auction of one-year bills yesterday:

Silver Nears 2-Year High, Aided by Commodity Funds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Silver prices climbed to their highest level in almost two years yesterday as the recent rise in precious-metals prices attracted more buying by commodity funds.
Silver for July delivery climbed for the sixth consecutive session on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gaining 17.2 cents, to $4.38 an ounce. The metal has gained 40 cents this week. 
 Gold prices have soared about $17 an ounce in the last two weeks, as some investors have seen greater returns from gold than stocks and bonds.
Metals prices "just roared on the opening" and continued rising amid buying by almost every large commodity fund, said Jim Steel, vice president of research at Refco in New York. Commodity fund managers study price and volume charts to invest pools of money.
 
'A Train at Full Speed'
 The increase in silver prices occurred despite lower-than-expected United States economic growth. The Commerce Department said yesterday that the economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter. Demand for silver, an industrial metal, typically grows as economies expand.
"Right now it's a train at full speed and there's very little in the way to stop it," said Peter Cardillo, research director for Westfalia Investments in New York.
Gold prices were helped by signs that Russian production is declining. Russian gold production fell 12 metric tons, to 129.50 metric tons, in 1992. Gold for June delivery climbed $3 on the Comex, to $357.40.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for July delivery surged $8.70, to $390.40 an ounce, the highest price since last summer.
Also on the Merc, energy prices jumped. Light sweet crude oil for June delivery rose 39 cents, to $20.58 a barrel; May heating oil climbed 0.82 cent, to 55.96 cents a gallon; May unleaded gasoline surged 1.35 cents, to 60.97 cents a gallon, and June natural gas rose 1.8 cents, to $2.372 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A mainstream ad agency sees its youth in an upstart New York shop and invests in it.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AS Kirshenbaum & Bond evolves from an upstart agency into a mainstream agency, the onetime brat pack shop has begun emulating older, larger rivals. It has gained national accounts and produced advertising that is more substantive -- sometimes even sedate -- than its defiantly provocative earlier work. Now the owners of the six-year-old agency are doing something else their established competitors do all the time: making an acquisition.
Richard Kirshenbaum, a partner and executive creative director, and Jonathan Bond, a partner and president, said yesterday that they had invested a "very significant" sum in Mad Dogs & Englishmen Inc., a small New York agency that opened in July 1991. 
 "Mad Dogs & Englishmen is the agency most like us five years ago," Mr. Kirshenbaum said in an interview over breakfast in midtown Manhattan. In other words, one of the brat pack of the 1980's now has a stake in one of the brat pack of the 1990's.
Mr. Bond, who joined Mr. Kirshenbaum and Robin Danielson, president at Mad Dogs, for the interview, said: "It's as if we invested in I.B.M. But we think they're a better bet than the stock market."
The decision to invest in Mad Dogs grew out of the realization by Mr. Bond, 35, and Mr. Kirshenbaum, 31, that they were frequently recommending the smaller agency to potential clients whose accounts they themselves could not take on for reasons like size or conflict issues.
"Jon and I kept referring accounts to Nick," Mr. Kirshenbaum said, referring to Nick Cohen, creative director at Mad Dogs. "One day, we just all sort of arrived at the same idea at the same time: 'Why don't we finalize this a little more?' "
"We feel we have this knowledge about how to build a successful agency," he added. "We could either write a book about it or help somebody else. And we're probably going to do both."
And last fall, when Michael Geach, who had founded Mad Dogs with Mr. Cohen, left the agency, Mr. Bond introduced Mr. Cohen to Ms. Danielson.
Occasionally, the two shops even found themselves competing, as in the recent pitch for the Paul Stuart retail clothier account. Mr. Bond said that Kirshenbaum & Bond had bested Mad Dogs for the account and would keep it.
Ms. Danielson, 30, observed ruefully: "It's like the 11-year-old brother wrestling with the 7-year-old brother."
But Mr. Bond and Mr. Kirshenbaum promise that they will learn to share. Indeed, they said, they recommended to one longtime client, Kenneth Cole, the footwear manufacturer and retailer, that he award Mad Dogs the account for Unlisted, a new lower-priced line of footwear aimed at women in their 20's. Mr. Cole agreed, and Mad Dogs will create television commercials for Unlisted, to run in major markets in late summer or early fall.
Unlisted's billings are estimated at $1 million, an impressive sum for an agency with current billings of $3 million -- from clients like The Village Voice and The Economist -- and with a staff of nine (not including Mr. Cohen's three dogs, which freely roam the Mad Dogs office). By comparison, Kirshenbaum & Bond has billings of $105 million and 96 employees (and no pets).
All three executives said that the investment would not affect either agency's account or executive rosters, adding that Mr. Bond and Mr. Kirshenbaum would serve as "investor-advisers" to Mad Dogs.
"The only thing this changes," Ms. Danielson said, "is that it allows us to be a little less desperate."
And all three agreed that the investment should have no impact on the agencies' contrasting corporate cultures, which Mr. Kirshenbaum described this way: "They want to save the world, and we want to conquer the world." Ms. Danielson said that it was more like "the hippie chick dating the bad boy in high school."
To emphasize the arm's-length relationship that Mr. Kirshenbaum and Mr. Bond hope to maintain between the two agencies, to minimize the potential for conflicts, they said they had invested their own personal funds in Mad Dogs, rather than agency funds.
Mr. Bond and Mr. Kirshenbaum have begun entering the mainstream of their industry in other ways as well. Mr. Bond has joined the Eastern region board of directors of the American Association of Advertising Agencies and his hair has started turning gray. And Mr. Kirshenbaum's famously unkempt long hair is stylishly shorter.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Plunges Against Yen On Group of Seven Inaction

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen yesterday amid reports that the world's richest nations failed to take an aggressive stance against further sharp rises in the yen.
In recent days, the currency markets have begun to expect that the Group of Seven industrial nations -- meeting in Washington yesterday to discuss ways to spur world growth -- would come down hard on the yen's rise of 12 percent this year. However, afternoon news reports said the nations planned no such action. 
 The dollar's fall began early in the New York session, when the Government released the weaker-than-expected statistics on gross domestic product showing the economy grew at a lackluster 1.8 percent annual pace during the first quarter.
 
'Plain Vanilla' Communique
 After sinking to 1.5690 German marks, the dollar managed to recover most of its losses in heavy cross-trading, in which participants sold marks and bought yen. But the recovery lost steam. By midafternoon, news reports circulated that the Group of Seven nations planned to issue "a very plain vanilla joint communique," said Marc Chandler, senior market strategist at IDEA in New York.
The draft version signaled only modest support for stemming the yen's appreciation, Mr. Chandler said.
"The rumor is that the communique is more neutral, not as supportive as the market was hoping to get," said Mike Casey, an international economist with Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 110.95 yen, down from 112.12 yen late Wednesday afternoon. Financial markets were closed yesterday in Japan for Greenery Day, a national holiday.
The Group of Seven statement, issued after most trading in New York had ended, repeated Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's comments that "excessive volatility is undesirable" in the currency markets.
To guard against rapid changes in the relationships of their currencies, the finance officials pledged "our continued commitment to close cooperation in exchange markets."
The British pound continued to slip. In London, sterling fell to $1.5715, from $1.5720 late Wednesday. By 4 P.M. in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.5725, less than late Wednesday's $1.5730.

Forecast Remains Cloudy For the Newspaper Industry

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 29

 BODY:
The top executives of major newspaper publishing companies told securities analysts here that the worst days of the recession appear to be ending for newspapers. But good times are still not here for the industry.
In a series of presentations this week on the financial picture at major newspaper companies, the publishing executives reported that some categories of advertising were beginning to show signs of health after several years of deterioration. Classified advertising, often an early signal of increased economic activity, is returning with exceptional strength.
 
Activity Remains Spotty
 But in general, some of the executives expressed frustration that much of their advertising business remained much more spotty than was typical during an economic recovery. 
 "Spring has definitely arrived but it has not blossomed into summer," said P. Anthony Ridder, president of Knight-Ridder's newspaper division.
John W. Madigan, president of the newspaper division of the Tribune Company, said advertising revenues were beginning to look "quite promising," especially in newspaper classified columns.
And John J. Curley, chairman of the Gannett Company, said his company's newspapers were starting to see a recovery of retail advertising, which had been especially scarce for several years. "The recovery for us -- at least in the markets we're in -- is real," Mr. Curley said.
 The newspaper executives spoke at a three-day forum for securities analysts sponsored by John E. Morton, an analyst at Lynch Jones & Ryan.
The executives said many types of display advertising remain stalled. The executives of some major city newspapers, including The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, said that the still-troubled economies of their cities were hurting their newspapers' financial performance.
"The Los Angeles economy remains a serious question for The Times," said Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive of the Times Mirror Company, which publishes The Los Angeles Times.
Lance R. Primis, president of The New York Times Company, said the pace of the New York City economy continued to hurt The Times. In the first financial quarter, The Times reported that advertising linage was down 4.8 percent compared with the corresponding period last year. But Mr. Primis said advertising trends appeared to be improving.
 
Exploring Other Ventures
 The business climate, some of the executives said, means that major newspaper corporations, like many smaller counterparts, are continuing to explore methods of enhancing their revenues with non-newspaper ventures, such as telephone audiotext systems and fax services.
Many new ventures are important, the executives said, as newspaper companies try to position themselves to take advantage of technological changes expected to change communications sharply.
Mr. Ridder of Knight-Ridder, which owns The Miami Herald among other newspapers, said such new ventures were important because "the information highway of the future" was being invented now. "Our responsibility," he said, "is to be ready to travel on that highway through whatever mode makes sense."

The Chicano Experience, in Its Glory and Tedium

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
"Bound by Honor," Taylor Hackford's ambitious melodrama about the Chicano experience in and around East Los Angeles, is like one of those huge wall murals that give bold, defiant color to an urban landscape that otherwise looks passive and drab. The film is big and long (nearly three hours), passionate and flat. It's full of heroic and tragic incident, but skimpy about the details of quotidian lives. Though it's not the epic it means to be, it is not a failure.
"Bound by Honor" is the story of 12 crucial years in the formation of three young men: Paco (Benjamin Bratt), who seems to have been born angry; his half-brother, Cruz (Jesse Borrego), who has the talent and temperament of an artist, and Paco's cousin Miklo (Damian Chapa), whose father is Anglo and mother is Mexican-American, a fact that determines the direction of his life. 
 With his light skin, sandy hair and blue eyes, Miklo grows up always having to certify his claim to be a member of the macho Chicano brotherhood. Of the three young men, he becomes the most furious and fanatical, the one with the most obsessed vision. Paco, a seeming loose cannon with a hair-trigger temper, goes through an off-screen conversion of character while serving a hitch in the United States Marines. By the middle of the film, he is a police detective and, it seems, a good one, patiently negotiating his way between his own minority culture and that of the dominant white society. Cruz's early success as a painter is nearly wrecked by his addiction to drugs.
This is the barest outline of the screenplay, which was written by Jimmy Santiago Baca, the New Mexico-born poet, after earlier versions had been written by Floyd Mutrux and then by Jeremy Iacone, from a story by Ross Thomas. The film's title was not idly chosen. "Bound by Honor" is almost exclusively concerned with each of the three friends' sense of his own identity in a perilous environment in which the hostile forces are whites, blacks and other Chicanos.
The initial impulse is to compare "Bound by Honor" to Luchino Visconti's epic "Rocco and His Brothers." Yet "Bound by Honor" is no great family saga set in a time of overwhelming social, political and economic change. "Bound by Honor" is an action melodrama with a social conscience.
Miklo, Paco and Cruz are characters whose rich potential is severely limited by the circumstances in which their stories are played out: gang fights and beatings, car chases and shootouts, sit-downs and reconciliations, in East Los Angeles and in San Quentin prison, where Miklo effectively grows up. Much of the film is riveting, especially the San Quentin sequences actually shot inside the prison. "Bound by Honor" takes on real heft as it follows Miklo's cool, brutal rise through the prison's Chicano power structure to become a figure of dark political importance.
Yet a lot is missing. Miklo, Paco and Cruz are defined almost entirely in the terms in which they choose to present themselves to their peers. They are all swagger, intimidation and attitude. It's as if they had no private moments, to say nothing of private lives.
With the exception of a sequence involving the accidental death of Paco's and Cruz's younger brother, the film pays little attention to their families. The movie sees virtually nothing of how these Chicanos earn their livings, eat, sleep and make love. Only Cruz is seen to have a girlfriend, and then only briefly. Paco and Miklo would appear to be celibate. "Bound by Honor" presents their lives as an unending succession of moments of high melodrama.
If there were a greater urgency to the melodrama, the mind might not have time to wander, and to wonder about everything that is not seen. The movie's narrative is full of twists and turns, some of which remain undramatized (like Paco's reformation), without gathering momentum until near the end. Even the film's time frame seems arbitrary.
The story begins in 1972. Succeeding sequences are identified as taking place in 1973, 1980, 1983 and 1984. The significance of these dates remains unexplained, either by the film or by anything the moviegoer can bring to it. A lot was going on outside East Los Angeles and San Quentin in that period. Yet nothing the audience sees in the film has any particular relation to the end of the Vietnam War, the collapse of the Nixon era or the beginning of the Reagan years. If this is the film's point, it's an unilluminating one.
Mr. Hackford has cast the film well. Though they must play at a fever pitch most of the time, Mr. Chapa, Mr. Bratt and Mr. Borrego are excellent, as are the members of the large supporting cast, notably Enrique Castillo, who appears as the leader of San Quentin's Chicanos, and Lanny Flaherty, as the San Quentin con who makes an unfortunate bargain with Miklo.
"Bound by Honor" looks and sounds authentic but, like many community wall paintings, it has the manner less of one artist's vision than of a community endeavor. This may explain its singular shortcomings and its redeeming sincerity.
"Bound by Honor" has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of vulgar language and scenes of physical and psychological violence.

HEADLINE: Topics of The Times;
A Piece of the Wall

 BODY:
The world, according to T. S. Eliot, ends not with a bang but a whimper. The Soviet empire, it seems, ends in New Jersey.
In Fort Lee last Sunday, the 10 last large pieces of the Berlin wall were put up for auction at a motel. The 12-foot-high cement slabs, weighing two tons each, were still in Germany. But they were described in a brochure, completely without irony, as being the perfect way to "decorate the entrance hall of your corporate headquarters, museum, or estate." (One can only imagine what Nikita Khrushchev might have thought of his "bulwark against capitalism" ending up as a piece of corporate sculpture for, say, a dress manufacturer in Greenwich, Conn.) 
 Surprisingly, only three people showed up to bid. And just after noon, with a wave of the auctioneer's hand, one of the darkest symbols of Communism was dispatched in one of the greatest traditions of a free economy. The market dictated the price. All 10 panels were sold to an anonymous German businessman, for $5,000 each.
In 1924 Lenin allegedly wrote, "Capitalists are so hungry for profits that they will sell us the rope with which to hang them." It didn't quite work out that way.

HEADLINE: Those 'Pork-Barrel' Projects Help People

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Mr. Dole's Selfish Strut" (editorial, April 23) asserts "it's important to look behind the headlines" that congratulate Republican senators on their brilliant defeat of the President's jobs-stimulus plan. You should have done so yourself before writing that "by including $2.5 billion of pork-barrel projects in its stimulus package, the Clinton team handed Mr. Dole a weapon."
The "weapon" is the request for $2.5 billion for the Community Development Block Grant, a 20-year-old program created by the Nixon Administration to provide decent housing, a suitable living environment and economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income Americans. 
 The Senate opponents of the President's plan got a lot of mileage out of their attacks on isolated community development projects: pool renovation, basketball court resurfacing, shopping-center expansion, recreation center construction. Labeled "pork," these projects came from our survey identifying job-creating projects that could be completed quickly if Federal jobs-stimulus financing became available. They were drawn from 4,400 suggested projects that were estimated to generate more than 200,000 jobs in 1993.
No one bothered to learn that the "pork" swimming pool may be the only summer recreation in a poor neighborhood; that the "pork" gym may offer young people the only alternative to neighborhood gangs. No one checked to see that the projects were not representative of the thousands suggested by the cities.
The Community Development Block Grants program should be singled out for praise in any debate on job creation and economic recovery for America and hope for the people of its cities.
