BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush recalled the helicopter tour of the West Bank given him by Ariel Sharon three years ago. The Israeli prime minister, who knows every ridge and wadi of Judea and Samaria, smiled ruefully and said that such a low-flying tour was not possible these days because the chopper would be vulnerable to Palestinian fire.
 The way to suppress such guerrilla gunfire was clear in the White House visitor's mind: Begin negotiations only when Yasir Arafat realizes that violence no longer pays. When the Palestinian leader publicly and privately takes action to turn off terror, Israel's economic retaliation will end, allowing an interim state of nonbelligerency to be negotiated. 
 Apparently Bush understands Sharon's requirement for "quiet" before talks begin. It would be foolish to transfer tax revenues to Palestinian buyers of rockets and mortar shells. In early April, the U.S. president will welcome Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah to the White House, showing he is open to ideas from peaceful Arabs, but he has pointedly not invited Arafat.
That's because nobody should be allowed to shoot his way into the White House. An invitation should be an incentive. After Arafat decides to order his well-armed Force 17 to cease firing on Israelis, and after he re-jails Hamas bombers and publicly calls on his followers to stop the war, that will be the time for a visit. 
Another incentive for stopping the violence would be to show Arafat that a policy of killing has consequences. Bush told reporters, "During the campaign I said we'll begin the process of moving our embassy to Jerusalem." (His words last May were, "As soon as I take office, I will begin the process of moving the U.S. ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital.") Secretary of State Powell reiterated that to Congress two weeks ago: "President Bush is committed to moving our embassy to Jerusalem. The process is ongoing. We have not started any actions yet." 
So? Bush has taken office; when does the "ongoing" process go on? The message would be unmistakable: The U.S. recognizes that Israel's capital is Jerusalem. If Israel one day negotiates away a portion of the city to be a Palestinian capital, the U.S. will build an embassy there, too. In the meantime, the insult to Israel's sovereign right to choose its capital should end.
Sharon did not press this point. Nor did he come to Washington with what Golda Meir used to call a shopping basket, seeking aid. On the contrary, the most significant discussions that took place were those least publicly discussed: strategic military cooperation on missile defense.
Israeli technicians with U.S. financing have for years been developing the Arrow antimissile missile. It is a generation beyond the gulf war's souped-up Patriots. At nine times the speed of sound, the Arrow is designed to seek an incoming missile in mid-course phase, which can be over 100,000 feet. I'm told it has had some successful tests in the past two years on dummy missiles. 
Without the most sophisticated guidance system, its results would be hit-or-miss. But Israel's Arrow may one day be coupled with our Aegis phased-array radar missile-tracking systems aboard U.S. naval vessels in the eastern Mediterranean. An Arrow-Aegis system jointly operated by the U.S. and Israel could counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction now being built in Iraq and Iran with aid from Russia and North Korea.
Neither Sharon nor Bush is fixated on the Palestinian problem to the exclusion of other fronts in the Middle East. When Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France arrives here next week, Bush should send this message to President Jacques Chirac in newly Socialist Paris: How about reasserting France's traditional interest in Lebanon?
Syria now occupies that once-independent nation, hosting Iran's Hezbollah terrorists. Five years ago, Chirac told Beirut, "The Lebanese Army and internal security forces must, following total Israeli withdrawal, be the only guarantors of the State's authority," enabling Syrian forces to withdraw.
Israel is out; why isn't Chirac's France enlisting European allies to enforce U.N. Resolution 425, freeing Lebanon from Syrian occupation? That would strike a blow against regional terror.
With new leaders, Israel and the U.S. have disenthralled themselves. Time to think anew and act anew.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Slide Further as Dow Nears Bear Market Territory

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday, with losses spreading to sectors that often thrive alongside a reviving economy, taking the Dow Jones industrial average to its lowest point in more than two years.
 The stock market's latest stumble came after a sharp and broad decline on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve acted less aggressively in its effort to resuscitate the economy than some investors had hoped. The central bank lowered short-term interest rates by half a percentage point, leading to selling by investors who had bid up technology stocks in hopes of a three-quarter-point cut. 
 Cyclical stocks, which are usually among the first to rise when the Fed stimulates borrowing and spending, took heavy losses yesterday. But so did food and drug stocks, which investors often add to their portfolios to weather an economic storm. 
"The market is still trying to come to grips with, short term at least, what they wanted Greenspan to do," said John C. Forelli, an institutional money manager for Independence Investment Associates, referring to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
The Dow industrials fell 233.76, or 2.4 percent, to 9,487.00, its lowest close since March 4, 1999. The Dow is now 19.1 percent below its closing high of 11,722.98 on Jan. 14, 2000, and is just 108.62 points shy of joining the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index in bear market territory.
In general, technology stocks fell by a smaller percentage, but the day's trading was volatile. The technology-weighted Nasdaq fell 27.21 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,830.23. Losses by technology stocks weighed on the S.& P. 500, which fell 20.48, or 1.8 percent, to 1,122.14.
New evidence appeared yesterday that investors were disenchanted by the markets or were unwilling to commit themselves to stocks. Mutual fund investors removed $11.4 billion from equity funds in February, transferring the bulk to money market accounts, according to Lipper Inc., a mutual fund industry research firm. It was the first net decrease in stock fund assets that the firm has recorded since August 1998, but it came after an increase of $140 billion in January.
The investors who remained in stocks, meanwhile, were becoming increasingly concerned about the prospects for corporate earnings as the economy cools.
"I think everybody is just confused," said Ned Collins, head trader at Daiwa Securities America. "I do believe that earnings are going to be the key factor."
Investors who had once hoped slumping earnings would be confined to the technology sector now seem less assured. Caterpillar fell $1.69, to $42.18; International Paper dropped $1.83, to $35.53; and Alcoa fell $1.64, to $34.64. Pharmaceutical and food stocks, often bought as a shelter from an economic storm, also declined. Coca-Cola fell $2.18, to $45.25, and Johnson & Johnson fell $3.57, to $87.23.
Biotechnology stocks helped lead the decline in the technology sector. Amgen fell $5.88, to $55.44; Idec Pharmaceuticals lost $7.06, to $42.06, and Biogen dropped $3.44, to $56.88.
Based on price-to-earnings ratios, however, many technology stocks are becoming fairly valued on a historical basis for the first time in three years, in Mr. Forelli's view.
"The question is if you can believe the earnings," he said. It was a question investors seemed to be asking themselves about many other sectors as well.
 --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
 (By Reuters) -- Bond prices fell yesterday along with stocks after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates less than investors hoped on Tuesday.
John Canavan, an analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., said investors continued to hold interest-rate-sensitive short-term securities rather than long-term issues after the Fed suggested in its post-meeting statement that it was poised to cut interest rates before its next scheduled meeting on May 15, if necessary.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32, to 101 26/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.77 percent from 4.75 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond fell 6/32, to 101 16/32. Its yield rose to 5.27 percent from 5.26 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Giuliani, Citing Economy, Seeks Cuts in Agency Budgets 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Citing the slowdown in the national economy, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he had instructed city agencies to prepare to cut spending over the next 15 months by as much as $500 million, a belt-tightening he said might prove unnecessary but was prudent given Wall Street's recent troubles.
 The budget cut requests -- generally 2 percent in the current fiscal year and 6 percent for the 2002 fiscal year, which starts July 1 -- have been sent out to all city agencies, the mayor said. But the reductions, if they went into effect, would not be across the board, the mayor said, hinting already that his traditionally well-treated Police Department, among other agencies, might be largely spared. 
 "The art of governing is making choices," Mr. Giuliani said. "Public safety may be more important than something else." 
The mayor said he was confident the city could handle any cuts without significantly curtailing services. But the announcement -- the letter requesting the cuts actually went out a month ago -- drew an immediate rebuke yesterday from City Council officials, who said it might be little more than an effort by the mayor to increase pressure on unions to settle contract talks for less money.
"Political huffing and puffing has begun," Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said through a spokesman.
To date, despite the plunge in the financial markets and the wave of layoffs nationwide, the most recent available data suggest that the city economy continues to grow, with 17,100 private jobs reportedly added in January and an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, the lowest since 1988. City tax revenues through February were $127 million ahead of the mayor's latest projection, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said yesterday.
But about a sixth of city tax revenues are generated by Wall Street firms and other financial institutions, many of which are off to a bad year. Mr. Giuliani cautioned yesterday that there was no reason for alarm. The city now projects to reach the end of this fiscal year, June 30, with a $2.3 billion surplus in its $39.67 billion budget. The administration, he said, is just trying to anticipate any major downturn.
"You always prepare for the worst and hope for the best, and I think probably that is the way it is going to work out," the mayor said.
Mayor Giuliani has already proposed a $39.32 billion budget for the 2002 fiscal year, which includes many cuts to agencies that manage city parks, libraries and programs for the elderly and to city museums, among other areas. When he released this plan in January, the mayor said that these cuts -- many of which he proposes each year -- were little more than bargaining chips to discourage the City Council from trying to expand spending. 
If that first round of cuts were combined with the new reductions he has requested, the impact could be severe. For the Brooklyn Public Library, for example, $8.2 million was slated to be cut as part of Mr. Giuliani's January budget plan; if an additional 6 percent reduction is to be found, the library will lose $3.6 million more, meaning a total reduction of 17 percent in its $68.6 million city appropriation. Brooklyn library officials said that total cut would force 59 of its branches to reduce their schedules from mostly six days a week to four. 
"The Council will ensure that vital city services will be protected," Mr. Vallone said.
Council officials said they expected that before any major service reductions were considered, the mayor would trim back the $401 million in tax cuts he had proposed in the 2002 budget, including the elimination of the city's sales tax on clothing, costing $181 million.
The mayor said he had no plans for now to modify his tax cut plan. But negotiations with the Council over the 2002 budget will not formally begin until April, after the mayor releases a more final spending plan.

HEADLINE: Court Says Employers Can Require Arbitration of Disputes 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court handed employers a major victory today by ruling that companies can insist that workplace disputes go to arbitration rather than to court.
 The 5-to-4 decision resolved a disagreement among the lower federal courts about the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act, a 76-year-old law that makes arbitration agreements enforceable in federal court. 
 While the law indisputably applied to a wide variety of commercial disputes, the disagreement, based on an awkwardly worded exemption for at least certain workers, was over whether it covered employment contracts.
Reading the exemption narrowly, the majority said today that Congress intended to exempt only transportation workers from the law's reach. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. 
Encouraged by earlier Supreme Court decisions treating arbitration favorably, employers are increasingly requiring workers to agree in advance to take any employment-related dispute to binding arbitration as a way of avoiding costly and prolonged litigation.
But while siding with a majority of the lower courts on the overall scope of the arbitration law, the court left unresolved some important questions about what rights workers might retain under other federal laws, like the major antidiscrimination laws that guarantee the right to punitive damages and legal fees. Many arbitration agreements cap damages at lower levels and do not guarantee that employees who prevail can recover their costs. It is also unclear whether arbitration agreements can preclude class actions.
Quoting language from an earlier arbitration case, Justice Kennedy said that under arbitration, a party gives up a judicial forum but "does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute." 
One arbitration specialist, David Gibbs, a lawyer in Boston who advises corporate clients on setting up alternative dispute resolution systems, said today that there were dozens of cases in the lower courts addressing the elements that make up a fair arbitration program. The trend in the lower courts has been to ensure that workers receive the remedies available under federal law.
The case today began in 1997 as a discrimination suit under California law by a salesman for Circuit City Stores. Circuit City tried to enforce its standard arbitration agreement, which the salesman, St. Clair Adams, signed when he was hired two years earlier. The agreement made all "disputes or controversies" relating to employment at Circuit City subject to final, binding arbitration.
On the basis of that agreement, the Federal District Court in San Francisco barred Mr. Adams's lawsuit. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, also in San Francisco, ruled that the agreement was not enforceable because the Federal Arbitration Act did not apply to employment contracts. With the Ninth Circuit being the biggest of the federal circuits, covering nine Western states, the decision alarmed the business community. Every other appeals court to have considered the question had found the arbitration act to apply to employment.
The linguistic difficulty with the law came from an exemption clause providing that the statute did not apply "to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce." What categories of employees was Congress excluding from federally enforced mandatory arbitration?
To the judges of the Ninth Circuit, the most natural reading was that Congress meant to exclude all employment contracts, particularly in light of the legislative history that showed that Congress was interested in making commercial contracts subject to arbitration as quickly as possible by assuaging the concerns of organized labor over bringing any employment contracts under the new law.
Under the Supreme Court's precedents at the time, Congress's jurisdiction over the economy was extremely narrow, so the exclusion referred only to those categories of employment over which Congress indisputably had jurisdiction.
The other federal appeals courts, however, had read the exclusion narrowly to apply, today as in 1925, only to workers in the transportation industries. That was the correct interpretation, Justice Kennedy said today, because to give a more elastic meaning to the phrase "engaged in foreign or interstate commerce" would be to "bring instability to statutory interpretation." Consequently, the exemption applies only to "contracts of employment of transportation workers," Justice Kennedy said.
That conclusion in itself opened new questions for resolution in future cases. How should courts define transportation workers -- for example, a ticket agent for an airline? A delivery truck driver for Circuit City?
In a dissenting opinion, Justice David H. Souter said the court was "imputing something very odd to the working of the Congressional brain" by concluding that Congress excluded coverage of "the class of employment contracts it most obviously had authority to legislate about in 1925" while extending the law to a much larger category of employees over whom federal jurisdiction was then highly uncertain.
"It would seem to have made more sense either to cover all coverable employment contracts or to exclude them all," Justice Souter said, noting that Congress might well have made the policy judgment that "arbitration could prove expensive or unfavorable to employees, many of whom lack the bargaining power to resist an arbitration clause if their prospective employers insist on one."
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a more sharply worded dissent. By its "refusal to look beyond the raw statutory text," he said, the court "misuses its authority." Justice Stevens added: "A method of statutory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed, and hence unconstrained, may produce a result that is consistent with a court's own views of how things should be, but it may also defeat the very purpose for which a provision was enacted."
The other two dissenting justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, signed both of the dissenting opinions.
Among the questions left open by the decision, Circuit City Stores v. Adams, No. 99-1379, was what role remains for federal administrative agencies, like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in pursuing enforcement actions on behalf of employees who are covered by arbitration agreements.
The court will decide shortly whether to hear an appeal by the E.E.O.C. from a decision by the federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., that it could not seek relief like backpay, damages or reinstatement on behalf of workers covered by arbitration agreements. The agency is arguing in that case, E.E.O.C. v. Waffle House Inc., No. 99-1823, that it was not a party to the agreement and that in seeking relief on the part of individuals, it is vindicating important public rights.
In a second labor decision today, the court ruled 7 to 2 that a federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, pre-empts state law on the designation of beneficiaries of Erisa-covered pension plans. In this case, Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, No. 99-1529, a man who was recently divorced died without a will and without removing his wife's name as the beneficiary of his pension. Under Washington State law, the benefits would have gone to his children by an earlier marriage, but the court ruled today that the Erisa designation should prevail.

HEADLINE: BOLDFACE NAMES 

BYLINE:  By James Barron 

 BODY:
That's Pleather, With a P
 ROSIE O'DONNELL has agreed to say it isn't so. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals went to court demanding a retraction when she said that the Gap was selling leather that the animal-rights group approved of. Not so, said the group's president, INGRID E. NEWKIRK -- there is no such thing as "PETA-approved leather." 
 Ms. O'Donnell's comment came after the Gap chain promised to stop selling leather from India and China. That promise came, in turn, after Ms. Newkirk and the rock singer CHRISSIE HYNDE were arrested during a protest at a Gap store in Manhattan.
Yesterday, Ms. Newkirk said that PETA's $350,000 lawsuit against Ms. O'Donnell had been settled and that Ms. O'Donnell would read a 111-word clarification on her syndicated talk show. Ms. Newkirk said Ms. O'Donnell had been in on the writing. "She added a part in which she added she wears pleather pants on occasion," Ms. Newkirk said. Pleather is, after all, synthetic.

Off Camera, but in Surgery
On camera, LORRAINE BRACCO shoulders the burden of being Tony's psychotherapist on the HBO mob opera "The Sopranos." Off camera, her shoulder has been giving her trouble, and yesterday DR. STUART HERSHON, the team physician of the New York Yankees, operated on it at Beth Israel Medical Center's Singer Division, on the Upper East Side. Ms. Bracco went home by midafternoon and was doing fine, an HBO spokeswoman said. The operation will not keep Ms. Bracco away from the show: the last few scenes for this season's episodes were filmed last month.

Gore and Greenspan, in Tandem
Once again, AL GORE'S Wednesday class at Columbia University featured the kind of question-and-answer session that nonstudent reporters would have loved to be in on. The answerer was ALAN GREENSPAN, chairman of the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates half a percentage point when many investors had hoped for more.
Mr. Gore pre-empted Mr. Greenspan's answer to one question, according to a student quoted by Dow Jones. The question had to do with whether one could predict the turnaround speed of a recession-bound economy, and Mr. Gore gave the answer: if plotted on a fever chart, a recovery "could be a U, or it could be an L, like a hockey stick, or a V and, if the wrong choices are made, it could be a W."
Another student said that when Mr. Gore finished his by-the-letter explanation, he and Mr. Greenspan high-fived each other.

Watch the Screen, and Wince
There were two Kates (the actress KATE HUDSON, top right, and the magazine editor KATE BETTS) and a Stuart at a party for Ms. Hudson's new film, "About Adam." The Stuart -- STUART TOWNSEND, who plays Adam, a Lothario from Dublin -- hedged on whether he was a real-life Lothario from Dublin. He said something about how acting was about "getting to do something a little further removed from who you are." He said he wished he had been a little further removed from the pre-party screening of "About Adam." "Normally I go to the pub, but this time I decided to watch it," he said. "Bad news. I should have gone to the pub." Why? "I thought it was depressing. You always go, 'What was I doing? Sleepwalking?' "
So what will he say if he watches the film he just finished, "Queen of the Damned," the sequel to "Interview With a Vampire"? Playing the vampire Tom Cruise made famous, Mr. Townsend discovered his inner rock 'n' roller. "I did a gig for 3,000 people in the desert in Australia," he said, "and I realized that acting really wasn't half as much fun as getting on stage and prancing around."
But enough with these movies. Mr. Townsend recently co-starred in a London production of "Orpheus Descending" and wants to do more theater. "It's where you learn," he said. "All the rest is just money and chauffeurs."

HEADLINE: Iraqis Now Daring to Talk of Life After Hussein 

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 15 

 BODY:
On the eve of the gulf war 10 years ago, a Westerner visiting Baghdad could be sure of one constant in any conversation with an Iraqi -- obsequious praise of Saddam Hussein, Iraq's often merciless ruler.
 Usually, the phrases about "the Iraqi people's great leader, His Excellency Saddam Hussein," and the "glorious era" of his rule would have an edge of urgency, as if only an excessive display of loyalty could ward off the retribution Mr. Hussein has been known to exact for dissent, including summary executions of whole families. 
 But a visit to Iraq shows that even if little has altered in the way Mr. Hussein maintains control, something else has changed. 
Where once the verbal genuflecting would pour forth unprompted, it is now possible for a visitor to go days without anyone but the government "minder" who accompanies every visiting foreigner mentioning Mr. Hussein. More than that, growing numbers of Iraqis, seizing moments when the minders are distracted, are ready to take the risk of whispering their fear of the Iraqi ruler and the deep-seated hatred that they say he has engendered among this country's 23 million people.
Even more remarkable, officials at senior levels have begun to speak of a time when Mr. Hussein will no longer be the country's ruler, and even, in two interviews in the past 15 days, to allude to his eventual death.
Altogether, the changes could suggest that at 63 Mr. Hussein is seriously ill. A decade ago, for a foreigner even to hint that Mr. Hussein might be mortal was to court expulsion, and for an Iraqi official to do so was unknown. 
The first of the two senior officials to broach the subject of Mr. Hussein in interviews was Abdul-Karim al-Hashemi, a former higher education minister with a doctorate in geochemistry from Boston University who heads the Organization of Friendship, Peace and Solidarity, an agency that is a prominent part of Baghdad's machinery for greeting foreigners. At the start of the interview, he was asked what he thought Americans should know about the state of affairs in Iraq.
Almost immediately, he began a discourse about the durability of the Baghdad regime and how it was not solely reliant on its current leader.
"To this day, people in America and Britain do not know that Saddam Hussein is not heading a one-man show," he said. "They don't know that the system Saddam Hussein has put in place is operating, not deteriorating, and not only operating, but developing."
Ten days later, a more senior official, Human Abdul Khaliq al-Ghaffour, inquired about the reporter's personal experiences as a lymphoma patient, a decade ago, and asked whether his visitor's lymphoma, a form of cancer, had spread to his bone marrow, and whether he had undergone a bone marrow transplant. 
After arguing briefly that the United States should open a "dialogue" with Iraq, Mr. Khaliq then turned unprompted to the issue of Mr. Hussein's mortality. "We are proud of Saddam Hussein, of course, but we are realists," he said. "Even after years of his long life, and I hope that he will stay forever, we are human beings, we know that there is an end to life. But we have thousands of Saddam Husseins now, so we have nothing to fear, this is the reality."
Mr. Khaliq is regarded by Western intelligence as one of perhaps two dozen men who form an inner circle around Mr. Hussein. He has been information minister since 1997; before that, for 10 years until 1992, he was chairman of Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission and thus, according to Western intelligence reports, was deeply involved in Iraq's efforts to build nuclear weapons. Mr. Khaliq, 54, holds a doctorate in nuclear physics from London University.
Later, when Mr. Khaliq's remarks were passed along to other Iraqis, during moments of unmonitored conversation, several reacted with something approaching nonchalance, as if they had known that Mr. Hussein was not well. One man said his family had ties with the Iraqi leader going back nearly 20 years but that nobody in the family had seen him lately. He added: "But of course, he's sick. He's very sick. We know that."
Another man, a physician, said it was known that Mr. Hussein was ill, and that many Iraqis were commenting privately about the Iraqi ruler's seeming pallor and weight loss during recent appearances on television. But added, "If we talk of that, it's KALABOSH" -- an Arab word meaning handcuffs.
Rumors like these have surfaced before only to recede as the Iraqi ruler vigorously carried on. After talk five years ago that he had Hodgkin's disease, a form of lymphoma, Mr. Hussein appeared on television to boast that he was fit enough to swim the Tigris. Politically, too, he has seemed in many ways stronger than ever. 
In the face of the harsh economic sanctions against Iraq over the past decade, he has defied the Western world over his secret weapons arsenal, and Iraqis say, exiles assert, enriched himself, his family and his cronies from black market dealings while millions of his countrymen have fallen into destitution.
While blaming the West for Iraq's deepening poverty, he has continued building vast marble palaces in Baghdad and other cities.
More specific rumors circulating now mostly come from Arab-language newspapers published outside Iraq that rely heavily on exiled Iraqi opposition groups. Some say one of his palaces has been turned into a clinic, some say the younger of his two sons, Qusai, stands ready to take control. Earlier this month, the Washington Times carried a report that Mr. Hussein had informed his family and senior aides in December that he was dying, and said that that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell "is reputed to give this intelligence assessment credibility."
This welter of rumor has provoked widespread doubts. At Western embassies in the region, officials familiar with the most recent intelligence reports remain skeptical that the Iraqi leader is ill, telling reporters that they have no evidence to indicate that, and cautioning that the Iraqis may be spreading the rumors as part of a "disinformation campaign" to weaken support for the economic sanctions.
"If there was some reason to believe that Saddam might be removed from the scene within weeks or months, then there might be less receptivity to a hard-line position on sanctions," one Western diplomat commented.
The Central Intelligence Agency, for its part, has been dismissive of such rumors. "I wouldn't attach credibility to rumors that Saddam is seriously ill," said one American intelligence official.
This time, Mr. Hussein has offered no public denial that he is ill. But he has responded in a way, by keeping up a vigorous schedule of official duties; Iraqi newspapers and broadcasts detail his every meeting with a foreign dignitary, or with his cabinet
At one of those appearances, a military parade in Baghdad four months ago, remained in the bitter cold for 13 hours, repeatedly firing a hunting rifle with one hand to salute the battalions marching past, and impressing diplomats with his stamina. At one point, hearing some of the guests complaining about the cold, he ordered an aide to fetch them warm clothing.
Some diplomats who were present, having heard the rumors of cancer, wondered if they were looking at a double. But an ambassador from a neighboring country, who greeted Mr. Hussein and shook his hand, said he had no doubt it was Mr. Hussein.
"Looking at him out there in the cold, firing that rifle, you couldn't imagine any guy stronger than him," he said. "And when he ordered warm clothes -- well, the way his assistants reacted, snapping to attention, it could only have been the real Saddam."

HEADLINE: Republicans Consider Increasing Tax Cut at Low End 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21 

 BODY:
Facing criticism that President Bush's tax plan is too generous to the wealthy and not responsive to the faltering economy, Republicans in Congress moved today to make tax cuts more favorable to low-income taxpayers and to get money into people's pockets quicker.
 The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Thomas of California, announced that he had rewritten two of the main aspects of the Bush plan to give more benefits to the less affluent. The committee is scheduled to vote on Mr. Thomas's proposals on Thursday. 
 In the Senate, Republican leaders have been meeting to find ways to make a tax cut applicable right away. Among the possibilities under consideration, a staff assistant said, was a temporary suspension of part of workers' Social Security and Medicare withholding taxes and an increase in the amount of income subject to the lowest tax rate.
In the House, the Budget Committee approved, on a party-line vote, a budget outline that would set aside $1.62 trillion for tax relief over the next 10 years. The committee approved the plan 23-19 after rejecting a series of Democratic amendments.
Two weeks ago, the House approved the central element of the president's tax plan, an across-the-board reduction in income-tax rates that would save taxpayers nearly $1 trillion over the next decade.
Today, Mr. Thomas addressed two other parts of the president's plan: lower taxes for married couples and an expanded tax credit for families with children. In both instances, Mr. Thomas expanded the benefits for taxpayers with low and moderate incomes, a step that is likely to attract at least some Democratic votes.
Mr. Thomas's proposals would increase the 10-year cost of these two elements of the president's plan by about a third, to about $400 billion from about $300 billion.
The full House could vote on these proposals as early as next week.
The budget resolution adopted tonight by the House Budget Committee provides for tax cuts of at least the size sought by Mr. Bush, and would allow them to be phased in on a slightly more accelerated schedule than originally sought by the White House.
The Budget Committee plan would also hold overall spending increases to lower levels than in recent years, but it left open the option of providing more money later in the year for two areas with powerful constituencies, the military and agriculture.
The budget resolution is a nonbinding blueprint intended to guide the tax and appropriations committees as they do their work. It generally tracked the budget sent to Congress this month by Mr. Bush, but altered it in a few respects. 
The House plan would place more restrictions than the White House version on use of temporary surpluses being generated by Medicare, allowing them to be used only for reducing the national debt or to expand the system of health insurance for the elderly and the disabled.
The House budget would also provide more money than the administration next year in several areas, including veterans' benefits. 
The House budget provided for total spending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 of $1.977 trillion, an increase of 3.7 percent from the current fiscal year. Discretionary spending on most government programs outside Social Security and Medicare would rise 4 percent next year, to $660 billion.
The budget resolution would permit the tax cut to grow if new budget surplus projections this summer showed that the government would have even more excess revenue than expected.
Despite growing pressure from some members of both parties to address the faltering economy by passing a tax cut that would put tens of billions of dollars in the pockets of consumers this year, the committee limited the tax cut for this year to the amount in the income tax bill passed by the House earlier this month, about $5.6 billion.
The resolution would allow the tax cut to increase next year to $64 billion, more than twice what Mr. Bush originally sought. Most of the tax cut would not take effect until the middle of the decade.
Mr. Thomas said he intended to keep all tax cuts within the $1.6 trillion framework proposed by Mr. Bush, but he has not indicated how he intended to do this. When asked, he talked about fitting "a pound and a half of sugar into a one-pound bag."
The Senate is moving on taxes at a much slower pace than the House and is not likely to vote on the matter until May. Then, it is likely to approve a measure far different from what the House passes. It will be up to a House-Senate conference committee to resolve the differences.
No one who follows Congress doubts that a large tax cut will be enacted before the year is out, but the various components of the measure are still very much in question.
For married couples, Mr. Thomas's proposal has four parts:
*He would double the standard deduction for couples filing joint returns to make it twice the standard deduction for single taxpayers.
*For those who itemize deductions, he would gradually raise the amount of income covered by the 15 percent tax bracket.
*For low-income earners, he would increase the amount of income on which they would be entitled to the earned-income tax credit.
*He would adjust the alternative minimum tax, a special tax on those with unusually large deductions, so that couples would not be treated less favorably than single people.
The goal of the last point was to provide relief from what is known as the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax law that leads to some couples owing more in taxes than they would if they were unmarried and filed separate returns. 
Mr. Thomas's plan, however, would give a tax reduction to almost all couples, whether or not they faced a penalty. It is almost identical to a measure that Congress approved last year and that was vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
These measures would be more generous to low-income taxpayers than the president's plan. The president would allow couples to take a 10 percent deduction on the first $30,000 earned by the lower-earning spouse, a measure that would not help the large majority of taxpayers at lower income levels who use the standard deduction.
The other part of the Thomas plan would double the child tax credit to $1,000 per child from $500, and $100 of the increase would be retroactive and applicable to 2001 income taxes. Workers with one or two children who do not owe enough in income taxes to be entitled to the full credit would be entitled to a rebate up to the amount they paid in Social Security and Medicare taxes. Under existing law, only taxpayers with three or more children are entitled to the refund.
President Bush proposed doubling the credit, but his plan would not expand the refund.

HEADLINE: German Confidence Is at Lowest Point Since July '99 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 21 

 BODY:
German industry fired off a powerful warning today that all is not well in Europe's biggest economy, when an important barometer of business confidence dived sharply, unnerving investors across Europe.
 In its monthly survey of sentiment among business executives, the IFO economic research institute, based in Munich, said confidence last month suffered its biggest plunge in more than a year, reaching a level not seen since July 1999 when Europe was being hit hard by the Asian financial crisis. The index fell twice as far as most economists had predicted. 
 Because the index is considered a reliable guide to future economic growth, the news compounded disappointment over the limited scale of the Federal Reserve's reduction in short-term interest rates on Tuesday. Stock markets declined across Europe, and the value of the euro slipped below 90 cents for the second time in two weeks. 
Adding to the bad news, the European Commission's statistical arm reported today that industrial production fell 1.9 percent in January, more than economists had expected.
No one doubts that Europe is slowing down, but there is much less agreement about how serious and widespread the trend will be.
In the last month, most private economists have trimmed their forecasts for European growth to 2.5 percent from about 3 percent. But that is still well above current predictions for the United States.
"It is too early to pull down the shutters," said Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. "If we get another two months of this and the numbers stay at this level, then there would be reason to worry."
The picture in Europe is far from homogenous. Signs of a slowdown are most acute in Germany, which is heavily dependent on exports outside Europe and which has been slow to liberalize its labor markets. But France, the next largest economy in Europe, remains fairly buoyant, and smaller countries like the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland are still growing quickly. Ireland, in fact, has drawn an official rebuke from the European Union over tax cuts that may overheat its economy.
Even in Germany, many manufacturers are still doing well, especially those that export mainly to Europe rather than to the United States. "We have the biggest backlog of orders right now that we have ever had," said Wieland Schmitz, a spokesman for MAN A.G., which makes trucks, buses, printing systems and other heavy equipment.
MAN's situation contrasts sharply with Freightliner, the American truck-making subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler, which is struggling with a sharp slowdown in the American market. In part because only 10 percent of MAN's exports go to the United States, it still foresees solid growth this year and next.
Nevertheless, anxiety is on the rise, once again putting the European Central Bank in a tight spot. So far, the bank has resisted following the Federal Reserve with interest rate cuts of its own because it worries more about inflation. 
But few economists believe the bank's forecast that Europe can still grow 3 percent this year, and unemployment across Europe remains at an uncomfortably high level of nearly 9 percent even after last year's economic growth.
As for inflation, it is already above the central bank's self-imposed ceiling of 2 percent annually, and the euro is again sputtering. A move to perk up growth with easier money could aggravate both trends.
"They cannot follow the Fed, and they shouldn't," said Alfred Boss, an economist at the Kiel Institute for World Economics in Germany.
Without changes like lower taxes and more flexible rules on hiring and firing, Mr. Boss said, it is "highly improbable" that Germany can grow any faster than 2.1 percent in 2001 and 2.5 percent thereafter, even with a cut in interest rates. 
In Britain, which did not adopt the euro, confidence among both consumers and businesses remains high, the main reason the Bank of England decided not to cut interest rates last month.
"The most striking feature of the U.K. economy was the strength of demand and confidence despite the world outlook," the Bank of England said today in a summary of discussions from its most recent meeting. "The U.S. slowdown could affect the confidence of businesses and consumers in the U.K., but it had not done so yet."
Thomas Mayer, senior European economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt, said Germany's abrupt loss of confidence might stem in part from frustration over economic reform, not the broader European economic picture. "The message of this survey is that this is mostly a German problem, rather than a European problem," Mr. Mayer said, referring to the German business sentiment data.
By contrast, executives at Alcatel, the French telephone equipment maker, remain fairly optimistic. Jean-Pierre Halbron, Alcatel's chief financial officer, said that because Europe never went on quite the same technology spending spree as the United States did, it is suffering less.
"If you take the last two to three years, telecommunication investment in Europe has been 50 percent of what it has been in the United States, and the economies are the same size," Mr. Halbron said.
Mr. Mayer added that the IFO survey found German pessimism directed at domestic conditions, not exports. And it coincided with a government decision to reinforce rules that give workers a say in corporate decision making, which Mr. Mayer said "put German industry in a very, very sour mood."
Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, vented his own frustration today about slow progress in parts of Europe. "We have to speed things up," he told reporters in Brussels today, where a special meeting on economic reform is set for the weekend.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Message in a Coca-Cola Can

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
THERE is a scene in David O. Russell's "Three Kings" that has haunted me since the first time I saw it. Not the notorious tour of Mark Wahlberg's internal organs, but the moment when Mr. Wahlberg's character, separated from his comrades and pursued by Iraqi Republican Guards, bursts into an Iraqi bunker full of cell phones and calls his wife at home in the suburbs of Detroit.
 For some reason this scene reminds me of one in Pawel Pawlikowski's "Last Resort." The protagonist, a young Russian woman stranded at a holding center for refugees on the coast of Britain, hooks up with an Internet pornographer. As she goes through the motions for his camera, her would-be boyfriend comes to her rescue. After he beats up the pornographer, the camera lingers on a computer screen that displays the reactions of cybervoyeurs around the world who think they've witnessed the coolest live Webcast ever. 
 And this moment, in turn, recalls a sequence in Jasmin Dizdar's "Beautiful People," in which a young British soccer hooligan is unwittingly airlifted into the killing fields of Bosnia during the siege of Srebrenica. An unexpected act of heroism -- involving the young man's heroin stash -- is captured on television and beamed via satellite to his parents back in London. And then I think of a silly advertising jingle for a company that has since changed its name and its logo: "We're all connected." Yes, but only because we were disconnected first.
Are these scenes images of globalization? The word conjures images of -- what, exactly? In common usage, globalization has an abstract, ideological ring; it belongs to the idiom of punditry, high-level policy debates and political sloganeering. Depending on whom you believe, globalization either holds out the promise of open markets, free-flowing information and political liberalization or hastens the erosion of cultural identities and consolidates power in the hands of big, unaccountable corporations.
But as difficult as it is to find a safe analytical perch from which to assess the large-scale consequences of globalization -- which can be defined, for the sake of argument, as the increasingly rapid and dramatic movement of goods, capital, information and people across ever more permeable geographical, cultural and political boundaries -- it may be even trickier to understand its effects on daily life or to glimpse its human face.
A few years back, you could hardly turn on American network television without seeing pictures -- brought to you courtesy of advertising agencies employed by various computer companies, long-distance carriers and freight haulers -- of Masai herdsmen, Central Asian shepherds, Japanese schoolchildren and Scotsmen in kilts. Their motley, smiling countenances were selling not so much a series of products and services as a single, reassuring idea: whatever our differences of language, custom and costume, we're all the same.
Of course this anodyne, unexceptionable message had a specific subtext: we're the same because we want the same things -- fast Internet connections, overnight delivery and half-decaf skim lattes (as well as, presumably, peace, shelter and clean drinking water). Through these ads, the American television-watcher could practice a kind of cost-free mental tourism, experiencing at once the frisson of exoticism and the balm of complacency: not only are they just like us, but what they want is also what we already have. 
Advertising, of course, is a medium devoted to fantasy, an unabashedly utopian art form that dresses the banalities of ordinary commerce in the raiments of universalism, projecting a perfect world into the hectic humdrum of buying and selling. Movies are different -- or at least have the potential to be. They are able, sometimes, to brush the finer grain of reality, and catch sight -- often sidelong or by accident -- of the hard material substrata underneath the fantasy: the gravel on the roads of the global village.

Jokes and Jingles
A handful of recent films -- from different corners of the world, divergent in style and scope -- address globalization not as an idea, or even as a theme, but rather as a half-invisible context, a source of jokes, stories and serendipitous metaphors.
The most recognizable and widespread of these may also be the humblest: the Coca-Cola can, whose red and white lettering forms a universally legible ideogram for the worldwide consumer economy. "I'd like to buy the world a Coke, and keep it company," goes an old advertising jingle, which seems charmingly dated only because it has proved so deliberately prophetic. Without the benefit of paid product placement, the Coke logo always manages to find its way into camera range.
In Khyentse Norbu's "Cup," released last year, the opening scenes show a group of young Tibetan Buddhist monks using the familiar soda can as a ball in an impromptu soccer game. After being confiscated by their monastery's no-nonsense abbot, the adaptable object finds its way into a shrine, where it serves as a holder for votary candles. 
Superficially, this part of "The Cup" looks like a variation on a theme introduced more than 20 years ago in the South African comedy "The Gods Must Be Crazy," in which a Coke bottle falls from the heavens into the midst of an insular African tribe, which treats it as a sacred object -- a fetish, in anthropological parlance.
But unlike "The Gods Must Be Crazy," which was sufficiently popular in Europe and the United States to spawn a sequel, "The Cup" is more than a primitivist fairy tale about the collision between archaic tradition and encroaching modernity. (Nor, conversely, is it about the corruption of a vulnerable ancient culture by the predatory West.)
The film, made in Bhutan (with Japanese and European financing) by a prominent lama who became interested in directing during the filming of Martin Scorsese's "Kundun," takes a wry, humanistic look at cultural conflict.
The novices are obsessed, like most of the rest of the world, with soccer, and Mr. Norbu follows their efforts to bring the World Cup, and therefore television, to their cloistered corner of the world. 
When it arrives, the results are neither revolutionary nor catastrophic, but just what you might expect: a room full of excited young men cheering for their team, which happens to be Brazil.
Coke -- and the ambiguous power of television -- also figures in the Chinese director Zhang Yimou's "Not One Less," which examines the lives of children on the margins of the high-tech worldwide economy in a more somber light.
The film takes place in an impoverished village in rural China, where there is a perpetual shortage of school supplies (and teachers), and where children are sent away to the city to work off their parents' debts. When this happens to one of her pupils, the film's heroine, a stubborn and unworldly 13-year-old substitute teacher, resolves to bring him back.

A Persistent Inequality
To earn money for her bus ticket, she and her class spend a day working in a brickyard. She calculates (mistakenly, as it turns out) that they will have enough money left over for two cans of room-temperature Coke from the village store: 24 ounces to be shared among 27 thirsty mouths. 
There is something heartbreaking in seeing all these children delicately -- one might almost say reverently -- sipping warm brown sugar water from flimsy aluminum containers. Part of the pathos arises from the intensity of their appreciation of something that is elsewhere taken entirely for granted. The scene is a reminder of the terrible inequality that persists -- and deepens -- in the new market-dominated world even as it also acknowledges a profound and curiously innocent desire to belong to that world. 
The guilty, uncontrollable desire for coke -- the illegal variety, that is -- is at the center of "Traffic." Most of the discussion of Steven Soderbergh's film has focused on its relevance to American drug policy. But in trying to tell a story about the drug trade, Mr. Soderbergh and Stephen Gaghan, the screenwriter, have told a story about trade, regulated and unregulated markets, the law of supply and demand, and the unintended consequence of Nafta. (That they have done so is acknowledged in a speech delivered by Miguel Ferrer's character, a low-level importer who has turned on his bosses, to the Drug Enforcement Administration agents played by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman. While Mr. Cheadle's character has a witty retort -- "What, are we on Larry King?" -- he doesn't have a persuasive counterargument.)
"Traffic" moves back and forth between the United States and Mexico, between a North overwhelmed by its appetites and a South corrupted by the business of feeding them. This map has some basis in reality, but it also projects a world turned upside down: replace illegal coke with the legal kind -- or, for that matter, with pharmaceuticals, fast food or movies -- and the multinational North becomes the supplier, pushing its product on the rest of the world. Or, more benignly, inventing new ways to give people what they want. 

Spartan Pleasures
But every desire eventually finds its opposite. Robert Zemeckis's "Cast Away" is a film that might seem in every way antithetical to "Not One Less" (whose cast, for one thing, consists entirely of nonprofessional actors). When we first encounter its hero, Chuck Noland, he might be starring in a promotional film for his employer, Federal Express. He is in Moscow, preaching the corporate gospel of speed and efficiency to a work force still fighting off the long socialist hangover. He's an exemplary -- and, since he's played by Tom Hanks, a heroically ordinary -- modern man, married to his work, living in constant motion, surrounded by gadgets and luxury objects and able to squeeze only fleeting moments of intimacy into his busy schedule. 
By now you know what happens next: Chuck's plane crashes in the South Pacific. His four-year sojourn on a deserted island, which occupies one of the most extraordinary hours of screen time in recent film history, is a long nightmare of solitude and desperation. But even nightmares hold an element of wish fulfillment. I doubt I'm the only moviegoer who watched with envy as well as pity Chuck's struggle to survive and stay sane. 
"The world is too much with us, late and soon," Wordsworth wrote. "Getting and spending we lay waste our powers." Or, to put it in the brand-conscious poetry of our own era, "The World on Time" may turn out to be an ambiguous gift. In the middle hour of "Cast Away," we watch someone, freed from the world as we know it, recover the elemental powers that his restless, clock-driven existence had shorn away. (It's hardly surprising that the movie did so well during the winter holidays, when the desire to flee from the entanglements of family and the pressures of shopping become especially acute.)
The FedEx packages from the plane wreck do arrive, of course, washing up in the tide with their familiar purple and orange markings. And they turn out to contain not only useful objects (thank goodness someone thought to ship a pair of ice skates across the southern tropics), but metaphors. Is there a more potent image of the desperate longing that lies beneath our easygoing commodity fetishism than Wilson, the volleyball whose brand becomes a name (it could have been Voit or Spalding), and whose blank surface becomes, when imprinted with Chuck's blood, a human face?
The things we surround ourselves with become the uncanny repositories of our alienated humanity, and the object of our stymied capacity to love. The loss of the volleyball, and Chuck's reaction to it, is both absurd -- Wilson is only a thing, after all -- and authentically tragic: Wilson is his best friend. 
Another of the packages that reach Chuck on his island -- and help to save his life -- contains Chinese videotapes, which he uses as lashing on his makeshift raft. In my own daydream, the unwatched tapes are a VHS transfer of Edward Yang's sublime "Yi Yi (a One and a Two)," a movie that like "Cast Away" finds drift and disconnection amid affluence and busyness.

Anomie the World Over
If "Cast Away" is a brilliant parable of the present human condition, "Yi Yi" examines that same condition with the sensitive precision of a great novel. NJ Jian, the sad-eyed, reluctant patriarch of a middle-class Taipei family, lives in the Eastern zone of Chuck Noland's world. He runs a small software company in search of venture capital, and he and his family live in a sleek urban environment that could be Manhattan or Frankfurt. NJ's teenage daughter hangs out at New York Bagels, his young son prefers McDonald's to traditional Chinese banquet food and a plastic bottle of Head and Shoulders sits on the side of the family's bathtub.
None of the details seem inserted to make a point: their function is descriptive. Just as Balzac in cataloguing the furnishings of a Paris apartment house could uncover the deep logic of 19th-century bourgeois society -- its class antagonisms, its sexual politics, its unacknowledged prejudices and intimate secrets -- so has Mr. Yang, in dwelling on the details of domestic and business life in a late-20th-century metropolis, discovered an essential structure of feeling.
A name for this feeling might be anomie, the sense of dislocation that accompanies the radical expansion of horizons. This is not to say that globalization makes us all unhappy, but rather that in redefining the pursuit of happiness and, at least arguably, freeing more people to pursue it, the present stage of capitalism also creates new forms of misery, not only material but also psychic. And it is striking how many recent movies regard the world with a sorrowful, worried expression, finding moments of comfort in an atmosphere of disconnection.
If "Traffic," for example, is explicitly about drugs, it is implicitly about the failure of communication and the fracture of intimate bonds by market forces. The brokenness that is the film's true subject is symbolized by its narrative structure: the links between the three stories are plain to the viewers but invisible to the characters. The world is too big for them to understand, and refuge from its remorseless logic is possible only in small measures and fleeting moments.
The New Yorker film critic David Denby has beautifully described "Yi Yi" as "a kind of melancholy globalist poem, an anxious tremor of the downturn." Like "Cast Away" and the other movies, "Yi Yi" was completed before the Nasdaq slide and the foot-and-mouth epidemic brought intimations of apocalypse to the public mood. The sense of somber uncertainty that pervades these movies is not a response to current events, but rather the underside of the giddy self-confidence that supposedly dominated the late 1990's.
The anxiety arises not from the fear of collapsing markets, but from the worry that, as goods proliferate and information circulates, meaning and human connections may be in danger of collapse. Like any other art, movies are powerless to restore what is broken, but they can provide images of what the rushing world conspires to obscure -- the anxious, melancholy human face.

HEADLINE: The Free Fall of the Australian Dollar Remains a Mystery 

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, March 22 

 BODY:
The Australian dollar has analysts baffled. It probably should be weak, they say -- but not this weak.
 The Aussie, as it is called here, slipped to an all-time low of just under 50 United States cents late last week, and it seems likely to stay down -- or even dip further -- in the near term, whether analysts can make sense of it or not. 
 The slump is a particular problem for Australian businesses that rely on imports or want to expand internationally. And though it is also making Australian assets cheaper than ever for many foreign investors, few seem interested in buying. 
The currency does not have much going for it at the moment. At home, consumers are glum, unemployment is rising and business investment has sagged. In the fourth quarter of last year, the economy shrank for the first time in almost a decade. And internationally, weak global growth is weighing on the Aussie.
"You can pin it to lots of different factors," Ivan Colhoun, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Sydney, said of the currency's tumble. "It's all very negative."
Still, analysts are hard pressed to explain just why the Australian dollar has fallen so far -- more than 24 percent against the United States dollar since January 2000, and more than 10 percent against the United States dollar just this year -- making it the second-worst performing major currency in the world, beating only the Turkish lira. Yesterday, it settled at 49.51 cents.
What is clear is that sentiment surrounding the Aussie is sour. "Investors have been burned so many times in the past two and a half years," said Greg McKenna, currency strategist at the National Australia Bank, that when the Aussie falls now, "it's like, 'Oh God, not again.' "
Overseas investors have been turning away from Australia since the late 1990's. Foreign holdings of the national government's bonds, for example, which peaked at 40 percent of the total outstanding in 1997, have dropped to just one quarter of the total. Even as Australia maintained steady economic growth and low inflation in recent years, the country failed to lure back the bulk of international investors and hedge fund managers who abandoned Australian assets during the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990's.
Now, as a global slowdown threatens, Australia's association with regional trouble spots like Japan, which buys one-fifth of the country's exports, are dragging the Aussie down again. Shipments abroad are bound to suffer if an economic meltdown spreads. Almost two-thirds of Australia's exports are commodities, including wool, wheat, gold and zinc; the country is the world's largest exporter of coal. And because the local currency is considered commodity-based, its performance typically suffers when global economic growth -- and demand -- crumple.
The lower currency is not all bad. It makes exports much cheaper, for one thing, and export strength is helping to cushion the country's economic slowdown. It is in part because of this -- and in part because the slide has been long and slow and has not pushed up inflation -- that the central bank has taken only minimal action to support the Aussie.
Still, Prime Minister John Howard protested recently that the country's economic fundamentals, while weaker than late last year, do not justify the Aussie's current level.
Most strategists and economists agree that it is undervalued -- some say significantly so. "Fundamentally, it seems ridiculously cheap," said Rory Robertson, a New York-based strategist at Macquarie Equities.
Intangible concerns, like business and consumer confidence, are holding great sway, analysts said. And a relatively small economy like Australia's, which accounts for just 1 percent of total global gross domestic product, can be tossed around more by the tides of capital flows.
Given the current conditions, analysts say, the Aussie is likely to continue to struggle. Some say the currency should be close to a bottom, but none are confidently predicting when it will recover. "Presumably, eventually, investors will notice," Mr. Robertson said. "Australia's having a half-price sale."

HEADLINE: Economic Jitters Send Latin American Stocks Reeling; 
In Argentina, Official Seeks A Free Hand

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, March 22 

 BODY:
Two tumultuous days into his new tenure as Argentina's economy minister and designated savior, Domingo Cavallo outlined his plans late Wednesday and asked Congress for extraordinary powers to revive the stalled economy.
 Mr. Cavallo promised to make Argentina more competitive without devaluing the peso or ending the decade-old currency board system that pegs its value to the United States dollar. He called for tax cuts, tariff changes and rapid easing of business and labor regulations. 
 But hopes that the plan would immediately bolster investor confidence seemed dim. The benchmark Merval stock index plunged 6.6 percent today, driven in part by a similar retreat in neighboring Brazil and by worries that the currency peg may be broken despite government assurances, as has happened in countries like Turkey. 
Late in the day, the market rout was aggravated by rumors, immediately denied, that Argentina's president, Fernando de la Rua, would resign.
In the two days since Mr. de la Rua brought Mr. Cavallo in as the country's third economy minister in three weeks, Mr. Cavallo has engaged in a frenetic pace of economic planning and politicking. It appeared to be as much an effort to dispel the impression that the government was adrift as to kickstart an economy that has contracted for two years.
"Soon Argentines will see us in action," Mr. Cavallo said, "and the country will be different."
He offered few details of his plan, instead calling on Congress to grant him almost unlimited powers to privatize state agencies, slash state payrolls, revamp pension laws to cut business costs, give companies more freedom to hire and fire and scrap other regulations.
The plan included several departures from past policies. Mr. Cavallo called for eliminating the current 14 percent import tariff on capital goods to encourage investment. At the same time, he called for average import duties on consumer goods from countries outside the Mercosur trade bloc to rise to 20 percent from 18 percent, to protect domestic producers. Mercosur also includes Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
Such unilateral tariff changes are bound to rankle Brazil, Mercosur's leader, which prefers that trade policies be coordinated among members. Mr. Cavallo and the foreign minister, Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini, were expected to fly to Brazil to talk with concerned officials. 
Mr. Cavallo's plan included a few tax increases, but mainly it aimed to raise more revenue by fighting tax evasion and corruption. He called for a new rule requiring all financial transactions over $1,000 to be completed by check rather than in cash. He also proposed a small tax on financial transactions that would be deductible from income and value-added taxes.
All told, the program was intended to shave $3 billion from the expanding government deficit this year. With $150 billion in foreign debt, Argentina was expected to miss the goal set by the International Monetary Fund for reducing its deficit in the first quarter; the monetary fund organized a bailout package of nearly $40 billion late last year.
Mr. Cavallo appeared to have a fight on his hands in Congress, where members of the Radical Party of President De la Rua have expressed reservations about giving him the power he wants, especially with regard to pension and labor laws. Mr. Cavallo, who leads a small conservative party, ran for president against the ruling Alianza coalition in 1999. 
Members of the opposition Justicialist Party, which was in power when Mr. Cavallo served as economy minister under former President Carlos Saul Menem, reacted more positively. 
"We understand the country is in bad shape," said Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota of Cordoba province, who praised Mr. Cavallo's plans to cut taxes and streamline regulations. "We will be a constructive opposition."
But labor leaders were skeptical. Hugo Moyano, who led a damaging 24-hour nationwide strike on Wednesday, said he was not about to stop the protests. 
"I don't believe Cavallo's policies will remove the country from its crisis," Mr. Moyano said. "They always postpone the social needs of the people."

HEADLINE: Economic Jitters Send Latin American Stocks Reeling; 
Brazil Frets Over Rate Rise And the Turmoil Next Door

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 22 

 BODY:
Brazil's stock markets plummeted today on the heels of a surprise half-point increase in interest rates by the Brazilian central bank Wednesday night, and they were rattled further by developments in neighboring Argentina. Sao Paulo's benchmark Bovespa index fell 5.34 percent, closing at 14,046.19.
 Meant to stabilize the falling value of Brazil's currency, the real, and to keep inflation from igniting, the interest rate move wound up worsening the growing concern over the Brazilian economy's prospects, economists said. 
 "It introduced a little uncertainty in the market," said Andre Loes, chief economist at Banco Santander. "They could have insisted a little more with the foreign-exchange markets."
After the Brazilian government's sales of dollar-indexed notes earlier this week failed to relieve mounting pressure on the real, the central bank's policy committee said it raised rates to ensure that the country would not exceed its inflation target of 4 percent this year. The Brazilian government instituted a system of inflation targets two years ago after a sharp devaluation of the currency threatened the stability of the local economy. 
Concerns over increasing instability in Argentina, the apparent slowing of the American economy, and disappointment over Brazil's yawning current account deficit have pushed the real down in value 5.3 percent this month, to 2.161 to the dollar, a two-year low.
Some economists said, though, that the central bank's move was justified. They said the market needed a signal that the central bank was willing to take tough, politically unpopular measures to guard against inflation, which scourged the country in the 1980's.
"This change in the rate was very important, because it made it very clear that if necessary the central bank would increase the rate," said Jose Carlos de Faria, an economist at Deutsche Bank in Sao Paulo. "Before this, the market had the perception that the central bank would not take such a strong move."
Over the last 11 months, the central bank's policy committee has been lowering rates. The benchmark short-term rate, known as Selic, which the bank briefly pushed up to 45 percent to head off a run on the real, has been falling steadily from 19.50 percent in the aftermath of the 1999 devaluation. It dropped to 15.25 percent before Wednesday, but the bank's surprise increase pushed it back up to 15.75 percent.
Business leaders and politicians continue to demand a significant reduction in interest rates, arguing that Brazilian industry needs lower borrowing costs to increase the competitiveness of Brazilian products in world markets. 
In that climate, Mr. Loes of Banco Santander called the half-point rate innocuous and wondered whether it would have much effect on inflation.
Economists say that while the fundamentals of the Brazilian economy remain strong, a growing financial crisis and political turmoil in Argentina have made investors in Brazil increasingly nervous.
Doubts remain whether the newly appointed Argentine economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, will be able to push through an emergency economic package and pull the country out of a long recession. There was also some concern that his plan to unilaterally alter tariffs would be disruptive to Mercosur, the four-nation trade bloc led by Brazil that also includes Uruguay and Paraguay.
Until there is some clarification of the Argentine situation, analysts said, markets in both countries will remain rocky and prone to sharp reactions to developments on either side of the border.

HEADLINE: Key Forecasting Gauge Declined in February 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
A key forecasting gauge for the economy fell in February after a significant gain in January, but it indicated that growth should pick up in the next few months, a private research group said today.
 The group, the Conference Board, reported that the index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.2 percent in February after a revised 0.5 percent gain in January. The drop matched Wall Street expectations. 
 The board corrected the leading index from a 0.3 percent decline reported earlier in the day and attributed the revision to an error in compiling consumer expectations data. The mistake occurred because the board used midmonth consumer sentiment figures instead of the usual end-of-month numbers, which were higher. Overall consumer expectations were therefore corrected to a 0.12 percent decline from a previously reported 0.19 percent fall.
The board's economist, Ken Goldstein, said the data suggested that inflation was still not in sight and explained that although the leading index declined steadily in the last quarter of 2000, it did not meet the 3.5 percent annualized loss over six months that would signal a recession.
Instead, Mr. Goldstein predicted another quarter of slow growth before the economy would pick up again in the summer.
He said that the half-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve this week would stimulate spending and consumption and inject "adrenaline" into the economy.
He recognized, however, that declining exports in the last quarter of 2000 played a role in slowing the economy. "There's a problem in demand, but it's not investment and it's not consumption," he said. "It's in exports." The United States export market remained "dried up" in the context of global economic weakness, he said.
A separate report released today showed that jobless claims rose, as measured on a four-week average, offering further evidence the economy is slowing. While claims fell to 379,000 in the March 17 week from a revised 380,000 in the prior week, the four-week average rose to 377,000 from a revised 365,500.
Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One in Chicago, agreed that despite slower growth rates the the nation had "a weak economy that's still in expansion territory" and concurred that the next few months carried stronger growth prospects.
Neither Mr. Goldstein nor Ms. Swonk appeared concerned that the recent fluctuations in the stock market would generate obstacles to investment or economic growth in the months to come.
The Conference Board said the coincident index, a barometer of current economic trends, rose 0.1 percent in February after remaining unchanged in January and increasing 0.1 percent in December.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
And the Oscar for the network willing to hold out the longest to sell costly spots goes to . . . ABC.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IN another sign of the effect of the struggling economy on Madison Avenue, ABC has become the reluctant star of a Hollywood cliffhanger called "Crouching Network, Hidden Sponsors," completing the sale of commercial time during the 73rd annual Academy Awards a scant three days before showtime.
 One reason for the lag compared with better times, when ABC normally sold out the broadcast a month or two beforehand rather than the Thursday before the Sunday, was that the network held firm to higher prices set last year as the American economy was emulating the best picture of 1952, "The Greatest Show on Earth," rather than the best picture of 1997, "Titanic." 
 ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, has finished selling the spots for an estimated average of just less than $1.4 million for each 30 seconds, compared with $1.2 million in 2000. That underscores an advertising truism: demand for prestigious, so-called event programming generally holds up in a weakened economy as marketers, like investors, make a flight to perceived quality.
The higher prices, however, along with the souring economic outlook, led some longtime Oscar sponsors to reduce the amount of commercial time they bought. One stalwart, Revlon, withdrew altogether after paring its buy last year, a disappearance related to its own financial problems rather than the economic slowdown. 
To fill the commercial time, ABC recruited newcomers to the program like Anheuser-Busch, Kinko's and Yahoo to join returnees like American Express, Eastman Kodak, General Motors, the Pepsi-Cola unit of PepsiCo and Charles Schwab & Company. The result is a show with an ad lineup that will resemble the Super Bowl's, with a far longer advertiser roster than typical.
"Obviously, it was a little more challenging," said Mike Shaw, president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network division of ABC, who spoke in a telephone interview from Los Angeles as he was helping sell the final 60 seconds of commercial time left.
"It would have been a lot easier to make a price adjustment a month ago and put it to bed," he added, "but this is a franchise we're interested in holding, and one year's softness is not going to impact that."
The Academy Awards, which ABC has rights to broadcast through 2008, is usually the second-highest-rated program each year, behind only the Super Bowl. Last year, the show drew an average audience of 46.3 million, and an estimated 79 million people watched at least some of it.
"Our strategy is to sponsor the highest-rated television events to reach our consumer in the most entertaining programs," said Peter McLoughlin, vice president for corporate media at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis. "We've been the exclusive beer sponsor for 13 years in the Super Bowl, so it was natural for us to become the exclusive beer sponsor in the Academy Awards."
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which administers the Oscars, has long restricted the types of products that can run commercials during the show, and this is the first year for beer. Mr. McLoughlin and Mr. Shaw said the change of heart was unrelated to the softness in commercial sales but took place after Anheuser-Busch approached ABC last year about becoming a sponsor in 2001.
"ABC took a reel of our commercials to the academy and what was presented was well received," Mr. McLoughlin said. "They opened the door, and we appreciate it."
Anheuser-Busch will run two humorous, though tasteful, commercials during the show, both created by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. One, about drinking responsibly, features the boy band 'N Sync and ran during the Super Bowl in January. The other, about a Clydesdale and a mouse, was to have run during the Super Bowl but was held.
"We know consumers watching big events and tuning in to 'appointment TV' like the Academy Awards are interested, involved viewers," said Laura Kurzu, vice president for marketing at Kinko's in Ventura, Calif. "They're less likely to migrate away during commercial breaks."
That is why Kinko's and its agency, the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom, chose the show as the place to introduce a campaign featuring the comedian Ryan Stiles and carrying the theme "We're doing more."
"And because the market did free up somewhat," Ms. Kurzu said, referring to the ability of the newcomers to join in, "we expanded the commercial from 30 to 60 seconds."
"We're even 'doing more' with media time," she added, laughing.
Several other advertisers are also running spots longer than the conventional 30 seconds, including Pepsi-Cola, with two 90-second commercials featuring the singer Britney Spears. "With three minutes, we really stand out," said Dawn Hudson, senior vice president for strategy and marketing at Pepsi in Purchase, N.Y., which also bought three minutes last year. "It makes us look like a more dominant sponsor."
The Super Bowl-like ad lineup "could be a very good thing," she added, "because it offers more opportunities for 'talk value' for all the different advertisers on the show" compared with previous years when there were fewer marketers.
One Oscars mainstay, Kodak, is also buying the same amount of commercial time this year as last, 90 seconds, running three spots by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group, that introduce a campaign carrying the theme "Share moments, share life."
"We're happy to be joined by these prominent companies," said Kent McNeley, chief marketing officer for consumer imaging at Kodak in Rochester, as "they see some of the value of advertising on the Academy Awards as we have."
Kodak is taking its sponsorship further, to paraphrase a recent ad slogan, signing a 20-year contract to name a new Academy site for the awards show the Kodak Theater.
General Motors is also using its sponsorship to introduce new commercials. Some are for Chevrolet by Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. And one, by the Troy, Mich., office of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, part of the Bcom3 Group, is the centerpiece of an aggressive new campaign for Cadillac, evoking the era when "every American had a dream of driving a Cadillac" and asserting, "It's time to start dreaming again."
"This is a big statement for Cadillac, so it's important to kick it off on a premier property," said Kim Kosak, director for advertising and promotions at Cadillac in Detroit.
"We call it the 'special occasion spot,' " she added, "because it will run only on programs like the Academy Awards."
The Cadillac spot offers a whirlwind ride from the past, as conjured up with vintage footage of a 1953 Cadillac LeMans, Muhammad Ali and American astronauts, to the future, symbolized by Cadillacs due in 2002 and beyond. One Pepsi spot also combines the past and future, showing Ms. Spears performing by an old-fashioned neon Pepsi sign.
One advertiser, though, is resolutely remaining in the present, addressing the faltering economy.
"We're breaking a spot with Chuck talking to investors about what he thinks about today's market," said Jack Calhoun, senior vice president for advertising and brand management at Schwab in San Francisco, referring to the founder, Mr. Schwab.
Mr. Calhoun summarized the message of the commercial, by the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of Omnicom, as "Everybody just take a deep breath and relax."
That goes for you Oscar nominees, too.

HEADLINE: Fed Minutes Show Concern Over Falling Economy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided to cut interest rates aggressively for a second time in January because the economy was losing steam surprisingly swiftly, minutes of their meeting showed today.
 "The speed and extent of the slowdown were much more pronounced than they had anticipated," according to minutes from the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Jan 30 and Jan. 31. 
 The committee voted 10 to 0 at the meeting to lower interest rates by one-half of a percentage point, matching a half-point reduction on Jan. 3 in between regular meetings and bringing the Fed's target rate on overnight loans between banks to. 5.5 percent. 
The Fed policy makers also agreed to emphasize that the main risk the economy faced was excessive weakness, signaling they were leaning toward more rate reductions.
Indeed, the Fed reduced interest rates another half-point on Tuesday, reducing the federal funds rate to 5 percent, its lowest level since mid-1999.
The minutes from January's meeting showed policy makers were not entirely sure what to make of the current loss of vigor in the economy.
"The eventual degree and duration of the softening in economic conditions were difficult to predict," the minutes said.
"In particular, it was unclear whether the pause in the economic expansion would be largely limited to a relatively short inventory correction or would involve a more extensive cyclical adjustment," they added.
The committee members felt that they were doing the right thing to revive the flagging economy and that the rate cuts they were making would bolster consumer and business confidence.
In particular, the minutes said "the most critical element" was rapid growth in productivity, a measure of how much workers produce in any given hour, which the committee felt would bolster incomes and keep inflation in check.
"The members saw substantial underlying strength and resilience in the economy and they remained optimistic about its prospects beyond the near term in light of the monetary stimulus that was being implemented and the persistence of rapid advances in productivity," the minutes said.
The next scheduled committee meeting is on May 15, but there is nothing to prevent policy makers from lowering rates between meetings.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks Get Late Bounce as Buyers Move In

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
A late-afternoon rally saved investors from steep losses yesterday, as stocks gained strongly in the last hour of trading. Technology stocks ended the day sharply higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average swung from a decline of more than 380 points at 2:40 p.m. to a decline of less than 98 points at the close. 
 After dismal trading on Tuesday and Wednesday and then Thursday morning, the sudden surge of buying came seemingly out of nowhere. The late-day gains were not related to fundamental changes in the outlook for the economy or for corporate profits, traders and analysts said. 
 Instead, the rally appeared to be driven mainly by traders who had sold stocks and stock indexes "short," betting that prices would decline. For most of the day, the short-sellers were right, but just before 3 p.m., a wave of buying from big investors stopped the decline.
As traders in New York and at options pits in Chicago saw that prices were not dropping any further, they hastened to buy shares to cover their short sales, one trader said. That buying pushed prices higher, and the short-covering fed on itself for the next hour.
"All it takes is a little bit of a run-up to get it going, and if it doesn't fall back, the locals in the pits start covering their shorts," the trader said. 
For the day, the Dow lost 97.52 points, or 1.03 percent, closing at 9,389.48. The technology-heavy Nasdaq rose 67.47 points, or 3.69 percent, closing at 1,897.70, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended almost even, down 4.56 points, or 0.41 percent, at 1,117.58.
Despite its afternoon rally, the Dow has dropped almost 600 points since the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates a half-point three days ago. The Dow is fewer than a dozen points from officially entering a bear market, a milestone it will reach if it closes below 9,378. Wall Street defines a bear market as a fall of 20 percent or more in a broad index; the Dow hit its record high of 11,722.98 on Jan. 14, 2000.
Because the Nasdaq and the S.& P. 500, which contain many more stocks than the Dow, have already fallen more than 20 percent, a slide by the Dow into bear territory would be largely symbolic, putting a coda on the great bull market that began in 1982. More important, a continued fall in the Dow would show that investors were nervous that corporate stalwarts like General Electric might not be immune to the earnings and sales shortfalls that have already rocked information technology companies like Cisco Systems.
Losers today included G.E., which fell $1.30, to $37.70, and manufacturers like Boeing, which skidded $1.85, to $52, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, off $1.82 at $101.81. But drug makers and technology companies gained. Merck rose $1.75, to $69.71, while Hewlett-Packard jumped $1.66, to $30.89.
"What's going to turn the market around is when earnings estimates stop coming down," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, which manages about $1 billion. "Maybe we're talking about the late third quarter, early fourth quarter before things look better."
Even so, two Wall Street strategists saw signs of hope in yesterday's trading action. Abby Joseph Cohen, chief United States strategist for Goldman, Sachs, noted that many top technology companies had actually risen since Tuesday. Intel, which fell to a 52-week low of $24.50 on Tuesday, closed yesterday at $28.69, while Dell Computer rose to $26.25 from $24.44 on Tuesday.
Investors are recognizing that some technology stocks are now trading at reasonable levels and that the worst disappointments in technology profits may have already occurred, Ms. Cohen said. "There's a collective realization that stocks have sold off notably," she said. "We think that this preannouncement period for corporate profits is going to mark the worst period."
Jeff Applegate, the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers and a stalwart bull whose optimism proved misguided last year, said he thought stocks could bottom within days or weeks. Mr. Applegate said he was disappointed that the Federal Reserve had not cut interest rates more than 0.5 percent on Tuesday to try to stimulate the economy. But he said he expected that the Fed would continue to cut rates and that the cuts it had already made would soon begin to help the economy.
Stocks usually hit bottom about three months after the Fed lowers rates, and the Fed initially cut rates on Jan. 3, so a rally may be imminent, Mr. Applegate said. Yesterday, "you got to some levels where you saw some real buyers coming in," he said. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates before the central bank meets again on May 15.
Government debt is reacting "to a very horrific experience in the stock market, and there are those who say that this will be the recession of 1991 all over again," said Todd Finkelstein, who manages $1.3 billion at Boston Advisors Inc.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32, to a price of 102 2/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.74 percent from 4.77 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32, to 101 21/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.26 percent from 5.27 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A Glut of Cable TV in India; 
A 'Wild West' Market That Overshadows China's

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: BOMBAY, March 18 

 BODY:
Hailing a taxi in this chaotic city can be a gamble in the best of times. When Cyrus Broacha is at the wheel, all bets are off. 
 Mr. Broacha, the manic host of a daytime show on MTV India, often masquerades as a blind cabdriver, using a hidden camera to record the reactions of passengers. Other times, he shows up in the corner barbershop, brandishing a pair of garden shears at unsuspecting patrons. 
 Such antics have made Mr. Broacha's show, "Bakra," one of the top programs on MTV India. And it has helped MTV India, an offshoot of the American MTV, keep its head above water in a television market with no fewer than six music-video channels. 
"I can't understand why people keep starting music channels," said Alex Kuruvilla, managing director of MTV India. "I think rich people must say, 'It's my daughter's birthday, I'll give her a music channel.' "
Nor is the bewildering choice limited to music video channels. Movies, sports, news, general entertainment, children's and regional programs can all be found on cable. Often, three or more channels compete in the same category. In a country that has too little of most things, India has created one of the most plentiful television markets in the world.
The pell-mell growth of cable here is in striking contrast to the other great Asian market, China. Despite much greater foreign investment in China and breathless predictions by Rupert Murdoch and other Western media moguls eager to tap that market, China remains a place where CNN can be watched mainly in hotel rooms and diplomatic compounds.
"Everybody wants to get into China," said Kunal Dasgupta, chief executive of Sony Entertainment Television. "But it's clear to us that India is a much more near-term opportunity, and almost as big."
Peter Mukerjea, chief executive of Star TV India, said: "There used to be a sense that India was full of problems. Now it's like the Wild West of media. There's no other place like it."
Except, perhaps, the United States. India feels a lot like the American market in the early 1980's, when cable television, then unregulated, was growing at a torrid rate. Ever since satellite-delivered cable came to India in 1991, after the gulf war had turned CNN into an overnight sensation, the government has stood aside as the industry bloomed.
To be sure, television is still far from ubiquitous in this country of more than a billion people. Fewer than half of Indian households, or about 70 million homes, have TV's. Of those, an estimated 28.5 million have cable, according to a report by HSBC Securities. That makes India the third-largest cable market, behind the United States and China.
While most Chinese receive only a handful of channels, because of restrictions on foreign broadcasters by the Chinese government, Indians receive up to 85 channels for a monthly rate of 150 rupees, or $3.26.
The downside of all this freedom is a TV market as teeming as the streets of Bombay. 
India has 30,000 to 50,000 cable operators, mostly mom-and-pop operations, stringing cable from trees to houses. With slowing advertising revenue and new channels squeezing in every month, the rivalry between big players like Star and Sony has become crippling.
"We've had a tough couple of years," Mr. Kuruvilla of MTV said. "We've got a small pie, and millions of people are fighting for a piece."
The proliferation of sexually charged television images is also stirring a debate in this traditional country. India's information and broadcasting minister, Sushma Swaraj, recently criticized a fashion channel from France that featured scantily clad models.
The channel, FTV, defused the controversy by agreeing to beam a separate signal, with more demure models, to India. But as television spreads into India's rural heartland, and as channels fight more fiercely for viewers, questions of taste are likely to come up again.
"Farmers in the Punjab are getting 'Baywatch,' " said Ramesh Vangal, chairman of an Internet portal, AtIndia.com. "One can argue about what kind of effect it is having. But it is transforming India."
The transformation is most obvious in Bombay, the media capital of India, where billboards promoting TV shows like "Suddenly Susan" and "Ally McBeal" have elbowed aside posters for Indian movies. Executives here say the rise of nationally popular TV programs has alarmed Bombay's huge film industry.
A case in point is the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," which made its debut in July on Star TV and riveted the nation for weeks. The show, known in Hindi as "Kaun Banega Crorepati," shattered ratings records and spawned several copycat game shows.
"It completely overturned the myth that only Bollywood works in this market," said Mr. Kuruvilla, using the nickname for India's film industry.
Bollywood movies tend to be overripe melodramas, better on action than character development. But they are reliably popular, feeding several all-movie cable channels and spinning off dubbed soundtracks, known as playbacks, that make up 70 percent of MTV's Hindi-language schedule.
But the game show was a home-grown hit, and it catapulted Star TV, owned by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, from an also-ran to the No. 1 cable service in India. Star has built on the show's success by producing a popular Hindi-language family drama that runs after it.
"Millionaire" was a holy grail of sorts for American broadcasters here -- a non-Indian programming concept tailored to Indian tastes. Sony and another cable channel, Zee, have produced game shows and are trying to exploit other American genres, like reality-based shows.
Sony, which operates an entertainment and movie channel as well as distributing CNBC India, is producing a series that will feature a princess trapped on an island. Fifteen contestants will face a series of hurdles, natural and man-made, to free the princess and claim a prize.
Mr. Dasgupta said Sony Entertainment planned to invest $250 million in India over the next three years, developing two new channels and getting into film production and distribution. The Sony Corporation owns 61 percent of the company, while Indian investors and Bollywood celebrities own the rest.
"In China, we're still clawing our way back from 'Seven Years in Tibet,' " said Mr. Dasgupta, referring to the Brad Pitt film about the Dalai Lama that angered Beijing because of its depiction of Chinese repression in Tibet. 
"This market has emerged," he said, "as more conducive to major U.S. studios."
Still, other executives said the success of "Millionaire" does not mean that every popular American or British concept can be turned into a hit with a bit of tweaking. Mr. Mukerjea is skeptical about replicating shows like "Survivor," which put contestants into trying circumstances.
"For the average Indian citizen, day-to-day existence is hard enough," he said. "He has to wait in a mile-long queue for a bus and then run after it because there are people hanging off the back. Here, if you go 40 kilometers out of Bombay, you're on the set of 'Survivor.' "
A former ad salesman whose pukka accent attests to his years in Britain, Mr. Mukerjea has become the most-watched TV executive in India. As Star soars in the ratings, the company is expanding into distribution: it recently bought 26 percent of India's third-largest cable system, Hathaway Cable, for $70 million.
Mr. Mukerjea, 45, plans to upgrade Hathaway's network to provide broadband service to its 2.5 million subscribers, most of whom are in Bombay. He is also exploring direct-to-home satellite transmission and FM radio, which -- given Bombay's legendary traffic jams -- is a natural business.
Star has made such inroads in India that it has shifted the center of gravity of the company. Mr. Murdoch's younger son, James, still runs Star from its headquarters in Hong Kong. But he visits India every two months. And other Star executives are increasingly involved in India.
"China is more close at hand from Hong Kong," Mr. Mukerjea said, "but this is an unbelievable opportunity. It's the tip of the iceberg."
The trouble is, everybody feels the same way. More than 30 channels started in the last year, at a time when advertising has slowed to an annual increase of 15 percent, down from 25 percent. Advertisers also have been rattled by the slowdown in the global economy and the recent earthquake here.
Despite all the new choices, Indians are not watching more television. They average about one hour and 20 minutes a day, a figure that has not changed in recent years. With few families owning more than one set, the popularity of one show usually comes at the expense of another. "Millionaire," for example, eclipsed the ratings of an Indian passion, cricket games.
Given these realities, Indian television is due for a shakeout. Well-financed companies like Star and Sony, with multiple channels, are likely to survive, while stand-alone channels fall by the wayside. In its category, Mr. Kuruvilla said, MTV is "the only financially viable channel of the lot."
Lest anyone confuse MTV with its video-playing brethren, Cyrus Broacha, the fake cabdriver, is loose on the streets of Bombay, looking for people to trick in the name of successful television.

HEADLINE: Kofi Annan Seems Good Bet for Re-election, and U.S. Is Pleased 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 22 

 BODY:
Kofi Annan, the first leader of the United Nations to rise from within its ranks, said today that he would accept a second five-year term as secretary general. With no other strong candidates in the field at this point, he is likely to be re-elected later this year, well in advance of the end of his first term, Dec. 31. 
 In Washington, a State Department spokesman welcomed Mr. Annan's decision. "His performance as secretary general has been outstanding," said Philip Reeker, the deputy spokesman. Five years ago, the United States vetoed a second term for Mr. Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and promoted Mr. Annan for the job. 
 Mr. Annan will visit Washington on Friday for a meeting with President Bush, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. At a news conference today the secretary general said he expected to discuss a range of issues with American leaders, including the Middle East, Iraq and the Balkans. 
He said he would also raise the question of American dues to the organization. Although a deal with other countries was reached in December that allowed the United States to reduce the size of its United Nations assessment -- and the pact was approved by Jesse Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as well as a powerful critic of the United Nations -- more than $580 million in past dues is still held up in the House of Representatives. William H. Luers, president and chairman of the United Nations Association of the United States, the largest American citizens' support group, welcomed Mr. Annan's announcement and said that the secretary general had brought "a new level of integrity" to the office and the organization, and had done much to open it up to outsiders.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the former American ambassador to the United Nations, today called Mr. Annan "the best secretary general since the organization was founded." 
Mr. Annan, a Ghanaian who will be 63 next month, is popular within the organization and has become a celebrity figure outside the United States, where the United Nations is generally held in higher regard and has a higher visibility. He has earned praise from industrial countries for his determination to reform the organization's archaic and politicized management system, a task being carried out largely by the deputy secretary general, Louise Frechette of Canada. He published trenchant reports of peacekeeping failures, often under his watch as head of that department, and ordered a study of how to improve its efficiency. 
Mr. Annan has provoked concern among some developing nations' governments wary of his overtures to international corporations to join in mitigating the effects of a globalizing economy through a program called the "global compact," and of his calls for intervention in countries where leaders abuse their citizens. 
Mr. Annan, a softspoken man with a calm, elegant demeanor and a sense of humor that has pulled his colleagues through difficult periods, said today that he had agonized over seeking a second term. Diplomats said that ultimately the decision was a joint one. They say that Mr. Annan's wife, Nane, a Swedish lawyer and artist, was known to be concerned about the toll the job was taking on her husband and the time they could spend together.
Asked today what his wife thought of his decision to seek a second term, Mr. Annan replied: "She said that she would support me. I shouldn't say more than that."

HEADLINE: Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities 

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California.
 Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency whose mandate is to ensure "just and reasonable" electricity rates nationwide, had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it. The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits. 
 An internal memorandum laid out two choices. The agency could audit and punish "bad actors," the companies that were exploiting the market. Or it could identify "bad hours," when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobody's fault, and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices. 
"It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors," the memorandum said.
The commission took the easier way. It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies, but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to $124 million collected during a relatively few "bad hours" in January and February. That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed, since the most potential overcharging occurred during "good hours," when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme. The order ignored those hours.
Today, in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness, California regulators estimated that generators had charged $6.2 billion above competitive levels over 10 months. They urged the agency to dig deeper, hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies. But the agency's track record -- one of complacency in the eyes of state officials -- leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers.
The small, obscure agency, tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here, has largely soft-pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top cop, even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line. To keep rates reasonable, it can impose price caps, strip companies of the right to charge market rates, force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether.
Instead, the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the $250 billion electricity industry, which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials. The agency's defenders, including its chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., a fierce advocate of unfettered markets, say that its largely hands-off approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests -- a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces.
But politicians, utility executives, energy economists and local regulators say California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok. They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits. The agency's critics, who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members, say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by free-market passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks.
When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year, it named a newly recruited industry insider, Scott Miller, to lead the effort. Mr. Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was "insufficient data" in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies. Yet his own former employer, PG&E Energy Trading, was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England.
The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets. Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California, New England, the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed.
Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively. They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry -- allowing companies, for example, to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses.
"We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it," said William Massey, a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics. 
The agency's inaction, the critics say, leads to "gaming" -- jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality -- and outright market manipulation. Consumers and utilities are the victims, paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive.
Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years. But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse. They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost $11 million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring.
Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states, a shortage of power plants, rising natural gas prices, and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency. They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators, local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track.
"We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market, but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers," Mr. Hebert said.

Fight Over Deregulation
Today's debate traces back to the 1930's, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies. The Federal Power Act of 1935 gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure "just and reasonable" electricity rates. The Federal Power Commission was abolished in 1977 and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent agency with 1,200 employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market. The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners -- two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years. Two Republican seats are currently unfilled.
The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 1980's, after the agency had begun opening the gas markets. By 1996, the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers. The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets, electricity prices would immediately fall.
That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy, most prominently in California, New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states. Generating companies rushed to expand in the new, borderless market.
But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide. Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years. Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources.
And as the California crisis has worsened, the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do. This week, Mr. Massey, a Democratic commissioner, and Mr. Hebert (pronounced AY-bear), a Republican, sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions. Mr. Hebert said high prices in California "were sending the right signals to get supply there." Mr. Massey called the prices that generators were charging "unlawful" and said that his agency, by not reining them in, "is simply not doing its job."
The agency's leadership has been in flux for months. Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr. Hebert, whom he named to the top post less than two months ago, with Pat Wood, who runs the Texas public utility commission. A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports. 
Though Mr. Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush administration, his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous. Mr. Hebert, a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there.
Mr. Hebert, who has served as a commissioner since 1997, has often taken the most ideologically free-market position of any commissioner. He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces. When Gov. Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt, Mr. Hebert's response was dismissive. "It's not in the interest of the American public," he pronounced.
Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of 1999, they started producing nasty shocks. The mid-Atlantic region experienced some early volatility.
As the turmoil grew, economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called "market power," the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level. Proving such abuses is difficult, because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them.
Joseph Bowring, who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the mid-Atlantic transmission system, said that power companies there had exercised some market power. But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not local regulators, had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not, he said.
Mr. Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so. In the end, Mr. Bowring and several agency officials said, the agency chose not to investigate.
The decision roiled some agency officials.
Ron Rattey, a veteran agency economist, wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as "impotent in our ability to monitor, foster, and ensure competitive electric power markets." The staff, the memorandum said, did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make. Such data would have been useful to Mr. Bowring.

Local-Federal Clash
Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own. Monitors in New England have intervened about 600 times since 1999 to correct prices they determined had been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation.
The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much.
The industry, not surprisingly, shares that view. One vocal critic was Mr. Miller. Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets, he was director of policy coordination for the national energy-trading unit of PG&E Corporation, the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric, the California utility.
Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's crisis, Mr. Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide. PG&E Energy Trading, by several estimates, is now the second-largest seller of electricity in New England.
The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators. They intervened several times in 1999 and 2000 to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies. Mr. Miller denounced the practice, though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged "very high" prices when it could.
"One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive advantage," Mr. Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in 1999. New England regulators too often acted as "judge, jury and executioner" when overseeing the market, he said.
One year later, Mr. Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators' perspective. Their Nov. 1 report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws.
As Mr. Miller's team was preparing its report, the Justice Department, whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agency's, began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion, people contacted by the department during that inquiry said.
One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New England's ancillary services markets, people contacted by the department said. They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year. PG&E confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it, but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the department's requests.
Mr. Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the agency. His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency.
Those duties brought Mr. Miller to California last August. With electricity prices there soaring, he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agency's San Francisco office.
One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators. He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts -- and whether they had manipulated the markets.
But when Mr. Miller and his team approached 11 generators and marketers -- including his old employer -- a few weeks later, they did it their way. They asked eight questions, many of them imprecise, like: "Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market."
This question, Mr. Stern said in a recent interview, "was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day."
Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper. Mr. Rattey recommended that Mr. Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file. But his suggestion was not adopted, agency records show.
Daniel Larcamp, Mr. Miller's supervisor, said "there might have been more information that could have been obtained" in the California inquiry. But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish, making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved. 
For Mr. Miller, agency documents show, the investigation was so time-consuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees. Mr. Miller submitted his form in late January, after a reporter requested it. Agency lawyers approved the form, but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PG&E. The lawyers said Mr. Miller's participation had been permissible because PG&E was not the subject of the investigation.
When the staff report was issued on Nov. 1, it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market. But while the companies "had the potential to exercise market power," the commission said, there was "insufficient data" to prove that they did.
Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration.
"This has been looked at several times, most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering," Rob Doty, the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., told a reporter earlier this year.

California Inquiry
The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators. But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf.
When the California crisis grew severe last December, the commission issued a refund order, a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices. It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than $150 per megawatt hour, considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced.
It also told generators that for the next several months, they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices. The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices.
When the agency's own 60-day deadline for examining market data in January approached, however, it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination. Instead, staff members said, the agency scrambled to forge a last-minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a time-consuming investigation.
During this scramble, a senior staff member, Kevin Kelly, suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors.
"Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by sellers ('bad actors') always seems to fail," his memorandum said. It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours.
The suggestion won the day. The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage 3 emergency, when supplies are critically low.
Mr. Stern of Southern California Edison and several private-sector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order. They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high. The bigger worry: Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight, they say.
Mr. Massey, the Democratic commissioner, dissented from the decision for those reasons. Because most high-priced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours, he argued, the commission effectively chose to bless as "just and reasonable" the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis.
"The problem with my agency is that we're so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that we've gotten sloppy," Mr. Massey said. "We're talking about electricity. It's the juice of the economy, so it's got to be available and reasonably priced."

Markets Call the Tune

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Gail Collins is on vacation.

 BODY:
I was talking to a friend on Wall Street about what impact the plunging Dow and Nasdaq might have on U.S. foreign policy, when he stopped me and said, "Look, the Nasdaq is America's Viagra -- without it, we just don't feel quite so potent."
 I wouldn't exaggerate the impact of the declining markets on U.S. foreign policy -- we mounted the Persian Gulf War during an economic slowdown. Nevertheless, part of the expansiveness of U.S. foreign policy during the past decade -- whether it was our intensive diplomacy in Northern Ireland and the Middle East, or our expansion of NATO, or our aggressive exporting of American capitalism, or our interventions in Bosnia, Haiti and Kosovo -- was to some degree tied to the soaring U.S. Dow and Nasdaq and the sense they produced of boundless American power. 
 There were plenty of good reasons to intervene to halt mass killings in the Balkans, but the soaring markets made these and other interventions much easier. There wasn't great public support for many of these operations, but there also wasn't much opposition because the costs were not big enough to notice -- and that was partly a function of how rich we felt. With the Nasdaq at 5,000, the public's attitude was that we could afford guns and butter, Arabs and Israelis, Northern Ireland and Nafta -- whatever. 
But with the Nasdaq's having fallen from 5,000 to 1,900, I sense that the public's attitude has gone from "Whatever" to "What did you say?" The same thing happened in Japan. When the Nikkei soared a decade ago, Japan was demanding a seat on the U.N. Security Council and sending peacekeeping missions abroad. With the Nikkei now in the tank, you don't hear much of that talk any more. With 50 percent of Americans now invested in the stock market and the markets collapsing, the public's tolerance for solving other people's problems has surely diminished. A broker friend called me to say that his mother had called him to complain that Alan Greenspan had lowered interest rates only 50 basis points, instead of 75. "Ten years ago my mother had never heard of Greenspan," the broker said. "Now she has an opinion on monetary policy."
But the soaring Nasdaq was not the only reason for American expansiveness abroad in the past decade. It also had to do with the fact that there is no more military draft, so none of the idle rich, no dot-com-ers, had to give up their stock options to serve in Bosnia or Haiti, and even more important, those who did go went with the assumption, and almost the promise, that these would be "zero-casualty wars." Americans had the same attitude toward the Nasdaq in the past decade that they had toward foreign wars: they were both no-lose propositions. You couldn't get hurt in either the Nasdaq or Kosovo, it seemed, so why not do both?
But now the laws of economics have brought down bloated tech stocks, and the laws of geopolitics -- that nature abhors a vacuum and if NATO doesn't fill the vacuum in Kosovo the local Albanian nationalists will -- have raised the stakes in the Balkans. Staying in both the stock market and Kosovo now has real costs.
Not only do we look at the world differently with the Nasdaq at 1,900, but the world looks at us differently. There's already a tendency among critics of U.S.-style capitalism to read the bursting of the Nasdaq bubble as an indictment of the American system and the vitality of our society. This is wrong and will be demonstrated as such when this business cycle ends. Meantime, one must agree with Jeff Garten, dean of Yale's School of Management, when he argues: "In the post-cold-war world the currency of a country's credibility is the strength of its economy. And to the extent that America was seen as having the magic formula, the rest of the world was willing to follow our lead. Now you will hear America's critics declaring, 'Who are these Americans to throw their weight around and tell us what to do?' "
Again, public moods alone don't determine foreign policy and would never stand in the way of wars of no choice. But the point about the post-cold-war era is that we feel it gives us more choices to intervene or not. And the markets, which have become the background Muzak of our lives, will affect the public's choices, especially if they turn costly. Background Muzak matters. If it didn't, companies wouldn't pay to put it in elevators.

HEADLINE: The Census Shows Growth In Atlanta's Population 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 22 

 BODY:
The unstoppable growth in northern Georgia has finally spilled into the city of Atlanta, reversing a population decline that began in the 1970's and shifting the city's demographics, the latest census figures show.
 Between 1990 and 2000, the city of Atlanta grew to 416,474 from 415,219 people, an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent. But just as surprising to demographers was the fact that much of the growth was the result of whites moving back to the city after years of flight. 
 There were 130,222 white, non-Hispanic residents of Atlanta last year, the census figures show, compared with 122,877 in 1990, an increase of 6 percent. At the same time, the number of black residents in the city declined to 254,062 from 279,987, a decrease of 9 percent. Blacks are no longer two-thirds of the city's population, slipping to 61 percent, while the percentage of whites increased to 31 percent from 29 percent. The number of Hispanics -- who can be of any race -- more than doubled in the city, increasing to 4.5 percent of the population from 2 percent. 
The region's enormous growth began around the same time as the city's population decline, in the late 1960's and early 1970's. As white residents began leaving the city for the suburbs in response to desegregation, they were joined there by millions of newcomers from the Northeast and Midwest, attracted to the region's improving economy.
The city never again reached its peak of 496,973 in 1970, but the 20-county region boomed to 4.1 million residents last year from 1.8 million residents in 1970, the census numbers show. By far the largest increase occurred in the last decade, when the region grew by 39 percent.
The comparison of census data uses an adjusted figure for 1990 that adds an estimate of undercounted residents, mostly members of minorities, believed to be missed in the original census. The 2000 figures have not been adjusted, but last year's census was considered more accurate in counting minorities.
Using the unadjusted figure for 1990 -- 393,929 -- the city's population increased by nearly 6 percent during the decade.
Analysts said the shifts in the city were a result of the region's growth.
"From what we're seeing, it looks like a migration back into the city, probably from people tired of all those commutes," said Robert Giacomini, research director for the state data center at the Georgia Institute of Technology. "These numbers are higher than expected for Atlanta, and I think they reflect the fact that traffic here is becoming national news."
Most of the growth in the city is within a few minutes drive of downtown, where new residents are renovating older houses and moving into a growing number of apartments and lofts. Officials have been trying to encourage new housing and office space around subway stations, hoping to reduce the traffic and air pollution that have become the region's new symbols. There has been little indication that the number of miles driven in the region has declined, but officials expressed hope today that the new numbers raised the possibility of a turnaround.
While whites are returning to the city, the increasing economic power of blacks has propelled many into the suburbs, particularly in the less-congested southern tier of the region that has proved less popular in previous years with white newcomers.
Clayton County, southeast of Atlanta, was 24 percent black in 1990 and is now 51 percent black. DeKalb County, to the east (and including a section of Atlanta), was 42 percent black, and is now 53 percent black.
But the numbers show that white residents are also moving to the southern tier of the metropolitan area, seeking the easier traffic and lower housing prices than they have found in the northern crescent that has been the engine of the region's suburban growth. Henry County, an 80 percent white county wedged between DeKalb and Clayton, has doubled in population in the last decade.
"A county like Henry is growing by selling to the entry-level housing market," said Bart Lewis, chief researcher for the Atlanta Regional Commission, a planning body. "You can buy a $150,000 house there and have a 40-minute commute, or a house for the same price on the north side and a 90-minute commute. Congestion is driving the patterns of growth."
Over all, Georgia's population grew by 23 percent in the last decade, to 8.2 million people, an increase that moved the state to 10th in population from 11th and gave it two new Congressional seats. The number of Hispanics increased sharply to 435,227 from 115,615, and in several counties, one in five residents is Hispanic.
Other cities around the South also grew in the last decade, census figures show. Memphis grew to 650,100 people from 640,033, an increase of 1.6 percent, while Nashville grew to 569,891 people from 532,471, an increase of 7 percent. In North Carolina, Charlotte grew to 540,828 from 412,486, a 31 percent increase, while Raleigh grew to 276,093 from 215,578, a 28 percent increase.
But New Orleans declined substantially, moving to 484,674 residents last year from 514,554 in 1990, a loss of nearly 6 percent. Louisiana's economy has not been as successful as that of Southern states farther east, and the state grew only 3 percent in the 1990's.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A New Look at Race in the States"Throughout this month, the Census Bureau is releasing state population figures by race and ethnicity. Categories in 2000 are not directly comparable with those in 1990 because the 2000 questionnaire was the first to let people identify themselves with more than one race. Figures listed here were made public yesterday.

SWISS RATE CUT

BYLINE:  By Elizabeth Olson 

 BODY:
 The Swiss National Bank has lowered a key interest rate by a quarter percentage point, two days after the Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate in the United States by half a percentage point. 
It was the first such change in the Swiss rate since June. The bank said Switzerland's economic growth this year would be below the 2.2 percent it had forecast in December. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)

The New State Budget, All Versions, Is Bigger

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 22 

 BODY:
Every day, newspapers tell of signs that the economy is slowing, of state and local governments having to trim their sails. The talk nearly everywhere is of caution and cuts.
 But not in Albany, and especially not in the Assembly. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, proposed a 5.4 percent spending increase in the next state budget, to $83.7 billion. The Republican-controlled Senate's plan is a bit larger and calls for more tax cuts. And on Tuesday, the Democrats who control the Assembly called for an 8.2 percent increase, to $86 billion. 
The governor says that the Legislature, particularly the Assembly, is acting as if New York were immune to what ails the nation. "There's no doubt in my mind or most people's minds that we're facing a very real national economic slowdown," he said.
Mr. Pataki has built the state's reserve funds to record levels, to protect against a downturn. The Citizens Budget Commission, an independent group, praised his proposed budget as the most prudent in 16 years (though what counts as prudence here would be a spending binge elsewhere).
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, points to the state's large surplus, its healthy tax revenues and its pressing needs in education and other areas, and concludes that now is no time for an excess of caution.
But the governor repeatedly cites what happened in 1990, when a recession hit, the state was unprepared and lawmakers had to make midyear budget cuts. Mr. Pataki, then a little-known assemblyman, has called that a watershed experience for him, one he vows not to repeat.

It Takes Awhile
Bet on the state budget being late this year. Very late.
The budget is supposed to be adopted by April 1, the start of the fiscal year. Nice theory. It hasn't happened since 1984. The only question is whether it will be manageably late, or infuriatingly late.
Recent history strongly suggests that this will be a bad year, and not because of mere substantive disagreements (though there are plenty of those). It's all about odd-numbered years.
In an even-numbered year, every member of the Legislature is up for re-election. No one likes to be stuck in Albany while an opponent traipses around the home district, blaming the incumbent for a late budget. Besides, election-year budgets usually contain enough pork to send everyone home happy without too much fighting.
Lawmakers finished the budget in April in 1998, and in May last year; in both years, the legislative session ended on time, in mid-June. In 1997 and 1999, budget negotiations, and the session, dragged into August.
"When we go into the summer, a lot of spouses call and say, 'I'm going to Cape Cod whether you do or not,' " said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "But sometimes that doesn't have the same pull that a re-election drive does."

Aid to Schools
The three sides are far apart on aid to local schools. The governor wants to increase it by less than 3 percent, the Senate Republicans by 7 percent, and the Assembly Democrats by 13 percent, a spread of more than $1.3 billion.
But looked at another way, there is remarkable agreement. All three sides have proposed similar approaches to restructuring education spending. There are important differences in the details, but all three have called for collapsing the many different categories of aid into a few, giving districts more flexibility in spending that money, and funneling any increases in aid primarily to "high need" districts like New York City.
"We're all in the same ballpark," said Senator John R. Kuhl Jr., chairman of the Senate Education Committee. "Everyone understands the need for flexibility."
In a landmark ruling in January, Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ordered the state to increase aid to the city's schools and to simplify the tangled knot of aid formulas. Mr. Pataki has said he will appeal the decision, but the budget proposals here could be seen as a first, small step toward complying with it and unraveling a byzantine system.
Then there is the matter of that $1.3 billion.

A Statistical Anomaly
The Assembly Democrats call themselves the defenders of poor communities and public schools. So it was odd to find that their proposed budget would raise education aid to wealthy districts next year much faster than it would raise aid to poor districts.
That kind of disparity is an especially important issue in the wake of Justice DeGrasse's ruling, which has prompted a heated public debate over the adequacy and equity of school aid in New York. Urban Democrats who dominate the Assembly support the decision, while their Republican colleagues and some suburban Democrats oppose it.
Yet in the Assembly's own budget plan, Garden City and Scarsdale, two wealthy suburban districts, would receive state aid increases of 35 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Elmont and Yonkers, two nearby low-income districts, would get 15 percent and 17 percent, respectively.
What gives? It all stems from the Assembly Democrats' pet program to help districts provide prekindergarten classes for 4-year-olds, and smaller classes in kindergarten through third grade.
In the first years of the program, nearly all the money went to poorer districts, while the wealthier ones will catch up next year. Those wealthy districts receive relatively little state aid, so even a fairly small increase in dollars can be a huge increase in percentage.
In other words, the apparent generosity to high-income communities is a statistical anomaly, one that would disappear after a year.
Mr. Silver and his colleagues have proposed a two-year education budget, a departure from the usual practice. "We're doing this to lock the governor into an election-year commitment to education," he said.
But some Assembly Democrats say privately that the sole reason for doing so was to avoid the embarrassment of appearing to favor wealthy areas over poor ones.

NEW YORK CITY RESISTS SLUMP

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
 Statistics released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor show New York City with a jobless rate of 5.3 percent in February, up slightly from the 5.1 percent in January but still below the 5.6 percent in December, when economic jitters began to sweep the country. 
And the city continues to generate new jobs at a rapid pace. Employment at private-sector companies grew by 2.5 percent in the 12 months ended in February, while nationally, employment rose by just 1.4 percent. Manufacturing suffered its sharpest drop since January of 1996, according to Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi. But there has been a surge of demand for secretaries and administrative assistants.

HEADLINE: In Leaving Seattle, Boeing Also Asserts It's Not Just a Plane Builder 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company's surprising plan to move its headquarters out of Seattle 85 years after the company's founding there represents the boldest step yet in a quest it has been chasing nearly as long: escaping the economic ups and downs of aircraft manufacturing. 
 As early as 1918, two years after its founding, Boeing decided to make flat-bottom boats and furniture to counter the slump in airplane sales after World War I. After World War II ended, it began making gas-turbine engines. And in the late 1960's, when aircraft sales dried up for more than a year, Boeing started making hydrofoils, wind-powered turbines and police-radio scramblers. 
 None of these businesses caught on, and Boeing ultimately abandoned them when commercial plane sales rebounded. As a result, its share price has soared and plunged over the years, and it has laid off thousands of workers only to hire them back when jet sales picked up. 
Having made more than $20 billion worth of acquisitions over the last four years, Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, has done more than any of his predecessors to diversify the company. Now Mr. Condit thinks he must take a startling step -- moving Boeing's headquarters to sever both the physical and psychological ties to its long heritage as a plane builder.
In announcing the headquarters move on Wednesday, Mr. Condit said he hoped the relocation to Dallas, Denver or Chicago, which he said would be completed by the fall, would show Wall Street analysts and investors that Boeing was no longer just a maker of passenger jets.
But that is also a risk because while there are some promising signs, it is not at all clear that Mr. Condit's corporate strategy will be any more successful than the company's past efforts. 
"Even if you diversify, you still have the problem of not being able to move people from one business to another," said David C. Colander, a professor of economics at Middlebury College in Vermont. "When the airplane sales drop, you still have all those employees with nothing to do." 
There is nothing wrong with having a cyclical business, he added, if you are profitable on average. 
Since buying the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the space operations of Rockwell International and the satellite manufacturing division of Hughes Electronics, Boeing has become the world's largest aerospace company. It is now organized into three independent divisions: commercial airplanes, space and communications, and military aircraft and missile systems. 
But the company relied on the airplane business for 61 percent of its operating revenue last year, down from 66 percent in 1999. That and its military business face the prospect of slow growth in the near future. And several of the businesses that Mr. Condit is hoping will deliver big profits are highly risky and may not bear fruit for many years. 
Last year, Boeing announced that it would enter the market to supply live Internet connections on passenger jets. That business seemed like an ideal opportunity to combine the expertise of Boeing's satellite and aircraft manufacturing divisions. 
But airlines' enthusiasm for the in-flight Internet has since cooled. The practical questions of how much the carriers are willing to pay to install the equipment on their jets and how much of the revenue they are willing to share with Boeing have proved more complicated than expected.
In addition, it is not clear that large numbers of passengers would be willing to pay a premium to surf the Net at 30,000 feet. The market is likely to take many years to develop. 
Mr. Condit is also excited about an initiative to develop a new air traffic control system, using satellite technology. That would both make Boeing a tidy sum and provide room in the skies for more Boeing jets. But like the military contracting business, air traffic control systems are expensive to develop and appeal to only a small number of customers. 
Boeing has had more immediate success expanding its aircraft services business. It won contracts to convert fleets of passenger jets to freighters and has entered the maintenance business, which has put it in competition with some of its big customers. 
The company is also taking a cue from its old rival McDonnell Douglas by moving into the finance business. Using the parent company's wealthy balance sheet, the Boeing Capital Corporation helps finance the sale of products across all Boeing divisions and is to be expanded. 
"If you look at Boeing, the picture that you have is of a company that is generating a flood of cash," said Wolfgang Demisch, an investment banker at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, who has followed Boeing for years. "The critical issue from a corporate perspective is how do you deploy that cash for the benefit of the shareholders."
Last year, Mr. Condit used some of the cash to buy the Hughes satellite business as well as Jeppesen Sanderson, a maker of digital navigation maps and other information, and a handful of other companies. Yesterday, he told analysts that Boeing might make other acquisitions, particularly in the finance arena. 
At the same time he announced the headquarters move, Mr. Condit gave each of the heads of the three main operating units the title of president and chief executive. Since all three are already in charge of their divisions, it is difficult to tell whether the new titles are simply cosmetic. 
But Mr. Condit said he planned to push much of the decision-making down to the operating units, leaving the new, leaner headquarters the job of focusing on the company's overall strategy. 
"The role of the headquarters is to make sure we are incubating new, dynamic businesses," he said. 
The move may accelerate Boeing's transformation into a truly global company. For while it has had a presence in scores of countries for decades, Boeing's top managers and its board remained more insular than many other American multinational corporations. 
It remains to be seen whether Boeing will be any more successful conquering new businesses as a company based outside Seattle than it has been in past attempts.

HEADLINE: Schwab Plans Up to 3,400 Job Cuts 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
The Charles Schwab Corporation, forecasting no rebound in investor sentiment this year, said yesterday that it would eliminate 11 percent to 13 percent of its work force and warned that its first-quarter earnings would fall short of already lowered expectations.
 Shares of Schwab, the nation's largest online brokerage firm, fell 4 percent, or 70 cents, to $15.20, the stock's lowest closing price in more than two years. 
 The job cuts, to come mostly through layoffs in the second quarter, will reduce Schwab's work force of 25,500 by 2,750 to 3,400. The company expects the job cuts, as well as planned reductions in office space and spending on technology, to save $40 million to $50 million a quarter, starting in the second half of the year. 
Schwab officials also said the company would earn 8 cents a share in the first quarter, 3 cents short of the consensus expectations of analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Schwab had warned in February that it would not meet the previous consensus estimate of 15 cents a share.
"We face a period where our clients are trading less, and trading less in a profound way," David S. Pottruck, co-chief executive of Schwab, said.
Schwab is responding to mounting pressures felt across the brokerage industry as the long boom has given way to a bear market. Merrill Lynch, Bear, Stearns and other securities firms have announced job cuts in recent months, but most Wall Street firms have avoided layoffs despite the steep slump in their businesses.
Schwab had tried to stave off layoffs, using voluntary Friday leaves and executive salary cuts but they provided only a temporary reprieve, an official said. 
The spending cuts that brokerage firms are making to appease shareholders could give an edge to privately held competitors, like Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund and brokerage firm. "The biggest risk to Schwab is that private companies like Fidelity really pick up their investment spending," said Amy Butte, an analyst with Bear Stearns.
Schwab's existing account balances have shrunk and the appetite of customers for trading has fallen sharply. Schwab's average daily revenue from trades was $189,000 in February, down from $279,400 a year ago, a 32.4 percent decline. Margin loans, which allow customers to borrow money to buy more securities, have plummeted, further cutting into the firm's revenues. 
It is also harder to attract new accounts. Last February, the firm landed 150,700 new accounts, compared with 78,500 this February. 
As a result, Schwab is having to retrench from its expansion and spend more time digesting its recent purchases of U.S. Trust, a firm that helps wealthy clients manage their money, and CyBerCorp Inc., a broker for active do-it-yourself traders. The acquisition of both companies was completed last year. 
Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said he supported both acquisitions in the long term, but believed that integrating them would prove costly in the short term, especially as Schwab faces a bleak market environment. He said Schwab's revenue had fallen 29 percent from a year ago but its earnings per share had declined far more, 65 percent. 
"You haven't gotten the payoff yet," Mr. McVey said. 
Charles R. Schwab, the founder and co-chief executive, said the firm had expanded to meet the surging demands of customers during the bull market.
"We've been through a highly speculative technology bubble," Mr. Schwab said. "Maybe I should have been more emphatic about understanding it was only a temporary phenomenon, but we weren't sure."
Now that stock trading is waning, Mr. Schwab and Mr. Pottruck said customers wanted more advice. That demand prompted the firm to shield U.S. Trust from the job cuts, as customers seek the firm's advisory services. 
"U.S. Trust will not be affected by these cutbacks because the business continues to grow and grow very nicely," Mr. Pottruck said.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about layoffs at the Charles Schwab Corporation referred incorrectly to a measure of the online brokerage firm's revenue-generating trades last month. They numbered 189,000 in an average day; the trades did not generate $189,000.

HEADLINE: Clinton Critic Is Bush Choice To Run F.T.C. 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
Signaling a sharp shift in the enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws, the White House announced today its intention to nominate Timothy J. Muris, a leading critic of the Clinton administration's antitrust policies, to become the next chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
 The nomination of Mr. Muris, a 51-year-old economist and law professor who was a top antitrust official during the Reagan administration and an economic adviser to both President Bush and his father, was widely expected. 
 Experts said today that it was certain to lead to a significant easing of reviews of corporate mergers and a far less aggressive policy toward prosecuting cases of monopoly. 
Mr. Muris has long maintained that the Clinton administration challenged too many mergers and filed too many antimonopoly cases without adequately exploring the potential benefits that large companies bring to consumers in the form of efficient production and distribution. Although liberals have in recent years become more sympathetic to efficiencies as a defense to mergers and monopolistic conduct, Mr. Muris has said antitrust regulators needed to go further.
"Efficiency defenses will undoubtedly be taken more seriously under a Muris regime," said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust scholar at the University of Iowa College of Law. "His appointment is clearly a move to the right. He's more aligned with the Reagan era of antitrust, but I wouldn't regard him as far right."
Mr. Muris's views of the Clinton administration's handling of monopoly cases is aptly summarized in an article he wrote on the subject last summer in the Antitrust Law Journal. The three main chapters in the article are titled "The F.T.C. is Wrong on the Law," "The F.T.C. is Wrong on Policy" and "The F.T.C. is Wrong on the Facts."
In the article, he criticized the agency's decision to sue Visx, a maker of laser vision correction equipment, and Intel, the chip maker, for antitrust violations in two important monopoly cases. (Visx won its case; Intel settled its case on the eve of trial.)
In an article two years ago on antitrust reviews of corporate mergers, he criticized the Clinton administration's handling of mergers. While he praised officials for accepting the arguments of merging companies that such deals produced important economic efficiencies that could benefit consumers, he said the administration had not gone far enough.
"The government antitrust agencies -- the antitrust division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission -- have refused to recognize fully the efficiency-creating potential of mergers," Mr. Muris wrote in the George Mason Law Review's spring 1999 issue. "Although the government's treatment of efficiencies has varied, one theme dominates: a reluctance to accept efficiency as a justification for a transaction."
In particular, Mr. Muris has criticized a series of cases that have been the hallmark of the tenure of the current chairman, Robert Pitofsky. Mr. Muris has criticized the agency's decision to challenge two mergers among the nation's four largest wholesale drug distributors, and another deal that would leave two companies controlling 98 percent of the United States market for prepared baby foods. 
Antitrust experts predicted that the F.T.C. under Mr. Muris would not bring many cases of the kind that Mr. Pitofsky had brought. 
"In merger reviews, the bread and butter of antitrust, many people say Muris will only make a difference at the margins," said Steven C. Salop, a professor of law and economics at the Georgetown University Law Center. "I think those margins could be quite big."
At the same time, Mr. Salop and Mr. Hovenkamp said, Mr. Muris has shown that he supports cases against trade associations and other affiliations involving rivals that collaborate in ways that can discourage competition.
"I think you will see him becoming more active in those instances where there is rule-making by professional associations," Mr. Hovenkamp said, "particularly where the rule-making has an impact on price or restraint on advertising."
Mr. Pitofsky, who has been chairman for the last six years, said today that he would step aside as soon as the Senate confirmed Mr. Muris. Mr. Pitofsky, who is widely credited by his supporters with reinvigorating antitrust enforcement, said he would return to teaching at the Georgetown University Law Center, where he had been the dean.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Business Effort Urged on Cyberterror 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
The government must work more closely with private companies to prevent cyberterrorist attacks that threaten to disrupt the nation's economy, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said today. 
 "Today, the cybereconomy is the economy," Ms. Rice said, referring to the nation's dependence on computers for vital services, including electricity, transportation, banking and communications. 
 "Corrupt those networks, and you disrupt this nation," she said here at a forum on Internet security. 
Financial losses from cyberattacks reached nearly $400 million last year, a 40 percent increase over the year before, industry figures show.
To discourage attacks in cyberspace, the nation must take additional steps to increase security and must be prepared if deterrents fail, Ms. Rice said.

HEADLINE: First Meeting: China Testing Firmer Way Of Bush Team 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
President Bush met today with the Chinese deputy prime minister, Qian Qichen, in an Oval Office session that highlighted the sharp discord between the United States and China on security issues and human rights, but appeared to do little to resolve it.
 The 55-minute meeting was Mr. Bush's first contact as president with a high-level emissary from Beijing and it came at a key time in the evolving relationship between the two countries. Mr. Qian, a senior Chinese diplomat who has seen American presidents come and go, approached the session as an opportunity to sound out a new administration that has from the start signaled a firmer approach toward China. 
 With Qian Qichen (pronounced chee-en chee-chun) sitting at his side, Mr. Bush told reporters before the meeting that he intended to foster good relations with China but also to speak out bluntly on disagreements. In private, the president urged the Chinese to respect human rights and religious freedom, and encouraged Beijing to release Gao Zhan, a Chinese scholar based in the United States who has been held in China in isolation for more than five weeks, officials said.
"Nothing we do is a threat to you and I want you to tell that to your leadership," Mr. Bush told Mr. Qian, according to an administration official who briefed reporters. 
During his visit here, Mr. Qian pressed China's opposition to the United States' sale to Taiwan of destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system, but Mr. Bush indicated that he would move forward with assistance for Taiwan. Bush administration officials said the White House would make a decision on the exact package of arms sales to the Taiwanese next month and that the Chinese could best affect shipments by working to reduce tensions along the Taiwan Strait.
The Chinese have placed hundreds of short-range missiles near the island, American officials say, and Mr. Qian made comments before his arrival here indicating that the chance of military conflict would increase if the Bush administration proceeded with the Aegis sale. Mr. Qian's language in the Oval Office was more restrained, officials said. 
Mr. Bush's proposed national missile defense system was another point of contention, as Mr. Qian reiterated China's opposition. Mr. Bush offered a pitch in favor of a missile shield, telling Mr. Qian that it ought to reduce tensions. 
While Bush aides focused largely on the strategic challenges posed by China, the president was facing several economic hurdles as well. 
Last year Congress passed legislation giving China permanent normal trade relations with the United States, ending more than a decade of efforts to link a yearly renewal of its trade status to its human rights record. Mr. Bush supported the legislation, which was tied to China's entry into the World Trade Organization, long a goal of Beijing's leaders.
But now that the Chinese have won the battle in Congress, they are delaying the final negotiations with the W.T.O. The reason is clear: China's obligation to open its markets to foreign competition, putting more Chinese out of work and increasing political pressure on the Communist Party, does not begin until it formally becomes a member of the trade group, which sets the rules for global commerce.
"Our relationship, of course, will be a complex relationship," said Mr. Bush, who will visit China in October. "There will be areas where we can find agreement, such as trade. There will be some areas where we have some disagreements."
Earlier, Mr. Qian met separately with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and a bipartisan group of lawmakers that included Senator Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.
"He came here to take the temperature of the new president and report back to his bosses on the new team," said a Senate foreign policy aide. Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of the most vociferous critics of China, stayed away from Mr. Qian's breakfast meeting on Capitol Hill.
At dinner on Wednesday night, General Powell raised the issue of human rights violations in China during a wide-ranging conversation with Mr. Qian. The Chinese leader, as expected, disputed General Powell's view that the Chinese have restricted press freedom in Hong Kong and clamped down on the Falun Gong religious sect, a senior State Department official said.
Likewise, when Mr. Bush urged the release of Gao Zhan, whose husband and 5-year-old son were also held separately for 26 days, Mr. Qian said without going into detail that she may not have been aware she was violating the law, the administration official said.

HEADLINE: Repercussions of a Spy Case 

 BODY:
As the United States and Russia embark on a series of retaliatory diplomatic expulsions initiated by the Robert Hanssen spy affair, the two nations should not let the skirmishing escalate into a diplomatic donnybrook. American and Russian leaders face a host of important security, political and economic issues. An espionage case, however serious, ought not to shape relations between Washington and Moscow. 
 Expelling foreign diplomats in retaliation for espionage cases is a well-established international ritual. So it was no surprise that the Bush administration responded to last month's arrest of Mr. Hanssen, an F.B.I. spy hunter charged with selling American secrets to Moscow, by ejecting a number of Russian diplomats. What was unusual was the scope of the American retaliation. In all, 50 Russians have been told to leave, the largest number since Ronald Reagan expelled 80 Soviet diplomats in 1986. Moscow has already signaled that it will respond with expulsions of American diplomats from Russia. 
 Expulsions on this scale could put an early chill into relations with Moscow. Mr. Reagan's 1986 expulsions temporarily complicated diplomacy with the Soviet Union. But that episode was overtaken by the arms control initiatives of Mikhail Gorbachev and Mr. Reagan's positive responses. It was encouraging to hear President Bush declare yesterday that he still sought "good relations" with Russia. 
There is a clear rationale for narrowly targeted diplomatic expulsions. Americans suspected of spying, like Mr. Hanssen, can be arrested. But their foreign controllers are usually intelligence agents working under diplomatic cover. The standard recourse is to declare these individuals persona non grata and demand their departure. 
These 50 expulsions send a strong message. Given the damage alleged to have been done by Mr. Hanssen, including the betrayal of Russians who were spying for the United States, a vigorous response was justified. He is accused of compromising some of Washington's most sensitive spy operations. But after Moscow inevitably responds with its own expulsions, it will be time to move on. 
Before Mr. Bush meets Vladimir Putin in July, the two need to turn their attention to other pressing issues. These include America's missile defense plans, the need for both sides to make additional cuts in their nuclear arsenals and the cooperative programs the two countries have developed to dismantle decommissioned Russian nuclear weapons left over from the cold war. New measures should be taken to help Moscow safeguard its nuclear materials from theft. Russia's plans to sell conventional arms to Iran must also be addressed, as must be its cooperation with Tehran in the construction of nuclear reactors in ways that could speed the Iranian development of nuclear weapons. 
With Mr. Putin giving Russian foreign policy a more nationalist edge, there is already a growing possibility that relations between Moscow and Washington will become more quarrelsome. But it would be unfortunate if the Hanssen case set the tone for Mr. Bush's dealings with Mr. Putin.

HEADLINE: Piety at Kyoto Didn't Cool the Planet 

BYLINE:  By David G. Victor; David G. Victor is senior fellow for science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of the forthcoming "The Collapse of the Kyoto Protocol and the Struggle to Slow Global Warming."

 BODY:
President Bush met a barrage of criticism last week when he backed away from regulating carbon dioxide emissions, but he was only hastening the inevitable. A major shift in American policy on global warming had to come -- not chiefly because of the new administration's debts to campaign donors, but because of the sheer impracticality of the policy in place when George Bush took office. In the long run, Mr. Bush may actually have improved chances for slowing manmade changes in the world's climate.
 Until last week, global warming policy was synonymous with the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to control emissions of greenhouse gases according to strict targets and timetables. Environment ministers dominated the negotiations that led to the 1997 protocol, and they sought targets that were symbolically tough but hopelessly unrealistic. 
 Caught in this fervor, the United States agreed in Kyoto to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases to 7 percent below 1990 levels, on average, from 2008 to 2012. Yet on the eve of the Kyoto negotiations America's emissions were already up nearly 10 percent from 1990 levels, and they have risen about 1.2 percent a year since then. Most of the facilities that will be burning fossil fuels from 2008 to 2012 are already in place today. For that reason alone, the Kyoto Protocol was never likely to be approved and implemented by Congress. Other industrialized countries, too, have recorded rising, not falling, emissions.
Even as it became clear that most governments could not deliver on their Kyoto promises, powerful environmental groups and influential Green parties redoubled their support for the treaty rather than admit the need for adjustment. Under this pressure, every government in every industrialized nation has officially pretended the protocol was workable.
Kyoto's unachievable targets have forced governments into bizarre diplomatic contortions. Some, especially in Europe, approached the Kyoto talks and subsequent negotiations in The Hague with no serious plan for how they would comply with the targets. Others, including the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan, are pushing for an international emissions trading system whose main effect would be to let them buy vast quantities of bogus emission credits from Russia and Ukraine. At Kyoto, Russia and Ukraine agreed to freeze their emissions at 1990 levels, but because of the collapse of the Soviet economy, they were already emitting greenhouse gases at 40 percent below those levels. So the emissions "reductions" they have available to sell are not real.
By making it clear that the United States won't pretend to meet the Kyoto limits, the Bush administration has, for all intents and purposes, killed the Kyoto Protocol. Now it has a responsibility to build an alternative.
America is ready for a sound policy. The Kyoto Protocol's demise is erasing unrealistic ambitions on the left, and a swelling majority of centrists now recognizes the need for precaution on burning carbon-based fuels. Conservative voices that oppose any control on carbon are fading as more Americans accept the scientific consensus on global warming.
The administration and Congress could assemble a sensible package from legislation already in the works. We should sharply increase funding for research and development on affordable ways to move the economy entirely away from fossil fuels over the next several decades and raise efficiency of fossil-fuel burning in the interim. We should also create an incentive for companies to limit emissions by letting them trade carbon emission permits. Unlike the sulphur dioxide trading system created in 1990 to control acid rain, this one should let the government issue new permits, allowing more emissions, if prices for the credits ever rise above a certain level. That provision would reassure business that the cost of compliance would not skyrocket if cheaper carbon-saving technologies did not become available.
This sort of program would embody the principle around which an effective global emissions reduction regime could also be built -- economic incentives that, over time, will slow the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere without the imposition of binding targets for a far-off future.
The rest of the world is ready to pin the blame for the Kyoto Protocol's demise on the United States, though all nations that crafted the compact really share the blame. The sooner America takes the lead in devising effective new policies, the better it can lead the world beyond Kyoto.

HEADLINE: Fox, on Tour, Stresses Mexico's Economic Importance for California 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 22 

 BODY:
In his first trip to the United States since becoming president of Mexico, Vicente Fox has traveled across California proclaiming to state legislators, farm workers and high-tech executives the economic importance of the Mexican-Californian relationship.
 He also pledged to work as hard for the rights of Mexicans in the United States as for those at home. 
 In a speech to the state Legislature, Mr. Fox pressed the officials to reconsider legislation to offer educational help to Mexicans with established residency in California. The bill, which Mr. Fox's host, Gov. Gray Davis, vetoed on the ground that it would be too expensive, would have let the Mexicans with residency qualify for in-state tuition benefits to attend state-run universities. 
In a luncheon today with Los Angeles business and civic leaders, Mr. Fox pointed out that Mexico was the state's largest trading partner. Investments have risen by 43 percent in the last two years, officials said. 
The president praised the free trade agreement among Mexico, Canada and the United States. But he also acknowledged that for Mexico to become a fully equal partner with the United States and Canada, it would need to work to close the income gap that divides Mexico from its northern neighbor and forces hundreds of thousands of Mexicans each year to abandon their country.
To rousing applause from the corporate audience in Los Angeles, the president pledged to "open Mexico to greater flows of investment" and to use the new earnings to develop new jobs, to eradicate corruption and to improve education for the rich and poor.
Earlier President Fox visited a suburban elementary school in the company of Laura Bush, the first lady. 
Mr. Fox delivered his most passionate statements today in a meeting with 10,000 Mexican-American farm workers and community leaders in Fresno. 
Calling them "permanent cultural ambassadors," Mr. Fox told the audience that he would do all that he could to win the passage of laws in Mexico so that Mexicans abroad would have the right to vote in Mexican elections.
"You are important," he said. "Believe me, you are very important."
Speaking to business leaders, Mr. Fox restated his commitment to Mexicans living in the United States. "No more talking about migration as a problem," Mr. Fox said. "From now on, we will make migration an opportunity for the future. We are going to make sure that migration is an asset for both our countries."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Chairman Under Republican Fire Back Home 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
As he commutes here to his new second job as Republican national chairman, Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia leaves behind a scathing example of how rough politics can get within his party: A group of Republicans in his own State Senate have joined Democrats in forming a fund-raising committee to oppose him in a running battle over the party's signature issue of cutting taxes.
 The unusual committee has incensed Mr. Gilmore by attracting fellow Statehouse Republicans at a time when he is supposed to be the national model of successful party unity and tax-cutting skills. 
 "The word is that it's an effort to undermine me," Mr. Gilmore said of the bipartisan alliance. But "I don't think I can be intimidated," he declared crisply in his office at the Republican National Committee. 
If nothing else, Governor Gilmore, a very successful 51-year-old politician long known for his tenacity, is showing intraparty steel in his new job as national chairman. That Republican flagship post was offered him by President Bush after Mr. Gilmore guided the Virginia Republican machine last year to an overwhelming Bush primary victory that finally stopped the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. 
But as he serves out his last year as governor, an escalating budget struggle with some of his own party's leaders in the Republican-controlled State Senate is casting a shadow on his efforts to take firm hold of the national party machinery. 
The governor, noting that the struggle is over his keystone 1997 election pledge to eliminate the state's automobile tax, is far from ducking the fight; he is depicting the battle with his foes as a crucial test of voters' expectations that Republicans can be trusted to deliver on their promise to cut taxes.
"If they're going to be pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into trying to tear me down nationally or locally in order to get me to go back on my promise to the people, that's just not going to happen," Mr. Gilmore said. "They should remember we Republicans have prevailed on the tax issue nationally. Keeping faith with the people is our No. 1 goal."
But his Senate critics insist that with state revenue now slowing with the economy, Virginia can no longer fully afford Mr. Gilmore's pledge to eliminate the tax on personal cars and trucks, a step that would save each vehicle owner some $200 or more a year but would impose an annual cost of about $1.2 billion on the state. Further, they say they were driven to organize against the governor because he was already using a political action committee of his own to undermine them unfairly with voters.
"We were being beaten about the head and shoulders by the governor's political machine and his PAC," said Senator Thomas K. Norment Jr., the Republican floor leader who helped organize the bipartisan effort. "I don't think this is in the spirit of leading the R.N.C. as a peacemaker," said Mr. Norment, who contended that the governor was breaking a campaign pledge to hold off on the car tax repeal if budgetary conditions worsened. 
The anti-Gilmore group has 17 Republicans and 17 Democrats from the 40-member Senate. It has hired Golin/Harris, a Chicago public relations firm, to stir protests by editorial writers and leaders from colleges, the arts and other areas suffering in the budget dispute. Senator Norment estimated that it had raised about $40,000 initially, mostly from the senators' own campaign funds, to serve not as a formal PAC but as a nonprofit issue education group. 
That portrayal was challenged by one of the governor's Republican supporters, H. Morgan Griffith, majority leader of the House of Delegates, who maintained that the group behaved like a PAC and was a "smoke screen" for "fat-cat donors." But Senator Norment said it was the governor who was in the "anomalous" position of having perhaps $500,000 from Republican donors in a PAC that he has been tapping to fight Senate leaders of his own party. 
Such an intraparty fracas was hardly anticipated when, in November 1999, the Republicans won control of both legislative houses for the first time in history. But Governor Gilmore, who retains the support of the House Republican majority, fell out with leading Senate Republicans over budget priorities when he insisted that the budget could be balanced even with a two-step elimination of the car tax, cutting it by 70 percent this year and 100 percent in 2002.
The Senate countered with 55 percent this year and 70 percent next year, which would find Mr. Gilmore, barred by term limits from a run for re-election, leaving office without fully delivering on his pledge. Lacking a two-house agreement, the governor acted under state law to issue a controversial two-year budget of $48 billion that included the 70 percent car tax cut but also a raft of state aid cuts for localities and college construction in order to close a $421 million shortfall. 
With this, the rift only widened, leaving Virginians with a public relations face-off between the Republican governor's No Car Tax PAC and the Republican Senate's Virginians for Fiscal Responsibility.
"Constituents are already hammering this guy," said one Democratic senator, Richard L. Saslaw, who maintained that the Senate effort was working and added, "I just hope he does for the R.N.C. finances what he's done for Virginia's." 
Mr. Gilmore contends that he "made the tough choices" while the Senate was trying to keep state finances and aid at the recent high levels so popular with voters. "When the economy begins to slow," he said, "why is it that the promise to the people has to be the one thing that goes out the window?" 
But Senator Norment insisted that the governor's budget tactic was putting their own party at political risk. "There's something inherently contradictory," he said, "about a family feud among Republicans that's being led by a high-profile Republican."

HEADLINE: After 53 Years, Fresh Kills Gets Its Final Load of Trash 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Never has a pile of smelly trash had it so good: When New York City Department of Sanitation scow No. 123 passed by the home of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani early yesterday morning on the East River, his honor stepped out on his porch to salute it. When it passed by the Statue of Liberty, Fire Department water cannons fired into the air. Tugboat whistles screamed. News photographers angled for a close-up.
 The final load of garbage bound for Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island after 53 years of rage and rhetoric was en route, and so what was nothing more than ordinary rubbish from Queens had become invested with meaning. 
 "We waved to it and they signaled to us and it was really absolutely terrific," Mr. Giuliani said later about his encounter with D.S. 123.
Sure, there have been other famous loads of floating New York garbage. A barge named Mobro 4000 with rubbish from a New York City suburb made headlines in the 1980's as the trash that no port would take. Scow D.S. 123, by contrast, was the barge that everyone wanted to welcome home because its 600 tons of household castoffs -- a tattered Christmas wreath, a basketball, a gray sock, a few broom handles -- represented two short but profound words: the end. One of the most notorious garbage dumps in America had taken in its last.
The final barge's final voyage began at the Sanitation Department's North Shore Marine Transfer Station in Flushing, Queens, about 7:45 a.m. in a cold drizzle, under the roar of jets taking from La Guardia Airport. It ended five hours later in a downpour at a landfill loading dock, which, like the barge itself, had been wrapped in red-white-and-blue bunting, and was swarming with damp dignitaries. 
Not everyone was impressed. In the workaday world of the harbor tugboat crews who over the decades hauled an estimated 400,000 garbage barges through the currents and high-volume traffic of the waterfront, the final ride of D.S. 123 was a trip down the river like so many before, except for the load of reporters and camera crews. And the ride also symbolized, for the crews, the end, or at least temporary discontinuation, of an economic mainstay.
"I'd rather not see it close -- for the jobs," said Tommy Napoleone, the 21-year-old mate of the tug Justine McAllister, which was one of four escort boats taking D.S. 123 to its berth. Mr. Napoleone lives in Staten Island, but far enough away, he said, that the landfill never bothered him. As rain beat against the tug's windows, Mr. Napoleone said that with the growth in the port there seemed to be enough work, and that he would continue on the tugs escorting ocean vessels. "But I have a few friends who work down there," he said of the landfill. "Lord knows what's going to happen to them."
Although the long-term plan for the city's residential waste disposal calls for garbage to again travel by barge -- from a system of transfer stations to a terminal in Linden, N.J., where it is to be repackaged for shipment by rail -- that system is not expected to be in operation for four years or more. In the meantime, trucks will handle most of the garbage, hauling it to landfills and incinerators in some cases hundreds of miles away.
What comes next for Fresh Kills is, in its own way, another journey. The so-called capping of the landfill, which involves placing a moisture barrier over the garbage mounds and a layer of topsoil onto that, is but the first step toward what politicians and the Sanitation Department say is a long-term plan to bring at least parts of the 3,000-acre property into public use as parkland. But given the volume of waste that was disposed there, an estimated 108 million tons -- more than in any other landfill in the United States, according to Chartwell Information, a company in Alexandria, Va. that tracks waste industry data -- much of the land could be unusable for decades.
The ecology of the landfill and its surrounding lands, which include some wetlands that were never used for garbage disposal, is expected to begin evolving, as well. Birds that for generations fed on garbage could be stressed, for example. Unsanctioned uses by people are growing, too. As much of the landfill has closed, its hills have become a magnet for off-road bicyclists and motorcyclists.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Enclave Grows Green, Inside and Out

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
As tenants move into the 324 apartments at 22 River Terrace, the newest residential building at Battery Park City, plans were announced yesterday for the next two apartment towers that are to rise there, in the enclave alongside the Hudson River.
 The Battery Park City Authority announced that the Related Companies of Manhattan would develop a $113 million building with 330 apartments while the Albanese Development Corporation of Garden City, N.Y., would build a $95 million structure with 260 apartments. 
 Both buildings will be 24 stories and rise on the same block as 22 River Terrace in what the authority calls the north neighborhood of Battery Park City.
Despite jitters about the national economy, leasing has been steady at 22 River Terrace. In the five weeks since rentals began at the 28-story brick and glass building, leases have been signed for 140 of its studio to three-bedroom apartments, which have 556 to 1,374 square feet. 
In that time monthly rents have been raised an average of 7 percent, and now range from $2,225 to $5,915, said Kevin P. Singleton. He is vice president and general manager at Rockrose Development Corporation, which developed the $45 million building, its third rental in Battery Park City.
Rockrose's just-completed project also marks a shift at the waterside complex toward so-called green buildings, ones that are energy-efficient and environmentally sensitive. 
The authority's guidelines, which went into effect in January 2000 for future residential and commercial buildings, require that developers, among other things, install appliances that are 35 percent more energy-efficient than required by current state energy standards and use building materials that have recycled contents and reduced toxicity to soften the project's impact on the environment.
While the construction of 22 River Terrace began before the new guidelines were in place, Timothy S. Carey, the authority's president, said that Rockrose, "to its credit," had voluntarily added green elements in its building. They include the use of energy-saving glazing on the building's windows, as well as motion sensors and fluorescent lighting in public areas to increase energy efficiency. 
Mr. Singleton said that while installing such features added $400,000 or 1 percent to the building's cost, they would ultimately help reduce operating expenses. "Saving energy and being green these days is good business," he said.
That is the message the authority hopes will be driven home with a new apartment tower about to arise, the first so-called green building designed to meet the authority's environmental guidelines. Work is expected to begin next month on that 266-unit rental, which will rise at River Terrace and Murray Street and is being developed at an estimated cost of $110 million by the Albanese Corporation.
The two newly announced buildings will also be green.
Mr. Carey said the environmental features included in the authority's guidelines were expected to add 10 to 15 percent to the initial cost of those and future buildings, though the cost to the developers for leasing the land would not be decreased. The idea, he added, is that builders "will be paid back within the life of the buildings," not only by lower operating costs but higher rents, too. 
Mr. Carey said the authority's environmental guidelines mesh with those now being completed for a state environmental tax credit program that is expected to be announced soon.
There are six more sites left to be developed at Battery Park City. Meanwhile, Mr. Carey said the authority had discussed with property owners the benefits of retrofitting their existing buildings with environmental features. 
The Rockrose building will be flanked by two parks. To the west is the four-acre Rockefeller Park and to the east will be a new $12 million, two-acre park, now called Tear Drop Park. 
The vision for the new park, Mr. Carey said, is "of a glen in the Catskills," with a 13-foot high "weeping wall" made of bluestone with water trickling down its face. There will also be rock formations using stones from New York quarries, a children's play area and a brook. Michael VanValkenburgh Associates of Boston is the landscape architect. 
Since that vision will not begin until November and will take three years to complete, an $80,000 park of less than an acre will be created in the interim. Construction is to start by mid-April on that park, which will have rows of crimson clover, sunflowers and spring rye. The architect is Donald Shillingburg in collaboration with Signe Nielsen landscape architects of Manhattan. 
Mr. Singleton said 22 River Terrace had been designed by Gruzen Samton Architects of Manhattan "with two front doors," one on each side, to take advantage of its closeness to the parks and the river. Common amenities include a landscaped terrace on the 17th floor, where the building steps back.
Rents average $51 a square foot. "Basically that is what the market will bear and is on par with rents at other buildings downtown," said Elie Khen, a broker at Bellmarc Companies, a residential brokerage company in Manhattan. "Even with the jitters in the market there will always be people who will rent."

HEADLINE: Bush's Budget Would Cut 3 Programs to Aid Children 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
As part of his budget, President Bush intends next month to propose cuts in programs to provide child care, to prevent child abuse and to train doctors at children's hospitals, administration officials said today.
 State officials contend that stable child care for low-income families has been a major ingredient of successful programs to move people from welfare to work. Congress provided $2 billion last year for the Child Care and Development Block Grant. That included an increase of $817 million, or 69 percent, so that states could provide day care to 241,000 additional children. 
 Budget documents from the Department of Health and Human Services show that Mr. Bush plans to cut child care grants by $200 million, to $1.8 billion, as part of the budget he will send Congress early next month.
The documents also show that spending for programs dealing with child abuse would be reduced by $15.7 million, or 18 percent. That would leave $71.8 million for federal grants to the states to prevent and investigate child abuse and neglect.
About 900,000 children are victims of abuse or neglect each year, federal data show, based on reports of cases investigated and confirmed by the states.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, has often emphasized the need to invest in services for low-income people.
"For welfare reform to be successful, you have to make an investment up front," Mr. Thompson said at his confirmation hearing. "It cannot be done on the cheap."
Mr. Thompson acted on that philosophy in 14 years as governor of Wisconsin. Under his supervision, state spending on child care in Wisconsin increased to $250 million this year, from $12 million in 1987.
The 1996 welfare law imposed stringent work requirements on welfare recipients, and most states have long lists of people waiting for subsidized child care.
Dennis P. Williams, the top budget official at the Department of Health and Human Services, described the amounts of money for various programs in memorandums to agency officials. Copies of the documents were obtained from people in both parties who oppose the cuts.
Mr. Williams said that Mr. Thompson "personally negotiated the budget with the director" of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. The numbers for specific budget items reflect decisions by Mr. Thompson "within the overall constraints of O.M.B. guidance," Mr. Williams said.
Administration officials defending President Bush's proposals made two points. First, they said, many domestic programs received exceptionally large increases in the current fiscal year because Congress and the Clinton administration showed little restraint on spending.
In addition, administration officials said Mr. Bush's concern for children was displayed throughout the budget, most notably in his proposals to double the federal tax credit for children and to increase spending at the Department of Education by 11.5 percent next year.
Campbell Gardett, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said, "People here do not want to comment on the budget" before its official release.
The budget documents show that Mr. Bush is planning to eliminate all the money, $20 million, that Congress provided for an "early learning fund" to improve the quality of child care and education for children younger than 5.
Mr. Bush's proposal could lead to a confrontation with Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Mr. Stevens and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, were the chief sponsors of the measure Congress passed last year to improve child care for preschoolers.
After President Bill Clinton signed the legislation in December, Mr. Stevens said, "I expect our new first lady, Laura Bush, a former librarian, to be a champion of early childhood education."
Administration officials said Mr. Bush was proposing a program to help older children after school.
But Helen Blank of the Children's Defense Fund, a liberal advocacy group, said, "It makes no sense to cut the Child Care and Development Block Grant to pay for a new initiative like after school vouchers."
In December, Congress also provided $235 million for a new program to train pediatricians and other doctors at children's hospitals across the country. Bush administration officials said the White House Office of Management and Budget had made a preliminary decision to seek large cuts in this program. Aides to Mr. Thompson said he was trying to get some of the money restored.
"We are still working on it," Mr. Thompson said. "We are still negotiating."
Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, expressed concern about the possibility of a cut.
"We really need the money for training of physicians who deal directly with children," Ms. Dunn said.
The president's budget for the Department of Health and Human Services, not counting benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid, calls for $56.7 billion in 2002.

HEADLINE: SENATORS SEEKING A $60 BILLION CUT IN TAXES FOR 2001 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
Republican senators agreed today to give Americans a $60 billion tax cut this year to stimulate the economy, and Democratic leaders said they were inclined to go along.
 The cut would be in addition to the tax reduction that President Bush has proposed and that most Republicans in Congress support. 
 The House, meanwhile, continued today to work on Mr. Bush's tax plan, which offers little immediate tax relief, but the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Thomas, said he was receptive to a measure that would lower taxes this year. 
"We can shift gears at any time," Mr. Thomas said.
A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said that while Mr. Bush was committed to the 10-year, $1.6 trillion tax-cut package he had outlined, "the President also believes we need to get more money into people's pockets quicker and he's committed to working with Congress to look at ways to make the tax cut retroactive so that we can give our economy a needed boost."
The lawmakers have not decided which taxpayers should get how much money or the mechanics of how they would get it. One possibility is a direct rebate -- a check from the government. Another is to change tax withholding tables so that take-home pay would immediately be greater.
If the $60 billion is divided evenly among about 200 million taxpaying adults, each would get $300.
The proposal was developed by Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee. Mr. Domenici presented it this afternoon at a meeting of all Republican senators. Afterward, he said: "We all agreed here that we want to do this. This must be done quickly for the American economy."
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said he supported the proposal.
The money would come from the budget surplus for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, after setting aside the money earmarked for Social Security and Medicare and about $30 billion in spending for other government programs.
Democrats said they wanted to see the details before they made any commitments, but they seemed enthusiastic.
"It makes sense to provide a stimulus and to do it in a timely way," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee.
Before the meeting of Republican senators, the House Ways and Means Committee approved two more parts of President Bush's tax-cut plan, but Mr. Thomas, a Republican from California, said after the vote that substantial changes might be needed to help the stock market and the economy.
The committee's bill would give a tax reduction to almost all married couples and would double the tax credit for most families with children to $1,000 per child. The committee made the measure somewhat more favorable to less affluent taxpayers than the president's plan.
But none of this money would get into people's pockets this year, and Democrats on the committee complained that Republicans were insensitive to current economic troubles.
In general, Democrats have objected to large tax cuts over many years, which they contend would drain government resources needed for social programs. But like Republicans, they feel the need to respond to what is seen as an economic emergency.
"We're not sure there's a tax cut that will stimulate the economy, but we're sure this one isn't it," said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, speaking of the president's plan.
The bill was approved by a party-line vote, 23 to 16, and is likely to go before the full House next week.
But the action in the House was overshadowed by the talk in the Senate about immediate tax relief.
Lawmakers from both parties have been struggling to find a way to address constituents' concerns about the sliding stock market and the possibility that the economy is faltering.
"There's a general perception that there's something Congress can do to overcome this economic slowdown," said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas.
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said, "There's a consensus that we need to do something that will have a stimulative effect."
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said, "I think it makes sense to think in a shorter time horizon."
It will be up to the Senate Finance Committee to work out the details of how Mr. Domenici's proposal would be implemented, and the political consensus could well collapse over who should get the money.
For example, should people too poor to owe income taxes get money back? Should everyone get the same amount, or should people who pay more taxes get more returned? Should wealthy taxpayers unlikely to change their spending patterns because of a rebate check of a few hundred dollars tops get anything at all?
Senator Domenici said he hoped all this could be resolved in the next few weeks. "We're going to do this as fast as possible," he said. "It will send people a signal that we are responsive."
Mr. Domenici said he hoped Congress would approve the central element of the president's proposal, an across-the-board reduction in income-tax rates, within a matter of weeks to assure the public that long-term tax relief was on the way. The House passed its version of this measure two weeks ago.
The remainder of the president's plan like the lower taxes for married couples, expansion of the child-care credit and repeal of the estate tax could be considered at a more leisurely pace, Mr. Domenici said.

HEADLINE: Procter to Cut 9,600 Jobs In Drive to Trim Its Overhead 

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. BARNES 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, March 22 

 BODY:
Procter & Gamble announced today that it would eliminate 9,600 jobs, or 9 percent of its work force, in the company's second substanial effort to reduce its payroll in two years. 
 About 40 percent of the job cuts will occur in the United States, and about 1,900 jobs will be lost in Cincinnati, where the company is based. Procter & Gamble said it would first offer early retirement and voluntary severance packages. Then, in about two months, it will begin laying off employees. 
 P.& G. is the second major consumer products company to announce large-scale layoffs. Gillette said in December that it would cut 2,700 jobs. Both companies have relatively high exposure to slowing overseas economies. 
Procter is the largest employer in the Cincinnati area, with 15,000 workers, and over the years it has developed a reputation as an insular and almost stodgy corporate giant. Of late, the company has been trying to change, entering into alliances and joint ventures with other companies. The cutbacks may be part of the company's effort to remake its culture and become more nimble.
Workers sitting in the corporate park outside the headquarters here slowly ate their lunches and mulled the company's announcement. Many were philosophical, viewing the cutbacks as further signs of economic slowdowns in America and overseas. Although they worried that colleagues, friends and neighbors could be forced out of jobs, several employees and other Cincinnati residents analyzed the cutbacks like investors.
"It's hard to find people who say bad things about Procter & Gamble here; we all own the stock," said Stephen C. Stricker, a Cincinnati resident and stockholder with friends at the company.
Procter announced in 1999 that it would eliminate 15,000 jobs by 2005 as part of a broad reorganization, but fewer people than expected took the voluntary retirement packages. So far, just 7,200 people have opted to leave. 
Alan G. Lafley, the chief executive, said yesterday that the new cutbacks were necessary to cut the company's overhead and restore its competitiveness. 
The layoffs and early retirement packages will cost the company about $1.4 billion, with most of the charges coming during the next fiscal year, starting in July. The company hopes the job cuts will save it $600 million to $700 million a year by fiscal year 2004.
Procter & Gamble's high costs are making it hard to compete on price, Mr. Lafley said. 
"The bottom line is we're not winning consistently with consumers," Mr. Lafley told analysts this morning. "They're often voting for competitors' brands, not P.& G. brands."
Sales growth at Procter has been flat and operating profit has declined for four quarters, Mr. Lafley said. Investments in new products and new markets have not generated the returns the company hoped for, but marketing expenses have grown to support those initiatives.
Although the cuts will be across the board, they will touch most lightly on the company's best-performing division, its fabric and home care brands, and fall most heavily on the lagging food and beverage division.
Mr. Lafley said he had told the managers of the global brand units to either fix stagnating businesses or get out of them.
"If we cannot get these brands or businesses profitable, then we will substantially restructure them, or shut them down," Mr. Lafley said.
Clayton C. Daley Jr., the chief financial officer, said the company could take an additional $400 million to $800 million charge if it got rid of underperforming brands. Analysts and some company employees say that Jif peanut butter and Crisco oil could be among the first products to be sold off.
Mr. Lafley said the goal was to return to double-digit sales growth and eventually double-digit earnings growth, but he said the restructuring could make it hard to increase earnings that much right away.
Analysts also expressed skepticism that the company could reach those targets in a slowing economy.
But Ajay Mehra, a portfolio manager at the Columbia Management Company, a unit of FleetBoston, said he recently bought Procter & Gamble for the funds he manages. The cuts, he said, were necessary for the company's earnings to grow. "It's not a good thing to have to lay off people, there is a human cost, but it is a much-needed remedy," Mr. Mehra said. "This is a faster pace of change than P.& G. is used to, this is a break with their culture. But I think that if I am Lafley, I am trying to send a message that change is necessary."
John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the layoffs at Procter & Gamble were a sign of the softening economy and a reminder that the slowdown had an effect on families.
"It's not just Procter & Gamble; we are seeing layoffs all across the economy reflecting a sharp slowing of demand," said Mr. Sweeney, adding that Procter & Gamble and other companies should do more to retrain workers that are laid off. "We think there are going to be more layoffs."
Cincinnati did not seem to take the news as hard, however. The morning radio shows were almost as concerned with the fate of Rodger, the Kentucky resident competing on CBS's "Survivor," as they were with news of the layoffs.
John F. Shirey, Cincinnati's city manager, treated the layoffs almost as if they were good news.
"What is more important to us is the overall health of the company," he said. "If these cutbacks result in improving the company, that has a positive impact in the city."
Many in the local business community seemed to go out of their way to express support for Mr. Lafley's decisions.
"We respect the leadership," said Michael Fisher, the president of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, who predicted that many of the workers who lose their jobs would be snatched up by other companies. Procter management, he said, "will do the things that are necessary for the long term." 
Angela Schunk, 28, who has worked at Procter for seven years, was also trying to be upbeat. Ms. Schunk said the company was acting morally by making voluntary reductions first.
"I think it's the right thing for the company, this will make us a strong company," said Ms. Schunk, who works in the baby care division and has a newborn of her own. "While I hope I would not be one of the ones asked to leave, I hope I would be able to handle it with dignity and respect if I was."
Still, some newer employees expressed concerns. 
"The people who have been here a really long time, those are the ones who are really on edge," said Tanya Daniels, 26, who has worked in a sales division for about a month. "A lot of people thought they would be here forever and now they have to start over." 
Unlike many Procter employees, the owner of the Montgomery Inn Boathouse, a restaurant two blocks from the headquarters, did not put a positive spin on the layoffs. "We have people from Procter & Gamble here every day for lunch and dinner, we get quite a bit of business," Dean Gregory said. "When Procter & Gamble loses jobs, we lose customers."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
South American Trade Bloc Under Siege

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, March 23 

 BODY:
In a more just world, the trade bloc known as Mercosur would be in a celebratory mood when its 10th birthday rolls around on Monday. Since its founding, trade among Mercosur's four members has tripled, to $15 billion a year; foreign investment has soared; inflation has been tamed; and the group has become the world's third-largest market, with more than 210 million people and combined production of more than $1 trillion a year.
 But "more than toasting the results of the past, Mercosur is going to mark this anniversary worrying about its future," said Gilberto Dupas, head of international studies at the University of Sao Paulo. The South American Common Market, as the group is also known, is now under siege from all sides, riven by disputes between Brazil and Argentina, its two main members, and facing mounting external pressures, mostly from the United States. 
 In its initial phase, Mercosur, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay as full members and Bolivia and Chile as associate members, proved remarkably successful in stimulating economic and political integration. The original members had just recently shaken off military dictatorships that were as suspicious of each other as of competition and free markets, and the result was a quick burst of growth.
"Any time you talk about Mercosur, you have to recall its starting point," said Pablo Guidotti, professor of economics at Di Tella University in Buenos Aires and a former Argentine government official. "All of these countries were emerging from decades of total isolation from the rest of the world economy."
The last two years, however, have been a time of trial for Mercosur. In January 1999, Brazil's currency was devalued by more than 35 percent, putting an end to the exchange-rate stability that had spurred trade within the group. Suddenly, many Brazilian goods were much cheaper than those of other members.
Since then, Argentina and Brazil have been involved in a series of noisy trade disputes over products ranging from cars and shoes to chicken and sugar.
Trade within the group has also been hit hard, falling by nearly a quarter in 1999, to around $15 billion, before recovering somewhat last year, to $17.7 billion.
Mercosur suffered another blow in December, when Chile said it was beginning negotiations with the United States in hopes of signing a bilateral free trade agreement. Chile's president, Ricardo Lagos, took office a year ago vowing that full Mercosur membership was his top priority, but he changed his mind in the face of Brazilian reluctance to lower tariffs faster.
Chile, heavily dependent on foreign trade, has external tariffs of 9 percent and plans to drop them to 6 percent. But Brazil, which wants to give industry more time to prepare for competition from abroad and has a giant domestic market of 170 million people, was willing to consider only minor trims to Mercosur's common tariff of 14 percent.
And Argentina, long mired in a recession that contrasts sharply with robust growth in Brazil, has plunged deeper into a crisis that is now both economic and political. That has led some there to urge President Fernando de la Rua to follow the Chilean path and radically open its economy.
"Argentina must stop wasting its time with this absurd project called Mercosur," Adolfo Sturzenegger of the New Millennium Foundation in Buenos Aires said this month. "It must immediately seek a bilateral negotiation with the United States."
It has also become clear that the member countries have quite different objectives. Brazil has always envisioned the group as both a commercial and geo-strategic entity that could put up a common front in negotiations with the rest of the world, while the others seem interested mostly in gaining access to Brazil's huge market.
"Brazil especially wants Mercosur to be a counterweight to the deepening North American entity that emerged with Nafta," said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. "But Mercosur is not moving as quickly and successfully as it was a couple of years ago, so the Brazilians don't have the Mercosur card to play the way they did then."
This week, in a move interpreted in Brazil as a blow to Mercosur, Argentina's new minister of the economy, Domingo Cavallo, announced a plan to eliminate tariffs on capital goods imported from outside the bloc and to impose new taxes on imported consumer goods. Both moves threaten Brazilian exports to Argentina, and on Thursday night Mr. Cavallo flew to Brasilia to reassure Brazilian officials that Argentina does not intend to bolt from Mercosur.
Still, Mercosur members are moving ahead with efforts to knit their economies closer together, somewhat the way members of the European Union have done. Common economic reporting standards are expected to go into place soon.
"We have begun to think as a unit and to draw up internal regulations, sanitary norms, and even dispute-resolution mechanisms," said Marcela Cristini of the Latin American Foundation for Economic Investigation in Buenos Aires. "Executives in Argentina and Brazil are investing in each other's countries, which is very important because in accords of this sort, if there are not opportunities for the private sector, the thing doesn't go anywhere."
Presidents of member countries also pledged last year to seek a common currency, without setting a timetable. That task, unthinkable until recently, is especially challenging because Argentina has linked its peso exactly to the American dollar, while the Brazilian real floats freely.
Mercosur has also established "a set of game rules that has been important in attracting long-term investment to the region," Dr. Guidotti said. Direct foreign investment, less than $5 billion a year a decade ago, has soared to more than $50 billion, most of it to Brazil, which now draws more investor dollars than any developing country except China.
But will Mercosur survive long enough to celebrate a 20th anniversary? The answer, trade analysts say, probably depends on the outcome of the American-led effort to create by 2005 a Free Trade Area of the Americas, which seems intended to swallow up Mercosur.
"If Brazil goes into the F.T.A.A., then Mercosur is finished," Dr. Dupas said.
But Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president, said this month that "Mercosur is a destiny for us, while the F.T.A.A. is an option." That set the tone for the next round of trade talks, scheduled to be held in Quebec next month and expected to produce a new American initiative to move up the deadline to 2003.
"With their own economies slowing, both the United States and the European Union are making a major aggressive push toward the Latin American market," Dr. Cristini said. "Mercosur has to give an answer, but this is clearly not the best moment for it to reply."

HEADLINE: Supply and Demand Among the Faithful 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS SHEA

 BODY:
Drive down 16th Street in Washington, and you will see evidence of the religious diversity that has struck visitors to America since Toqueville. Church after church will flash by: Grace Lutheran, the National Church of the Nazarene, Trinity A.M.E. Zion, All Souls Unitarian. And on and on. To a small group of sociologists, the reason there are so many kinds of houses of worship is no different from the reason there are so many brands of detergent or toothpaste at the supermarket: economics. 
 Competition, and supply and demand, shape the earthly aspects of religion -- its popularity and how it is delivered -- they say. And people in pews are fickle consumers, ready to bolt to a competing brand if the current one seems stale or uninspired. 
 This economic approach has led them to conclude that competition, rather than undermining belief, actually spurs it. Not only does it make clergymen work harder, they say, but it also means there is a greater likelihood that any one person will find a church that suits his spiritual tendencies, whether New Age or biblical literalist. 
"It can be demonstrated that in any society there is a distribution of religious tastes and concerns," said Rodney Stark, a professor of sociology at the University of Washington and a leading proponent of what is known as the religious economies theory. "The basic point is that any society would be better served by many different religions focusing on -- if you want to use market language -- different market segments. I'm sure we drink more soda pop because there are 20 companies out there, rather than just Coke." Why wouldn't religion be the same, he asks?
Religious pluralism, Mr. Stark and others say, explains why the United States is so religiously vibrant, while much of Western Europe has seen a decline in interest in traditional churches.
But both the economic language and the pluralism argument have upset many in the field. Steve Bruce, a sociologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, has written that the sociology of religion is suffering from "the malign influence of a small clique of U.S. sociologists" who are peddling daft ideas. And Mark Chaves, a sociologist at the University of Arizona, calls the pluralism theory a "house of cards," collapsing under close scrutiny.
The religious economies scholars, who focus on the variety of Christian denominations, are trying to tear down the view of pluralism that has reigned in the sociology of religion for a half-century. It was perhaps most famously articulated by Peter Berger in his 1969 book, "The Sacred Canopy." Mr. Berger, now director of the Institute on Religion and World Affairs at Boston University, wrote that faith was once like an awning that sheltered all of society, offering citizens a common certainty. But as tolerance opened the door to different varieties, the canopy tore: certainty could not help but decline, and faith followed. Mr. Berger made his case through broad historical and cultural analysis. 
But Mr. Stark and Roger Finke, a sociologist at Penn State and co-author of "Acts of Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion" (University of California, 2000), argue that this big-picture sociological view is often woolly and unscientific. They say, too, that a new theory is needed to make sense of America. In the United States today, some 40 percent of adults claim to attend church weekly, compared with 10 percent in Britain and 4 percent in Scandinavia. With some 1,350 denominations and sects, according to the Encyclopedia of American Religions, the United States is at once one of the most pluralistic and one of the most religious modern societies. Those facts have forced sociologists to rethink the idea that religion would die out when neighbors stopped believing in the same God. 
Adam Smith drew some links between competition and religious commitment in "The Wealth of Nations" 225 years ago, but most scholars ignored them. Mr. Stark and others started using economic language to describe religion in the mid-1980's. 
The new brand of thinking started making waves, however, in 1988, when he and Mr. Finke published an article in the American Sociological Review. Using data from an unusually thorough survey of religious behavior in 1906, conducted by the United States Census Bureau, they explored the link between religious diversity and commitment. (Such information is no longer gathered by the government.)
The secularization thesis held that religion would decline most rapidly in cities, because it would be impossible for urbanites not to notice that their neighbors headed off to different churches. But Mr. Stark and Mr. Finke found that rural areas had attendance rates of 50 percent, while some urban areas had rates as high as 60 percent. 
Their methods were as startling as their arguments. They used the same statistical formula that the Federal Trade Commission uses to measure the amount of competition in consumer markets (like software) to look at pluralism even more closely. They found that in towns of similar size, church attendance was highest when there was a choice of worship. 
"Contrary to the pleas of the clergy and the pronouncements of social scientists," they concluded, "pluralism is friend, not foe, to religious mobilization."
In 1991 Larry Iannaccone, an economics professor at Santa Clara University, went international with the theory. In an article in Rationality and Society, he argued that 90 percent of the variation in religious commitment among European states, the United States, New Zealand and Australia was attributable to differences in pluralism. Since then, there has been a flood of articles, often by these same three scholars, applying the thesis to various countries and periods. 
The real difference between religion in America and Europe, they propose, is on the supply side. Mr. Stark's European colleagues are baffled, he says, when he describes the raft of church solicitations he gets in the mail. They have never heard of such a thing. "I tell them: 'That's the point. You don't understand.' American churches work very hard at reaching out to people to bring them in." 
One of the most controversial of Mr. Stark and Mr. Finke's arguments is that Europe could wake up religiously if its churches started acting like their American counterparts. That strikes some scholars as absurd. Even those who think the theory works for America say it fails in Europe. For one thing, in Poland and Ireland (and also in Quebec) the Catholic church has few competitors, and yet faith and attendance at Mass are very high. 
Additionally, several sociologists who specialize in Europe's Protestant countries have said open competition and the decline of traditional religion have gone hand in hand. Mr. Bruce of the University of Aberdeen has said that was the case for Britain. "Dull as it may be to say so," he wrote in 1999, "the old orthodoxy was by and large right."
Other scholars question whether the pluralism theory is even applicable to the United States. A widely discussed paper in the American Sociological Review two years ago, by Daniel V. A. Olson of Indiana University at South Bend, attacked the statistical methods used by Mr. Finke and Mr. Stark. 
And an article in a forthcoming issue of the Annual Review of Sociology by Mr. Chaves and Philip S. Gorski of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, concludes that of 26 articles published in respected scholarly journals on religious pluralism in various countries, 16 found either no pattern in the relation between pluralism and religious commitment or found that pluralism hurt religious commitment. 
The pluralism argument is crucial for the religious economies scholars, Mr. Chaves said, because "it is the one place where they have a claim to an empirical 'discovery.' " But he added, "It is clear to me the weight of evidence is massively against this."
In some of the studies of America, Mr. Finke and Mr. Stark treated Catholics differently from followers of other faiths. Critics have called this statistical sleight of hand. But the pair said that as a tightly knit, often persecuted minority -- at least in the 19th century -- Catholics did not take part in the same economic market as Protestants. Mr. Finke and Mr. Stark often focus on 19th-century America because the important issue, they argue, is whether having one, two or three churches makes a difference. 
As far as Ireland and Poland are concerned, Mr. Stark and Mr. Finke counter that even monopoly churches can thrive when religion and political conflict get entwined. The Poles, for instance, long saw attending Mass as a way of thumbing their noses at the Soviets. To critics, however, that line of argument sounds self-justifying. 
Still, even the critics concede that America's staggering level of faith demands more study and more theorizing. Mr. Berger, author of "The Sacred Canopy," has modified his views on whether and how America is secularizing. In an interview he said he no longer thought pluralism dissolved faith entirely, although he maintained that it changed the character of belief, making it more tentative and malleable, even in America.
He declined, however, to give the religious economies thinkers credit for his own shift. Like many others, he thinks a market-based view of religion misses most of what's important -- for example, he said, history, meaning, symbolism and ritual. "To look at religion from a framework derived exclusively from economics," Mr. Berger said, "is not very helpful."

HEADLINE: SHELF LIFE; 
Witnesses to Revolution Wrote History's First Draft

BYLINE:  By Edward Rothstein

 BODY:
In 1777, during the American Revolution, a British Army officer recorded in his journal the aftermath of a brutal battle fought over terrain near Ticonderoga, N.Y. "The wolves," he wrote, "came down in numbers from the mountains to devour the dead, and even some that were in a kind of manner buried, they tore out of the earth; the great stench thro the country being the cause of their coming down."
 It is a stench that assaults the senses again and again in this powerful collection of original documents, the stench of rotting corpses from the forests of Brookland (later Brooklyn), from the swamps of Long Island, from the fields of Virginia. Here are letters, proclamations, chronicles of battles, newspaper articles, diaries and memoirs by British and American participants, by writers familiar and obscure. In their accounts the war takes on a detailed texture that is startling one moment, numbing the next. 
 There is almost no editorial intrusion by John Rhodehamel, the curator of American History at the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif., who selected the contents and ended the volume with short biographical notes, a condensed history and a list of sources, many no longer available. More information might have been helpful along the way. But there is something compelling about a story being told with more than 120 different selections written in more than 70 different voices, unfolding with chronological urgency. 
The popular imagination, of course, has some sense of the travails of the American Revolution, portrayed in images of the starving, freezing troops led by Washington through Delaware or shown more recently in the movie "The Patriot," with its horrific re-creations of hand-to-hand combat. There are broader scholarly histories as well, but something changes when confronted with first-hand accounts by observers. 
First there is the minor, seemingly negligible detail, usually filtered out from formal histories, that allows the abstract to become concrete: how a British colonel could not keep up with his troops, "his being a heavy man," or how Continental soldiers in Pennsylvania appeared to a flirtatious young woman in a home where they were billeted, or how starving soldiers prepared food during the 1775 invasion of Canada ("a little water, stiffened with flour, in imitation of shoemakers' paste"). 
It is touching to read Abigail Adams's futile appeal to her husband John, in a 1775 letter, as affairs of the nascent state preoccupied him. "All the letters I receive from you seem to be wrote in so much haste, that they scarcely leave room for a social feeling," she wrote. "I want some sentimental Effusions of the Heart."
The bewilderment and anger of the British observers also come through with fresh intensity. Ambrose Serle, private secretary to Lord Howe, the British admiral, writing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, thought it proved "the Villainy & the Madness of these deluded People." A year later John Burgoyne, the British general, wrote that the "present unnatural Rebellion," far from guaranteeing freedom, has ushered in "the compleatest System of Tyranny," including "Arbitrary Imprisonments, Confiscation of Property, Persecution and Torture." 
Tales of atrocity, by all combatants, abound: the colonists who laughingly shoot a 7- or 8-year-old child playing in a yard; the British soldiers who attack the wounded colonists, "beating their heads to pieces"; the Indian allies of the British who rape and scalp a colonist's wife. There is one account, after the end of the war, by the daughter of a Philadelphia Loyalist who feared the vengeful mob gathering around her house with pickaxes, iron bars and stones. 
There are also questions raised, again and again, about the status of the slaves. The British offer them freedom in exchange for taking up a musket; so do the colonists. But little is resolved. Washington writes home urging that economies be undertaken, "without making the poor Negros suffer too much."
Above all, though, is the sense of the immensity of the war. "I am surprized at the Suddenness, as well as Greatness of this Revolution," John Adams writes Abigail in 1776. There were times when even the goal of the Revolution might have seemed unclear. 
A doctor in the Continental Army is delirious during the march to Valley Forge: "Poor food -- hard lodging -- Cold Weather -- fatigue -- Nasty Cloaths -- nasty Cookery -- Vomit half my time -- smoak'd out of my senses -- the Devil in't -- I can't Endure it -- Why are we sent here to starve and Freeze -- What sweet Felicities have I left at home." 
This is, of course, the great weakness of war chronicles. The sacrifices rarely seem justified at the time. Why was so much put at stake when the British, offering negotiations, seemed to promise so much? How did the colonists succeed in creating an army that one observer called "the strangest that ever was collected: Old men of 60, Boys of 14, and Blacks of all ages, and ragged for the most part"? How was support galvanized from the gentry, intellectuals, poor laborers and farm workers? How did the colonists ever end up victorious?
That is where the historian must come in, confronting these varied documents and their many precedents, coordinating theoretical writings on liberty with actions on the battlefield, analyzing why some revolutions end with great possibility and others end in wholesale terror.
Here, though, there may be justification enough in the book's closing account, a 1783 letter from Washington's secretary, who describes the general's resignation from his successfully completed commission. In his farewell to Congress, Washington's hands shook, his voice faltered.
The letter writer, James McHenry, adds: "The events of the revolution just accomplished -- the new situation in which it had thrown the affairs of the world -- the great man who had borne so conspicuous a figure in it, in the act of relinquishing all public employments to return to private life -- the past -- the present -- the future -- the manner -- the occasion -- all conspired to render it a spectacle inexpressibly solemn and affecting."

HEADLINE: A Space Station's Long Goodbye 

BYLINE:  By Leon Aron; Leon Aron, director of Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of "Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Much of the coverage of the demise of the Mir space station was misty-eyed and nostalgic. Commentators used Mir's fiery descent as a metaphor for Russia's fall.
 This lamentation is misguided. Instead, we should say "Good riddance!" The station's decommissioning is a sign not of Russia's decline, but of her liberation. 
 An offshoot -- like the entire Soviet space program -- of the Soviet ballistic missile project, Mir was designed exclusively to serve the military-industrial complex that for decades had looted and beggared Russia. In 1998, Yevgeny Primakov, then the foreign minister, revealed that the Soviet Union was spending 70 percent of its gross domestic product on "defense and defense-related projects." 
When Mir was launched in 1986, 35 percent of Soviet hospitals did not have hot water and 30 percent lacked indoor toilets. The country's infant mortality rate was higher than that of Barbados. Half of Soviet schools had no central heating or running water. People spent between 40 and 60 hours a month in lines, and ration coupons were needed to buy 400 grams of sausage a month. 
In Russian villages, World War II widows, many receiving a pension of four rubles a month, worth about 40 cents, dug up potatoes with wooden shovels. It has been famously said of Peter the Great that he had forged a rich state of the impoverished people. Mir was a symbol of such a state. 
In the last week, we have heard again and again that Russia could not "afford" Mir. Nonsense! National priorities are not set by accountants. 
Can Iraq afford its relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction? Can North Korea afford its missiles when its people starve? Can China afford to increase its defense budget by 8 percent annually? Can Vietnam afford the fourth-largest army in the world, or could Cuba afford an expeditionary force in Angola in the 1980's? 
It was not the absence of money that killed Mir but the transition to a political system in which the rulers must account for their spending to a democratically elected parliament, a free press, an opposition and, ultimately, the voting public. The national goals changed accordingly.
"A great power is not mountains of weapons and subjects with no rights," Boris Yeltsin declared in 1997. "A great power is a self-reliant and talented people with initiative. The sole measure of the greatness of our motherland is the extent to which each citizen of Russia is free, healthy, educated and happy." 
As president, Mr. Yeltsin cut defense spending to under 5 percent of the country's gross domestic product -- and Mir was doomed.
One hopes, fervently, that in a not-so-distant future a democratic Russia will be rich enough to restart its space program -- as an embodiment of prosperity and free will, not of militarized tyranny preying on a terrorized nation. Meanwhile, shed no tears for Mir.

HEADLINE: Overtaxed Mothers Need Relief 

BYLINE:  By Ann Crittenden; Ann Crittenden is the author of "The Price of Motherhood."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A tax cut seems certain this year, and many groups of taxpayers are scrambling for special favors. But no one is talking about the people who need tax relief the most: mothers. Married mothers are arguably the most heavily taxed workers in the country, even though they're often in the least desirable jobs, with low pay and few benefits.
 Much of this heavy taxation is a result of joint filing of income tax returns, producing the so-called marriage penalty. In 1999 some 38 percent of husbands and wives paid more in federal income taxes than they would have if they had not been married. (Spouses can file separately, but very few do, because the tax code exacts penalties on married couples who don't file jointly.) 
 But joint filing means that the family's second income, added on to the main one, is taxed at the couple's highest marginal tax rate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, joint filing, as opposed to individual filing, raises the marginal tax rates of the lower-earning spouse in 72 percent of couples. And in almost 80 percent of families with children at home, that lower-earning spouse is the wife.
Take the example of a woman with two children who is married to a man earning $70,000. If she takes a job paying $30,000, almost half of this new income may well be taxed away, through federal and state taxes and Social Security taxes. After child care and other work-related expenses, she will be lucky if she brings home much at all from that $30,000 job.
Numerous economic studies have found that high marginal tax rates do discourage married mothers from paid work. The relatively high taxes on their income lead many mothers to the perfectly logical conclusion that their time is better spent at home than in the labor market, particularly when there are children at home who need a parent's presence.
Most of us know women who have made this calculation, sometimes reluctantly giving up careers that they have worked long and hard to achieve. Thus, the overall effect of requiring couples to file joint returns has been to reduce mothers' earnings potential as well as total family earnings.
Allowing mothers to keep more of their paychecks not only would increase family incomes and reduce economic inequality within the family, but would also cost the Treasury less revenue than other forms of tax reduction. The additional taxes paid by the women attracted into the paid labor force would help offset the loss incurred by lowering their tax rates.
In the majority of industrialized countries, individual taxation of incomes is the norm and the trend. Interestingly, one study compared the tax system of Germany (one of the few countries other than the United States with a joint taxation system) with Sweden's individual income tax systems and found that imposing the German approach on Sweden would have reduced Swedish wives' rate of participation in the labor force by one-fourth. Yet this topic is not even discussed in the United States.
The Bush administration's tax proposals do include a modest reduction in the marriage penalty. The $1.6 trillion tax plan would allow the lower-earning spouse to deduct from taxable income 10 percent of the value of her (or his) earnings, up to $30,000, for a maximum tax deduction of $3,000. But this tax relief would not do enough to overcome the financial disincentives to work for many mothers.
We need to start talking about taxing everyone as an individual, as the government did before 1948. Today Americans have the freedom to choose their own living arrangements, and they live in all sorts of households.
Individual filing would be more neutral, and it would eliminate once and for all the confusing, anachronistic requirement that couples designate one adult as the taxpayer and the other as "spouse." After all, we are individuals under all laws but the tax laws when it comes to the money we earn.

HEADLINE: A Flawed Timber Market 

BYLINE:  By Jimmy Carter; Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, is chairman of the Carter Center in Atlanta.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Along with all the other former presidents, I was a strong supporter of the North America Free Trade Agreement when it was initiated in 1994. Free trade among the United States, Mexico and Canada has, in general, been good for the people and the economies of all three nations.
 However, we are now facing a crisis in the marketing of lumber that could be devastating to 10 million American landowners, 20,000 sawmill owners and more than 700,000 workers, and also to the environment. This problem has aroused the concern of labor, industry and environmentalists. There are many facets to this complicated issue, but they can be summarized in relatively simple terms. 
 In Canada, the national and provincial governments own 95 percent of the timberland. In the United States, private investors own the overwhelming portion of woodlands. In Georgia, for instance, 70 percent of all forest land belongs to about 600,000 private nonindustrial owners, most of whom are also involved in farming. Timber companies like Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Pacific and International Paper own another 20 percent, while the remaining 10 percent is in public ownership, as in parks and military bases.
Rosalynn and I are typical family landowners. On our relatively small woodland tracts, some of which our family has owned for seven generations, we maintain a proper mix of hardwood and softwood trees for optimum wildlife habitat, and we market our timber selectively when it reaches full maturity. We cut relatively small areas at a time and replant as quickly as possible after harvesting. Within 10 years, we begin periodic thinning, always providing the best conditions for optimum growth of the next generation of full-grown trees.
When we sell some mature trees, we obtain bids from sawmill owners, who are under contract to cut under strict conditions that protect the permanent value and productivity of the farm. It is an almost universal practice of families like ours to protect the land from erosion and to replant another crop immediately after harvest. Our sawmills must pay full market price for standing timber, saw and dress the lumber as efficiently as possible, and sell it on the retail market.
Canada has no equivalent free market for the overwhelming portion of its timber. Provincial governments grant an annual allowable cut to sawmill owners at whatever low price is necessary to maintain full employment in the timber industry. These sawmills usually pay a fraction of the price that American sawmill owners pay, creating a great disparity that is beginning to wreak havoc with the timber industry in the United States, from the farm family that owns some woodland to the small or large sawmill owners who cannot compete on the retail market with the heavily subsidized lumber being imported from Canada. 
These disparities between the American and Canadian timber industries have existed for more than 25 years. In 1996, the United States and Canada signed a five-year pact, which expires this month, that tried to limit the problem by restricting Canadian exports of lumber into the United States. But quotas are not the answer. What we need is a permanent agreement that ensures free trade but ends the artificial price restrictions that the Canadian government has put on timber. This will allow both Canadian and American lumber interests to compete on equal footing.
Without a dependable timber market in the United States, many landowners cannot afford to invest in reforestation and forest maintenance, and the consequence will be land that is barren or converted to other uses. The cost to society is great -- less carbon dioxide sequestered in the trees, a loss of air and water filtration, less green space and wildlife, and more soil erosion and urbanization.
Our family has other personal income and can survive even if our nation's timber industry is crippled, but hundreds of thousands of American families depend on a fair and stable market for their livelihood. Their interests must be protected.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Stocks Perk Up, With Nasdaq Posting Gain in a Harsh Week

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
After bouncing around for most of the day, the three major stock indexes ended higher yesterday, providing a positive fillip to an otherwise sour week.
 And even though investors signaled that the Federal Reserve's half-a-percentage-point rate cut on Tuesday was too small for them, the Nasdaq composite index bounced back enough Thursday and yesterday to have its first positive week since the end of February. 
 Technology stocks also helped lead the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index higher, although both finished the week lower.
Too many analysts have already been burned by earlier declarations of a stock market bottom to come trooping out again. Some thought, however, that they saw signs of irrational pessimism in Thursday's sell-off when the Dow fell more than 380 points before rebounding to end the day down 97 points. That is the kind of selling, analysts say, that has to come before the market can fight its way out of the grasp of the bear. 
"It's a good sign, but there have been a lot of good signs already that have not played out," said John Manley, senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Other analysts still say the corporate earnings outlook could worsen and that stock prices do not reflect that yet. And some say that investors are still too eager to catch the bottom and ride it up. "Bottoms are made when people give up," said Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 115.30 points, or 1.2 percent, to 9,504.78. Even with the rally yesterday, the Dow was off 3.2 percent for the week. And over the last two weeks, the Dow has plunged 10.7 percent, the worst two-week decline since the stock market crash of 1987.
Still, the Dow, based on its closing price, is the only major index that has not dropped 20 percent or more from its peak, for many on Wall Street the borderline of bear market territory. But it dropped beyond the 20 percent threshold in intraday trading on Thursday and yesterday. With the rally yesterday, it is down 18.9 percent from its January 2000 peak.
The Nasdaq composite rose 30.98 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,928.68 and was up 2 percent for the week. But the Nasdaq is still down 61.8 percent from its March 2000 high. 
The Nasdaq was led higher by Microsoft, Qualcomm, Dell Computer, Oracle, Apple Computer and Amgen. But other big-name technology stocks were sold, indicating that investors moving back into this sector are being selective. Yesterday's decliners included Immunex, JDS Uniphase, Cisco Systems, Sun Microsystems and Comcast.
Shares of Microsoft rose $2.56, to $56.56; Qualcomm jumped $2, to $58.88; Dell climbed $1.19, to $27.44. Immunex lost $7.25, to $11.63; Cisco fell $1.06, to $18.69; and Sun dropped 63 cents, to $18.25.
The S.& P. 500 index rose 22.25 points, or 2 percent, to 1,139.83, and was off 0.9 percent for the week. It is down 7.6 percent in the last two weeks, its sharpest slide since the April 2000 plunge in the stock market. The S.& P. is off 25.4 percent from its March 2000 high.
While they differ on what it means for the outlook for the market, both Mr. Manley and Mr. Bernstein agree that there are investors with cash ready to buy again, which helps explain yesterday's rally.
"I am amazed at the amount of interest in the tech sector given the bear market it has been in," Mr. Bernstein said. "People are on the sideline waiting to get in."
Mr. Manley said that while the Fed's rate cut this week, the third half-point reduction since January, might have been too small to please investors, the Fed had already indicated that there were more cuts to come. And the outlook for stocks in the longer term, he said, has to be positive because "it is very hard to build a case that the Fed will not get its way" -- an economic rebound.
Still, Motorola, the cell phone manufacturer, reminded investors again yesterday of the pain that many companies are going through to adjust to the decline in demand as the economy slows sharply. The company announced that it would lay off more workers, this time 4,000 in the network equipment business. Since December, Motorola has announced layoffs of about 22,000 workers and the company said last month that it might have a loss in the first quarter.
In the bond market, prices fell as investors moved from bonds into stocks. Some investors also say that interest rates are already low enough to account for the future cuts expected from the Fed.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 4.80 percent, from 4.74 percent Thursday, a two-year low. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 16/32, to 101 18/32.
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is a good indicator of investor sentiment about coming Fed rate cuts, rose to 4.23 percent from 4.17 percent Thursday.
The rebound of the Dow at the end of the day on Thursday appeared to help foreign markets, which have also fallen sharply recently. In Japan, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose 2.8 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in Britain climbed 1.7 percent and the DAX index in Germany rose 2.9 percent.
There was a sign that the European Central Bank might be ready to cut interest rates. Jean-Claude Trichet, a member of the central bank council, said the bank was no longer worried about inflation. "While we were very, very worried about inflation a month or a month and a half ago, we're not anymore," Bloomberg News reported Mr. Trichet saying in an interview with the French radio station Europe 1. 
This was enough of a signal of a possible rate cut in the future that the euro, which has had a surprising decline against the dollar recently, rose slightly against the dollar. It finished in New York at 88.85 cents, up from 88.75 cents Thursday.
In Latin America, which has suffered in the last few weeks, in part because of the financial troubles in Argentina, the Merval index in Argentina surged 6.2 percent while the Bovespa of Brazil finished 2.6 percent higher. Both indexes fell more than 5 percent Thursday amid rumors that Argentina's currency peg to the dollar would be abandoned.

PERSON: Mark F. Kessenich Jr. 

HEADLINE: Mark Kessenich Jr., 62, Leader In Transforming Bond Markets 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Mark F. Kessenich Jr., a former Citicorp executive who helped shape the way corporate and government bonds are traded, died on Tuesday at his home in Westhampton, N.Y. He was 62.
 The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, according to the family. 
 Mr. Kessenich took over Citibank's North American investment division in 1975, just as the rising national debt began to increase the popularity of bonds as a tool of corporate and government finance. To manage the boom, Mr. Kessenich helped revamp the way bond houses did business, essentially transforming them from liaisons between businesses and investors into risk-takers that underwrote many of the deals themselves.
Under Mr. Kessenich's tenure, Citibank's bond division grew from a single New York office of 110 employees to a worldwide business with 2,200 workers, making it one of the largest on Wall Street at the time. 
In 1986, Mr. Kessenich was recruited to help revive an embattled E. F. Hutton Group, which had pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud charges in 1985. His defection was widely considered a coup for E. F. Hutton, but the firm's economic woes worsened with the stock market crash of 1987, and it ultimately merged into Sherson Lehman in 1988. Mr. Kessenich formed Eastbridge Capital Inc., a bond-trading firm in New York, that year. He served as president and chief executive until his illness forced him to retire in 1998. 
Mr. Kessenich is survived by his former wife, Diane Kessenich; three children, Barbara Kessenich Robertson of Greenville, S.C.; Mark F. Kessenich III of Westhampton, N.Y.; and Paul T. Kessenich of New York City; a sister, Joanne K. Knief, of Ocala, Fla.; and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Not Enough Power And No Glory; 
California's Choices All Look Painful

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 23 

 BODY:
California's energy crisis seems to get worse with each passing day.
 This week, Californians were once again plunged into darkness as warm weather and a large number of shuttered power plants caused blackouts from Santa Monica to San Francisco. In offices in and around Sacramento, frenzied negotiators continue their months-long talks to design a settlement to keep the nearly bankrupt utilities afloat and creditors at bay. 
 And despite a dizzying 190 bills introduced in the Legislature to address the crisis, the bickering among politicians persists. Republican leaders have called for the ouster of state utility officials, and California's controller warned that the state's general fund was in danger of being frittered away unless decisive action was taken. 
Two months ago, Gov. Gray Davis promised a speedy end to the crisis. But all the solutions proposed so far seem as fragile and tenuous as the grid itself.
Now a growing chorus of economists, business leaders and policy experts are saying what most agree that Mr. Davis will not utter: the state cannot spend its way out of this crisis, and politicians are delaying an inevitable, albeit unpopular, end -- raising retail electricity rates significantly. The desire to satisfy all parties is costly and has caused confusion and indecision.
"The solution to the policy problem is moving agonizingly slowly because there are several powerful political groups that can block any piece of legislation," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former chief economic adviser in the Clinton White House who is now the dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. "California's politicians don't seem to have enough power or conviction -- I think it's power -- to get these groups to agree." 
Further, said Steve Fleishman, a Merrill Lynch utility analyst in New York: "The government officials keep trying to plug the holes in the dam when they spout up. But there are too many things that need to be paid within the current utility rate structure." 
In an interview today, Governor Davis reiterated what he has said for months: California's biggest problem is short supply -- no major power plants have been built in 10 years -- and he has invoked his emergency power to put more generation online quickly. He warned, too, that state negotiators were proceeding with caution to avoid the kind of mistakes the architects of deregulation made in the first place. "One of the reasons we are in trouble today was because there was a rush to judgment," he said. "We are not going to make that mistake again."
But for a brief moment recently, it looked as if the state had finally marshaled its forces and was well on its way to presenting Californians with a cohesive plan. The state treasurer's office hired bankers to help sell a $10 billion bond issue, the largest of its kind, that would help pay for power now and stabilize prices over time. 
State negotiators hoping to avoid a taxpayer bailout announced a preliminary agreement with Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, to buy its transmission lines for about $2.76 billion. And Governor Davis proudly told reporters that his team had negotiated a successful round of long-term power contracts that would help keep California's lights on. 
But almost every promising announcement has had a less-enticing twist. Intense negotiations with the privately-owned utilities drag on week after week. Southern California Edison has not finished a deal to sell its transmission lines, a necessity if it is to begin paying bills owed since November. "Progress has been made," said Bob Foster, Edison's chief negotiator. But he warned, "I don't want to sound overly optimistic."
Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of PG&E, for its part, has not announced anything, even in principle. John Nelson, a spokesman for the utility, did not return calls seeking comment. 
Regarding the long-term power contracts, a report released this week says that the state has received commitments for less than half the 6,000 megawatts it hopes to secure for this summer. The power generators, too, can opt out of their contracts for a variety of reasons, including a failure by the state to sell bonds by July 1. Governor Davis said today that in most cases, much of the energy the state wanted to buy for this summer was no longer available. That shortfall could require the state to buy more than 15 percent of the energy it needs in the expensive spot market, nearly triple the amount he once said he wanted. 
Still, the issue that has caused the biggest controversy is who has first rights to the money now being collected from ratepayers. (Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison now have $4.4 billion in their coffers.) State officials have said that according to the law drafted in January to ensure the state could buy power on behalf of the utilities, the Department of Water Resources should be paid first. The utilities are saying they are first in line. Whatever the outcome, the law's ambiguity has been a problem for the state treasurer, Philip Angelides, who said it has not only cost him precious time, but could put the bond offering in jeopardy unless it is clear how the revenues will be divided. 
"The danger of this is if you let problems like this multiply, the situation gets worse and worse," he said. California's Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on this issue on Tuesday. (Governor Davis said he expected the commission to agree that the state should be paid first.) 
But Mr. Angelides did not want to wait that long. Instead, he said, he and his team approached legislators to write another law so he could proceed with the state's $10 billion bond offering in May. 
But even then, he contends, the bond offering is only a short-term fix at best. "After the $10 billion is exhausted, we can't keep borrowing and borrowing and borrowing," Mr. Angelides said. "The reality is our lack of investment in power plants and inability to conserve are going to cost us more." 
Mr. Angelides has a point. But the governor's resistance to raising rates is at best a negotiating tool. The governor has told some people that he is open to raising rates, but only after the utilities make the concessions he wants, people close to the negotiations with the utilities said. It is part of his overall strategy, these people said -- one that includes building more power plants and conserving energy, both crucial in helping California minimize disasters this year and next.
But that does little to solve the problem of the $13 billion in debts the utilities have already incurred. And that provides little comfort to the likes of Hal Dittmer, president and owner of the Wellhead Electric Company, a small power generation company in Sacramento, who decided to close down his three power plants in February because he had not been paid all the money owed by Pacific Gas and Electric. No solution now being discussed, he said, either in the legislature or with the utilities themselves, really addresses his problem. And like many of the utilities' creditors, he is growing impatient.
"The word I would use for what is going on in Sacramento is dithering," said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, who has seen a swarm of recruiters from other states approach Los Angeles businesses recently in an effort to woo them away. State politicians, he said, have to understand "that they are putting California's economic future at risk." 
Governor Davis, while sympathetic to his critics' frustrations, dismisses them. "They are viewing the process from afar," he said. "From the government's perspective, we are moving at warp speed."
But that may not be fast enough. Today, in Sacramento, the State Assembly rejected a plan that would have allowed smaller power generators, which have contracts directly with the utilities, to be paid. Unlike their larger counterparts, companies like Mr. Dittmer's do not have their sales guaranteed by the state and are themselves threatened by bankruptcy.
The utilities have been negotiating with the smaller generators for months, but industry analysts say the two groups are bitter rivals and no agreement is likely soon. And to make matters even more precarious, smaller generators could be the likeliest to force the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, in part, because they want their money and have the least to lose.
"Politics is not just about keeping the lights on," Ms. Tyson said. "It's about making sure that all parties are represented." And that is contrary to the business world, she added, "where it's about getting the job done."

C4) Chart: "Price Shock"Ever since California's deregulated power market spun out of control last summer, the state has struggled to repair the damage. But with an array of business and political forces at work, even a recent $10 billion rescue plan has failed to stabilize the situation. Since January, it has been impossible to determine wholesale prices because the state agency that has stepped in to buy most of the power does not reveal what it pays.

HEADLINE: Baltimore Technologies Shares Fall on Forecast 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 23 

 BODY:
Baltimore Technologies P.L.C., Europe's largest security software maker, today forecast first-quarter sales below what some analysts expected, blaming the economic slowdown in the United States. Its shares fell as much as 27 percent. 
 The company, which got a fifth of its revenue in North America last year, expects quarterly sales of about $:25 million ($35.7 million), it said. Brian Skiba, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, had forecast $:30.5 million. 
 Baltimore's shares fell as much as 40.5 pence (58 cents), to 110 pence ($1.57), before the company's statement was released but after its chief executive, Fran Rooney, mentioned the economic slowdown in a meeting with analysts earlier in the day in Dublin. Some interpreted the comment as a grim profit forecast, said Mr. Skiba, who attended. 
"That's made people nervous about the stock," Mr. Skiba said.
Several software companies in the United States, including Microsoft and Oracle, said earlier this year that the slowdown was hurting business, which helped drag down technology stocks worldwide. Baltimore's shares have fallen by more than half this year. 
"In common with other companies, Baltimore has experienced some sales being delayed due to the prevailing economic climate," the company said in its statement. 
Baltimore reported a fourth-quarter loss of $:55.2 million last month.

HEADLINE: Farmers Joining State Efforts Against Bioengineered Crops 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
North Dakota is weighing a bill that would make it the first state to ban planting of a genetically modified crop, reflecting a surge of concern about such crops in legislatures around the country.
 The North Dakota bill, which would impose a two-year moratorium on growing genetically modified wheat, is one of more than 40 state bills introduced this year that would regulate biotech crops or the labeling of foods made using genetic engineering. 
 "You have people at the state level trying to get these things passed because the federal government won't do it," said Andy Zimmerman, who works with the Green Party in New York, where a bill has been introduced to ban the planting of genetically modified crops for five years.
But the North Dakota bill, which has already passed the state's House of Representatives, signals another trend as well -- that concern about genetically engineered crops is now coming not only from environmental and consumer groups but from farmers, who have generally supported such crops. 
Although virtually all the state bills proposed in past years failed, the North Dakota bill has made headway precisely because its main backers are some of the state's own farmers, not the usual biotechnology opponents. While many of these farmers say they are not in principle opposed to bioengineered foods, they fear losing the ability to export their crops to Europe, Japan and other places where consumers are shunning such food and where governments strictly regulate it.
"We don't want to lose the ability to sell our wheat abroad," said Todd Leake, a farmer from near Grand Forks and one of the strongest champions of the North Dakota measure. "Most of the economy in North Dakota is agriculture," Mr. Leake noted, "and wheat is the mainstay of that."
To some extent, the North Dakota bill is merely symbolic; the moratorium would expire on July 31, 2003, probably before any genetically modified seed would even come to market. And the bill does not mention enforcement.
Still, that has not prevented Monsanto, which is developing genetically modified wheat, and some farm groups opposed to the bill from putting up a stiff fight. So while the bill breezed through the state's House last month by a vote of 68 to 29, its passage in the Senate is far from assured.
In other states as well, biotechnology and food companies, not eager to deal with a patchwork of laws, have lobbied heavily against some bills, say legislators who proposed them. Many other bills, however, fail simply for lack of support.
Many farmers like genetically engineered crops because they contain useful traits, like pest resistance. But critics say that they have not been studied thoroughly enough to rule out health problems like allergies or unanticipated ecological effects, including the killing of monarch butterflies.
The first genetically altered crops -- herbicide-resistant soybeans and pest-resistant corn and cotton -- were snapped up by farmers. About half of the soybeans and a quarter of the corn grown in the United States last year were genetically modified. And many farmers, including some in North Dakota, are continuing to grow these crops, despite a rise in consumer resistance.
But genetically modified crops like wheat that are not already established are having a harder time catching on because farmers and food companies fear they will not be able to sell them.
Genetically altered potatoes never gained much of a foothold after major potato processors and fast-food companies indicated they would not buy them. Monsanto is discontinuing its potato product. And farmers in the main tobacco-growing states are refusing to grow crops that are genetically modified to reduce nicotine. The farmers and some cigarette companies worry that smokers, particularly in Europe and Japan, might shun modified cigarettes, even as they accept the risk of cancer.
Genetically modified wheat probably will not reach the market before 2003, Monsanto says. The company is developing wheat resistant to its Roundup herbicide, which would allow the herbicide to kill weeds while leaving the wheat unscathed.
Still, wheat millers in Europe and Japan have already warned American industry trade organizations that they would not accept any wheat that has been genetically modified. 
Concerns among wheat farmers have increased in the wake of the StarLink corn fiasco, in which genetically modified corn not approved for human consumption found its way into taco shells and other foods, causing recalls and numerous other disruptions to farmers, grain elevators and food companies and leading to a decline in corn exports to Japan.
That is why backers of the North Dakota measure say a moratorium is needed. If even a few farmers were to plant genetically modified wheat, they say, the state's whole crop could become contaminated and exports jeopardized, particularly if competitors like Canada were to grow only nonmodified wheat.
Neal Fisher, administrator of the North Dakota Wheat Commission, a marketing group financed by farmers, said that North Dakota's wheat crop was valued at about $1 billion annually, about half of it exported. The state is the leading producer of hard red spring wheat, a premium crop used in breads and rolls.
There have been 77 bills related to agricultural biotechnology introduced this year in 27 states, said Chip Kunde, vice president for state affairs at the Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents food companies. The list overstates the amount of legislative activity somewhat because in about 10 cases, the same piece of legislation introduced into two legislative chambers is counted as two separate bills. Nonetheless, the number of bills is up from 50 bills in 16 states last year and only 12 bills in 1999. 
Much of the increase, Mr. Kunde said, is from what might be characterized as pro-biotech bills, in that 19 bills in 15 states are intended to penalize protesters who tear up genetically modified crops. 
But there are eight bills in six states that would ban or put a moratorium on the planting of genetically engineered crops, compared with seven bills in four states last year, Mr. Kunde said. There are nine bills in seven states that would require foods made from bioengineered crops to be labeled, up from six bills in five states last year. 
Other bills deal with seed sales. Still, virtually all the crop moratorium and labeling bills have made little headway. The one bill that did pass last year was in Mississippi, which required more extensive labels on bags of genetically modified seeds. That bill, like the North Dakota one, was backed by farmers.
Douglas Farquhar, a program director at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said the bills have not progressed because the federal government "keeps on saying we've got this covered." He said a state law might be subject to challenge on the grounds that it interfered with interstate commerce. 
But that is not clear. States can enact regulations that are stricter than federal ones, unless federal law specifically prohibits them, Mr. Kunde said. He said he was not aware of any pre-emptive federal rule related to bioengineered crops. 
The North Dakota bill, introduced by Representative Phillip Mueller, a wheat farmer himself, allows a committee of state officials and farm representatives to lift the ban earlier if Canada approves genetically engineered wheat. Research would be exempt from the ban.
In lobbying against the bill, Monsanto has told legislators that a moratorium by a major wheat-growing state would discourage the company from doing research on improved wheat, particularly for varieties grown in North Dakota.
Mark Buckingham, a Monsanto spokesman, said a moratorium was not needed because the company was willing to work with farmers to resolve their concerns. "It is absolutely not in our intentions to press forward with a product until it's wanted," he said.
A similar bill proposing a two-year moratorium on genetically modified wheat appears to have died in Montana. The North Dakota bill is now before the Senate Agriculture Committee. Terry Wanzek, a Republican and the chairman of the committee, said he had sensed some momentum to defeat the bill and instead require a study of the issues.
"A lot of farmers are for the bill and a lot of farmers are against it," said Mr. Wanzek, another farmer. "It's not an easy position to be in the middle of right now."

NUCOR, STEEL MAKER, CUTS EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The Nucor Corporation, the No. 2 steel maker in the nation, said yesterday that it had cut its first-quarter earnings expectations because of low steel prices and weak demand. 
The company, based in Charlotte, N.C., is also the nation's leading steel recycler. It forecast first-quarter earnings of 40 cents to 44 cents a share, down from its previous estimate of 50 cents. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expected earnings of 51 cents a share. Nucor said the first quarter had been difficult for the steel industry and it was still being hurt by the slowing economy and by imported steel.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS BACK IMMEDIATE TAX CUT PROPOSED BY G.O.P. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23 

 BODY:
The idea of a $60 billion tax cut this year to stimulate the economy gained strength in Congress today, but new questions arose about whether a consensus could be reached on the details.
 Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, and Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, called news conferences to announce their strong support of a plan for an immediate tax cut announced on Thursday by Republican senators. 
 But Mr. Daschle and Mr. Conrad said they could not go along with the intention of Republicans to tie the $60 billion tax cut for 2001 to Congressional approval of the across-the-board tax rate reductions proposed by President Bush. The rate cuts have been approved by the House but face uncertain prospects in the Senate. 
"Why not take what we already agree on, in the name of expeditious response to the economic concerns raised by leaders in both parties," Mr. Daschle said, instead of holding "that piece hostage to the larger questions involving the tax cut that have been debated now for several months."
The senator in charge of writing the details, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said in an interview that the bill he would send to the Senate would combine in a single package the immediate tax cut with long-term rate reduction.
"We aren't going to re-establish confidence in the economy just by putting $60 billion in people's hands," Mr. Grassley said. "That's a spit in the ocean compared with the changed behavior that would come from cutting the rates permanently."
Traveling in Maine, President Bush seemed to take the Grassley approach. "I think we can accelerate tax relief, we should accelerate tax relief and keep the size of the tax relief package at the same level," the president told reporters. 
The president's $1.6 trillion tax plan covers the 10 years beginning in 2002. Adding $60 billion in 2001 would not, in the president's view, change the overall size.
Accompanied by Maine's Republican senators, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, Mr. Bush signaled more of a willingness to compromise on taxes than he had in the past, although he insisted that the cost should be held at $1.6 trillion over 10 years.
"There's a lot of good ideas now being floated out in the Congress, and I'm open-minded to any good idea," he said. Ms. Snowe and Ms. Collins support measures that would have tax reductions reviewed and possibly suspended after a certain number of years if budget surpluses did not pan out, and Mr. Bush did not completely rule out this idea.
In an interview afterward, Ms. Snowe said, "I just sense that there is flexibility in the president's position."
The explanation, Ms. Collins said, is that "he understands that he does not have the votes that he needs" to get his plan unchanged through the Senate.
Mr. Grassley said his staff was researching the mechanics of putting an immediate tax cut into effect. Each of the potential ways of doing it has drawbacks.
Mr. Grassley said he was leaning toward putting rate cuts into effect retroactive to Jan. 1 and ordering the Treasury to develop new withholding tables immediately reflecting lower taxes this year. 
The effect would be that most people's take-home pay would rise. But the millions of people who make too little to owe income taxes would get nothing, and putting the new withholding tables in place could take eight weeks or more.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, plans to offer a proposal next week to send a rebate check to all taxpayers. The advantage in that approach is that people would get a chunk of money quickly. The problem is that the last record the Internal Revenue Service has of most taxpayers is their 1999 tax returns, and millions have moved, divorced or died since those returns were filed.
A third possibility under consideration is a temporary suspension of workers' Social Security and Medicare taxes. This would have the benefit of helping low-income workers who owe no income tax. But it might be perceived as draining money from Social Security and Medicare, and when the payroll tax returned to normal, it would look like a tax increase in workers' paychecks.
The drop in the stock market and signs of a faltering economy have clearly changed the political calculus on tax legislation. No longer is delay a possible tactic. Politicians cannot afford to be seen as doing nothing when constituents are concerned. 
"With the stock market doing what it's doing, there's increased angst in Congress that something has got to be done," said Alan Kranowitz, a business lobbyist who once worked in the Reagan White House.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said: "Clearly things are changing. Senators and House members are concerned. That's prompting all kinds of ideas. Ideas are sprouting like turnips around here."
The economic conditions have given the president and his Republican allies a new rationale for tax cuts -- that they are needed to turn the economy around. That was a hard sell for the president in the campaign last year when the economy was booming.
On the other hand, Democrats have also been emboldened and are no longer on the defensive. Bush's plan looked attractive when there was no real alternative, a Senate staff assistant said. Now, a Democratic lobbyist said, Democrats can vote for an immediate tax cut and then vote against parts of the Bush plan without suffering political consequences.
A Republican lobbyist said the volatility in the stock market was giving even some Republicans pause about the reliability of the long-term budget projections on which the Bush tax plan is grounded. 
James E. Glassman, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan who follows developments in Washington closely, said he doubted the long-term Bush plan would ever become law if Congress approved a quick stimulus package on its own.
Mr. Glassman and other Wall Street economists said a $60 billion tax cut in one year would be sufficient to give the economy a jolt, but they worried about whether the stimulus could be put in place before the economy regained strength on its own.
With the country in a recession in 1975, several economists recalled, Congress rushed through a tax cut that became law at the end of March. But it was months before the money reached people's pockets, and by then the economy was already recovering.
Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said a permanent rate cut would help the economy much more than a one-time stimulus. "The problem with one-time proposals," Mr. Berner said, "is that if people view them as temporary, they will respond in kind and save the money and not spend it."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Warns Candidates That Tax Increases Would Hurt City 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Saying that New York City is already too highly taxed, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani criticized suggestions by some of his potential successors that tax increases might be needed to pay for services like school improvements.
 "If we have budget problems in the city, we should reduce taxes more rather than raise them, because what we need to do is to encourage the economy of the city and make New York City more competitive, not less competitive," the mayor said yesterday on his weekly radio program on WABC-AM. "So when you hear these candidates talking about raising taxes, it gets me nervous for the future of the city, and for the future of the economy of the city." 
 Mr. Giuliani said that elected officials in New York City have too often resorted to a " 'Let's raise taxes' knee-jerk reaction." Although the mayor did not refer specifically to any candidate, his comments came in the same week that Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi announced his campaign and said that he would support a tax surcharge as a last resort to improve the city's public school system. Another expected candidate, Public Advocate Mark Green, said that he would not rule out such a tax increase. Mr. Green also said that the Giuliani administration should shift money intended for building jails to school construction.
The other two expected Democratic candidates, the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, say that a tax increase would be unnecessary. Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone, said that the speaker "does not believe we need to raise taxes," and that Mr. Vallone's plan would use residential property tax revenue to finance public schools. 
Mr. Ferrer's plan would reallocate money in the education budget to pay for teacher raises and other changes, said John Del Cecato, a campaign spokesman.
This week, two new financial analyses said that the city could be facing higher budget deficits than the city and state comptrollers' offices predicted just earlier this month. The new analyses, prepared by the State Financial Control Board and the city's Independent Budget Office, projected deficits ranging from $3.3 billion to $4.5 billion from the 2003 to 2005 fiscal years. Earlier analyses predicted deficits of about $2.3 billion to $4 billion.
Even though his administration has tried to insulate the city against an economic downturn by basing the budget on conservative revenue estimates and by creating a budget surplus account, Mr. Giuliani said, it is necessary to tighten the budget because of the national economy's recent "sputterings."
"Real difficulties on Wall Street and real difficulties in our economy obviously can have an impact on New York City like any place else," he said. The administration has asked city agencies to cut their budgets by 2 percent in the current fiscal year and 6 percent for the 2002 fiscal year, which begins this July 1.
The response to budget difficulties should be "reducing spending, not reducing the amount of money that we put into the private sector, which is, after all, the key, our savior" in terms of the economy, the mayor said. He added that the same should hold true in Washington.

To the Editor:
 While President Bush has focused on directing the projected surplus toward a tax cut, your March 21 news article "California Orders Blackouts for a Second Straight Day" highlights a far greater need. 
 California suffers from a serious power-supply deficit, a condition that threatens to spread across the country. For California to meet its own demand, the state must build new power plants.
Only the federal government can finance such an undertaking. The project of meeting this country's energy needs with money from the surplus would help the economy far more than any tax cut.

 Democratic Senators Back An Immediate Tax Cut Plan

But Mr. Daschle and Mr. Conrad said they could not go along with the intention of Republicans to tie the tax cut to Congressional approval of the across-the-board tax rate reductions proposed by President Bush. Page A1.

Ban on Modified Crops Is Considered
North Dakota is weighing a bill that would make it the first state to ban planting of a genetically modified crop, reflecting a surge of concern about such crops in state legislatures. The North Dakota bill, which would impose a two-year moratorium on growing genetically modified wheat, is one of more than 40 state bills introduced this year. A1.

Trial Ordered in Case Against Ford
A California judge ordered a trial to begin in September to assess damages in a case filed against Ford Motor on behalf of millions of car owners who claim the company knowingly installed defective ignition systems.

More Job Cuts Planned by Motorola
Motorola is cutting 4,000 more jobs, or about 3 percent of its work force, bringing the total eliminated since December to 22,000. The latest reductions are in Motorola's networks sector, which was created in January. Shares of Motorola climbed 31 cents, to $15.99, above its 52-week low of $13.94, and well off its 52-week high of $56.25. C3.

An Uneasy Birthday for Mercosur
The trade bloc known as Mercosur marks its 10th birthday on Monday. In some ways, there is much to celebrate: trade among Mercosur's four members has tripled, to $15 billion a year; foreign investment has soared; inflation has been tamed; and the group has become the world's third-largest market, with more than 210 million people and combined production of more than $1 trillion a year. Even so, the group is now under siege, riven by disputes between Brazil and Argentina, its two main members, and facing mounting external pressures, mostly from the United States. C2.

Image of 'Beautiful Game' Is Sullied
Brazilians say that soccer is not just the national sport, it is a religion. But the image of "the beautiful game," as Pele dubbed it, is being sullied by a spreading multimillion-dollar corruption scandal. Soccer generates about $16 billion a year in Brazil. But that wealth, it now appears, has provided opportunities for unscrupulous team administrators, managers and agents to plunder millions of dollars at the expense of the government, fans and their own teams' finances.

European Rate Cut Is Possible
The European Central Bank is less worried about inflation, said a bank council member, Jean-Claude Trichet, suggesting the bank might cut interest rates as soon as next week to stop euro zone economies from stalling.

HEADLINE: A Clerical, and Racial, Gap Over Federal Help 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

DATELINE: AUGUSTA, Ga. 

 BODY:
Last month, Mayor Bob Young invited his friend Stephen Goldsmith, a senior White House official, to meet with 200 ministers and community leaders here to talk up the president's plan to steer more government money to religious and nonprofit groups doing social service work.
 They met inside St. Paul's Episcopal Church on the landscaped banks of the Savannah River, and at the end Mr. Goldsmith received a standing ovation. 
 Many of the black ministers left and drove back across the railroad tracks, past blocks of rotting shotgun shacks, mentally calculating how many more children they could tutor and houses they could build with the government grants Mr. Goldsmith had talked about. 
The white ministers, meanwhile, drove off to their churches in the blossoming precincts known as the Hill, past the golf course where the Masters tournament is played, and began phoning one another to share their alarm about the dangers that could lie ahead for churches that accept money from the government, and for a nation that puts churches on the government payroll. 
As a focus group for the nation, Augusta reflects the incipient racial divide over President Bush's plan to channel more government financing to religious social services. The reactions are complex and also influenced by religious denomination and political affiliation. But it is clear that many urban black ministers confronted daily by the needs of the poor are more willing to consider government assistance.
"These children are hungry," said the Rev. Larry Fryer, who directs the New Hope Community Center in a poor neighborhood of Augusta. "Now, I'm a minister, but if I have to remove the Bible, remove the cross from the wall, remove the Ten Commandments to get that government money, I'll do it. If God is in me, that's good enough."
White suburban clergy members, meanwhile, are more concerned about freedom from government interference. "When there's work to be done, I would rather see my church come up with the money and the people to do it," said the Rev. Robert D. Fain of the Church of the Good Shepherd. "If we rely on the government, it compromises our witness."
The Bush administration has noticed the emerging gap and, in speeches and a presidential visit with black ministers this past week, begun to frame the initiative as an antipoverty issue.
Last week, legislation to put in place the first pieces of the plan was introduced in the House and Senate. But since Mr. Bush unveiled his initiative as a centerpiece of his presidency, it has unexpectedly sparked intense controversy nationwide, in particular among clergy members.
In Augusta, soon after Mr. Goldsmith left, a group of white clergy members (two Presbyterians, a Methodist, an Episcopalian, a Unitarian, a Southern Baptist and a Reform rabbi), who had never before found cause to meet, gathered at the Congregation Children of Israel to share their apprehensions. They were worried that the plan could compromise the independence of religious congregations, breach the separation of church and state, or result in coercive evangelizing of vulnerable people.
Fueling their misgivings was the experience shared by the rabbi's wife, Cynthia Parr, who had attended the meeting with Mr. Goldsmith out of curiosity after seeing an announcement in the newspaper. She noticed that the only clergy members there were Christian, so after the meeting she asked the mayor about it. He told her that he had invited everyone listed in the telephone book under "Churches." And he acknowledges that he said to her, "I suppose you are going to tell me I left out all the imams too," a reference to Muslim clergy members.
The group of white clergy members, pained by Mrs. Parr's account, grew decidedly queasy that the president's plan, when carried out in states and counties by local officials, could unintentionally pit one religion against another, unravel decades of efforts to build interfaith relationships, and ultimately exclude minority faiths. 
"It's not faith-based, it's Christian-based," said the Rev. J. Richard Short, pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, to fellow clergy members gathered over coffee recently at the synagogue. "I think it's a portent of things to come. Who is going to sit at the table and decide which applications get funded?"
In religious profile, Augusta resembles many Southern cities. There are enough churches to fill 10 pages in the phone book, but there is also a mosque (listed under "Churches -- Muslim"), a Hindu temple, a Sikh center and three synagogues (listed as "Churches -- Jewish.")
Mayor Young, a former television anchorman who was co-chairman of the Bush campaign in Georgia, said in an interview that he arranged the meeting on short notice, and did not intend to exclude anyone. He said he invited Mr. Goldsmith to Augusta because of its problems -- Augusta and adjacent Richmond County, with 200,000 residents, have the lowest per capita income in Georgia, a rising unemployment rate and one in three children living in poverty.
"African-American churches are doing those things that white people aren't interested in doing," he said.
On the south side, the black ministers, unaware of the discussions by their brothers on the Hill, greeted Mr. Goldsmith's presentation as both a major new antipoverty initiative and an endorsement for the black churches that have long served as a safety net in poor communities. 
"For me, it was a confirmation," said the Rev. Sam Davis, pastor of Beulah Grove Baptist Church, who runs a community center and development corporation in Augusta's battered core. "I believe that God is getting ready to redistribute the wealth to our economically hurting communities, and I am just grateful to President Bush."
The ministers shook Mr. Goldsmith's hand and pressed business cards into his palm. "My biggest concern when I left was fulfillment," Mr. Goldsmith later said in an interview. "People were saying, 'We're ready to go, and now what should I do?' And as you know, we don't actually have grant money." 
Mr. Fryer wrote to President Bush inviting him to visit the New Hope Community Center and talk to the children who come after school for meals and computer games.
The difference between black and white clergy members was made clear in a 1998 survey of more than 1,200 religious congregations conducted by Mark Chaves, a sociology professor at the University of Arizona. He found that 64 percent of the predominantly black congregations were willing to apply for government funds, compared with 28 percent of predominantly white congregations.
Last week, Mr. Bush met at the White House with 15 black ministers and urged them to help promote his initiative.
"We are coming out strongly supporting Bush and the faith-based initiative," the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers III of Boston, who assembled the group, said in an interview, "and we're generating a direct challenge to our flat-earth white fundamentalist brothers because, in all the racket in the last few weeks, the black churches haven't been heard from."
In Augusta last week, there were signs that the black churches are starting to be heard. The white ministers invited black ministers to join their meeting at the palatial First Baptist Church on the Hill. 
"I think we need to listen to them," said the Rev. Jeffrey J. Newlin, of Reid Memorial Presbyterian Church. "It's very easy for us removed from where the real social poverty problems are to issue our pronouncements." 
Mr. Davis told the group he would accept government funding because Beulah Grove Baptist has fallen into financial trouble trying to support its community center and development corporation. 
At Rabbi Jordan Parr's suggestion, they agreed to hold their next meeting in two weeks at Beulah Grove Baptist, across the tracks.

 India Unbound
By Gurcharan Das.
406 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50.
 IN 1997, when India celebrated the 50th anniversary of its independence, the world paid homage to its most populous democracy. Other countries had grown richer in those postcolonial years. Many had escaped the political and religious convulsions that had so often shaken the region. But almost alone in the non-Western world -- barring a short interruption in 1975, when Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency -- India had clung doggedly to its democratic convictions. A slew of books commemorated the achievement. One of the finest, Sunil Khilnani's "Idea of India," described India's polity as "the third moment in the great democratic experiment launched by the American and French Revolutions."
Like many of these books, Gurcharan Das's "India Unbound" is a broad summing-up of the last half century. Part memoir, part journalism, part history and part management bible, the book begins shortly before independence and continues until the new millennium. A former C.E.O. of Procter & Gamble in both India and America, and currently a venture capitalist and consultant, Das is less concerned with political than with economic history. And where authors like Khilnani cherish the revolution that began with independence in 1947, Das does not find full cause for jubilation until 1991, when India unleashed a series of economic reforms, the start of an "economic revolution" that he believes "may well be more important than the political revolution."
Those reforms were forced upon India, adopted less than enthusiastically when the nation found itself with foreign exchange reserves worth only two weeks of imports. Over the course of what Das calls a "golden summer," a newly installed government surprised everyone by easing foreign exchange restrictions, devaluing the rupee, lowering import tariffs and undoing the byzantine controls that had stifled Indian industry. Many -- Das included -- feel the reforms should have gone further, but the results nonetheless have been dramatic: after decades of chugging along at the so-called Hindu rate of growth (a dismal 3.5 percent per year), the economy grew by an average of 7.5 percent in the mid-1990's. The growth in disposable incomes, and the opening up of the country to world markets, has altered the face of Indian society, creating a new consumer middle class. Das argues that these changes are only the beginning of a dramatic reversal of fortunes. "The theme of this book," he writes, "is how a rich country became poor and will be rich again."
At the heart of "India Unbound" is a deep ambivalence about Jawaharlal Nehru, the architect of Indian independence but also of its disastrous economic policies. Das recognizes the political contributions made by Nehru, and he writes of the admiration he felt as a young man for the handsome leader whose lofty ideals inspired a nation. But, echoing an increasingly common attitude in modern India, he feels that Nehru's faith in Soviet-style central planning cheated the nation of the prosperity enjoyed by some of its Southeast Asian neighbors. Nehru's revolution, Das argues, was incomplete, delivering political liberty but failing to unshackle the nation economically. In one of the more eloquent expressions of this sentiment, he tells of a meeting at which the industrialist Rahul Bajaj is threatened with imprisonment for producing more scooters than permitted by his quota. "My grandfather went to jail for my country's freedom," replies Bajaj. "I stand ready to do the same for producing on behalf of my motherland."
Such stories enliven what could easily have been a dull piece of economic history. Das had a ringside seat at the events he describes, and the result is an engaging account that moves easily from the big picture to the telling anecdote. Through Das, we are introduced not just to the standard pantheon of political figures but to a range of lesser-known characters from the corporate world. These include old-fashioned industrialists like Bajaj and also a new brand of businessman -- entrepreneurs like Narayana Murthy, the C.E.O. of Infosys, India's most successful software company, and Subhash Chandra, the founder of a global Hindi satellite television channel, often called "the Murdoch of Asia."
Das's sympathies clearly lie with this later generation of managers. He sees the earlier breed as dinosaurs, pampered by a protectionist government and doomed to oblivion. His enthusiasm for the new order becomes most apparent in the book's final section, where he succumbs to a certain giddiness over India's prospects in the 21st century. Das is particularly excited about India's software industry, a sector whose great success has led many to predict -- as the head of India's largest mutual fund recently did -- that "what oil is to the Middle East, infotech is to India."
Such optimism is not entirely misplaced. India's high-tech industry has been the most visible success of the reforms, generating fabulous wealth and great opportunities. What is less clear is the extent to which this wealth is trickling down to the 300 million Indians who still live in poverty and the 75 percent who live in the countryside, far away from the new economy. Das is undoubtedly right that poverty has tarnished India's democracy, but he seems less concerned that unequal prosperity may have the same effect. To be fair, he does argue that democracy and capitalism need not be mutually exclusive, and cites from the work of Amartya Sen, who has repeatedly written on the importance of integrating the two. But despite his professed preference for "democratic capitalism," Das's faith in free markets can come across as overly zealous, as when he complains that too many Indians "are still listening to the background noise of democracy when we could be listening to the music of entrepreneurship."
However, one doesn't need to share Das's unbridled fervor for markets to appreciate this book. "India Unbound" is like an opinionated but insightful guide to a rapidly changing nation in which old cliches about spirituality and poverty are increasingly irrelevant. Near the end, Das writes about his son, who has decided to leave a job in New York and return to India to start a company. "He's caught up in the spirit of our times, when every young person is willing to risk the security of a job to pursue his passion," Das writes. That "spirit" signals a dramatic widening of horizons, a new self-confidence. Something tremendous is happening in India, and Das, with his keen eye and often elegant prose, has his finger firmly on the pulse of the transformation.

 A Question of Intent
A Great American Battle With a Deadly Industry.
By David Kessler.
492 pp. New York:
PublicAffairs. $27.50.
 Back in 1990, when David Kessler was teaching at Columbia Law School, he invited the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration to give a lecture to his class. Shortly after arriving, the F.D.A. head thumped his chest and explained he was wearing "body armor" because of a threat on his life. During his lecture, he kept repeating, "F.D.A. is in the vortex."
Later that year, Kessler was himself named F.D.A. commissioner by the first President Bush. Soon he could have used some of that "body armor," as he placed himself in "the vortex" of the nation's tobacco wars, seeking for the first time in the agency's history to regulate cigarettes.
"A Question of Intent," Kessler's account of his struggle with the tobacco industry during his seven years at the F.D.A., is indispensable in many ways. He tells how companies produce and promote a product that is lethal and addictive. He explores the difficulties of regulating rich, powerful corporations. And he provides a practical guide for any executive seeking to turn around a troubled organization and advance a controversial agenda.
To be sure, Kessler sometimes seems disingenuous. He repeatedly maintains that he initially did not intend to tackle tobacco, generously credits his ideas to others and modestly disclaims his manifest skills at political maneuvering and media manipulation. But even the most self-servingly self-effacing elements of this narrative offer valuable insights for bureaucratic boat-rockers.
Nominated as F.D.A. commissioner at the age of 39, Kessler was an overachiever in charge of a historically underachieving agency. By training both a physician and an attorney, he had spent his professional career preparing for the job, having taught food and drug law and served as an unpaid assistant to a Senate committee, where he became the resident F.D.A. expert. 
Finding the agency to be "underfunded, understaffed and demoralized," Kessler perceptively observed that its real problems were structural, not personal. While the F.D.A. is responsible for regulating the nation's food, medications and cosmetics, it suffers from having been established early in the 20th century and, therefore, lacking many of the prerogatives of newer regulatory agencies. As Kessler writes, "It could not subpoena witnesses and documents, embargo unsafe or questionable food and drugs, assess civil penalties for most violations or destroy unsafe imports."
Yet Kessler recognized that the agency's adversities created opportunities (because "bold action would likely be tolerated, perhaps even welcomed"), and he quickly established his presence by publicly pressuring food manufacturers to stop using the word "fresh" to describe products like sauces made with frozen tomatoes and orange juice made from concentrate. Then he successfully pushed for tough labeling requirements, including calorie content, for packaged foods, persuading Bush to reject the objections of the industry and his own Agriculture Department.
Meanwhile, Kessler was laying the groundwork for taking on tobacco. And after he was renominated to his post by Bill Clinton, who was outspokenly antismoking, Kessler stepped up his efforts to have the F.D.A. explore whether it should regulate tobacco, something his predecessors had refused to do. 
The F.D.A.'s enabling legislation defines drugs in part as substances that are "intended to affect the structure or any function of the body." Kessler credits an F.D.A. attorney with suggesting that the agency focus on nicotine, the tobacco component that scientists have long suspected makes smoking habit-forming. Kessler started an investigation of whether the tobacco companies intended to ensnare smokers by manipulating the level of nicotine in their cigarettes.
Now he entered a netherworld of legal ambiguity and corporate secrecy, and what follows is an engrossing, if occasionally exhausting, detective drama. Two F.D.A. investigators -- a veteran of Army undercover narcotics operations and a retired New York City transit police officer -- turned up informers from within the tobacco industry, whom they provided with colorful code-names like Deep Cough, the Nicotine Kid and Cigarette Jr. Meanwhile, a squad of scientists, researchers and lawyers pored over corporate documents, patent applications and court proceedings. This "tobacco team" found that the companies were aware that nicotine is addictive, controlled the nicotine level in cigarette brands by blending different types of tobacco and even developed a new kind of high-nicotine plant. "Some of today's cigarettes," Kessler writes, "may in fact qualify as high-technology nicotine delivery systems that . . . create and sustain addiction."
Suspecting he would be stymied by higher-ups at the Department of Health and Human Services, Kessler established his own channels to the White House, and as Clinton prepared for his 1996 re-election campaign, Kessler shrewdly framed an approach that focused on the companies' efforts to market cigarettes to teenagers. At a news conference with Clinton, Kessler announced new regulations designed to discourage teenage smoking, including bans on the tobacco companies' running advertisements with cartoon figures like Joe Camel, sponsoring sports events like the Nascar races or selling cigarettes in vending machines. But early in 2000, by which time Kessler had left the F.D.A., the Supreme Court, by a familiar 5-to-4 margin, upheld the companies' challenge to the agency's authority to regulate tobacco. 
Radicalized by the industry's cynicism, Kessler now favors dismantling, not regulating, the corporations that make and sell cigarettes. "It has become apparent," he concludes, "that nothing else will work."
If anything approaching this proposal ever comes to pass, historians will give a great deal of the credit to the indefatigable David Kessler, who took on an influential but irresponsible industry. One of his offhand observations should be memorized by careerists both inside and outside the Beltway: "The challenge in Washington, I began to realize, was not getting a job, but figuring out what to do with it."

 MOTHER JONES
The Most Dangerous Woman in America.
By Elliott J. Gorn.
Illustrated. 408 pp. New York:
Hill & Wang. $27.
 The labor agitator Mother Jones (1837-1930) relished her role as a hell-raiser. In her bold efforts to rally workers, she harangued crowds, led union marches and stared down gun-toting company thugs. Imprisoned several times as a subversive, she courted arrest, once boasting, "I can raise more hell in jail than out." 
 She elicited both veneration and vitriol. For the coal miners and steelworkers she defended, she was little less than a saint. "That's Jesus Christ come down on earth again, and playing he's an old woman," a miner declared. One newspaper pronounced her "God's great ministering angel," another "perhaps the most remarkable woman in America." 
 The establishment types she battled had less flattering things to say about her. On the floor of the House of Representatives she was branded a "notorious and troublesome woman." A United States attorney is reported to have named her "the most dangerous woman in America," the epithet that provides the subtitle for Elliott J. Gorn's lively, well-honed biography, "Mother Jones."
 Gorn, a professor of history at Purdue, reveals that there was ample reason for these hyperbolic reactions. Energetic and peripatetic well into her 80's, Mother Jones devoted much of the last three decades of her life to traveling from one troubled labor site to another. Alarmed by the low pay and harsh lives of America's blue-collar work force, she encouraged workers to organize and, if necessary, to rebel against their employers. "Arm yourselves," she is said to have told one audience, "return home and kill every goddamned mine guard on the creeks." 
 Lacing her calls for workers' revolt with promises of a brighter tomorrow, she spared no venom when inveighing against American capitalists, whom she labeled "cannibalistic plutocrats" and "pirates." She called John D. Rockefeller "the greatest murderer the nation had ever produced." For a time, she was active in the Socialist Party of America. But even that organization proved too tame for her, and she left it, though she stayed close to its leader, Eugene V. Debs, who admiringly termed her "this intrepid old warrior" and the "heroine of a thousand battles." Small wonder that when the Red scare, a fit of anti-Communist paranoia, swept the nation after World War I, she was called a Bolshevik, a description she heartily accepted.
 Curiously, as Gorn shows, she had a strong conservative streak. Although she was one of the most socially involved women in American history, she opposed woman suffrage, even on the eve of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the vote. She declared, "I have no vote, and I've raised hell all over this country," as if bravado could make up for the disfranchisement of half the American population. Given her radicalism, it's hard to fathom her bald statements on the issue - for example, "In no sense of the word am I in sympathy with woman's suffrage." 
 Gorn wrestles with this surprising attitude, attributing it to her belief that in a class-based society, economic relations mattered more than political or social ones. He demonstrates that in other ways too her radicalism went only so far. Although she praised African-American workers, she was known to make racist remarks about Chinese immigrants. And she held conventional ideas about the family, maintaining that men should be breadwinners while their wives stayed home.
 If Gorn is unable to explain fully such reactionary stances, he dexterously incorporates them into his portrait of this complex woman. Mother Jones, he makes clear, was a carefully constructed public persona. She was born Mary Harris, and her married name was Mary Jones, but she referred to herself only as "Mother" after espousing labor reform full time. Believing that woman's special gift was love, she saw labor unions as extended families over which she could shower mother-love. The workers she addressed were her "boys." Gorn eloquently describes how she worked within the code of conventional womanhood even as she opened new vistas in social reform. 
 Little information survives about her early life. Given the paucity of hard facts, Gorn does an admirable job of outlining her roots, filling in historical background to establish the social and cultural contexts that nurtured her. He recreates the abject working-class environment of Cork, Ireland, where she was raised, and the devastating potato famine of the 1840's, which drove her family, along with thousands of others, to America. He describes the world of poor, illiterate Irish immigrants like her father, a milkman turned railway worker who settled first in Vermont and then in Toronto. He probes the prevailing anti-Catholicism in Toronto that must have made the young Mary, trained in a convent school, seem at times like an outcast. He follows her humble path as a workingwoman drifting to Michigan, where she taught in a Catholic school, then to Chicago, where she was a dressmaker, and finally to Memphis, where she met and married the ironworker George Jones.
 IN Memphis she experienced an unspeakable tragedy that shaped the rest of her life. In the late 1860's, yellow fever killed her husband and four children. The grief-stricken widow moved back to Chicago, where, as a seamstress for the rich, she bitterly noted the contrast between the "luxury and extravagance" of the few and the misery of the "poor, shivering wretches" she saw on the streets. 
 After the great Chicago fire of 1871 destroyed all her possessions, she could have fallen into depression. Instead, grief became the crucible of her commitment to working-class reform. Having lost her real family, she found a new one - the family of the oppressed and dispossessed. In the late 1870's, she experienced what she called a conversion to labor activism. She seems to have borne alarmed witness to many of the strikes that swept America over the next two decades. Around 1900, she became the chief speaker for the United Mine Workers, the largest and most progressive union in the nation, and appeared not only at coal strikes but at railroad, steel, textile and brewery strikes as well. 
 Weaned on personal misfortune and fired by rage against social injustice, she was the very embodiment of her famous rallying cry, "Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living."

 BODY:
 The Missing World, by Margot Livesey. (Penguin, $13.) In this British novel, a young journalist awakens from a coma after a traffic accident to find she has no memory of the last three years; her creepy former boyfriend, seeing an opening, tries to marry her before she recovers her past. The result is "intelligent fiction, vigorous both in its observation of human foible and in its speculation on the role that memory plays in underwriting our sense of choice and direction in our lives," Michael Upchurch wrote in the Book Review last year.

The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington, by Maurice Isserman. (PublicAffairs, $14.) Michael Harrington (1928-89) was a Socialist critic whose 1962 book, "The Other America," was a landmark study of the culture of poverty, and whose life work was to create a "left wing of the possible." In 2000 our reviewer, Victor Navasky, called this a "fair and fascinating account of a charismatic and appealing actor on the American political stage."

Sick Puppy, by Carl Hiaasen. (Warner Vision, $7.99.) This gleefully chaotic novel, in which a deranged eco-terrorist takes aim at a corrupt lobbyist (and litterbug), is populated by depraved and awful Floridians of all stripes, from crooked politicians to swamp-dwelling vigilantes. " 'Sick Puppy' begins with an absurd premise and then gets nuttier," Joe Queenan wrote here last year.

Shakespeare's Kings. The Great Plays and the History of England in the Middle Ages: 1337-1485, by John Julius Norwich. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16.) The British historian assesses the reliability of Shakespeare's plays about the later Plantagenets, setting the chronology straight and sorting out conflated or confused figures for the "enthusiastic but cheerfully nonexpert" Shakespeare lover. "Lord Norwich takes to his task with characteristic panache," R. N. Swanson wrote in these pages last year. "His style is easy and highly readable."

A Member of the Family, by Susan Merrell. (Perennial/ HarperCollins, $13.) In this first novel about the limits of familial love, an American couple who adopt an emotionally disturbed Romanian orphan are forced to contemplate some tough decisions when his disruptive behavior threatens to destroy their family. The result is "a heartbreaking story about an adoption gone very wrong," Betsy Groban said here last year.

The Nature of Economies, by Jane Jacobs. (Vintage, $12.) The social critic best known for her groundbreaking 1961 work, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," maintains that economies mimic natural systems in the way they evolve, and that they need to be understood in ecological terms. "She draws upon a rich knowledge of diverse literatures . . . and has lost none of her astute wit," Robert Kuttner wrote here in 2000.

The Verificationist, by Donald Antrim. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) This slender novel features a bunch of squabbling psychoanalysts (none with medical degrees) who meet in an all-night pancake house to chew over their livelihood and their sexuality, among other things. The narrator observes most of the action while floating around the ceiling. The result is "a book that clatters and whirs like a Rube Goldberg device, spitting out, on every page, perfectly formed pellets of intellection, rude humor, grief and longing," Dwight Garner wrote here last year.

The Tulip, by Anna Pavord. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) A British garden writer blends botany and history in charting the remarkable ascendancy of the tulip, a humble wildflower from Central Asia that captivated Europe in the 17th century and became a global craze. Her narrative, which has been reissued with fewer illustrations than in the hardcover edition, "will create many new devotees," Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote here in 1999. Tulipomania: The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower and the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused, by Mike Dash (Three Rivers, $12), is a close-in study of the speculative buying and selling of tulips that gripped the Netherlands in the 1600's, creating the world's first futures market before ending in a spectacular crash. " 'Tulipomania' captures the frenzy of a fascinating phenomenon," Carol Peace Robins wrote here last year.

Acts of Mutiny, by Derek Beaven. (Picador USA, $13.) The narrator of this ambitious novel sets out from England to Australia in 1959 with his mother and her lover aboard a liner filled with disaffected emigres, and discovers that the military has stashed a deadly weapon in the hold. Last year in these pages, Mark Schone praised the book's "exciting, geopolitical plot." Scott Veale

 No Small Courage
A History of Women
in the United States.
Edited by Nancy F. Cott.
Oxford University, $35.
 "In much of the Western world's written history, women's presence is minimal," Nancy F. Cott writes in the preface to "No Small Courage." This ambitious book examines women's experiences in the New World since Columbus landed, and attempts to demonstrate that newly found perspectives will "change the historical record altogether." Its 10 chapters, written by nine historians under Cott's editorship, look at "work and leisure, family patterns, political activities, forms of organization and outstanding accomplishments." The writers also examine the effect of race and economic class on women's lives. For example, in a section on the colonial Chesapeake region, Jane Kamensky, a historian at Brandeis University, writes, "Planters' wives were increasingly able to restrict themselves to duties befitting proper English matrons because they enslaved Africans to do the rest of their work." In its coverage of the 20th century, "No Small Courage" becomes more a history of feminism than of the female experience. The final chapter, for instance, provides details on the divergent views of feminist factions in the 1960's and 70's, and even on countermovements, but offers scant information on the patterns of women's lives during that time. There is little new scholarship, but illuminating and lively personal narratives are interwoven throughout the book. These individual stories help shape this multilayered record, which falls short of painting a complete picture of women in the United States but succeeds in giving a sense of how women have been "active agents" in American history, in the words of Cott, who teaches history and American studies at Yale.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Racing for Dollars, Photography Pulls Abreast of Painting

BYLINE:  By RICHARD B. WOODWARD; Richard B. Woodward is an editor-at-large for DoubleTake magazine.

 BODY:
FOR better or worse, photography is the New New Thing in the art market. Over the last two years, with fortunes being won and lost on bets about our digital future, the most searching visual invention of the 19th century has been charting upward like a 1999 Internet stock.
 Record prices have become the norm for every period. A few contemporary photographers, at auction last year for the first time, outsold their peers in other mediums. No booth at New York's recent Armory Show, a showcase for international art trends, seemed up-to-date without a photographer or two; while the exposure photography received in the city's museums amid the millennial hoo-hah last year was unprecedented. Even if the new financial respect and visibility for photographs in 2000 is seen in decades to come as a blip, one of many tech bubbles that popped, a dizzying sense that milestones had been passed and barriers leaped was hard to ignore. 
 ARTnewsletter reported in September that a print of Man Ray's "Glass Tears" from 1932-33 had sold privately in 1999 to the collector John Pritzker for "substantially more than a million dollars." (Only three years earlier another "Glass Tears" set the record for a photograph at Sotheby's at a mere $266,500.) If nothing else, the sale indicated to many people, as the dealer Howard Greenberg said, that the "price gap between great photos and great works in other media is closing."
Nowhere was this phenomenon on more egregious display than at New York's contemporary art auctions last year. Enormous, digitized, color prints by young Germans ruled the block. "Pantheon, Rome" by Thomas Struth, hammered down for $270,000 at Christie's in May, measures 8 by 6 feet; while Andreas Gursky's "Prada II," which fetched the same price in Christie's November sale, is nearly 10 feet across -- wider than most of Pollock's canvases. Even photographs that aren't king-size, at least if by Cindy Sherman, were bid up to unheard of heights. "Untitled No. 209," a color self-portrait from 1989, went for $269,000 at Sotheby's in the spring while "Untitled No. 92" from 1982 fetched $259,000 in the fall at Christie's, making her among the most prized American artists of her generation in any medium. No photographer in history has achieved the monetary parity with painters and sculptors that Ms. Sherman, Mr. Struth and Mr. Gursky now enjoy.
That none of the photographs mentioned above are unique works -- all the images have existing variants or were printed in editions -- may mean that the upper end of the contemporary-art market has at last accepted the replicant nature of photography (previously a deterrent to high prices); or that buyers are willing to overlook this uncomfortable fact in exceptional cases.
The tide of money has rolled into the calmer bays of 19th-century photography as well. Sotheby's London sale in October 1999 of the Andre and Marie-Therese Jammes collection was billed as an event. The Parisian couple pioneered an appreciation for French calotypists like Gustave Le Gray, Henri Le Secq, Edouard Baldus and others. Still, few collectors predicted the bidding frenzy that ensued. An 1855 albumen print by Le Gray went to an anonymous phone bidder for $840,370 -- a world record for a photograph at auction. Another Le Gray went for $694,650.
The total of $12.3 million for 265 lots prompted The International Herald Tribune to call it "one of those historic days when an extraordinary sale brings home the fact that a major change in cultural perception has taken place."
The centrality of photographs for the millennial celebrations reinforced this impression of a cultural earthquake. Many surveys of American art, even one as recent as Robert Hughes's "American Visions," have played down the contributions of photographers to the country's artistic heritage. 
But last year there was no getting away from them. The Whitney Museum's two-part extravaganza, "The American Century," highlighted photographers from beginning to end.
At the Museum of Modern Art, the space given to photography was still more striking. In a year devoted to re-examining its mission and its collections, 30 of the 50 shows had photographs on the walls with paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures and videos. In this new, provisional, uncompartmentalized MOMA, photography stood for the first time on equal footing with every other art. Its prominence within the museum was further emphasized by the announcement in December that MOMA would buy 1,000 photographs by Lee Friedlander -- 868 prints from the 1950's to the present, and another 132 prints "representing current and future work." Not only is this the largest purchase of works by a living artist in the history of the museum, it is the first time the Modern has committed itself to buying art not yet made.
Some of the pressure to change photography's status has come from contemporary practice. Young artists everywhere have accepted the camera as simply one among many picture-making tools and photographs as just another kind of image. The awarding of the 2000 Turner Prize in England to Wolfgang Tillmans, the first time a full-fledged photographer has won this glamorous award, completes a dramatic shift that began in the 80's when photographers first appeared routinely in painting and sculpture galleries. It is no longer unusual to find, say, prints by Robert Mapplethorpe or Sherrie Levine hanging in the collection of someone who also owns a David Salle painting or a Damien Hirst vitrine.
But a noticeable change in the Chelsea scene over the last year or so has been the appearance of photographers who were never stars during the 80's art boom. Robert Adams, associated with the New Topographics movement of the 70's and among the most unassuming artists alive, had two large shows last year at Matthew Marks, a premier space for contemporary work. The color landscape photographer Stephen Shore, another relative old-timer, turned up at 303, a gallery better known for showing young painters and installation artists.
Perhaps the older New Topographic focus of Mr. Adams and Mr. Shore will help to establish an American lineage for the newer New Topographics of Mr. Struth and Mr. Gursky; or maybe photography of any style, even small-scale documentary, is now welcome in art's marketplace. The Andrea Rosen Gallery, which represents artists in many mediums but mostly with a conceptual bent, will have a show by Mr. Friedlander this spring. 
Some of the older antagonistic critical rubrics -- between modern and postmodern, "straight" and "staged" -- seem increasingly empty or pointless as money begins to change everything.
Whether this is altogether good for photographers is another matter.
Will people start to view exhibitions, like Mr. Gursky's current show at the Modern, with dollar signs in their eyes? What will happen to the photography market and to people's expectations when, as some conservators and dealers predict, the color in some of these high-priced prints starts to fade? The layer of serious photography collectors in the world remains dangerously thin.
The market may be surging ahead of what photography can truly deliver as an owned thing with an aura that offers solace or proves one's financial savviness and self-worth.
Throughout its history photography struggled to be respected as an art on equal grounds with painting and sculpture. It existed on the margins, with scant attention from the art magazines or general news media. Those days are probably over. But what seemed to be a disadvantage may in fact have been a relative blessing. Commenting from the sidelines on the follies of human vanity has been one of its most constructive roles. Then again, it may turn out that 2000 was the year that photographers finally joined -- or led -- the passing parade.

West Coast Hotels Dim Lights, Raise Rates

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The power problems on the West Coast have prompted a number of hotels to add surcharges, usually from $1.50 to $2.50 a night. In addition, some chains and individual properties are taking energy conservation measures, which range from installing dimmer light bulbs in guest rooms to shutting down the hotel laundry. 
 Marriott, for example, which manages or owns more than 150 hotels in California, has added a $2.50 surcharge to daily room rates in its full-service hotels and $1.50 a night at others, such as those carrying its Courtyard brand. While Marriott cannot mandate the surcharge for its franchisees, it said that it expects most of them to go along. 
 "When the energy situation is resolved the surcharge will be removed," said Lucy Bossert, a Marriott spokeswoman. Meanwhile, to conserve energy, which many hotel operators say accounts for about 10 percent of their costs, Marriott recently appointed an energy manager for its Western region.
Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which includes the Sheraton, Westin and W brands, has added a $2.50 nightly surcharge to its 60 or so hotels in California, Oregon and Washington. It also plans to keep the surcharge until energy costs start coming down.
Hilton Hotels has a $3 per night surcharge at the 49 properties it owns and manages in California. In addition to the Hilton brand, they include some Doubletree, Embassy Suites and Red Lion hotels.
The upscale 667-room Argent Hotel in San Francisco has begun assigning guests to certain floors when it isn't filled, then shutting off lights and turning down heating on the unoccupied floors. The Argent has also installed 27-watt halogen bulbs in its guest rooms, providing as much light as 100-watt bulbs while using less energy.

Three Shows and Each Has Its Charm

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
IT has become something of a trend at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven to emphasize presentation. 
 Three exhibitions currently at Yale illustrate this in different ways. (Two of them are here only through today; the third one closes in a week.) They are interesting in their details, but the way they look as totalities gives a clue to what might be expected in future shows. 
 The first show, "Objective Color," is the most radical of the three, discarding some of the traditional rules governing a museum exhibition. The show is an assembly of 20th-century art, almost all abstract paintings and sculptures from Yale's collection, with each piece included because color is its main reason for being.
The focus on color means the viewer is supposed to disregard chronology, even the title and artist's name, and give himself over to a pure retinal experience. 
Jennifer Gross, the gallery's curator of European and contemporary art, has concocted an alluring environment. All the intense color gives the proceedings a garish "swinging 60's" look. Viewers can't help being dazzled -- and then frustrated -- because Ms. Gross has done away with putting identification labels next to the objects. Instead, posted at various points in the gallery are laminated sheets containing information that is usually provided by wall labels. The experience of trying to find information about a work one is interested in is more distracting than any wall label could ever be. Perhaps Ms. Gross should have banished written information altogether.
But it is writing that emerges as the most engrossing part of the show. Near the exit is a book for visitors to write their comments. A civil war is being waged in those pages, and it is amazing that such a range of attitudes could be elicited by a display of art that is 99 percent abstract. 
Around the corner, by contrast, is an exhibition drained of color: "From Caligula to Constantine: Tyranny and Transformation in Roman Portraiture." The portrait sculptures are in various earth colors and the walls are gray. The gallery's decor is intended to recreate a Roman house with a pool, a household shrine and an atrium in which images of the ruling emperor and ancestors would be displayed. It is an august atmosphere, just right for the display of objects set in stone.
But when viewers begin to examine the carved portraits, or likenesses on coins, they realize they are looking at something that is the opposite of static; rather, it is fluid and chameleonlike. Most of these portraits have been reworked in order to erase the familiar physiognomies of tyrants. The features of a successor, or even an ancestor, supplant the original ones. The practice was not a matter of economy when it came to portraits of emperors. The reworking, the replacing of the bad with the good, was akin to redemption.
The exhibition also contains a number of portraits of private citizens, and their reworking was related to economy. Yale's curator of ancient art, Susan B. Matheson, contends the materials were costly and that warehouses of sculptures may have been available for reuse.
A major issue in the exhibition is the treatment of likenesses of women, who may or may not have been innocent bystanders. A marble portrait of Plautilla, the wife of Caracalla who was executed on her husband's orders a decade after their marriage, retains extensively damaged eyes nose and mouth.
Professor Eric Varner of Emory University, who organized the exhibition, comments that Plautilla's defacement deprived her "of any metaphorical ability to 'see' or 'speak' to the inhabitants of the Roman Empire."
In the Asian Galleries is "Ancients and Moderns: Tradition and Transformation in the Arts of Asia." There will be a Part II beginning April 17. The word "transformation" in the title is a clue that the show's intent is something like the Roman portraiture show. The objects are not to be regarded as static; rather the exhibition is an animated experience.
Standing at the entrance to the show a viewer is impressed by the vista, a long stretch of display cases containing a diversity of Japanese or Chinese household objects. There is also two-dimensional work on the walls. In the middle of the show, the viewer assumes the role of amateur connoisseur. Several centuries might separate the similar objects in a given display case and the viewer can't resist trying to determine the historical order.
A group of Japanese ceramics is especially rough hewn, evincing a kind of expressionism that is easily associated with the contemporary era. But basic, historically refined forms remain under the surfaces, and the experience of the exhibition becomes one of appreciating how much inspiration contemporary artisans have taken from the past.
"Objective Color" and "From Caligula to Constantine" close today. Part I of "Ancients and Moderns" closes April 1. Information: (203) 432-0600.

Knowing What You Owe

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI 

 BODY:
THERE is little that I can be smug about, but when it comes to debt, I can be obnoxious. Except for my mortgage, I have no debt: no car loans, no credit card balances, no margin loans. Even my mortgage is laughable: 15 years at 5.625 percent; I hope to have it paid off by the time my daughter starts college in four years.
 A few years ago, when I was thinking about moving to a different home, the loan officer who was handling my mortgage application was in awe, saying she had rarely met anyone who was so debt-free. 
 Is that obnoxious enough?
Many of my friends live on debt. They ask me, "Why should I spend my money when I can spend the bank's?" But I find debt troubling -- especially when the economy is slowing.
My generation is no stranger to debt. According to a Federal Reserve Board report on consumer finances in 1998, the latest agency numbers available, 87 percent of families headed by people 35 to 54 years old had some kind of debt. Almost 60 percent had mortgages, while about half had installment loans, like those for cars. About half had balances on their credit cards.
What the heck are we doing? That is easy to explain. "The American dream requires more than a turkey in every pot," said Robert E. Veasey, a certified financial planner in East Providence, R.I. "It needs filet mignon on every grill. When I grew up, going out to eat was a treat. No one stays home to cook anymore. We drive cars that are expensive. It isn't enough to have basic cable. Now I need digital cable."
Kathleen Meunier of Warwick, R.I., 37, said she and her husband, Richard, who have a combined annual income of $60,000, had accumulated about $45,000 in debt a few years ago. Using credit, they had bought two cars and a big-screen television and had a swimming pool installed at their home. "We were really living the idea that money grew on trees," she said. "We went out to eat three, four times a week. We went away on vacations twice a year and to bed-and-breakfasts once a month."
The odd thing about debt is that many people don't know how much they have. Ms. Meunier said she didn't realize the extent of her indebtedness until a financial counsel pointed it out to her about two years ago.
Credit counselors say debt problems don't hit some people until they are over the limit on their credit cards and cannot use them anymore.
"They almost don't want to know what their situation is," Mr. Veasey said. "They finally get to a point when they see the situation and then are embarrassed about it."
Ms. Meunier sought help from the Consumer Credit Counseling Services of Southern New England, a nonprofit group that put her on a budget and helped her pay off the debts.
Cynthia Becker, regional coordinator of education and new business development for the group, said many people use credit to pay for everyday expenses, which, of course, can snowball. A rule of thumb, she said, is that debt payments should not exceed 40 percent of income.
That is where some baby boomers are getting into trouble. The Fed report said that in 1998, some 11.6 percent of families in which the head of household was 35 to 44 had debt payments that were more than 40 percent of their incomes. That is up from 7.8 percent of such families in 1989.
For households headed by 45- to 54-year-olds, a category comprising mostly boomers, the figure was also 11.6 percent in 1998, up from 10.9 percent in 1989. And all of this was before the economy began turning sour.
Usually, Mr. Veasey and Ms. Becker said, the only way out is to cut expenses. But to do that, you have to know what they are. Mr. Veasey suggested carrying a little notebook and entering everything you spend money on. "I don't care if it's a pack of gum," he said.
Then start cutting back. Don't go out to eat as often. Put off buying that television. Visit Grandpa for vacation, not Mickey Mouse. Over time, the savings add up, and before you know it, the bills are not only paid, but you actually have money left over. 
Ms. Becker said the slowing economy and the pending change in bankruptcy laws would spell trouble for more people. She said her organization, which covers Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, had 17,551 families enrolled in debt management plans at the end of last year, up from 16,223 in 1999. She said she expected the numbers to rise this year.
"It will get worse before it gets better," she said.

HEADLINE: Suffolk's Budget: Quick Change in Direction 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A CHILL passed through Suffolk County government earlier this year when state figures for December sales tax receipts arrived. They showed a 16.6 percent drop from a year earlier, a startling plunge in the revenues that finance more than half of county government but fluctuate, sometimes wildly, with the regional economy and with the strength of retail sales.
 The growth of sales tax revenues had been so strong from the 1990's through the first three quarters of last year -- frequently increasing by double digits over the previous year -- that last March Suffolk confidently joined a handful of other New York counties and cities in rescinding the sales tax on clothing costing less than $110, forgoing an estimated $29 million in revenue from March through December. 
 But with a weak fourth quarter last year, highlighted by the December plunge in receipts, county estimates of $789.6 million in sales tax revenues for 2000, estimates made before the slowdown, turned out to be almost $28 million higher than the $761.7 the county actually collected. And that's after the estimates had been adjusted to take the clothing exemption into account. 
Now a projected increase in sales tax receipts for 2001, based on what was in retrospect the overly optimistic 2000 estimate of an increase of more than 8 percent, looks impossibly high as the economy sputters.
In his state-of-the-county address last week, Robert J. Gaffney, the county executive, warned of a $35 million budget deficit by the end of 2001, a deficit that could grow to $140 million by the end of 2002 unless swift action is taken.
The action Mr. Gaffney prescribed includes a hiring freeze, a call for spending cuts and most significantly, an increase in the county sales tax of a quarter of 1 percent. That would bring the rate to 8.5 percent, a level matched in New York only by neighboring Nassau. In 1995, Suffolk voluntarily cut the sales tax by that same quarter of 1 percent. If the increase is enacted, the county's share of sales taxes will increase to 4.25 percent. 
In his address last week, Mr. Gaffney insisted that the county economy remained strong and called neither for higher property taxes nor for rescinding the sales tax exemption on clothing. He said the sales tax increase was the only short-term way to prevent deficits but should remain in effect only as long as it was needed. 
But in what may signify a change in the way the county finances its spending, Mr. Gaffney also broached the politically touchy question of whether an imbalance between sales taxes and property taxes needs correcting. The underlying problem, Mr. Gaffney told members of the County Legislature, is that by using sales-tax-driven budget surpluses of $330 million over the last eight years to reduce property taxes, Suffolk had grown too reliant on a source of revenue over which the county had no control.
"The fact is that property taxes are a more stable source of revenue than the sales tax," Mr. Gaffney said in his address. "And slashing the tax warrant has left the county more dependent on sales tax revenues -- and more vulnerable to a slowdown in the national economy."
Mr. Gaffney proposed changes in the county charter that would allow up to two-thirds of budget surpluses to be set aside for leaner times. Sales tax receipts created the surpluses in recent years, but current charter provisions, reflecting powerful anti-tax movements of the late 1970's and 1980's, require that surpluses be passed on to county taxpayers in the form of lower taxes, and not held by the government. 
A result of those laws, Mr. Gaffney said, has been an unprecedented 70 percent reduction -- from $161 million to $49 million -- in property taxes paid into the county general fund over the last eight years. "No other level of government anywhere can say as much," he noted.
The sales tax bonanza has also allowed the county to hold down the property taxes that still largely finance the police district that covers the five western Suffolk towns. The five East End towns have their own local police departments. 
But an arbitration award, which will increase the police district costs by more than $100 million over the next four years, coupled with flatsales tax revenues, spells trouble, Mr. Gaffney said. "To put it bluntly, binding arbitration may be the single largest threat to our long-term financial stability, and something has to be done about it," he said. 
Health-care and social-service costs, also dramatically down over the last eight years, are now beginning to rise again, other county officials said.
Yet raising property taxes could boomerang on elected officials. Mr. Gaffney said that making up the $27 million shortfall in the general fund would trigger a 56 percent increase in property taxes, although the increase would still leave taxes at half of what they were eight years ago.
Such an increase would probably be highly unpalatable for county legislators, who face election every two years, and could also harm Mr. Gaffney politically.
Support appears to be stronger for the sales tax increase. Paul Tonna, a Republican from Deer Park who is the presiding officer of the County Legislature, called the increase "an excellent proposal." He said he would join Mr. Gaffney in asking legislators in Albany to authorize the increase, which will also need approval from the County Legislature.
The clothing exemption, which budget officials estimated would result in the loss of more than $30 million a year, will remain in effect until at least next March, the earliest date at which the county could end it. Mr. Gaffney pledged to "keep sales-tax-free clothing in place, both for our residents and as a long-term economic boon for clothing retailers," but that decision will rest with the legislators.
Suffolk retailers lobbied for the exemption and say it has increased their business. Janine H. Nebons, the general manager of the Tanger Outlet Center in Riverhead, said that since the exemption began last March, there had been a 23 percent increase in shoppers from Nassau, which has no such exemption. She said the Nassau shoppers were "acutely aware" of the Suffolk exemption.
She said that holiday shopping volume rose 8 percent last year over the same period in 1999. The outlet center, which opened in 1994, is one of the largest such centers in the country, with 165 stores and 10 to 12 million shoppers a year, she said. 
Frederick B. Pollert, the director of the County Legislature's budget review office, said that budgets last year and this year took into account the lost clothing tax revenues and that the exemption was not a cause of the shortfall.
Mr. Pollert said the county would know more about sales tax revenues when a report on receipts for this year arrives in April. "That will give us a better idea of whether that last quarter in 2000 was an outlier or indicative of a trend," he said.
Dr. Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business group, said with the downturn in the stock market the region was entering uncharted waters in which county governments' reliance on sales taxes became especially risky.
"You have a situation where half our residents and possibly more own stocks, values have declined considerably, and we still don't know where the bottom is," Dr. Kamer said. "So you are going to have a much more drastic effect on consumer spending than we have had in any previous business cycle."
Dr. Kamer said the surge in consumer spending in the last several years had been fueled by "the wealth effect" among consumers whose portfolios were growing by leaps and bounds. But after recent market declines, she said, consumers are "buying what they need and probably not much more than that." 
"That is why it is so dicey to project sales tax revenues at this time," she said. "We just don't know how powerful the reverse wealth effect is going to be and how long it will last." 
Nevertheless, the county still has the confidence of Wall Street. Fitch Inc., a credit rating service, recently upgraded its rating for Suffolk's general obligation bonds from A to A-plus. The service's highest rating, currently held by Westchester County, is AAA. Nassau has a BBB rating.
The agency said the upgrade reflected "the county's improved fiscal environment, highlighted by institutionalized cooperation between the executive and legislative branches on matters related to the budget, an established commitment to grow reserves as a means to offset future economic disruptions and an increased focus on longer-term financial considerations." 
The agency also noted the county's "broad and deep economic base" and moderate debt levels. 
Joseph D. Mason, the director of public finance at Fitch, said the service was aware of Suffolk's lower-than-predicted sales tax revenues. "The final numbers did not come in quite as hoped," he said. "We are not overly concerned about it."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
As Market Pauses, Office Space for Sublease Grows

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
A GROWING amount of the available office space in the state is not in the hands of landlords. It is on the sublease market, offering an exit for companies restructuring their space needs, good deals for tenants and a mixed blessing for the 11-county northern and central New Jersey office marketplace, national real estate services companies say. 
 There are 4.1 million square feet of space being offered for sublease, or 26 percent of the overall available space, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Figures from GVA Williams show there are 3.3 million feet of such space, or 20.7 percent of all available space. And Insignia/ESG says there are 2.31 million feet of sublease space, or 13 percent of all available space. 
 Because of the different ways brokerages calculate space availability, their statistics often seem to be at odds. In the case of subleasing, Cushman & Wakefield shows a doubling of such space from nine months ago and GVA Williams registers a similar increase but from last year, while ESG shows an increase of 10,000 square feet from the end of 1999 to the end of 2000. 
Despite the differences, there is an unaccustomed amount of sublease space available these days for the first time in recent years as the uncertain national economy affects the office market. Rental rate increases have started to diminish, cautious tenants have trimmed their space needs and the pace of leasing has slowed in some submarkets. 
Most industry professionals agree there is a pause in the market. But with the overall office vacancy rate around 10 percent, no one is predicting it will collapse. 
"There will be more turbulence in the next four to six months before the market rebounds," said Mark Yeager, president of Gale & Wentworth, a real estate company with headquarters in Florham Park.
Eric Witmondt, chief executive of the New Jersey office of GVA Williams, based in Parsippany, has a more tempered outlook. "It will be status quo at least through the summer," he said, "as everyone takes a wait-and-see approach to what happens to the New Jersey and national economies." 
The crop of subleases is the result of corporate mergers, acquisitions and even expansions. Rearrangements to the corporate house, including those of Lucent Technologies, Prudential, Merrill Lynch and AT&T, are expected to continue, at least for the near term, industry professionals said. 
Lucent has 155,000 square feet on the sublease market in a 310,000-square-foot building on Woodhollow Road in Parsippany. The sublease is part of the company's restructuring, which will result in 10,000 people being laid off, 1,500 of them in New Jersey.
That "will create vacant space," said John J. Skalko, a Lucent spokesman. He declined to speculate on future sublease plans but said the company had 8.5 million square feet of space in 36 buildings in the state.
As part of AT&T's efforts to reshuffle its space needs to cut costs, the company has put some 1.8 million square feet of space on the market, said Gary Morgenstern, a spokesman. As those efforts continue, the company's 12 million square feet in 35 buildings "could further tighten," by 2 million feet in the next year, he said.
The sublet space is filtering onto a market where rents have stabilized after rising an average of 35 percent in the last two years. Subleases generally are priced at 25 to 50 percent below market.
Subleases are a concern because they bring "another pricing dynamic" to the market, said Daniel J. Loughlin, a managing principal at the Staubach Company, a commercial real estate service firm with offices in Murray Hill. But he said, and most other commercial brokers agreed, that barring a full-blown recession the market should be able to absorb the sublease space.
Among the reasons are that such space represents just 2 percent of New Jersey's 152-million-square-foot market, said Patrick Murphy, executive director of Insignia/ ESG of New Jersey, which is based in Saddle Brook. In addition, he said there has been limited new construction, keeping demand ahead of supply. That is expected to continue because financing from lenders to construct buildings on speculation remains tight, he added.
Mr. Witmondt added that the state had also not been as negatively affected as other regions by sharp cutbacks at dot-com companies, which could have meant more sublease space. Additionally, the state has a diverse tenant base, he said, adding that while some industries like telecommunications are shedding space, others, including pharmaceuticals, are expanding.
Mr. Murphy added that his firm knew of at least seven companies looking in the state for large blocks of office space, ranging from 150,000 to 600,000 square feet.
In today's market, brokers said the conventional thinking about sublets as small unmarketable space with short leases and bargain rents did not always hold true. Indeed, a sizable amount of the available sublet space is in blocks of 50,000 square feet or more, reports Cushman & Wakefield, which lists 13 such blocks totaling 2.5 million square feet. 
Mr. Witmondt said that with large blocks of quality space still in demand, such subleases actually "could help loosen up submarkets where there has been no new construction."
An example is the 150,000 square feet of space that Prudential, the insurer, has made available as a sublease at a 325,000-square-foot building it leases on Wood Avenue in Metro Park. That space, resulting from the insurer's consolidation of its operations, has 10 years left on its lease and is an option for tenants, "because there is nothing else available in that submarket," said Michael A. Cohen, managing director at GVA Williams, which is marketing the space for Prudential. Asking rents of $33 a square foot a year are competitive, he said.
The same is true for sublet space that has become or will become available on the Hudson River waterfront, where the vacancy rate is low. There, EDS, a computer services concern, recently shed 45,000 square feet in a building in Weehawken. 
In submarkets where new construction is brisk and sublease space is abundant, it could drag down the market. In Morris and Somerset Counties, which have the largest amounts of subleases, such space accounted for 44 percent and 47 percent respectively of the overall available space in those markets, Cushman & Wakefield said. 
In Somerset County the biggest block of space is the 400,000-square-foot building on Davidson Road in Franklin Township that Merrill Lynch will be making available for lease or sale. The building is part of the company's consolidation to its new 1.25-million-square-foot campus on 450 acres off Interstate 95 in Hopewell, Selena Morris, a spokesperson, said. That is slightly more than the 1.1 million square feet the company will ultimately be leaving, she said, noting that it will have 3 million square feet of space in the state. 
Mr. Murphy of Insignia ESG, which is marketing the building, said, "It will draw tenants in this kind of market because there is a flight to quality." 
That is also what Mr. Loughlin of Staubach is hoping for in marketing the largest sublease in Morris County -- the 340,000-square-foot building in Parsippany that Aventis Pharmaceuticals is vacating. The company no longer needs the building, which was considered a temporary location, because it is moving to its larger permanent headquarters in Bridgewater. 
"The lease has eight and half years to go, making it more marketable" than short-term subleases and "competitive with new construction," Mr. Loughlin said. "We will be aggressive, but rents will not be below market."
Meanwhile, developers continue to build in the county. Gale & Wentworth is building a 175,000-square-foot speculative building as part of the Center of Morris County in Parsippany, which ultimately will have 850,000 square feet in four buildings.
"The market still has enough depth," Mr. Yeagar, the company's president, said, noting that in Morris County as elsewhere his company "plans to continue to develop because the basics are solid." But reflecting a more cautious market, it is adjusting its strategy on speculative building. Mr. Yeager said his company would now want to have an existing speculative building at least half leased before starting another one

HEADLINE: Incumbent's Loss Stuns Port Chester Democrats 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER 

 BODY:
OF all the local elections last Tuesday, one that may spell the biggest change is the upset of Port Chester's mayor, Christine Korff, by Gerald L. Logan, a 63-year-old securities broker and a political neophyte.
 The margin was slim -- Mr. Logan won by 16 votes of 3,415 cast (there were no dimpled chads). But the election caused a huge power shift in a village known for its bitter partisan rivalry. 
 As mayor, Ms. Korff, a Democrat, gave her party the majority on the village's board of trustees, which has three Republicans and three Democrats. But Mr. Logan's victory now gives the Republicans the majority.
Moments after his victory, Mr. Logan said he would reassess many of the Democrats' initiatives, most important the $100 million downtown redevelopment project that began last year. The developers, G & S Investors, of Long Island, were selected for the project by local Democrats.
Mr. Logan does not take office until April 3, but he was already talking like the new sheriff in town at a celebration at a local restaurant, Pasta Per Voi, stressing the need to reassess G & S's role in the project.
"I've been looking at projects like this all across the country," he said, "and we need to sit down and make sure they have the proper financing to deliver what they've laid out."
Ms. Korff's tenure was marked by lawsuits charging she blocked civil service jobs and promotions for several men related to prominent village Republicans. Republicans have also accused the Democrats of hiring a corrupt company to settle overdue parking tickets. 
Mr. Logan said, "We've been hearing all kinds of things, and we want to clean things up and bring some honesty and ethics to this village."
Ms. Korff, a mortgage broker who served three terms as mayor, lost one lawsuit over her hiring practices and is appealing the decision. She dismissed the charges as political attacks. 
A ruby pinky ring sparkled as Mr. Logan clasped his long fingers around a glass of white wine. Many supporters wore fine suits and smoked Cohiba cigars. The vote tallies, projected onto the wall next to pastel murals of Italy, were intermittently obscured by shadows of hands slapping high-fives and shouts of, "Kick the bums out."
Meanwhile, in the rear room of the Village Inn, a no-frills restaurant in town, Ms. Korff, 39, watched her vote lead dwindle. Several victory balloons popped as her aides reached for cigarettes and shouted into cell phones.
Angelo Rubino, chairman of the village's Democratic Party, stood in front of a droopy American flag and repeated into a microphone, "I am just shocked." A young boy was wearing a Yankees jacket and a say-it-ain't-so face.
High up on a landing, surveying the room and its lonely platters of salami heros, Sam Terenzi, Mrs. Korff's political mentor and a powerful Democratic supporter, cradled his drink, shook his head and slipped out of the room.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Montclair, N.J.; 
Town Steps In on Development of Long-Vacant Store

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR N.J. 

 BODY:
THE building has sat there, empty and brooding, for more than 11 years, 110,000 square feet of void at the edge of one of this suburban town's most lively areas of small shops, restaurants and movie theaters.
 The two-story building was once a Hahne's department store, and many residents of Montclair and neighboring towns in western Essex County remember going there to shop and then browsing the smaller businesses nearby along South Park and Church Streets a block west of Bloomfield Avenue. 
 "Montclair residents have memories of a really vibrant, active corner," said Helen Mazarakis, executive director of the Montclair Economic Development Corporation. "They remember how people spilled out of Hahne's to the other stores, and they are disappointed that the place has been vacant for so long."
Since Hahne's closed, several plans have been advanced for the empty building, all without success. In the mid-1990's, there was a plan to convert it into a medical mall, with a mixture of medical care, health and fitness and retail tenants. As many as 72 physicians were to be affiliated with the center, with 24 of them in the building full time. 
Like so many other proposals for the site, nothing came of the plan.
Now, frustrated with the lack of progress, township officials have taken action. Unlike more typical instances when the aim of local officials is to stop unwanted development, the township council has declared that the Hahne's site needs to be redeveloped.
That is, the current owners must develop the site or sell it to a developer with an acceptable plan, or the town could seize the property through condemnation.
"The current council is fed up with the lack of progress," said Ed Remsen, a council member. "This current market won't last, and we don't want to wait through another real estate cycle before something happens." He said that town officials had "lost faith" with the owners of the property.
According to people with knowledge of the situation, the property is owned by a group of investors known as Center Montclair Associates. The group includes executives of York Hunter, a construction management company in New York. Kenneth M. Colao, a principal of York Hunter, did not return repeated calls seeking comment.
Planners have identified other sites that might need to be redeveloped, said Terence Reidy, the township manager, but the long delay at the Hahne's property put it at the top of the list.
"The council decided to pull the trigger on this one and said, 'We will do a redevelopment plan,' " Mr. Reidy said. "We are hoping that this will move things forward. But if it does not, it is critical that the town have a way to step in and make it happen."
It is not surprising that Montclair officials are taking steps to force the development of the vacant property, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Blaustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.
"An empty building has negative implications on nearby properties, and the site has significant potential," he said. "In general, towns are becoming more proactive in guiding their destiny." Mr. Hughes said a township in the New Brunswick area was working to gain control of a tract of land to preserve open space in opposition to a developer who wants to build. In the Montclair case, town officials are seeking the opposite result, he said, but both are similar actions.
The long delay in development at the Hahne's site has deprived the township of money, Mr. Remsen said. Fully developed, the property would be taxed at about 10 times its current level, which over 11 years has amounted to a substantial amount of lost tax revenue, he said.
Other developers have found the Montclair property attractive and have approached town officials with plans, Mr. Reidy said, including projects that would include retailers on the ground floor with upscale apartments on upper floors. "Over the last three or four years, we have been approached by six or seven developers," he said. He said town officials had referred the prospective developers to Center Montclair Associates, with no results so far.
Several real estate executives close to the situation said the makeup of Central Montclair Associates had made decisionmaking difficult. The investors, they said, are mostly doctors, lawyers and builders, not professional developers, and each has ideas about how to develop the property.
"We have met with them over the years and developed marketing packages for the Hahne's property," said Ms. Mazarakis of the development corporation. Since the township's redevelopment designation, she said, "we have been backing away" because the marketing plans have not worked and the group does not want to get in the way of government action.
Adding to the attraction of the Hahne's site are zoning rules that would allow four floors to be added to the building.
"There is a six-story limit, as long as it stays within density maximums," said Karen Kadus, Montclair's director of planning. 
She said zoning rules required retailers on the first floor, to avoid having a break in the shopping strips to the north and south. "We don't want to have an interruption," she said. "We want people to keep on walking."
Mr. Reidy said there was great demand for apartments in Montclair, which is largely filled with single-family homes. He said a former bowling alley nearby on Bloomfield Avenue, a major thoroughfare in the area, was being developed with retail space on the street level with apartments above.
Although some business people in the area, which is chronically short of parking, have suggested tearing the building down and replacing it with a multilevel parking garage, Ms. Kadus said there was a better solution.
She said the town was interested in developing an existing surface parking lot into a deck as part of the redevelopment of the Hahne's property. "We now require the provision of additional parking as part of the development of the building," she said.
Mr. Remsen, the council member, said the designation of areas in need of redevelopment had been used before in housing, forcing owners to either repair or sell houses that had deteriorated into eyesores. "We must have done 15 to 17 rundown or abandoned houses," he said. "It had a good effect; they were either fixed up or sold."
Mr. Reidy said, "When I came to town in 1994, we had a lot of houses owned by absentee landlords that had been left to go to seed." But the properties were highly attractive to buyers looking to improve them, he said, and the redevelopment designation helped speed up the transactions.
The current redevelopment law has been modified from the days when parts of a city had to be designated "blighted" before urban renewal actions could be taken, Mr. Reidy said.
"In the past, you would condemn a property, pay the owner its fair market value and then try to figure out what to do with it," he said. "Now by the time you finish the planning, you know what to do and have a developer ready to do it."
He said he hoped that the owners of the Hahne's property would work with town officials and said he understood that Center Montclair Associates was meeting with potential buyers and developers.
He said the redevelopment could begin within a year unless the owners resist and go to court. Having stores operating once again in the Hahne's building and people living in the upper floors would provide a lift to retailers in the entire area, he said.
"Church Street is healthy, but not up to its potential," Mr. Reidy said. "Once the Hahne's site is developed, Church Street will explode and spill over to Bloomfield Avenue."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/75th Street Between Fifth and Madison Avenue; 
Stately Limestone Mansions With a Sense of History

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE old limestone mansions of 75th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenue seem a bit less august these days -- some were broken up into apartments decades ago. But the stately mansions' history involves several famous players from New York's past. They include Thomas J. Watson, the chairman of I.B.M. from 1915 to 1956, and Irving Berlin, perhaps the most renowned songwriter in American history.
 The first buildings on the block, put up as developers tested the viability of the area next to Central Park, were row houses built in the 1870's. The neo-Grec-style row house at 19 East 75th, built in 1876, was first occupied by the Rev. R. Heber Newton, a liberal Episcopalian clergyman who endorsed Darwin's theory of evolution. 
 In the 1880's, the street's architecture became richer and more vibrant. Queen Anne-style row houses were built at 13 and 15 East 75th, designed by William E. Mowbray for his father, Anthony Mowbray, a developer.
 The real mansions came in the 1890's, among them the 50-foot-wide 1896 limestone in French Renaissance style at 4 East 75th, designed by Trowbridge, Colt & Livingston for Nathaniel McCready, the president of a shipping firm. McCready hunted boar using dogs from his own kennel in France in the forests near Orleans. 
The 1900 census shows McCready there with his family and seven servants, including three coachmen. The house's current entry hall was originally an open driveway leading to a five-stall stable in the back. The driveway was filled in when Stanley Mortimer, an expert rider and polo player, bought the house in 1919; the bronze gate that appears to be original was designed for him by Carrere & Hastings, who also designed the New York Public Library. 
 In 1904 Stuart Duncan built a large house across the street, at 3 East 75th Street. Duncan's father, John P. Duncan, had made his fortune by importing Lea & Perrin's Worcestershire sauce. After his father's death in 1901, the son concentrated on the family's real estate portfolio -- and had C. P. H. Gilbert, the architect of what is now the Ukrainian Institute of America at 79th and Fifth, design this 50-foot-wide house. 
 Duncan initially took the address 1 East 75th, assuming that whoever ultimately built next door at the Fifth Avenue corner would favor a more prestigious Fifth Avenue address; early photographs of Duncan's house clearly show the "1" above the entrance.
But Duncan didn't reckon with the very reserved Stephen V. Harkness, son of Edward S. Harkness, one of John D. Rockefeller's oil partners. Stephen V. Harkness built a mansion on the corner in 1909 and demanded the less ostentatious 1 East 75th Street address, causing Duncan to get a bronze numeral 3 for his doorway.
 DUNCAN sold 3 East 75th in 1920 to Clarence H. Mackay, head of the Postal Telegraph Cable Company (later ITT), which handled trans-Atlantic communications. Mackay's daughter Ellin was living there in 1924 when she met Irving Berlin and fell in love. 
The Mackay family was Roman Catholic; Berlin was Jewish, and the elder Mackay was concerned about his daughter marrying out of her religion. He tried to delay things by sending her on a European trip. 
But on Jan. 4, 1926, Berlin, whose songs include "God Bless America" and "White Christmas," telephoned Ellin Mackay and proposed immediate marriage. She walked out of 3 East 75th in the clothes she was wearing, took her first subway ride and married Berlin at the Municipal Building.
Their daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, tells the story of her parents' courtship in "Irving Berlin: A Daughter's Memoir" (Simon & Schuster, 1994). Ms. Barrett mentions that her mother called the 75th Street house from a phone booth immediately after the ceremony. The new Mrs. Berlin first reached the Mackay family nurse, Mary Finnerty; "Finny," Ms. Barrett wrote, simply fainted.
 In 1939, the head of I.B.M., Thomas J. Watson, bought the McCready/Mortimer residence across the street at 4 East 75th Street. 
 In 1954 Watson was interviewed by The New York Times and recalled the 1930's, when, he said, it seemed as if no one else had faith in the country's economic future. "We kept on, found new markets and were ready when business did improve," he said. His obituary in The Times in 1956 noted that he was "often called 'the world's greatest salesman.' " 
Eventually, some of the old houses were cut up into apartments. In 1951, the old row house at 9 East 75th Street was remodeled into apartments with a facade that looks typically plain. But on closer inspection the front door is from the 1840's or earlier, with an equally old brass plaque reading "No. 9." The managing agent, Martin Hollander of Marin Management, said that the 1951 owner had been extremely frugal and apparently often reused old materials, perhaps from other buildings.
Work is under way at two big houses on the block. The old Harkness house at the corner, now occupied by the Commonwealth Fund, is wrapped in netting for facade repairs, and Jean Doumanian, the film producer, is involved in a long, on-again, off-again renovation of the old Watson house.
THE wide Doumanian house is apparently empty except for occasional workers. "They've apparently gutted the interior, but lately they're in, they're out, you see trucks there, and then they're gone, and you don't see anyone again for weeks," said Vito Tricarico, an architect who lives in an apartment in the old Duncan/Mackay house across the street, which was broken up in 1941. Ms. Doumanian, who bought her house in 1987, declined to discuss the project.
 There are other buildings on the block that are empty, among them the partly renovated 10 East 75th Street, which is for sale, and others that merely appear empty. One that other residents on the block point to is the Queen Anne-style house at 15 East 75th Street. 
"No, it's occupied," said Ramon Garcia, who added that he had been the architect for a top-to-bottom restoration there that was finished last summer. The building's original yellowish stone and deep red brick, cleaned of paint, now shine amid the other buildings' more sober coloring. 
 Richard Steinberg, a managing director at Ashforth-Warburg, is the exclusive broker for 10 East 75th Street, which is for sale for $10.5 million. Mr. Steinberg estimated that it would take $3 million more to complete the renovation, which was left unfinished because of the owners' divorce.
He said he thinks that 75th and 73rd Streets are the two prettiest blocks on the Upper East Side, in part because they have so much limestone.
Mr. Steinberg noted that most of the houses on 75th are more than 20 feet wide. "In real estate terms," he said, "20 feet is the dividing line between houses and mansions."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
The Streetscapes column on March 25, about 75th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues, misidentified the man who built the mansion at 1 East 75th in 1909. It was Edward S. Harkness, not Stephen V. Harkness. The article also misstated the relationship between the two men and misstated which of them was a partner of John D. Rockefeller. The Rockefeller partner was Stephen Harkness, who was Edward's father, not his son.

HEADLINE: THE CENSUS; 
Fast-Growing, Fast-Changing

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
WHEN the 2000 census figures for New York State were released two weeks ago, the numerical snapshot of Westchester County was not, at first glance, all that surprising to anyone who has lived or worked in the area: while the county's population grew at only a modest rate, it has become more ethnically diverse.
 What was surprising, though, was that the number of Hispanics exceeded the estimate anticipated by demographers for the 2010 census. 
 That statistical revelation captured the essence of what one could glean from the county's first batch of census data. While most projections were fairly accurate, and major themes were readily identifiable, there were enough surprises and details to provide a crisper portrait of a county that has changed markedly in 10 years. 
Among the inferences drawn by sociologists, for instance, is the notion that Interstate 287 has become, with some exceptions, even more of a Mason-Dixon line between an increasingly diverse and densely populated south and a whiter, sparser north.
But the most noteworthy change, demographers and planners say, is that Westchester has become more heterogenous, and the pace of change seems to be accelerating. 
And spearheading that change, demographers say, are Hispanic immigrants who are turning many neighborhoods into ethnic enclaves, as evidenced by the 56 percent increase in the Hispanic population in the 1990's. That figure easily outpaced the state average of 26 percent.
Such influxes "used to take much more time, whether it was Russian Jews or Poles or Italians," said Gregory Holtz, research director at the Michaelian Institute for Public Policy and Management at Pace University in White Plains. "But the change has gone into turbo process, and the new immigrants get to Westchester and the suburbs much faster than they did before."
Overall, Westchester grew to 923,459 residents, from 890,635, an increase of 3.7 percent. The total was above the estimate of 906,000, said Michael Lipkin, associate planner with the County Department of Planning. But the pace was slower than that registered by New York City (6 percent) and some of the outer-ring suburbs, like Putnam (13.1 percent), Orange (10.2 percent) and Dutchess (7.2 percent) Counties.
In fact, Westchester would have recorded a net loss had it not been for the influx of immigrants, Mr. Lipkin said. In the last decade, 58,000 more people left the county than settled from other areas of the country. But that deficit was erased largely by new immigrants, and, to a lesser degree, a slight gap between the birth and death rates.
Meanwhile, Westchester's non-Hispanic white population continued to dwindle compared with other racial groups. In 1990, whites made up 72 percent of the county's population; this time, with whites declining by 50,000, the figure was 64 percent.
The black population climbed 4.5 percent, while the proportion of blacks in Westchester inched up to 13.8 from 13.6 percent. Westchester's Asian population increased 37 percent; that proportion now stands at 4.8 percent, up from 3.6 percent 10 years ago.
The figures used by The New York Times reflect a comparison between the 2000 census and data from the 1990 census that had been adjusted to reflect the undercount in that census. Others, including New York State officials, have compared the 2000 figures with unadjusted data from 1990.
But regardless of whether one uses adjusted or unadjusted figures, it is clear from the 2000 census that Hispanics are now the biggest minority group in Westchester, outnumbering blacks for the first time.
As a share of the population, Westchester's population of Hispanics increased to 15.6 from 10.4 percent. In raw numbers, the number of Hispanics increased to 144,124 from 92,150 -- surpassing the county's estimate of 110,000 for 2000, as well as the 2010 estimate of 140,000, Mr. Lipkin said.
And the places with the highest proportion of Hispanics, according to the census, were Port Chester (46 percent), Sleepy Hollow (45 percent) and Ossining (28 percent). All registered gains in the 1990's.
But for sheer explosive growth in the lower Hudson Valley, nothing in Westchester could approach the gains notched by the village of Brewster in Putnam County: while the overall population grew by 36 percent, the Hispanic population jumped 345 percent, resulting in an increase to 32 from 9.8 percent in the proportion of Hispanics.
On the other end of the spectrum, the least diverse places in Westchester included Bedford, which was 95 percent white, and Buchanan, which was 94 percent white.
One trend that appeared to emerge in Westchester, as well as in other parts of the metropolitan New York area, was that the Hispanic population became more segregated between 1990 and 2000, said John R. Logan, a sociologist at the State University of New York at Albany.
He found that the average Hispanic in Westchester was likely to live in a census tract that was 22 percent Hispanic in 1990. But in 2000, that figure jumped to 35 percent -- suggesting that Hispanics, particularly new immigrants, often settle in existing ethnic enclaves, Professor Logan said.
Geographic segregation between northern and southern Westchester was another theme, several analysts said. While the south became more culturally diverse and urban, the north, with its anti-sprawl attitude and zoning restrictions, did not change as much, said John Howard, a professor at Purchase College.
In fact, 10.3 percent of Westchester's population occupied 41 percent of the county's area in Pound Ridge, North Salem, Lewisboro, Yorktown, Somers and Bedford, said George Raymond, chairman of the Westchester Housing Opportunity Commission.
In the south, meanwhile, Westchester's cities more than held their own as New York City's population climbed and those of upstate cities like Buffalo and Syracuse dropped. Yonkers, the state's fourth largest city, grew 2 percent and now trails Rochester, No. 3, by only 25,000 residents.
With Rochester losing 8.4 percent of its population in the 2000 census, and the upstate economy still in a major slump, the possibility exists that by the next census, Yonkers may overtake Rochester.

HEADLINE: A Downtown Flagship Strikes Its Colors 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
BY way of settling into his new apartment at 45 Wall Street a month ago, Fu-Shing Wu, a financial analyst from Washington, introduced himself to the woman next door as her new neighbor.
 "Not for very long," she replied. "Haven't you heard? The building has been sold." As Mr. Wu put it, "She was like, hello and goodbye." 
 Although the Web site for 45 Wall Street still said last week that it is "destined to become the new standard for 21st century living," reality suggests that its destiny may be as the shortest-lived large-scale apartment development in New York history, with only four years elapsed from conversion to condemnation. 
In January, the Rockrose Development Corporation, which converted the 28-story office tower into 435 rental apartments in 1997, reached an agreement with city and state officials to sell the building.
The Rockrose property, bounded by Wall Street, William Street and Exchange Place, was the first piece nailed down in the assemblage of the full block across Broad Street from the New York Stock Exchange.
On this site, the city and state plan a 50,000-square-foot trading floor for the stock exchange, topped by a 1.3 million-square-foot office tower.
One of the things that makes the story of 45 Wall Street noteworthy is that the building was so recently a keystone of the Giuliani administration's plan to repopulate Lower Manhattan. And it is already scheduled for demolition.
Rockrose has told tenants that impending condemnation of the building by the Empire State Development Corporation "will necessitate that you vacate your apartment." The city has offered relocation assistance from $8,000 to $17,000 an apartment, depending on the size of the unit and number of occupants.
While the notice was not an outright eviction, it said that expiring leases would not be renewed except for rent-stabilized tenants and that even these would no longer be protected once the property was formally condemned by the state. Moreover, Rockrose said, some financial assistance "might not be available if you do not act promptly to relocate prior to June 30, 2001."
"You may, therefore, find it worthwhile to move now," the notice said.
That has left tenants perplexed, edgy and angry. "What's the rush to empty the building?" asked Ray Fleischhacker, vice president of the 45 Wall Street Tenants' Association, which represents about 100 families. "People are moving and giving up rights they don't know they have for a paltry amount of money that's fully taxable." He and his companion Alexandra Fisher, the co-president of the association, have petitioned the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court to annul the Empire State Development Corporation's determination that a public purpose would be served by condemning 45 Wall Street. They note that the full block has not been assembled, that no developer has been designated and that there is ample space nearby in existing office towers. They also question the commitment of the stock exchange to the project.
Several related motions are pending before the court now, Ms. Fisher said.
Whatever happens, the 900 or so residents of 45 Wall Street are not going to end up homeless. It is probably safe to say that many, if not most, would have moved on in a few years anyway. But it is also true that they are likely to pay more rent for less space and fewer amenities.
The Alliance for Downtown New York is torn between unalloyed support for the stock exchange project and its longstanding goal of attracting residents downtown. "This is a tough situation for us," said its president, Carl Weisbrod. "In the final analysis, though, the New York Stock Exchange is a unique institution that defines 'Wall Street' to the city, the nation and the world."
Michael G. Carey, president of the city Economic Development Corporation, acknowledged that 45 Wall Street played a role in the Lower Manhattan plan. "But now we're at a different stage," he said, and the stock exchange is a "very significant financial engine for the city and state."
HAVING agreed to buy 45 Wall Street from Rockrose, reportedly for $160 million, officials next reached an agreement to buy 23 Wall Street and 15 Broad Street from J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. The middle of the block, 37 Wall Street, is controlled by the Wilf family. Mr. Carey said it would be condemned.
Except for the facade of the landmark J. P. Morgan & Company Building at 23 Wall Street, everything on the block -- 45 Wall Street included -- is to be razed. Demolition is to begin late this year or early next year.
No developer has been designated yet for the project, which is expected to involve more than $1 billion in government subsidies, including land acquisition, but Mr. Carey said it was still early in the process.
It is not too early to begin emptying 45 Wall Street, however. "The program we're undertaking now is a voluntary program," Mr. Carey said. "What we've tried to do in anticipation of condemnation is assist with the relocation of as many tenants as possible. People don't have to get out by June 30."
About 100 tenants have already taken advantage of the relocation program, Mr. Carey said. "That goes to the fact that it is a very fair -- indeed, generous -- offer."
Not in the eyes of Doug Sheinberg, one of the original tenants. He deals in computer software. His wife, Lesley, is a commercial real estate broker. They have a 21-month-old daughter, Carson. They pay $1,850 a month for a rent-stabilized 900-square-foot apartment. "For me to get the same apartment is going to cost $800 to $1,000 more a month," Mr. Sheinberg said. "I'm not sure I can afford to live in the city."
"We're not looking to make money," he said. "We're just looking to ease out without taking a hit." That, he said, would mean relocation assistance of at least $30,000.
One of Carson's playmates, 34-month-old Caleb Berger, was probably the first newborn to arrive at Wall and William Streets in 160 years. His parents, Linda and Robert Berger, imagined they would leave 45 Wall Street eventually. "But we wouldn't have chosen this moment," Ms. Berger said.
The Bergers moved in 1998 from Murray Hill into a 2,000-square-foot apartment for which they paid $3,600 a month. "We decided to come downtown because we thought we could get more apartment for the money," Ms. Berger said. With a child on the way, they were also attracted to the riverfront parks at Battery Park City.
"It's very unsettling not to know what you're going to be doing three months from now," said Ms. Berger, who works for the federal government and walks to her office.
"We carpeted the whole apartment, painted it, put in floor moldings," Ms. Berger said. "And, lo and behold, we get a notice that we can't live here anymore."
Although Rockrose gets little sympathy from tenants, the transaction was not easy for the company, run by the Elghanayan family, which is known for holding its properties over the long run.
"We're not contesting it; it's by agreement, but it is a condemnation," said Sofia Estevez, vice president of residential marketing. "We don't ever sell a building."
"It's heartbreaking for us," she said, "because 45 Wall Street is our flagship building downtown. This is the most extravagant amenity package we've ever done."
Rockrose bought 45 Wall Street in 1996 from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which developed it in 1959 as the Atlantic Building. Designed by Voorhees, Walker, Smith, Smith & Haines, it was one of the last wedding-cake-shaped towers.
Met Life had to persuade the U.S. Trust Corporation at 45 Wall Street and the Atlantic Mutual Companies at No. 49 to merge their headquarters under one roof, said Cornelius E. Golding, senior vice president of the Atlantic. To satisfy corporate egos, the new building was given the Atlantic name but the U.S. Trust street number. (This was a day when addresses were often commonly understood shorthand for businesses.)
U.S. Trust remained in the Atlantic Building until 1989. The Atlantic moved employees out in the 1970's and 80's but kept one floor as its executive office until 1995.
In July 1996, a year after Atlantic vacated entirely, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took a sledgehammer to the limestone facade of 45 Wall Street to signal its conversion into an apartment building, a $75 million undertaking by Rockrose and the Whitehall Street Fund of Goldman Sachs & Company.
Zoning rules ordinarily require that an apartment be no more than four times deeper than it is wide, said David Mandl of Meltzer/Mandl, which designed the renovation. By designating the deep interior spaces as home offices, however, and ventilating those spaces mechanically, the builders created some units 12 by 70 feet.
The architects removed panels of limestone between the small windows, yielding wider bays. Rockrose built a fitness center and wood-paneled club room at the top of the building, added an underground parking garage and installed a distinctive marquee.
To qualify for real estate tax incentives under the 421-g program, Rockrose developed the building subject to rent stabilization, although individual apartments were removed from regulation as rents exceeded $2,000. Ms. Estevez said 34 percent of the units are still stabilized.
Leasing began in early 1997 and half the units were snapped up in six weeks.
But the pendulum downtown was moving again. Cater-corner from the Rockrose building, Swig Burris Equities bought 48 Wall Street in 1998 to convert it into apartments. The interest from commercial brokers was so great, however, that it is being renovated as an office building, said Kent M. Swig, a principal in Swig Burris.
In late 1998, the block with 45 Wall Street was publicly identified as a possible stock exchange site. Ms. Estevez said Rockrose was prevented from telling tenants about negotiations under a confidentiality agreement. But the company began adding a rider to leases noting generally that there was a proposal to acquire 45 Wall Street.
News of the stock exchange plans had in any case not reached Paris. So Yasmine Rossi Zoughbi and her husband, Djamal, believed they had found an ideal spot when they arrived at 45 Wall Street in 1999 from the 10th Arrondissement. It was close to the subway, which takes Ms. Zoughbi to her modeling agency in SoHo in 10 minutes, door to door, and was quiet at night.
They pay $2,700 a month for a penthouse unit. "If I could stay here, I would," Ms. Zoughbi said. Though her lease runs until November, she could not afford the intervening months of uncertainty. She looked at 22 River Terrace, a Rockrose building in Battery Park City, but it was too expensive. "Why don't they do an exchange?" Ms. Zoughbi asked. "For the same kind of apartment, we are obliged to pay $500 more."
The Zoughbis will move to a $3,000-a-month apartment on Greenwich Street.
Tamara Beudec despairs of ever again finding 800 square feet for $1,915 a month. She had an architectural practice when she moved into 45 Wall Street and designed custom furniture that could be wheeled around to create a variety of domestic or business layouts. "Some pieces of my furniture are unsellable because they're too big," said Ms. Beudec, who is now embarked on a second career in financial services. "They're meant for that space."
But she said she is even more troubled by how the city encouraged the redevelopment of a building that would be so quickly abandoned. "Why call it planning?" she asked.
WHEN the broker for Mr. Wu, who moved in last month, told him the building might be sold, it sounded to Mr. Wu as if the deal were remote. And when he was given a tour of the building, Mr. Wu said, the Rockrose representative never mentioned the possible sale.
Having dreamed of working on Wall Street, Mr. Wu was delighted to live there, too. It was, he said, icing on the cake.
His may have been one of the last leases executed. Ms. Estevez said that as soon as Rockrose reached agreement to sell the building, renting stopped.
"How could they continue to take tenants?" asked Mr. Fleischhacker, the tenant leader. "What was the purpose, to get every last penny out?" Now, he said, Rockrose is receiving a payment of $1,000 an apartment as an incentive to vacate the building. Ms. Estevez said she could not reply because of the confidentiality agreement.
She did say that next week Rockrose would open a leasing office for its newest project, 200 West 26th Street, exclusively for 45 Wall Street tenants. Meanwhile, residents coming home have seen a pitchman handing out fliers for 88 Greenwich Street, Ms. Fisher said, and have also found fliers and business cards in the lobby for moving companies and relocation specialists.
As of last week, a ticker screen on the www.45wall.com Web site was still saying: "Studio, one, two and three bedrooms available." Elsewhere on the site, visitors were told that "45 Wall Street is geared not just for today but for tomorrow." There was, however, no word about the day after.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Among 19 Stores at Crotona Park East; 
Work to Start On Bronx Supermarket

 BODY:
Almost a decade ago residents of the Crotona Park East section of the Bronx had high hopes for a supermarket and retail stores on a 10-acre site that had been an industrial park. Yet because the project involved City Hall, community groups and the private sector, there was no way to get it done quickly. But finally, one week from tomorrow, April 2, groundbreaking is scheduled for a $30.7 million, 134,000-square-foot shopping center at the site, 174th Street and Vyse Avenue. 
 The anchor tenant -- which has signed a 20-year lease and is investing $1 million in construction -- is Pathmark, which is building a 48,500-square-foot supermarket that will also house a bank and pharmacy. The 19 retailers that have committed to the project include Athlete's Foot, Petland Discounts, Blockbuster and Rockaway Bedding. 
 "Close to 80 percent of our space is already leased," said Ralph Porter, president of the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes, a community coalition that has sponsored and developed more than 2,300 housing units in its 25-year existence. The leasing agent for the shopping center is the Hutensky Group of Hartford. The contractor is GR2D, a partnership of R2D, a division of Hutensky, and Gabriel Associates, a local minority-owned real estate developer and general contractor.
The Desperadoes bought the site from New York City's Economic Development Corporation, together with Neighborhood Enhancement and Training Services, a Bronx-based nonprofit group, and the Retail Initiative, a commercial real estate equity fund affiliated with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which provides funds to help revitalize inner cities. Besides Pathmark's investment, the financing to cover the $30.7 million consists of an $18.8 million construction loan from the European American Bank and the Bank of New York and grants and loans from community groups, corporations and the federal and city governments. 
Mr. Porter said the new Pathmark would be the first supermarket in Crotona Park East in years, adding that it would be especially welcomed by elderly residents and those who do not own cars or do not drive. As to whether his organization had ever despaired of seeing the supermarket and shopping center materialize, Mr. Porter said no, adding, "We were encouraged by what Frederick Douglass said, 'The struggle continues.' "

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT; 
In Jersey City, Girding for a New Era

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
When the clock struck 4 p.m., it marked the beginning of the end of the Schundler Era, nearly a decade of unprecedented economic growth and political controversy under Mayor Bret D. Schundler, a conservative Republican in this ethnically diverse and heavily Democratic city.
 It was at that time on March 15 that the deadline had arrived for mayoral candidates in the May 8 municipal election to submit nominating petitions. And by 4:01 p.m. it was apparent that Mayor Schundler -- elected to three consecutive terms -- was officially out of the race. The 43-year-old mayor is seeking the Republican nomination for governor. 
 The passing deadline put to rest speculation that as the underdog in the Republican primary against Acting Governor DiFrancesco, Mr. Schundler would hedge his gubernatorial bet by keeping his mayoral option open. "I guess we're really in it now," said Joe Pascoe, Mr. Schundler's campaign manager."
It was second of two big questions hanging over the mayoral race to be answered in three days. On March 13, State Superior Court Judge Arthur DiIalia ruled that Gerald McCann could seek his former job despite his conviction on federal bank fraud and tax evasion charges that resulted in his removal from office in 1992.
The charges against Mr. McCann, first elected in 1981, involved a failed real estate deal that took place after he lost a re-election bid and left office in 1985, but before he won a second term in 1989. Judge D'Italia ruled that he could run this year because his crimes were unrelated to his public duties. Coincidentally, it was Judge D'Italia who had barred Mr. McCann from running in 1997 because he was still serving the federal equivalent of parole. 
With Mr. McCann definitely in and Mr. Schundler unquestionably out, the race to lead Jersey City's 240,000 residents can begin in earnest. Voters now have six candidates from which to choose: Councilman Robert Cavanaugh; Glenn Cunningham, a former council president and United States marshal; Tom DeGise, the City Council president; Louis Manzo, a former Hudson County freeholder; Mr. McCann; and Kevin Sluka, the city's director of public works. 
All of the candidates are Democrats, although Jersey City holds nonpartisan elections in which candidates run under a campaign slogan but no party banner, and there is no primary. Candidates must receive at least 50 percent of the vote to win; otherwise, a runoff is held.
But even a final list of candidates does not necessarily give the city's 101,000 registered voters a clear choice. Each mayoral hopeful heads his own slate of candidates for the nine-member city council -- six seats for wards A through F, plus three at-large seats -- and 10 people are seeking council seats, for a total of 70 candidates.
It was fitting that the Schundler and McCann questions figured prominently in how the field shook out, since the two were closely associated with the main campaign issue: tax abatements, particularly for projects along the city's waterfront.
Abatements are deals granted by the city that excuse developers from having to pay standard property tax assessments on a particular project for a proscribed period, typically 5, 15, 20 or 30 years. Instead, the developer makes significantly lower payments in lieu of taxes directly to the city. 
Critics of the abatements point out that homeowners do not receive abatements, and therefore big business is essentially being subsidized by the average homeowner. Proponents dismiss such notions, insisting that the city collects more from the abatements than it would from standard property tax assessments. Furthermore, they contend, projects would not be developed without the abatements, and the city would be left collecting paltry sums on the undeveloped property.
The latest city figures show that 89 properties are receiving tax abatements in fiscal 2001, with payments in lieu of taxes totaling $48 million, up from just $17 million in 1992.
But as shrinking space and ballooning rents in Manhattan have made the Jersey City waterfront increasingly attractive, even people who support abatements in principle have criticized city officials as being unnecessarily generous.
"It's definitely a campaign issue," said Mia Scanga, who helped collect more than 3,000 signatures in an unsuccessful attempt to block an abatement for a proposed 43-story apartment project, Millennium Towers.
The candidates' views on abatements range from unapologetic supporters like Mr. DeGise, who led the city council in approving dozens of them, to critics like Mr. Manzo.
"The No. 1 issue related to Jersey City is the continual giving away of tax abatements to wealthy developers," said Mr. Manzo, a 46-year-old insurance salesman, who ran unsuccessfully in two previous mayoral races. "It's been going on since 1980, and what really ticks me off is that they turn around and roll over abatements."
Mr. Manzo criticized Mr. DeGise's close relationship with Brian Doherty, a lawyer and DeGise fund-raiser who has represented some of the city's biggest developers, including the Lefrak Organization, which developed the 600-acre Newport complex with the help of abatements, the Applied Companies of Hoboken, which just received an abatement for the huge HarborSpire project -- two waterfront apartment towers of 55 and 50 stories each -- and Mack-Cali Realty Corporation of Cranford, which owns the Harborside waterfront office complex, an abatement recipient that houses more than 5,000 jobs. 
No one disputes that developers have long been political contributors. But Mr. DeGise, who makes no secret of his fund-raising appeals to the development community, said he supported abatements because they were good for the city, not to fill his campaign coffers.
"A good deal of the business community is supporting me, and I'm not appologizing for that," Mr. DeGise said.
Other candidates fall somewhere in between. Mr. Cunningham, for example, voted for several waterfront abatements as a councilman in the 80's. But he said the waterfront and the city's economy were much more bleak then. While he still might approve some abatements now, he added, "I think much of our development can take place without those incentives."
Mr. Doherty said the abatement was an emotional issue and easy to exploit, though he said most criticism of the practice was unfounded. The businesses at Newport -- which operate in a mall and other buildings constructed with the help of abatements -- have generated $9 million in special sales tax revenue that go directly to the city, not the state, as part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. 
That money has financed business improvement districts around Central Avenue, Journal Square and Martin Luther King Drive, Mr. Doherty said.
"It's easy to be a demagogue," Mr. Doherty said, attacking what he called Mr. Manzo's hollow criticism of abatements. "The development community is fully vested in Jersey City, and therefore they want to contribute to those candidates who want to continue the development that is beneficial to Jersey City."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 1, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the mayoral campaign in Jersey City misspelled the surname of a State Superior Court judge who ruled that former Mayor Gerald McCann could seek re-election despite his conviction on charges of fraud and tax evasion. The judge is Arthur D'Italia, not DiIalia.

HEADLINE: Yonkers Should Renew Waterfront Industry 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The attempt by Yonkers to revive its waterfront and downtown with luxury housing is an expensive folly ("On the Waterfront, Yonkers Hopes Apartments Along the Hudson Will Start a Revival" March 18). 
 The area where Hudson Park will be built has few amenities and many social problems, but the developers intend to charge Manhattan-level rents for apartments abutting busy train tracks. 
What Yonkers really needs is a commitment to bring back industry. With lower costs and convenient transport, Yonkers could again be a commercial and industrial center providing jobs for its many impoverished residents. 
As a former resident, I just hope that it does not take another 20 years for Yonkers leaders to start making real progress.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2001.5 Volkswagen Passat; 
German Engineers Refuse To Leave Well Enough Alone

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN 

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
WE are passing Bubba's Mountain Road, traveling through a kudzu-draped landscape with 750 miles to go on the kind of marathon journey that can sour your disposition, unless you have the right travel companion. Fortunately, I do -- the 2001.5 Volkswagen Passat. It is even enough to offset driving with my husband.
 We are headed for the Great Smoky Mountains on a trip through the land of "boiled p'nuts," pork barbecue and Dollywood -- all bits of regional Americana on the way home to Cleveland, where we should be able to deliver a trial-by-mileage verdict on the latest Passat. 
 As suggested by its in-between model designation, the Passat has not been completely redesigned. The size, interior space and cargo capacity are all about the same, but there are significant changes: VW made the styling a bit flashier, improved the way the car drives by making the structure stiffer, and gave the base engine, a 1.8-liter turbocharged four cylinder, more power. Depending on model, prices are up $200 to $540.
The base price of the four-cylinder GLS sedan -- the model I drove home from Georgia -- increased by $300, to $22,300 including shipping charges. The GLS wagon with the same engine went up $300, to $23,100. The top-of-the-line GLX sedan with a V-6 engine and 4Motion all-wheel drive is now $32,125, up $540, and the similarly equipped GLX wagon is $32,925. The GLX's now have standard 16-inch tires.
Why does VW call this a 2001.5 model? The answer is complicated, involving dwindling supplies of 2001's, the arrival dates of the new cars and an attempt to take advantage of emissions and economy rules.
The Passat has been an important car for VW. It paved the way for the company's strong re-emergence in the American market in recent years, and it is crucial to VW's plans to reach a more luxury-minded customer. The new Passat is also intended to create a buzz for the W8, an eight-cylinder Passat that is likely to arrive in the second quarter of 2002.
The Passat is also a family sedan with a semi-sporty European feel. Again this year, Consumer Reports ranked it first among family cars.
We left Atlanta on a Thursday afternoon in a front-drive sedan with the 1.8 turbo engine and a five-speed manual transmission. Soon we were on a two-lane road passing a sign that read "Baby Goat Quilts" and abandoned, weathered cabins.
While the steering of the old Passat was quick to respond, this one was even more eager to change direction, especially for a front-drive car. If you want to turn, you don't need to place an order in advance.
The suspension was only tweaked, not redesigned. Already a solid car, the Passat now feels even stiffer, and the driver feels even better connected to the road. That is largely because the body is 10 percent more rigid, said Stefan Krebsfanger, manager of product strategy for VW in North America. Engineers reinforced the body in strategic areas by using thicker sheet metal and adding welds to improve rigidity.
The steering, which used to feel a little too light and busy for a car that would like to be called a European sport sedan, seems improved. It is heavier now, although Mr. Krebsfanger said the basic steering setup wasn't changed. He attributed the difference to the car's 150-pound increase in weight, its wider track and a different tire-rubber formula.
After a night in Bryson City, N.C., and breakfast at Ma Barker's restaurant, we filled the tank with premium 91-octane fuel. (The turbocharger requires it.) Soon we approached Newfound Gap Road, which bisects the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and a sign that warned: "Steep winding mountain road next 35 miles. Be prepared for severe weather, ice and snow."
Perfect.
While the Passat's V-6 is unchanged, the turbo 4 now has 170 horsepower, up from 150. Maximum torque, or pulling power, which has been increased to 166 foot-pounds, from 155, is available when the engine is turning at any speed from 1,950 to 5,000 r.p.m.
As a result, the engine is wonderfully accommodating. Crossing the park, even in fourth gear on an uphill grade, the engine pulled eagerly as we accelerated after slowing down for a sharp curve.
Side-curtain air bags, designed for head protection, were new for 2001; the only additional safety equipment is a third height-adjustable head restraint for a rear-center passenger.
Leaving the Smokies, we passed through Gatlinburg, Tenn., past Dinosaur Golf, listening to a country-and-western interpretation of how Moses led the Jews out of Egypt, and then through Pigeon Forge. We bypassed Dollywood and a Las Vegas-style entertainment strip offering everything from laser tag to Hill-Billy Village, whose attractions were not immediately clear.
On Interstate 75, we found the Passat to be a comfortable highway cruiser, and even at 80 the rather small turbo engine felt unstressed.
We didn't have to wait for Cleveland to test VW's claims that the improved tires made potholes and tar strips less jarring. As we left Kentucky and entered Cincinnati, Interstate 71 offered a bonanza of potholes. The Passat did a competent job of cushioning us against the harsh reality of Ohio's highways.
But after seven hours on the road the seats were beginning to wear on us. The bottom cushions could definitely be longer; both the 5-foot-6 driver and the 6-foot-4 passenger wanted more thigh support.
VW has improved the cup holders, which are now part of the center console, but not the rachet knob that tilts the seatbacks and that forces you to contort your arm like a chicken wing. It is a nuisance, but a small thing on a vehicle that satisfies on so many more important levels.
The verdict? The new Passat just shows that VW employs a bunch of overachievers who didn't know enough to be content with a first-rate sedan. Danke, y'all.

INSIDE TRACK: A marvelous multitasker.

HEADLINE: Plasma TV: That New Object Of Desire 

BYLINE:  By RICK MARIN

 BODY:
SOME people's favorite "Hannibal" moment is Anthony Hopkins performing brain salad surgery on Ray Liotta. But the scene I can't get out of my mind is Gary Oldman's invalid Hannibal survivor lying in bed, staring up at a bank of televisions. 
 It wasn't what he was watching -- Bloomberg or CNNfn -- that grabbed me, but how: on half-a-dozen wafer-thin TV screens. I have become obsessed with flat, tube-free TV's, in particular those big, wide plasma screens that until recently cost at least $10,000. Before the movie even started, I confessed my dire case of plasma envy to one of my seat mates, Megan Martin, a 23-year-old aspiring filmmaker. She had no trouble relating. 
 "When I sell my first screenplay, I'm not getting a car," she said. "I want one of those flat screens." 
In the 80's, it would have been a Porsche; in the 90's a BMW -- before they became "Beemers" and schoolteachers started driving them. Now, there's a new status symbol, a new envy object in town. It doesn't have wheels, but it's equally cool, and elusive, for mortal consumers. 
You used to have to sneak into a high-end audiophile boutique to check out a plasma unit. Flat as a stack of pancakes, its two panes of glass are separated by just a few millimeters and filled with hundreds of thousands of tiny neon and xenon gas cells -- they produce the crisp digital image.
But the main attraction is the movie-screen width -- its 16:9 aspect ratio makes the 4:3 proportions of a regular TV set look so, like, square. You see gawping, suspicious browsers walking all the way around these machines looking for the tube or hamster wheels or whatever makes that space-sucking bulge in the back of ordinary TV's. Are the "wall screens" Ray Bradbury promised in "Fahrenheit 451" finally here? Do we start burning books now?
A year or so ago, the plasmas started materializing everywhere -- in gyms, clubs, malls. In a student lounge at New York University. Hanging from the ceiling of the Gap on Fifth Avenue in Midtown. In a show of video art at the Whitney Museum of American Art. There was a Philips ad with a hip couple watching one on their bedroom ceiling. Dangling before us in all these public spaces, plasma technology becomes even more tantalizing. The screens become what the ad people like to call "aspirational" objects of consumer desire. 
"It's the 'wow' factor," said Scott Schurman, who had a Sony plasma installed in the bedroom of his Upper East Side apartment two weeks ago. "Anybody who walks into your apartment and sees one of those TV's is going to say: 'You are cool. You are a better person.' "
Mr. Schurman, 44, is the national accounts manager for Recoton, a high-end audio component company. For professional reasons, he is something of an "early adopter" of consumer electronics. "I bought a Sony DVD player for $1,000 two years ago," he said. "Now, it's $179." He convened a meeting of his co-op board just to show off his plasma TV.
Pioneer, Marantz, Panasonic and NEC, among others, have all gotten into the plasma game. The screens come in two sizes: 42 inches and 50 inches (measured diagonally -- some things never change), and range from three to seven inches deep. Why have prices taken so long to come down? 
Mike Gleason, the national sales manager for Fujitsu General America, blames the technology. "Regular TV's have about a 2 to 3 percent failure rate at the factory," he said. "On plasmas, it's about 60 percent." Fujitsu was able to cut its sticker price in half, he said, partly because of a lower failure rate and weaker yen against the dollar. 
Liquid crystal display flat screens -- the same technology used in some computer screens -- are marginally more affordable. Sharp's 10-inch flip-down TV, popular for mounting under kitchen cabinets, is still $1,299.
About 65 percent of flat-screen sales are to businesses. It has proved an eye-catching marketing device. "You put a regular TV in a mall or a movie theater, and people walk right by it," Mr. Gleason said. "With plasma, the message is secondary. People stop just to look at the monitor."
At the Wiz on Fifth Avenue, I saw a couple of ultra-trendy Japanese teenagers sitting rapt in front of "Gladiator" on a plasma screen. The Apartment, a mod home furnishings store on Crosby Street, has one suspended from the ceiling -- the first thing you notice when you walk in the door. The James Dean Lounge in the Iroquois Hotel on West 44th Street has one over the fireplace. Its general manager, Paul Celnik, "wanted to present people with things they don't have in their own homes," he said.
So, who does have them in their own homes?
"Madonna, Donatella Versace," said Greg Mykietyn, a salesman at the Harvey electronics store in ABC Carpet & Home. Of the 100 or so plasma screens his store has sold in the last year, most went to celebrities and "the very rich," Mr. Mykietyn said. "It has attracted a type that said: 'I want it. I don't really care how much it is.' " He said he recently sold one to Julianne Moore.
Another "Hannibal" connection! Does everyone involved with this movie have one?
Jeffrey Sachs, an investment banker, said he got his 50-inch Pioneer plasma screen for a media room he just built in his apartment in United Nations Plaza. One criticism of the plasma screens is that they don't render black tones. But Mr. Sachs's only complaint was that until the broadcast and cable channels start sending out programs in the 16:9 aspect ratio, the wide screen makes everyone look fat. 
"I don't want to see Jennifer Aniston fat," Mr. Sachs said.
HBO's "The Sopranos," however, is in the wide-screen format this season. That was just one of many reasons that I wanted -- no, needed -- to get a flat screen in my apartment. 
Last week, Fujitsu lowered the price of its 42-inch screen from $15,999 to $9,999. A bargain! Their prices are insane, as Crazy Eddie used to say.
I called Fujitsu and asked if I could "test" one. (A journalist's privilege.) Gravely, I signed an agreement promising to pay a fine of $1,000 a day if I didn't give it back after a week. 
Last Wednesday morning, two Fujitsu technicians showed up to install my loaner: a 42-inch Plasmavision SlimScreen PDS-4222. I had taken a big painting off the wall to make room. They put the screen on top of a long built-in cabinet. If I was buying one, I would have hung it. Fortunately, the Fujitsu comes with a stand. Not so fortunately, the stand has "Plasmavision" written on it in big letters. 
"That's a bit much," my neighbor said when he saw the logo. "We get the idea."
Steven Sclaroff, an interior designer, had told me that most of his clients still want to hide these screens, even though their existing TV cabinets are too deep and have to be reconfigured with false walls. "There's still a tendency to want to put the TV away," he said. 
Are they nuts? My first thought was how perfectly the brushed-metallic frame matched my Harman Kardon stereo and Pioneer turntable. My second thought was, "I should have got the 50-inch." That's how sick I am. 
My third thought, once the technicians turned it on, was, "I'm never giving it back."
The Fujitsu guys, Ryan Flaig and Ringo Serrano, made the necessary connections to my cable box and VCR. I didn't wire the monitor to my speakers because I have a fear of becoming a home-theater geek. I don't want "Emergency!" -- which happened to be on TV Land when the screen turned on -- coming at me at THX volume.
There was a fuzzy line wiggling down the left side of the screen. "Noise from the cable," Mr. Flaig said. He shifted the frame of the picture and made it disappear. "A lot of customers get the TV and complain the picture's bad. But it's the cable."
An audio cable was missing, so I went to the Wiz to buy one. I also loaded up on DVD's. "Ben-Hur" (just out). "Gladiator." "Scarface." Because I have no DVD player in my apartment, I hooked up the one in my laptop. Now I could not only write about this personal Jumbotron, I could write on it.
I've seen "Ben-Hur" a dozen times, but not since my parents got a color TV has my world been so changed. I kept the Fujitsu on all afternoon. New York 1's Pat Kiernan never looked so good. That night, I invited a friend over for a flat-screening of "Apocalypse Now" on DVD. We cooked up "a little rice and rat meat" (as Martin Sheen's Captain Willard says) and hunkered down in front of a TV screen big enough for Marlon Brando.
"The horror, the horror," I croaked at the realization that I was soon going to have to go back to watching my 27-inch JVC, purchased in 1987. I needed my own plasma. But the cost -- how could I justify it?
Richard Mishaan, an interior designer, gave me an idea. He had put two Philips plasma screens in his section of the Kips Bay show house last year. (Philips sponsored the house.) He also has a Sony in his store, Homer, on Madison Avenue.
"A comparable television set was like four feet deep and costs $5,000," he said. "If you calculate the cost of real estate in New York and divide that by four feet . . . ."
Where's my calculator? My apartment is probably worth $500 a square foot. With a flat TV on the wall, I could get rid of my TV and reclaim enough space for another chair, another ottoman even. That's about 16 square feet.
That's $8,000 worth of real estate! The new Sony PFM-42B1 SuperTheater plasma lists for $7,999. 
I told another neighbor about my exciting calculations. If I got a Sony, I'd actually be saving $1.
"That's the kind of thinking that got us into this recession," he said.

Waiting for the Other Shoe to Drop on a Sagging Economy

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
CAN it get worse?
 That is the question for investors who have agonized through two of the toughest weeks in recent stock market history. The 10.7 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial average since March 16, which pushed it briefly into bear-market territory on Thursday and Friday, was the worst two-week plunge since the 1987 crash. 
 Although the market rebounded on Friday, the answer is still yes, it can get worse. That is because corporate profits have borne the brunt of the economic downturn so far. But if the economy does not show signs of stabilizing or rebounding quickly, then the burden will shift to workers, who will be laid off as companies seek to cut costs. Incomes will fall, consumer spending will slow and the economy will sink further. That would leave stocks, at best, treading water. 
That is the prospect being described by economists who have predicted that this slump will become a recession. They are still in the minority and have not been looking prescient lately, with job growth stronger than expected in February and the housing sector holding up. But they warn that the other shoe has yet to drop.
As the economy slowed at the end of last year, many employers were reluctant to discharge workers who had been so difficult to find and keep in the first place. This is one reason that the unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent in February, is still so low.
Avoiding layoffs as production slowed cut into productivity, which grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, down from 8 percent a year earlier. So the price of the downturn was reduced productivity growth, which raised costs and sent earnings into their own recession.
That decline has already devastated the stock market. Currently, earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are forecast by Wall Street analysts to fall 7.2 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with a year ago, and 5.2 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The outlook for the third quarter is still positive, at 2.7 percent, but slipping, while the fourth-quarter forecast of 13.8 percent seems to apply to another planet.
Only time will tell if the second shoe will fall. But the growing list of layoffs shows that companies are unwilling to live much longer with plunging earnings. Last week, Procter & Gamble said it would cut 9 percent of its work force. John T. Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, said a week and a half ago that his company was having a hard time reducing its production costs and warned investors to cut their estimates for the company's profit margins. And that was after announcing that Cisco was reducing its work force by 11 percent.
There are also signs that getting out of this mess will take more time and effort than expected.
While many economists still do not see a recession, they have given up on a quick recovery. And the Federal Reserve, which made its third half-percentage-point rate cut of the year last Tuesday, has not gone far enough yet, especially in the eyes of the stock market, which plunged after the announcement.
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, now says the Fed will cut its benchmark short-term interest rate, now 5 percent, to 4 percent, instead of the 4.5 percent he previously forecast.
Despite all the pessimism, the Fed does seem bent on turning around the economy, which is good for stocks in the long run.
But after the plunge into a bear market, it will be harder to convince investors that the future looks bright. They need to be confident that the Fed has cut interest rates enough to rescue the economy. And despite the fastest rate cuts ever under Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, we are not there yet.
Some important corporate executives, like Mr. Chambers, will also have to be able to announce that they are doing better than expected after months of acknowledging that sales and profits were falling short of expectations. 
But with the first-quarter confession season swinging into high gear in the next three weeks and earnings forecasts still declining, it's too soon to hope for that.

Saying the Road Is Hard, Dominican 'Taxistas' Seek Unity

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
The organizers of the meeting had hoped for 50 livery-cab drivers, but only about a dozen showed up. One driver had an explanation.
 "Time is gold," said Francisco Taveras, using the Spanish version of the common saying, "and there's no group that saying applies to better than a taxista. When his car is empty, he wants it full, and when it's full, he wants it empty." 
 That comment brought a laugh from the drivers who gathered recently at the Bailey Radio Dispatcher base in Kingsbridge Heights to meet with organizers from the Coalition of Progressive Dominicans. The purpose was to discuss the problems faced by livery drivers, many of whom are Dominican. The coalition hopes to unite Dominicans from different sectors of the economy: teachers, lawyers, factory workers, cabdrivers. This was the first meeting dedicated to a single occupation.
Hilario Amparo, driver No. 102 at Bailey and a founding member of the coalition, started the meeting with a litany of complaints about high insurance rates, lack of Dominicans in government, and frequent summonses from the police and the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
"They never give us a break," Mr. Amparo said in Spanish, the language used during the meeting. "Not even if we're on a one-way street, picking up a call, and we double-park as we wait for the passenger. The police make us move, and if we don't, they give us a ticket. It's impossible." 
One driver, Julian Taveras, said lack of English was an obstacle. "We don't know how to express ourselves, so we get a ticket," he said. "Why? Because we didn't know how to defend ourselves, even if there's some silly reason for what you've done that you could have explained."
Rafael Pasian and Emiliano Perez, public school teachers and founding members of the coalition, told the drivers that the coalition would provide free English classes, perhaps at livery bases in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
Of 40,000 livery-cab drivers in New York, three-quarters are Latino, and three-quarters of those are Dominican, said Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, a trade group.
In some ways, the goals of Mr. Mateo's organization, which was formed in 1998, overlap with those of the coalition. The taxi group has signed up thousands of members, lobbied public officials, secured discount health insurance and opened walk-in help centers for drivers.
But the coalition is focused on uniting Dominicans. After the meeting, Mr. Pasian said his group's top priority was to find a place to hold meetings. "The community center will be the unifying force that brings all the elements together," he said. SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: A Poet, Barred at the Gate 

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
SHE is only 23 years old, although her passport says she is 26. She looks more like a tomboyish model than a national literary figure.
 But when the Eritrean poet Saba Kidane steps up to the microphone, she quiets the crowd with a flash of a smile and a single word. 
 Draped in a loose white robe, she doesn't read so much as sing.
Please fly my hello to the black and white Africans
Her English is heavily accented, but it flows like water.
Please float my hello to the African lake
Please fly my hello to those suffering from the unconscionable others.
The rest is in her native Tigrinya, laced with glottal stops and flattened vowels. Even those who don't know the language are drawn in; by the rise of her voice and the sway of her hips as the words dance from her mouth. But for those who understand her words, the effect is even more entrancing.
"She speaks about the condition of women in Eritrea, particularly women who are survivors of the war with Ethiopia," said Prof. Ngugi wa Thiong'o, a Kenyan novelist who teaches comparative literature and performance studies at New York University. He first saw Ms. Kidane perform last year at a pan-African literature conference in Eritrea. He doesn't speak Tigrinya, but he saw the effect she had. "There's humor there. I saw some women laughing. But I also saw some women crying."
Like many accomplished performers from distant lands, Ms. Kidane (pronounced ki-DAH-ne) is unknown to most Americans, but among her compatriots in the expat community here, she is a star. 
"She's very smart and interesting," said Amanuel Tekeste, a longtime New York resident who owns an Eritrean restaurant called Massawa in Morningside Heights. "My wife is very interested in her."
His sister, Freweini Tekeste, a waitress at the restaurant, speaks little English, but at the mention of Ms. Kidane's name, her face lit up and she began chattering in rapid Tigrinya. "I know her work," she said. "She is famous. I love her!"
Many in Eritrea have long known about Ms. Kidane, a single mother who was a program director for youth radio and is now working on starting a youth newspaper. But it was at the conference, in January 2000, that outsiders got their first glimpse of the limpid-eyed poet with the voice like a bell.
At the conference in Eritrea, after Professor wa Thiong'o, his wife and their grown daughter spent a few days with Ms. Kidane, he announced that he was informally adopting her, an honor that raised her recognition in the world of African literature. 
Bob Holman, a poet and professor of writing at Bard College in Annandale, N.Y., also attended the conference.
"Nobody had introduced her to me, she wasn't on any of the panels, and here she steps up to the stage and takes control like a diva," he recalled. "She blew the house down."
After Mr. Holman invited Ms. Kidane to perform in the United States at the People's Poetry Gathering, a five-day poetry festival in New York that begins Wednesday, Bard College and Yale University invited her to speak. The festival, sponsored by three New York organizations -- City Lore, an urban folklore center; Poets House, a poetry library; and Arts International, a nonprofit cultural exchange organization -- includes a segment on Eritrea in which Ms. Kidane would share the stage with Reesom Haile, her country's poet laureate, and Ararat Iyob, an Eritrean poet who lives in Washington. 
But last month, when she applied for a visitor's visa at the United States Embassy in Asmara, Eritrea's capital, Ms. Kidane found that not all Americans are so welcoming. As a young woman from a struggling third world country, she looked like a risky bet to the official who interviewed her. It didn't matter that she had invitations from five American institutions, that she was leaving behind her 3-year-old daughter, or that Mr. Haile had easily procured a visa for the festival. Rather than fitting the embassy's usual profile of a visiting artist, Ms. Kidane looked like someone who sought to enter the United States to stay.
"It's cynical and patronizing," Mr. Holman said. "They assume everyone in the world wants to live in the States. And they look at her being a child as being a reason for her wanting to get out rather than a reason for her wanting to go home."

Hard Times In the Horn of Africa
No one can deny that Eritrea is a poor country. A sliver of land on the Red Sea coast hugging the northern edge of Africa's horn, until the 1940's it was a colony of Italy, which bestowed it with palazzi and pasta but left it with a thirst for independence. That desire was severely challenged during a bloody, three-decade war to gain independence from neighboring Ethiopia that ended in 1991, only to start again in 1998. The violence ended last year. Ethiopian troops began withdrawing this year. 
Today Eritrea is a young democracy that tolerates more freedom than many of its neighbors. The government supports polyglot education, environmentalism and women's rights. But while Eritrea has a population of four million, more than a million fled the country during the long years of war and poverty. 
According to Kelit Alazar, an Eritrean-born engineer who moved to New York in 1972, most Eritreans in the United States never dreamed of emigrating here. But over the years, several thousand have settled in the New York area, many moving to Parkchester in the Bronx or to southwest Harlem. Some are doctors or engineers. Others drive taxis or work in hotels.
On a recent night, in a dimly lighted room in the headquarters of the Eritrean Community Center on West 125th Street near Broadway, rows of long tables were packed with people. Children scampered about chattering in English as adults used the spongy white bread known as injera to scoop mouthfuls of beef and lentils from large metal platters. Men gathered around the bar conversing in one or another of Eritrea's nine official languages, while an older woman wearing a gauzy white shawl bantered with friends in Italian, remembered from colonial days. 
Mr. Alazar helped start the center in 1985. Like other community centers aimed at certain groups of immigrants, it helps newcomers integrate and keeps younger generations connected with the old country. But the transition is often difficult. As years turn into decades, he said, "We're physically here, but mentally, everything is back home."
On this particular night, on a stage decorated with balloons and streamers, community leaders made speeches honoring Eritrea's National Women's Day and touted the participation of women in Eritrean public and professional life. Mr. Holman, wrapped in a white shawl, took the microphone and spoke of the coming festival and of the efforts to bring Ms. Kidane to the United States. Thanks to the Internet, Ms. Kidane's work is widely distributed among the Eritrean diaspora, and listeners cheered at the mention of her name.
"If she came, we'd have an event for her at the center," Mr. Alazar said. "It would be fantastic. We would have a full house." 
In the past, visiting musicians from Eritrea have been a hit among young people, many of whom have never seen their parents' country. "When they come live, people are dying to see them," Mr. Alazar said.
He added that Ms. Kidane would be popular with the new generation. "She's young," he said, "and young people like young people. It would be an incentive for some of them to go back home and take a look."
Ms. Tekeste, who was attending the festivities, rose from a chair and limped to a neighboring table. A recent arrival to the United States, she had fought for 16 years in an army in which women played an essential role. After artillery fire destroyed her hip, she came to this country to seek medical treatment, but doctors told her further surgery might result in paralysis. 
For Ms. Tekeste, Saba Kidane's poetry speaks directly to her experiences in the field. "I feel I'm part of the same front as Saba," said Ms. Tekeste, whose younger sister died in combat. "I feel very much connected to her."
If Ms. Kidane were older, she too might be hobbled by war injuries. In 1991, at 13, she dropped out of school, pushed her birth date back three years and joined the army. She trained to be a soldier and made it to the front. If the war had not halted that year, she would have seen combat.
According to Charles Cantalupo, a professor of English and comparative literature at Pennsylvania State University who specializes in African literatures, the idea of Ms. Kidane's trading in her Kalashnikov for a pen makes sense, because much of Eritrea's recent art originated in the trenches. 
"Many writers and artists attended the university of struggle and revolution," Dr. Cantalupo said. "The war was a cultural education, and many of the fighters were writers. Look for the brightest thinkers; they were on the field."
Well before the war, poetry played an integral role in Eritrea. The art form is even woven into the local currency. The five-nakfa bill, as common a denomination there as the $1 bill is in the United States, features an ancient sycamore tree whose branches spread like a wide umbrella over the ground. Like certain sycamore trees across Eritrea, this one, near the town of Segheneyti, has for centuries drawn local poets to perform there. 
"Ours is an oral society," said Kassahun Checole, publisher of Africa World Press, a publishing company in Lawrenceville, N.J. Although Eritrea has one of the world's oldest written languages, known as Geez, it is used mostly for liturgical purposes, he said. "By and large, most people record history, play songs and pass it down orally. And these people are very poetic. When they tell a story, they tell it in a very attractive and musical way."

A Young Medium With an Ancient Message
Saba Kidane's voice was quick and light as she discussed the poetry she began writing in 1995, upon returning to school after the war.
"It's about nature, social strife, spiritualism, love, silence, sadness, madness," she said in a recent telephone conversation from Asmara. "Always, the poetry just comes to me. I'm just a medium."
Women in Eritrea have long been bards. In one tradition, women gather around a newborn baby and compose poems for its mother. But their participation in the male-dominated worlds of government, the professions and public performance is a new phenomenon, a result of the war. 
"Traditionally, women sat in the background and didn't say much," said Mr. Checole, the publisher. "But in a 30-year war, everyone had to participate. Women made up over 30 percent of the fighting force."
Ms. Kidane, born well into the war, has inherited her country's new, more egalitarian mind-set. Through her radio work she has pushed for social change and has called for education to stem the AIDS epidemic that has seared the continent. "She has a very independent feminist perspective," Mr. Checole said. "In a male society, she stands up and speaks her mind on issues. 
"She is very hopeful for the country," he added. "Young people are very engaged in what is going on right now, and she represents that engagement."
The fact that most of her poems are in Tigrinya is seen as a sign of her commitment to her country. "There's no question of her wanting to write in English," Professor wa Thiong'o said. "A person of her age in a different country would aspire to become an English-language poet, but she is proud to write in her own language." 
Such national pride is common in Eritrea, Dr. Cantalupo said, adding that young Eritreans today are "profoundly committed to the national experiment." 
"It's a wonderful liberating moment for them to express themselves," he said. 
In that context, Ms. Kidane said, she would have no reason to leave Eritrea, where she is known and loved by so many. "Now that people have accepted me in their hearts," she said, "I'm not about to leave all that."

Back to Try Again, But the Embassy Is Adamant
Back in New York, Ms. Kidane's supporters felt confident that if the embassy officials who interviewed her could hear about her commitment to Eritrea and her place in its literary community, they would reconsider their decision to deny her a visa. So on March 13, after Representative Jerrold Nadler and the five groups who invited her had sent letters of support to the embassy, Ms. Kidane returned for a second try. She brought a letter of support from the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as proof that she had obtained a license to start her newspaper.
"We had so much compelling evidence," said Steve Zeitlin, City Lore's executive director. "We did not think it was humanly possible for them to deny this."
But Maureen Monetta, the consular officer who had heard the case the first time, had the same answer when Ms. Kidane made a return visit: no.
"She said, 'I'm surprised you came a second time,' " Ms. Kidane said later that day. "Even though I had brought these letters, she said, 'You don't fit the profile of the kind of person we want to let in.' " As Ms. Kidane recalled, Ms. Monetta simply handed back the thick packet of support letters and sent her home.
In an e-mail to Mr. Zeitlin sent the same day, Ms. Monetta encouraged him to replace Ms. Kidane on the roster. "If you would like to consider someone else from here," she wrote, "the requirements would be someone who has family, social and economical ties here. (Someone in the mid-40's, with business ties, a home and a family.)" 
Festival promoters say the stereotype of a poet as a middle-aged professional with a large family is exactly what they are trying to challenge. But embassy statistics do not help their case. "Our return rate for young people her age is about 5 percent," Ms. Monetta wrote in the e-mail to Mr. Zeitlin. "While I regret that this is a one-time shot for spotlighting Eritrea, I cannot help you with her application."
The following day, speaking by telephone to a reporter, Ms. Monetta repeated the statistic. "She is certainly very up and coming," she said of Ms. Kidane. "She is also very young, and frankly, her ties to Eritrea just aren't strong enough." 
Ms. Kidane said she had not planned to travel anywhere, and accepted the invitation only because it would give her an opportunity to do what she loved and would be a continuation of her work at home. "It would have been wonderful, I'm not able to articulate it," she said. "And the exposure would have helped me in Eritrea too." 
William Clarke, the United States ambassador in Eritrea, declined to be interviewed for this article, but the embassy press officer, Collette Christian, wrote in an e-mail that one reason for the strict visa policy was the responsibility of the United States to avoid causing "brain drain," the exodus of the brightest minds from developing countries that have seen political and economic instability. The embassy, she wrote, is trying "to protect Eritrea from developing a nation with a high rate of nonreturn, precisely by screening applicants to ensure that they meet the guidelines."
After Ms. Kidane's second rejection, the poet laureate of the United States, Stanley Kunitz, added a letter of support. And an impassioned petition posted on an Eritrean diaspora Web site has garnered more than 550 signatures from 22 countries, many from Eritreans living in the United States. "Depriving her is depriving all of us Eritreans," wrote one. Another wrote, "Don't they have an idea that some people love their country, family and culture?" A third added, "I'm 12 years of age, so I'd like to know about my home country." 
But as the festival approached, hopes dimmed. To attend, Ms. Kidane would have had to be on a plane out of Asmara by yesterday. 
Frustrated, Mr. Zeitlin wondered at the logic of Ms. Monetta's refusal. "Does she think this is all a giant ruse that Saba Kidane is using to get out of Eritrea?" he asked.. "She didn't find us. We found her."
In a country that struggled for so many years under the yoke of war, waiting is part of life. Saba Kidane will not fly her hello from New York this year, although she will add her voice to the festival via videotape. Back in Eritrea, she is throwing her energy into her newspaper, where she hopes to encourage a new generation to share its writing with the larger community.
Dr. Cantalupo surmised that her absence would be most sorely felt by listeners here. 
"Saba would have much to teach American audiences," he said. "Poets there are not separated or marginalized from mainstream society. It will be a loss not to see that example. 
"We'll be left in the dark a little longer," he added. "But hopefully not too much longer."

GRAPHIC: Photos: FACES OF A NATION -- In Eritrea, sycamore trees, like this one in the town of Segheneyti, are gathering spots for poets like Saba Kidane (insets), who is beloved by Eritreans in New York and back home.

HEADLINE: After Earnhardt's Death, A Rebound for Nascar 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
THE death of Dale Earnhardt, the fabled stock car driver, was a blow not only to his fans but also to companies tied to motor sports. Shares in the dominant racetrack companies, the International Speedway Corporation and Speedway Motorsports, plummeted just after Mr. Earnhardt's crash five weeks ago at Daytona International Speedway in Florida.
 Market analysts feared that fans would turn their backs on the sport, in attendance and television viewing, because racing's equivalent of Elvis was gone. 
 Instead, Mr. Earnhardt's accident appears to have evoked more awareness of Nascar racing. Nascar races on the Fox network have been the nation's top-rated sporting events on most recent Sundays, and track attendance has held up as fans take part in memorials for Mr. Earnhardt and cheer on his racing team.
Television revenue and attendance are the main sources of income for companies in the motor sports business. Shares in I.S.C., Speedway and a third company, Dover Downs, had recovered after Mr. Earnhardt's death. But I.S.C. and Dover have struggled in the recent market slide, while Speedway has held its own. "Definitely, there is momentum," said Breck Wheeler, an analyst at Legg Mason.
This year is the first of a six-year, $2.4 billion contract for Nascar and national television networks. Fox will show the first half of the Winston Cup racing season, through July; NBC is to pick up the broadcasts after that. In all, 27 races will be on the two networks, with an additional 10 shown on cable by Turner Sports.
The contract was a milestone for Nascar, which, despite a wide fan following, has never received the broadcast attention given other sports. As recently as 1985, Nascar collected just $3 million a year for 28 races on television. Track owners receive 65 percent of the television money, with 25 percent going to racing teams and 10 percent to Nascar.
The deal has been particularly lucrative for I.S.C., headed by members of the France family, which also controls Nascar, a closely held company. I.S.C. owns a dozen major tracks, including Daytona, the Michigan International Speedway and a new track in Kansas City, Kan. The company is also studying the feasibility of an auto racing complex in the New Jersey Meadowlands.
I.S.C. is the bellwether, said Joe Hovorka, an analyst with Raymond James and Associates. "They have the most tracks," he said, adding that they would have "the most benefit" from the television contract.
He has a "strong buy" rating on I.S.C. shares, which he said could reach $48 this year. They closed at $38.88 on Friday.
Scott Barry, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, assigned the same rating. "I.S.C. trades at a significant premium, and a premium is deserved," he said.
Investors looking for cheaper shares generally head to Speedway, also rated a "strong buy" by Mr. Barry and Mr. Hovorka.
Mr. Hovorka said it could reach $30 within 12 months, compared with $24.28 on Friday.
Speedway is the industry's maverick. The owner of six tracks, it was first to see Nascar's upscale market potential. Its flamboyant managers outfitted its tracks with innovations like luxury boxes and lights for night racing.
CONCERN about attendance is a big reason that Jason Ader, an analyst at Bear Stearns, does not share the enthusiasm for these stocks, rating them "neutral." He said a weakening economy made it difficult for tracks to raise ticket prices above the typical $75 to $100 that a Winston Cup race commands.
He likened Mr. Earnhardt's death to Michael Jordan's retirement. "When Michael Jordan left basketball, it had an immediate impact," Mr. Ader said. "You make up some of the gap, but don't fully get it back."
Mr. Barry said Mr. Earnhardt's death might have shocked many fans into realizing how much racing meant to them. "The irony," he said, "is that the sport has never been better positioned to withstand this type of tragedy."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Edwin G. Vroom And Adele S. Weisman; 
Reserve Small-Cap Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE volatile, tumbling stock market is making even long-term money managers queasy. "We take Dramamine before the market opens," joked Edwin G. Vroom, co-manager of the $76 million Reserve Small-Cap Growth fund.
 That said, he and the other co-manager, Adele S. Weisman, do not buy and sell stocks based on short-term market moves. "A major characteristic of our management style is that we make long-term strategic investments in growth stocks," Ms. Weisman said from their offices on Fifth Avenue, near 44th Street, in Midtown Manhattan. "We don't even think about market timing, nor do we view economic cycles as investable events." 
 Except, perhaps, for buying shares during market dips. "If we have companies with long-term growth prospects that are experiencing problems because of the overall economy, we continue to hold or even add to the position," Ms. Weisman said.
The managers' long horizons have paid off for investors. The fund returned 26 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended on Thursday, compared with 1.8 percent for its peer group of small-growth funds and 1.9 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. For the 12 months ended Thursday, it lost 44.8 percent, versus 38.1 percent for the group and 24.7 percent for the S.& P.
Mr. Vroom, 55, is president of Roanoke Asset Management, the fund's subadviser. Ms. Weisman, 54, is senior vice president of Roanoke, which also manages about $550 million in institutional and individual accounts. They have worked together for more than 20 years -- "longer than most marriages," Ms. Weisman said -- and have run the fund since its inception in November 1994.
The managers troll for growth among United States companies with market capitalizations of $2 billion or less. They look for annual earnings and revenue growth of at least 20 percent over five years -- actual results for the last two years and projections for the next three.
They split industry groups between them, with Mr. Vroom primarily following technology, health care and energy stocks and Ms. Weisman concentrating on telecommunications, retail, biotechnology and media. To choose the fund's 40 to 50 issues, they examine areas likely to grow rapidly. "We begin to look at niches or subsectors of our particular industries," Mr. Vroom said, "and then we look for different companies to fill those subsectors."
"Doing our research, we move up and down the food chain," Ms. Weisman said. "If we're working with service providers, we talk to management about the types of equipment in the network and who supplied them. When we work with equipment manufacturers, we talk to them about the companies that supply their components. That gives us a list of names to investigate."
Their financial-statement analysis helps them determine if a company's profitability is solid. They seek operating margins of 8 percent to 35 or 40 percent, depending on the industry.
Expenses are a key. "We want to make sure that what goes into the margins at every level -- marketing, sales, administration, R & D, taxes and other expenses -- are consistent with a company's long-term growth assumptions," Ms. Weisman said.
How much will they pay for shares? The answer is tied to a company's growth prospects; as a rule, however, they will not buy a company whose price-to-earnings multiple is more than twice its earnings growth rate.
Early last summer, the managers became convinced that the biotechnology sector was starting a period of prolonged growth. Because they viewed biotech stock prices as inflated, they began looking for related companies. Last June, they bought shares in Chronimed, a Minnetonka, Minn., company that distributes drugs and provides services for patients with chronic conditions.
"Many biotech companies have little or no distribution or marketing capabilities," Mr. Vroom said. "So when they develop new compounds, they're forced to go through large drug companies, which take a big share of their profits. A new industry has emerged that facilitates distribution for these drugs." 
The managers' positive view of broadband telecommunications led them to companies that supply components to that market. They bought shares of TranSwitch, a Shelton, Conn., company that makes high-speed semiconductors used in communications networks, at $61.58 in October and, convinced that growth prospects remained solid, added more when the price fell to $18.9375 this month. The shares are now at $19.56.
"There's been a slowdown in the telecommunications business," Mr. Vroom said. "We think it will correct in 12 months and people will look at the area much more favorably." He expects the company's earnings to grow 25 to 30 percent in the next 12 to 18 months, based on increasing demand for capacity in telecommunications systems.
In September, the managers bought shares of Genesco, a specialty retailer based in Nashville, at $17.0625. "Specialty retailers are exposed to unpredictable changes in style that put their earnings at risk," Ms. Weisman said. Genesco avoids this, she added, by distributing brands of many manufacturers. 
Ms. Weisman expects Genesco to have earnings of $1.70 a share in the fiscal year ending next Jan. 31, compared with $1.44 the previous year. The shares closed on Friday at $25.98.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Is Japan Digging Out, Or Falling Deeper?

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THE 1980's were Latin America's lost decade. But in the 1990's, it was Japan that missed the boat. And after 10 years of no growth, slow growth or outright contraction, the wonder is that it remains the world's second-largest economy.
 The Japanese stock market hasn't exactly been a happening place, either. The Topix index is about 16 percent above a 1998 low but remains about 56 percent below the hyperinflated peak it hit in 1989. Many people say Japanese stocks are still expensive. 
 In their own incremental way, Japanese officials are trying to shake things up. Last week, the Bank of Japan started a new campaign to reinflate the economy.
Gary Motyl, chief investment officer for institutional equities at the Templeton Institutional Group, has been watching Japan for 20 years. He took time last week to talk about its prospects. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Are you impressed with the Bank of Japan's shift in policy?

A. Reducing an interest rate from 25 basis points to zero, which is one thing they intend to do, is effectively a nonevent. Also, it is not clear to us how committed they are to change. Will they do this in a piecemeal, short-term fashion, or will the effort get bogged down in politics?
The Japanese economy is in such a state that attacking one or two things just won't work. This has to be a concerted action that embraces monetary and fiscal policy, as well as restructuring everything. 

Q. Last week there were worries that coming accounting changes would rock the Japanese banking system and reverberate around the world. Can a further slide there really spread outside its borders?

A. We don't think Japan is going to implode and carry the rest of the world down with it. We don't see the deflationary problem spreading.
And the market has a pretty good idea how the stock holdings at Japanese banks are going to be valued come the end of this quarter. The numbers are going to be very ugly, but not orders of magnitude worse than people are anticipating.
The thing that is amazing to us is that the Japanese populace has been this docile in the face of a decade-long recession. I can't imagine that happening anywhere else, and certainly not in the United States.

Q. Templeton was a huge investor in Japan in the 1970's and into the 80's. But then the firm started to ease out, and by 1988 was effectively no longer a presence. Is your outlook more positive now?

A.In terms of the equity weightings in our portfolios, Japan has moved from the low single digits to the high single digits over the last couple of years.
The majority of stocks in Japan are still expensive on a price-to-earnings basis. We also think they are expensive on a price-to-adjusted book value basis, which is adjusted for things like pension liabilities and nonconsolidated debt.
There are some wonderful companies with very good managements. But there are a massive number of companies that have no interest in rewarding shareholders. To get corporate managements to really change will take a matter of years. We are still early in the game.

Q. What do you need to see to become more positive about investing there?

A. First, there has probably been more money lost trying to call the bottom of the Japanese market over the last 10 years than in the dot-com phenomenon over the last couple of years.
We would need to see some serious reforms and deregulation. In addition, individual companies need to get serious about enhancing returns on equity, about controlling their costs and positioning themselves to meet global competition.
When we visit these companies, for every one that says they are going to change and will be improving their return on equity, we meet 10 who want to stick to the same way they have been conducting business for the last 30 years. 

Q. Yet there are some companies that "get it." Which ones do you own a piece of?

A. One company we own is Komatsu, the world's second-largest producer of construction equipment. They are making the effort to truly globalize the company, watch their return on equity and manage themselves the way some of the better American and European companies are run.
The Toyota Motor Company is an extremely well-run operation, but the stock is too expensive. We own NTT. On a valuation basis, we think it is one of the most attractive telecommunications companies. They are also the eighth-largest holder of real estate in Japan, which is on their books at a nominal amount. And we still have some Sony that we have owned for many years. The stock is not cheap, but it is a world-class company with good management and good technology. It is a hold.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Rediscovering The Simple Beauty Of Cash

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
THE stock market's plunge has frightened legions of investors into a kind of paralysis.
 In a period of so much uncertainty, few people want to commit what may now be sharply depleted assets, especially when returns from relatively safe perches on the sidelines in cash or cash equivalents look pretty good. Those returns look reasonable even after the Federal Reserve last week made its third rate cut of the year -- and, given the way stocks have behaved, just keeping pace with inflation seems a minor triumph. 
 Where to put your money while waiting out the storm depends on how much flexibility you want, whether you insist on having your money insured by the government, and just how willing you are to tolerate low but stable returns. 
Some of the options are a throwback. You can, of course, stick with a savings account at the local bank. But such accounts pay relatively little, even compared with the chief alternatives, money market funds and and certificates of deposit. Other than convenience, the main attraction is federal deposit insurance, for up to $100,000 an account.
At Emigrant Savings Bank in New York, for instance, a savings account now earns 2.25 percent a year, according to John M. Fall, a vice president. The rate applies whether you request the traditional passbook that is still favored by older depositors or accounts that provide only monthly statements. The law, however, denies passbook users access to automated teller machines.
Where could you do better? There is no central source for tracking savings account rates. So to find the best deal, you have to go from bank to bank. But keep fees in mind. "You might have a better rate someplace," Mr. Fall said, "but the fees could be higher." 
Emigrant charges $2 a month for accounts of less than $500, but this is waived if an individual has several accounts totaling more than that. And savings accounts may offer check-writing privileges, typically limited to three checks a month.
Some online banks, like ING Direct, pay considerably higher interest, but not everyone wants to deal with an institution that has no physical office. 
Savings accounts in general have few fans among experts. "I recommend against them because the interest rate tends to be low," said Scott M. Kahan, a financial planner and president of the Financial Asset Management Corporation in New York.
For a better return, money market funds are probably the best bet. "They are not guaranteed," said Harold Evensky, who heads the Evensky Group, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla. "But they pay higher rates than savings accounts, and they are considered extraordinarily safe."
Banks also offer money market deposit accounts -- and they are insured -- but the yields are usually lower. "Banks are not encouraging that business because they are not trying to build assets" by paying fully competitive rates, said Peter Crane, managing editor of iMoneyNet, which monitors money funds. They can pay as little as 2 percent, though the average compounded seven-day return on money market funds tracked by his firm is about 5 percent.
To be sure, some money funds are still offering 6 percent interest, but some specialists caution investors against those whose rates are much higher than average, because they may hold some assets of less than pristine quality.
"Look for a fund that does not have commercial paper," the i.o.u.'s of corporations, said Bruce R. Bent, chairman of the Reserve Funds, a money market sponsor. "There have been instances where funds have held paper for institutions such as Pacific Gas and Electric that have defaulted. In those cases, the funds made good the difference, but why ask for trouble?"
Rates on money market funds, which change daily, can be checked on the iMoneyNet.com Web site.
While the vast majority of money market funds are fully taxable, there are those -- holding about 12 percent of money market assets -- that stick to tax-exempt securities. Because their returns now average only about 2.25 percent, they are aimed mainly at the well to do, said Connie Bugbee, editor of Money Fund Report, an industry publication. "The average investor in the 28 percent or 31 percent tax bracket can earn higher after-tax rates in a taxable money fund," Ms. Bugbee said.
For investors skittish enough about stocks to want to tie up their money for months, or even years, there are certificates of deposit, which are insured by the government because they are issued by banks. They can be bought directly from the bank -- the highest rates tend to be at cyberbanks -- or through a broker.
C.D.'s have an advantage if interest rates fall -- your initial rate is locked in until maturity, whether three months, six months, or a year or more away. But if rates rise, or if you have an unexpected expense, the lack of liquidity can be costly.
"If you might need the money before the C.D. comes due, remember that you will pay a penalty to take it out," Mr. Crane said. And brokerage firms generally charge a fee for the transaction. The fee at Merrill Lynch for a $1,000 C.D. is $17.50, according to Peter Bacanovic, first vice president for investment at its private client group.
Generally, the longer the maturity of a C.D., the higher its return. But Mr. Bacanovic cautioned that this was not always the case. Three-month C.D.'s, for example, could pay higher rates than the six-month variety, he said. 
The range of C.D. offerings is shown at bankrate.com, which surveys banks throughout the country. But investors should ask about the fees for transferring money at both ends.
Mr. Kahan suggested that investors planning to return to the stock market would find it most convenient to buy their C.D.'s through their brokerage firms, even though withdrawal penalties might be bigger than at banks.
Rates may not differ substantially, he said, but even small differences can be meaningful when large amounts are involved. For $500,000 worth of C.D.'s, for example, one-quarter of a percentage point amounts to $1,250 a year. And he said credit unions, which are not profit-oriented, may offer the best terms, provided that you qualify to join.
For investors who want maximum safety, the best solution may be Treasury bills, which carry maturities of up to a year and are backed by the full resources of the United States government.
"Treasuries are slightly more tax efficient because they are exempt from city and state taxes, and they trade more easily in large quantities," Mr. Bacanovic said. "You have to buy each C.D. over $100,000 separately."
These kinds of short-term securities carry very little market risk, analysts said, and no risk of not getting your principal back at maturity. They can be bought directly from the government at no extra cost, but banks and brokers charge a fee related to the size of the purchase.

HEADLINE: The World: China; 
Hedging Their Bets

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
IN China, he is always referred to as "Xiao Bushi," or "Little Bush." The appellation distinguishes George W. from his father but also ties him to a man remembered fondly here as the kind of "pragmatic realist" that officials desperately hope the son will be.
 Government leaders and scholars here have watched the new administration with a brave public face and private apprehension. They constantly tell themselves that United States-China ties are too deeply rooted in mutual interest to be upended by moralistic impulses or to permit Washington's reckless arming of Taiwan. 
 "We have no reason to become rivals or enemies," Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen said in New York last week. Still, there is tension as both countries look forward. Both know that China's neighbors see the American presence in Asia as a counterbalance to China's emerging economic and military strength. So American strategists worry about China's program to upgrade its long-backward military, while the Chinese fret that America is determined to hold their country down and may secretly support Taiwanese separatism.
The Chinese are also still waiting to see how Mr. Bush will handle the clashing Republican impulses on China, with military hawks and moral critics within his party as strange bedfellows on one side and traditional realists, who favor engagement, on the other. One sharp issue on which the hawks seem to have the upper hand is national missile defense -- a project China intensely opposes, fearing it will make the United States far too arrogant and neutralize China's small nuclear deterrent.
In addition, the possibility that the United States will step back from a cooperative approach to controlling North Korean missiles is considered ominous here. And in his meeting with Mr. Qian on Thursday, Mr. Bush seemed determined to draw attention to the differences between the two countries, including human rights, though he promised to treat China with respect.
The first big test of what Mr. Bush is prepared to do will come as the administration decides what weapons to sell to Taiwan this year. The Chinese have warned that providing America's most advanced naval destroyers, equipped with the Aegis radar system, would cause a serious rift. But in an odd way, this gives Mr. Bush an easy way out. If he punts on Aegis this year, keeping it on the shelf as an implicit potential club, he can still sell Taiwan a group of powerful used Kidd-class destroyers, along with other advanced weapons, and the Chinese, though objecting, will be secretly relieved.
With missile defense, no one expects Mr. Bush to back away from his pledges to forge ahead. But there is a choice of ways to move ahead, some of which could allow China and Russia to feel their own nuclear prowess has not been strategically vaporized.
The Chinese are, of course, hedging their bets, cultivating ties with Russia and promoting Asian economic cooperation as potential counterbalances to American power, and modernizing their military. American officials know that if it feels cornered, China can retaliate by undermining nonproliferation efforts and raising military tensions over Taiwan. 
Even as it pushes for the promised sharper edge in dealings with China, the administration has also shown signs of recognizing the pitfalls of aggressive confrontation -- that American hostility may bring out the worst in this potential adversary. In the end, the Bush administration may well be nudged, a la Clinton, to the familiar mix of broad cooperation and sharp disagreements, with the Taiwan issue never resolved but never exploding either. 
The Chinese mean it when they say their immediate priority is economic development, and much as they hate to acknowledge dependence, they know there is no real substitute for American capital and technology. They also crave Western acceptance as a respectable emerging power. So they can be expected to try, as best they can, to nurture the Bush-pere side of the American president, even as they prepare for the almost inevitable rivalry.

HEADLINE: Spies Will Be Spies 

BYLINE:  By David Wise; David Wise, the author of "Cassidy's Run: The Secret Spy War Over Nerve Gas," is writing a book about the Robert Hanssen case.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Newspaper readers and television viewers over the past few days might have been forgiven for thinking they were caught in a time warp, a throwback to the bad old days of Dr. Strangelove and superpower conflict. The expulsion of 50 Russian diplomats from the United States and Russia's quick retaliation in kind feel like something out of the cold war. But despite all the rhetoric, these actions, at least for the intelligence agencies on both sides, do not signal a return to the cold war. For them, it never ended.
 Nothing on the grand scale of the current expulsions has been seen since 1986, when a round of retaliations began in August with the espionage arrest in New York of a Soviet intelligence agent employed at the United Nations. A week later, Nicholas Daniloff, an American correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, was arrested in Moscow. Over the next two months of tit for tat, 25 Soviet diplomats were expelled from the United States, Moscow ejected five Americans, and then Washington banished 55 more Soviets. 
 But that was during the cold war. Although Mikhail Gorbachev had begun his policy of glasnost, the long-standing tension between the two countries continued. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, many observers assumed that everything would change. It didn't, at least in the intelligence business. The cold war was over, but nobody told the spies.
For a while, the Russian espionage presence in Washington, New York and San Francisco did diminish. Fewer officers of the S.V.R., the successor to the foreign intelligence arm of the K.G.B., plied their trade, although Russian military intelligence was as active as ever. By 1996 or 1997, however, the number of S.V.R. officers is said by senior intelligence officials to have crept back up to cold war levels.
The immediate cause of the current decision to expel 50 Russians was the arrest last month of the former F.B.I. agent Robert P. Hanssen, who is accused of spying for Moscow since 1985. But the Clinton administration and the F.B.I. tried for years, with no success, to pressure Russia to reduce its espionage operations in this country. The Hanssen arrest provided the Bush administration with an excuse to crack down. But there are pluses and minuses to this decision.
Expelling Russian diplomats, many of whom are intelligence officers, will probably cause some disruption of Russian espionage activities in this country, like the use of recruitments or "walk-ins" who might be providing secrets to Moscow. And it will temporarily reduce the surveillance burden on the F.B.I., which has been hard-pressed to watch the spies not only of Russia but of other nations.
This round of expulsions, however, increases the problems of the C.I.A., which has never had as many spies in its Moscow embassy and consulates as the Russians have in this country. Now the agency will lose officers in Russia, thinning its ranks even further. The C.I.A. has traditionally and vigorously opposed mass expulsions of Soviet and Russian diplomats for fear of such reductions. 
By acting forcefully, President Bush is trying to send a macho, tough-guy signal, consistent with other hard-line noises coming out of Washington these days. But with what result? A Russia headed by President Vladimir Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, is unlikely to stop spying just because some of its people are kicked out. In time, new spies will happily arrive to take their places. Washington and New York are regarded as plum assignments for agents in the S.V.R. The F.B.I. can take some comfort in the knowledge that some of the replacements will be new and inexperienced. But many will be old hands, veterans of espionage assignments in other countries. And even new spies learn fast.
The spying will continue, because on both sides the temptation is too great to stop. All countries want to learn each other's secrets, and that desire did not end with the cold war. Presidents -- on both sides -- demand information on which to base their policy decisions, and secret information is highly prized. Intelligence obtained clandestinely has a special cachet. In this country, the S.V.R. targets military, technological, cryptographic, economic and political information. Many of its officers are smooth, sophisticated and well-trained. Russia is willing to pay millions of dollars to its best sources, as Moscow did to Aldrich Ames, its mole inside the C.I.A. who was convicted of espionage in 1994. 
Washington, in turn, maintains a vast intelligence apparatus, estimated to cost $30 billion a year, ranging from satellites whirring overhead to human spies on the ground. In a 1994 speech, then C.I.A. director R. James Woolsey declared frankly, "What we really exist for is stealing secrets." Yuri Kobaladze, the former spokesman for the S.V.R., was equally candid. "There are friendly states," he said in 1993, "but not friendly intelligence services."

Viewing the First Bubble And How It Blew Up

BYLINE:  By Judith H. Dobrzynski 

 BODY:
 Somewhere, Norton Simon, the pioneering industrialist who died in 1993, must be proud. In the 1940's, 50's and 60's, Mr. 
Simon turned a small investment in a failing orange-juice bottling plant into one of the first multinational consumer products conglomerates, with well-known properties like Hunt-Wesson Foods, McCall's, Max Factor, Avis and Canada Dry. Then he amassed a renowned art collection, with masterworks by the likes of Raphael, Cezanne, Picasso and Matisse, now housed in the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif. In both pursuits, he was the quintessential value hunter, searching for undermanaged or underappreciated companies and art. 
 So a current exhibition at his namesake seems both prescient and fitting: "Tulip Mania: Flower Fever in 17th Century Holland," a show of 65 watercolors depicting the tulips available in the 1630's, when their prices soared to unbelievable levels and then crashed and became the classic example of an investment bubble. The show opened on March 1 and will continue until July 23. Judith H. Dobrzynski

The Price of Power

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Welcome to the Cartel California. Last week a report by the Independent System Operator, which runs California's power grid, made it more or less official: the electricity crisis in the Golden State is partly the result of market manipulation by power generators. The report alleges that generators overcharged the state's utilities, which distribute power to consumers, by more than $6 billion over a 10-month period. 
 The report is almost certain to be ignored by federal authorities. But I'll come back to that in a minute. First, there are a couple of things I need to make clear about the report's claims. 
 The I.S.O. is not alleging that pow er generators were part of some vast conspiracy. Actually, I shouldn't have used the word "cartel" in the opening sentence. The generators didn't have to conspire: the logic of the situation made it easy, almost irresistible, for each individual company to manipulate the market. In fact, to believe that the generators didn't engage in market manipulation, you have to believe that they are either saints or very bad businessmen, because they would have been passing up an obvious opportunity to increase their profits.
Imagine the situation: it's a hot summer, and the California electricity market is very tight. You are one of only a handful of major players selling wholesale electricity. Surely the thought has to occur to you: what would happen to prices if one of my plants just happened to go off line? And when companies act on that thought . . . well, you get the picture.
It's also important to realize that accusations that power companies were withholding electricity to drive up prices didn't emerge out of nowhere when the crisis erupted; this isn't a case of politicians suddenly looking for scapegoats. On the contrary, economists were raising red flags about the possibility of market manipulation long before California's woes hit the headlines. Indeed, some economists warned about the issue before California even deregulated: there was clear evidence that "market power" was a problem in Britain, which began experimenting with deregulation and privatization years before the movement came to America.
And the research evidence continues to pile up. Just before the I.S.O. issued its report, the economists Paul Joskow and Edward Kahn circulated a study that found strong evidence that "exercise of market power" played a large role in raising electricity prices last summer. The authors aren't leftists, or even opponents of deregulation. They were merely trying to look objectively at the evidence, which points more or less unmistakably to the conclusion that deliberate withholding of electricity to drive up prices has been an important factor in the California crisis. 
Still, there is every reason to believe that Washington will turn a deaf ear to this evidence. As an article in this newspaper explained on Friday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is supposed to act as the nation's watchdog over the energy industry, lately seems more like a lapdog. I was particularly struck with the report that FERC's staff found that California's power companies "had the potential to exercise market power," but could not conclude that they had actually used that power. As I said, those power generators must be saints, bad businessmen, or both.
What should the regulators be doing? I'm skeptical about proposals to make the generators pay big fines; it's not clear that you could figure out which company was responsible for which part of the problem, or for that matter that the companies were doing anything illegal. What FERC could do is impose a temporary cap on wholesale prices. This would limit the financial damage to California -- the state government is currently spending more than a billion dollars a month to subsidize electricity purchases. And in a market where "exercise of market power" is a major factor, a wholesale price cap might actually increase supplies, because power companies would no longer have an incentive to withhold electricity to drive up its price.
But it's not going to happen. Blame knee-jerk free-market ideology, or the political influence of the power companies (many of which are based in, yes, Texas). Whatever the reason, it is hard to imagine an administration less likely to be sympathetic to California's plight than the one currently in power. 
And if this indifference makes Californians angry, it should.

Grizzlies' Relocation Reveals the N.B.A.'s Fault Lines

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
VANCOUVER is a lovely city to visit, but your typical young basketball professional does not want to play there.
 "Taxes," said Erick Strickland, shipped this season by the Knicks to the Grizzlies and counting down to when he can leave. "Once you're there for 70 days, that's when they really kick in." 
 "Customs," said Bryant Reeves, referring to the consumption of time and not the fear some players would understandably have of encountering a drug-sniffing dog. "One of the bigger hassles." 
There are other reasons, some of the Grizzlies said last week, when they dropped by Continental Arena to lose to the Nets. A black population that is no bigger than Salt Lake City's, a lack of employment opportunity for wives and girlfriends, schools that are different from those in the United States and last, but not least, supermarkets that don't stock brands familiar back home.
Yet it is more than a few bags of M&M's or the threat of having one's marijuana stash uncovered from a suitcase that has doomed half of David Stern's Canadian expansion, setting up the National Basketball Association's first franchise move since Kansas City uprooted to Sacramento in 1985. Michael Heisley, Vancouver's third owner in six years of operation, says he will lose $46 million this season; hence the auction that has had four cities luring Heisley, who must disclose his choice to the league by tomorrow and is said to be leaning to Memphis.
It was in Washington after the All-Star Game last month when Stern announced that he felt Heisley's pain. Unclogging the path to relocation for a franchise that has never won more than 22 games contradicted the commissioner's oft-stated belief that the onus should ultimately be on a team to be worthy of the support it demands for economic success.
Calling Vancouver "a nice place to go for a walk when it's not raining," point guard Mike Bibby also observed, "For us not winning, there's a lot of people at the games -- nine or ten thousand." Too little, too late. Bibby, born in Cherry Hill, N.J., but raised out West, knows the Grizzlies are good as gone. Personally, he would prefer they settle in Anaheim, where they would be squeezing into a region that already has two teams, and the defending champions at that.
None of the projected sites is paradise. Memphis and Louisville are small markets represented by college coaches (John Calipari and Rick Pitino) with big egos. New Orleans didn't support pro basketball during the 1970's. Having grown by six teams between 1988 and 1995, from 23 to 29, the N.B.A. is paying the price for expansion excess, for truly believing it was bound to be a hit wherever it deigned to go.
To put the Canadian push into perspective, ratings for nationally televised games get consistently buried by curling, according to one Grizzlies official. Expansion teams in Minneapolis and Charlotte have become glass houses with cracks in the windows. The viability of Toronto, more multicultural than Vancouver but beset with the same tax rap, may depend on Vince Carter's willingness to spend the rest of his career in a place where great sportsmen compete with sticks. Of the newest N.B.A. teams, only Miami and Orlando have become stable, popular places to play, in part based on the ability to slip 18 holes in after the shoot-around.
Everyone still wants to Be Like Mike, but it's almost laughable when people contend that only another Jordan return can save the onetime marketing miracle. When Sports Illustrated reported recently that His Airness is considering such a move for next season, knees all over the country predictably jerked.
In the unlikely event he comes back, Jordan would undoubtedly lift nose-diving television ratings with the supporting talent his Washington Wizards don't have and are not likely to soon get. But Jordan is past the point of being anyone's panacea. The best thing he could do for the N.B.A.'s long-range recovery would be to get his 38-year-old rump roasted a few times by Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant. Maybe then, people would stop living in the past and blaming developing players and their tattoos and cornrows for everything wrong with basketball, as opposed to the league's bull-market mentality of chasing every expansion dollar and gouging every ticket-buying fan.
It took Jordan seven years and the emergence of Scottie Pippen to win his first title. Magic Johnson and Larry Bird played with Hall of Fame casts throughout the 1980's. Charles Barkley joined a team that had Julius Erving and Moses Malone. Most of today's young stars, with little or no collegiate training, dribble into a stretched-thin league that long ago stopped catering to working-family fans and hitched its destiny to corporate masters and the beneficiaries of the company largess. Now, everyone is running for cover in an economic market being shredded by bears.
Grizzlies alert! Be on the lookout, America, for another bad team.

HEADLINE: For Family in Shelter System, Living From Bench to Bench; 
<SR>WAITING TO SLEEP -- A special report.

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Jamall Roper fell silent as his younger brothers and sister talked about being homeless, stranded in a place where hundreds of families like theirs were trying to get into New York City's shelter system. 
 Day after day, and often halfway through the night, the four schoolchildren and their ailing grandmother had endured the city's Emergency Assistance Unit in the South Bronx, the waiting room for families seeking shelter, or, in the end, just somewhere to lie down until morning. 
 "I slept on a bench that was hard," Paris, 9, said softly. Tara, a second grader, blurted out: "The benches are too little and there are too many families. They didn't have no pillows and this lady had a hundred bags and they stole my brother's Game Boy." 
Homeless families have become all but invisible to many New Yorkers. The public image of homelessness is a grizzled derelict or a deranged bag lady. But this winter, when the nightly census in the shelter system rose above 25,000 -- more than at any time since the 1980's -- the people most likely to need shelter in New York City were, as always, children.
And what those children encounter in the system is often hard for them to understand.
For Paris, the security guards loomed large. "We don't get enough rest, so if there's an empty bench, I sleep on it, and the security guard wakes me up and says, 'Go,' " he said.
Their grandmother and sole guardian, Arlene Cruz, 55, who gathered them from New Jersey foster homes four years ago, now had to try to deliver them clean, fed and in uniforms to their Manhattan public school, starting from a different shelter each morning. Each afternoon they had to return to the din of the unit, to wait for the late-night bus to another bed.
Often the shelter assignment came way past bedtime, if at all. Asked where they slept when no beds or benches were available, even Ronald, the 6-year-old, could answer. "Floor," he said in an asthmatic growl.
But Jamall, 11, an honors student, could not speak. Tears filled his eyes, and he was trying too hard to hold them back.
"He has the best understanding of what's going on," Jamall's school counselor, Alana Reed, said later. "He has a sense of responsibility for his siblings and his nana." 
For families like Jamall's, the Emergency Assistance Unit is the mandatory first step. It is perennially in violation of court orders to enforce New York City's right to shelter, and the city's commissioner of homeless services recently acknowledged that it functions as a kind of gantlet.
"I can't screw the front door any tighter," said the commissioner, Martin Oesterreich, referring to tough screening procedures adopted in 1996 to discourage any parent with a housing alternative from using the shelters as a shortcut to a subsidized apartment.
What that means in practice is usually hidden from public view. Citing privacy, city officials have taped brown paper over the windows of the unit, at 151 East 151st Street, and barred reporters. But the experiences recounted by Jamall and his siblings, and corroborated by city, school and medical records and interviews with the adults in their lives, make the consequences for children hard to miss.
Despite Ms. Cruz's efforts, which were praised by school officials, the children began to miss school or arrive late, exhausted and unprepared. Their grades suffered. The whole family fell ill. And Ms. Cruz began to fear she could not carry on.
"I'm drained, but I've just got to keep going," Ms. Cruz said late last month, as tears slid silently down Jamall's cheeks. "I don't want them to take my grandkids and put them back in foster care."
On the day of that conversation, Feb. 23, the children were together in a temporary shelter apartment in the Bronx, a place with beds and blankets, a refrigerator, even closets where their grandmother had hung 16 crisply ironed school shirts for the week. But Jamall knew that the city had still not ruled them eligible to stay, and that only the last-minute intervention of a Legal Aid Society lawyer had kept them from having to apply for shelter all over again. 
"My biggest worry is that they find us ineligible and we have to leave," he said. "And that they're going to take us from our grandma because we don't have a place to live."

Becoming Homeless
Jamall and Paris vividly remember the day five years ago when New Jersey child welfare workers, citing parental neglect and drug use, took them from their mother, Maya, and stepfather, Ronald Jones, who is Tara and Ronald's father. "I tried to run back to my mom," said Paris, who was no more than 4 at the time, "but they caught me."
Jamall was placed in one foster home, Paris and Ronald in another, where, Paris said, the foster parents beat his baby brother. Tara went to a paternal aunt, then on to foster care, too, when the aunt was called to military duty.
It took their grandmother a year to extract all the children from the foster care bureaucracy. She was then living in rural South Carolina, after raising seven daughters in New York, where she had worked in factories, on switchboards, and for the Federal Bankruptcy Court as a clerk for 13 years. 
New Jersey was quick to end its financial support for the children. And South Carolina, Ms. Cruz discovered, would not grant her even a voucher for child care because she was not on welfare, but was working at a low-wage supermarket job. The total public assistance benefit she got for the children -- $286 a month -- barely covered Ronald's day care fees. 
For three years, Ms. Cruz made ends meet by adding a shift as a hospital aide to her supermarket job and by qualifying for food stamps. 
But when Ms. Cruz's health failed and the car broke down, Jamall realized that their home was about to fall apart.
"My grandma kept getting sick," he recalled. "She had to go to the hospital. She had problems paying the bills and stuff. She said she couldn't take it no more."
Ms. Cruz, who had discovered lumps in her neck requiring tests, hoped to get better medical care in New York, and help from relatives. A daughter, Cecily Pereira, sent her children's father to fetch them all at the end of May last year. But in mid-summer, he was jailed on a drug charge, and by fall, unable to afford the rent on the apartment, Ms. Pereira moved into a much smaller place with another working mother.
Ms. Cruz's efforts to find an affordable apartment failed, despite help from a social service agency in East Harlem, where the children were excelling in school. The children's own parents could not help. The father of Jamall and Paris had recently been released from prison and lives in one room; their mother is in residential drug treatment in Philadelphia. 
Reluctantly, in November, Ms. Cruz's sister Mary Campbell agreed to take in the family over her husband's objections, but only through Christmas.
On Dec. 29, when she insisted that they leave -- "It's too disruptive, too crowded, too expensive and has become overwhelming and a burden," she later wrote to city officials -- they turned to the shelters.

Branded Ineligible
The place where the Cruz family had to wait was full of children who could not freely play, eat or sleep. Some things that happened there are hard for Jamall, Paris, Tara and Ronald to forget.
There was the time in January when Tara and Ronald took ill. "The food had food poisoning inside of it," said Tara, who suffered two bouts of acute gastroenteritis and a case of dehydration, according to medical records. "We couldn't bring no food inside. There was no water fountain."
There was the time Jamall had strep throat and their grandmother caught pink eye. Forbidden to stand in line for meals with other families, they had to wait for city workers to bring them dinner. On the third night, no one came.
"We was quarantined in this little room, and we saw mice running all over the place," Paris remembered. "They forgot we were there. Ronald and Tara started crying because they were so hungry."
Finally, at 11 p.m., just before they were sent to a shelter for the night, Ms. Cruz dispatched Jamall to the deli across the street for $2 worth of ham and $1 worth of cheese. ("No bread," she said apologetically. "I didn't have enough for it.") The children devoured the rolled-up slices standing between the inner and outer doors of the unit, trying to stay out of the wind.
But the worst moment came early the next morning, when they had returned to the unit and a worker started screaming at their grandmother. He was angry that they had fallen asleep on the floor waiting for the quarantine room to be unlocked for them. 
"I just wanted to hit him so bad," Jamall said. Ms. Cruz, who had vowed to keep her dignity as she saw frustrated families fighting over the corner of a bench, was appalled to find herself shouting back.
"I just lost it," she said.
By then they had learned that if they left the unit without a pass, their application for shelter would be thrown out. They had to wait until they were called to board the bus to a shelter, usually so late that the unit's hallways were packed with sleeping families. By 6 a.m., they would be roused by a shelter worker's banging on the door and sent out to wait for the bus back again. 
Their grandmother, whose enlarged heart and hypertension had been duly noted on a medical screening form along with the children's asthma, had to line up for another pass so she could take them on to school, clutching hands and counting heads as they changed subways. 
They began to arrive weary and late to the brightly lighted classrooms of the East Harlem Block School, where each morning students recite the school mission: "to enable every student to achieve his/her personal best performance in all areas of their education and human development." 
In the fall, Tara, now 8, earned a 100 for her wishful account of a family Thanksgiving and a 90 on a report about "A Christmas Carol." By mid-January, when her penmanship became a sleep-deprived scrawl, her grade on an assignment was 70. The children could not enroll in the after-school program. The family's pass from the unit expired at 3 p.m., and they had to hurry back to keep waiting. 
"Last week, Jamall fell asleep several times during class and asked if he could sleep through recess," Ms. Reed, an intern who is the older boys' school counselor, wrote on Jan. 19. "Jamall, who normally shows a tough exterior, has cried through our last two sessions as he described his nights in the shelter and his fears that his family would never have a home."
That was one of several letters Ms. Cruz was given from the school, hospitals and doctors. They were all addressed "To Whom It May Concern," and they all pleaded that the family be given a steady place to sleep.
"If something is not done to help this family," Tara's second-grade teacher, Nyesha Patterson, wrote, "four young lives will be destroyed."
But after days of cycling the family through overnight beds, the city ruled that they were not truly homeless, as it typically does even in applications for shelter that are ultimately accepted. They were, in a word that came to be dreaded by the children, "ineligible."
"If they find us ineligible, we have to start all over again," Paris explained. "We already started over five times. They keep on saying we can go back to our aunt, but there's only three rooms and too much people and the landlord don't want so much noise."
Ms. Cruz tried to challenge the city's ruling on Jan. 22 at what is known as a "fair hearing," held in a Brooklyn office. It lasted five minutes and changed nothing. Directed to re-evaluate the family's application, the city ruled again a few days later that they were ineligible.
"The eligibility of this large family was initially in question," city officials said in a prepared statement last week, but they would not elaborate. 
The family had to start over. At 4 a.m. on Jan. 30, they were still waiting for a shelter assignment when a unit worker announced that the remaining families would get no beds that night. 
It was already morning -- the morning Paris took a citywide fourth-grade reading test, the day Ms. Cruz had a biopsy of the lumps in her neck at North General Hospital, the day before Jamall's 11th birthday.
"It's almost like getting punished for hitting bottom -- something you couldn't help," said Ms. Cruz, who has since been told she needs treatment for a thyroid disorder. "You see homeless people and you feel bad and then you turn around and you realize, 'I'm homeless. I am homeless with all these children.' "

A City's Unkept Promises
On Feb. 13, Ms. Cruz called the Legal Aid Society. She waited on hold for two hours, but it was worth it. After a lawyer called the city on her behalf, Ms. Cruz and the children were placed in a short-term shelter apartment on Valentine's Day, and two weeks later, the city acknowledged that the family was homeless. Under a 1995 court order, in fact, the Cruz family had even been entitled to expedited emergency housing because of their medical conditions. 
"This is a very typical case, and the impact on children is on the one hand appalling, on the other hand, all too common," said Steven Banks, director of Legal Aid's Homeless Rights Project. "There are 5,500 families in the shelter system, and five Legal Aid staff members to try to correct mistakes that the city makes on an individual case-by-case basis." 
That is the reason Legal Aid sues the city for overall relief, he added. 
But the longstanding battle to enforce court decrees seems to have reached a new impasse. Despite renewed promises of compliance made by the city last month, there were families left to sleep on the floors of the unit through 6 of the last 10 nights, including 113 children, city records show. That practice had stopped under pressure from a City Council ban in July 1999, only to begin again last summer. And now, like Ms. Cruz and her grandchildren, most of the applicants are shuttled back and forth to shelters each night -- a practice the city is under a new court order to end. 
Leonard Koerner, the city's chief assistant corporation counsel, said last week that the city was doing the best it could. He cited a recently announced program to add 517 rooms or shelter apartments for homeless families over nine months. But he acknowledged that officials had already fallen short on the first installment, and with the possibility of a recession looming, the prospect for reduced demand seems dim.
A confluence of factors is at work, current and former officials say. Housing costs rose sharply during the economic boom as the lowest incomes lagged, new welfare rules made it harder for poor families to rely on public assistance to help pay rent, and federal housing subsidy programs were cut.
Part of the problem, Mr. Koerner said, is that "doubled-up families living in harsh conditions" see the shelters as the only route to an apartment of their own. 
"There are some homeless people, certainly," he added, "but a lot of them are not truly homeless. You have to have a way of differentiating that or you don't have a functioning program." 
He added: "Over all, it works O.K. It's a very hard situation. I'm not going to say there aren't mistakes made."
Typically, the number of families seeking shelter declines in winter, when children are in school, and swells in summer. This winter, the numbers remained high. Last week, 10,385 children were in the system.
"It's all catching up to them," Mr. Banks said. "All the cuts in housing, the failure to address the gap between rents and incomes, the failure to have an appropriate program for survivors of domestic violence." 
Jamall, whose family is still waiting for an opening in a regular family shelter, has reached his own conclusions about why the system works the way it does. "I think they don't want us to have our education," he said. "Because they don't give us enough sleep to not fall asleep in class."

HEADLINE: Admissions Test Courses Help, But Not So Much, Study Finds 

BYLINE:  By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
A new study by an independent researcher has found that coaching for college admission tests has only a small effect, despite the claims of companies and private tutors who have turned test preparation into a multimillion-dollar industry.
 The study's data, from a national sample of more than 14,000 students, indicated that the average gain from coaching was no more than about 20 points on the 1,600-point SAT test. The study found coaching produced similarly small improvements in English and math for students taking the ACT, a test used by many colleges that do not use the SAT. Coaching actually seemed to have slightly lowered scores on the reading part of the ACT. 
 The findings support the longstanding contention of the College Board, which sponsors the SAT, that test coaching has little effect. But the study, reported in the current issue of Chance, a magazine of the American Statistical Association, had several flaws. The study did not differentiate between intensive and expensive preparation courses that may last for months, and short, even one-day courses. Officials of major preparation companies said this failing called the results into question.
Also, the study compared students who chose coaching to those who did not, rather than randomly assigning students to one group or another.
Still, some experts on educational testing, like Stephen Klein, a senior research scientist at the Rand Corporation who studies educational testing, called the work "very important" and convincing.
More than two million high school students take the admissions tests each year, and 10 percent to 12 percent of them sign up for commercial coaching programs, which may cost $700 to $3,000 for a course or $450 an hour for a private tutor, according to the study's author, Derek C. Briggs. 
Mr. Briggs, a doctoral student in education at the University of California at Berkeley, based his conclusions on an analysis of data in a national survey by the Department of Education that follows a representative sample of students from eighth grade through high school and beyond. Mr. Briggs said he had no connection to any testing service or coaching concern.
Until now there has been no large national study on the subject and few studies done outside the auspices of the College Board or the companies that sell test preparation courses.
Previous studies with designs like Mr. Briggs's have found similarly small effects from coaching. Other studies have sometimes reported far more substantial benefits in coaching, but they also have had serious design flaws, said Dr. Nan Laird, a biostatistics professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, and other academic statisticians who have examined the data. 
Dr. Laird said most of the studies that showed big gains simply compared test scores before and after students were coached. But they did not include, for comparison, the scores of students who were not coached but who simply took the tests again. Retaking itself usually results in higher scores.
While not arguing with the study itself, testing companies said the results did not apply to them.
Seppy Basili, vice president for learning and assessment at Kaplan Inc., a leading test preparation company, said there were big differences between test preparation courses.
"What we've seen over the past 15 years is this huge increase in weekend courses and one-day courses," Mr. Basili said. Kaplan's courses, which cost $800, last three months. "This whole notion of grouping commercial courses with this broad brush causes a problem for us." 
He added that the company's surveys of its students showed that they increased their SAT scores by an average of 120 points.
Though Mr. Briggs's study avoided many drawbacks of previous ones, it was not ideal, said Dr. James Robins, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health, who cited the fact that students were not randomly assigned to groups. As a result, Dr. Robins said, he would not be surprised if the true coaching gain was as much as 40 or 60 points -- or if it was even less than 20 points.
Dr. Robins also said that at highly competitive colleges, any advantage, even 30 or 40 points in an SAT score, could make a difference between being accepted and being rejected.

HEADLINE: Troubling Label for Hispanics: 'Girls Most Likely to Drop Out' 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 24 

 BODY:
Sitting on a leopard-print couch in a house that shudders as planes land at nearby Miami airport, Ady Solis cannot quite put her finger on when her childhood began to slip away. In her pudgy face and nervous giggle, there are still signs of the girl she should be at 16, but just barely.
 Gone are the days when she was simply somebody's little girl, somebody's promising pupil. 
 "I don't feel like I'm a child," said Ady, a Nicaraguan immigrant who dropped out of school last year and lives in Miami with her Cuban-American boyfriend, their 10-month-old daughter and his family. 
"I feel like a grown lady, you know," she said, balancing her baby on her knee. 
Ady is an example of a troubling trend -- Hispanic girls dropping out of school at a far greater rate than any other group of girls in the United States. According to government data, 26 percent of Hispanic girls leave school without a diploma, compared with 13 percent of black girls and 6.9 percent of white girls.
The only group that has a higher dropout rate among all students is Hispanic boys. Thirty-one percent of Hispanic boys drop out, compared with 12.1 percent of black boys and 7.7 percent of white boys. 
In addition, Hispanic girls leave school earlier than all other groups of young people, male or female, and are the least likely to return, according to a recent study, "Latinas in School," published by the American Association of University Women.
The high rate of failure has taken on an added significance with the release of the 2000 census data, which showed that Hispanics were now tied with blacks as the largest minority group in the United States and are expected to become the largest minority group.
As the numbers grow, the Latino population's experience in virtually every aspect of current American life, from education to employment, has ever greater implications for the nation as a whole.
"The demographics indicate that Latinos will very soon be the largest education group in this country," said Gloria Rodriguez, who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton on Hispanic education and is the founder of Avance, a nonprofit family support and education program for Hispanics in San Antonio.
"Many of our children are not succeeding," Ms. Rodriguez said, "and that is going to impact us all."
The gap between Hispanic boys and girls and other students in educational attainment can be attributed to a range of factors, including high rates of poverty and language barriers. But girls in particular face special social and cultural pressures that prompt many to leave school without a diploma. 
"We definitely have a very schizophrenic framework and concept where you have both the Old World model of what a female should be and then that conflicts with the modern-day version, the Americanized version that tells us you can be a mother and have a career," said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida. "There is a lot of confusion and a lot of identity crises going on in the young Latina psyche," Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a former teacher, said. 
Until now, problems with girls have gone largely unnoticed. 
"With the Hispanic dropout rate, people tend to think of macho gang-member guys," Ms. Lehtinen said. "They don't tend to see that Hispanic females are also dropping out." 
Certainly, the majority of Hispanic girls graduate from high school, and those who do not are overwhelmingly new immigrants at the lowest end of the economic spectrum. 
"There are regional differences and subgroups within the Latina population," said Angela Ginorio, co-author of the American Association of University Women study on Latina girls. "It is not a consistent picture across the board." 
But some parts of that picture are stirring concern. And researchers, education officials and families are devoting increasing attention to the high dropout rates for girls.
"There is a high concentration of poverty in this population, and many of these kids start out with disadvantages," said Raul Gonzalez, a former teacher who is education policy analyst for the National Council of La Raza, a nonprofit agency that provides social services for Latinos. In addition, Mr. Gonzalez said: "Many Hispanic immigrants are either economic refugees from Mexico or war refugees from Central America. Thus they come to this country very often with little schooling,"
The result, Mr. Gonzalez and others say, is that more and more poor Latino immigrants often end up in schools where overwhelmed teachers have trouble instructing students who are struggling simultaneously to learn American history and English as a second language.
Carlos Rodriguez, a research scientist at the American Institutes for Research, a nonprofit sociological research organization in Washington, and others cite teenage pregnancy and its attendant cultural factors as contributing to the dropout rate. 
"Low-income Hispanic religious-oriented mothers may still tend not to talk to their daughters about abortion or birth control," Mr. Rodriguez said. 
Ms. Rodriguez of Avance and others point to family demands. They cite the migrant worker who depends on the girls in his family to cook and clean while the men and boys tend to the field. Or the newly arrived immigrant mother who holds two jobs but relies on her older daughters to provide child care for younger siblings. For these families, the experts say, pushing education down on the list of priorities is a matter of survival.
That is what happened with Ady Solis, who instead of doing homework worked in her family's bakery. In eighth grade, she would sneak home after school just long enough to change out of the high heels she was not supposed to be wearing and into the comfortable shoes that would get her through another night of work. The next year, she passed up a school trip to Washington because she felt guilty using money her mother had scraped together. "I wanted to help because my mother was working too much," Ady recalled. 
While the power of economics is indisputable, there is another, less tangible explanation for the high dropout rate. In interview after interview, Hispanic girls cited the problem of mixed messages and expectations. Many girls caught between two worlds with often competing values said they simply give up. 
"Everybody is changing the rules," said Rosa Talavera, a 17-year-old from Kendall, a suburb of Miami, who dropped out when she was a sophomore. "We're supposed to be independent, but you still have that machismo factor in your brain." 
"I mean, in a way I hear that like, 'Be more traditional, be more like those classic girls in Nicaragua who hide behind their skirts,' " Rosa said.
Her mother, a teacher whom Rosa regards as "Americanized," has tried to reassure Rosa that it is all right to want a career and a boyfriend in that order. But her grandmother pleads with her to put on makeup and grow her hair long. Rosa finds the contradiction between her grandmother's wishes and her mother's views confusing.
"Especially for girls who have Hispanic parents and are first generation born in America, it is hard because, on the one side we're hearing, 'You should get married, you should have children and know how to cook for your man,' " Rosa said. "And on the other side of the story, we're hearing, 'You should get a career first.' So it's really hard to grasp what you should be doing."
Vanessa Blanc, an 18-year-old Cuban-American, has been a friend of Rosa's since kindergarten. While she has stayed in school and plans to join the Air Force when she graduates, she says she understands the pressures that drove her friend to drop out. 
"Some teachers do think Hispanic girls are going to end up pregnant and cooking for some guy," she said. "That's the stereotype. That's what they see on TV. That's the image they create in their mind and they can't see beyond that. They don't expand their minds. And the sad part is that sometimes teachers' expectations of students can take them in the wrong path because they feel they won't disappoint anyone by dropping out. It's what's expected of them."
Mr. Gonzalez of La Raza agrees. "We may be inadvertently sending off signals that their education is not as important as becoming a wife or mother," he said.
Rossana Rosado, publisher of El Diario-La Prensa, the Spanish-language newspaper, said that many Latina girls had a limited number of publicly identifiable role models who defy traditional expectations.
"Women are still invisible in corporate structures," Ms. Rosado said, "and Latinas are even more invisible," she said of the difficulty of finding someone to look up to. "The impact of that on young girls is that it is hard for them to visualize themselves 10 years down the line or 20 years down the line. I think at some point when you are 12 or 13 you pretty much realize you're not going to be Jennifer and if you're not going to be Jennifer Lopez then what is there?"
Too many girls feel that there isn't anything beyond Jennifer Lopez, said Mr. Rodriguez of the American Institutes for Research. Mr. Rodriguez, who specializes in issues concerning Hispanic education, said: "Among women who come through Ph.D programs, for example, or the medical profession, or any of the managerial professions, Hispanic representation has not been great. The impact has been the maintenance of stereotypical roles for girls."
Martha Gonzalez, 20, is one who eventually overcame the stereotypes. 
Ms. Gonzalez, who moved to Los Angeles from Mexico when she was 4 and later joined a gang, says she dropped out after some teachers could not remember her name and went so far as to tell her they did not expect her to show up. 
"As soon as you're born, or as soon as you come to the U.S., you're classified the minute they see you," Ms. Gonzalez said. " 'You're Mexican. Let me guess: You're a dropout, you're pregnant.' " 
It was only after a stint working in her family's bakery that Ms. Gonzalez returned to school.
"I had to scrape floors and wash walls, and just do embarrassing things in front of everybody, and I was like, if my own family treats me like this, what makes me think another employer won't treat me like this," she said. "I decided to take myself back to school and just left everything the way it was and walked out of my job." 
Ms. Gonzalez, who is now a sophomore at Los Angeles City College, said she realized that in certain ways she was an exception. 
"There were about two or three of us out of 30 that made it," she said.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK; 
It Looks as if Grizzlies Are Heading for Memphis

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
In the end, the pull of Las Vegas, Disneyland, the Big Easy and even the Bluegrass State were not enough. The N.B.A. is apparently going to Graceland.
 Barring a last-minute change of heart, the Vancouver Grizzlies' owner, Michael Heisley, will recommend to Commissioner David Stern tomorrow that the Grizzlies be relocated to Memphis, according to three people familiar with the franchise's plans. 
 Russ Granik, the National Basketball Association's deputy commissioner, declined comment on Heisley's possible choice until tomorrow. A representative from the office of Andy Dolich, Vancouver's business operations director, also declined comment. 
But two of the three people familiar with the franchise's plans acknowledged that Memphis, emboldened by support from Federal Express, had emerged as the favorite, prevailing in a strong bidding war over Louisville and its main corporate sponsor, the parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Anaheim and New Orleans were also in the hunt while Las Vegas recently fell out of the running. 
"Memphis is pulling away from the pack," said one of the people with knowledge of Vancouver's plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "There are some big-money people stepping up, they have a good arena and they have enlisted some major corporate sponsorship to bring the team there. At this point, I would be surprised if it wasn't Memphis."
Memphis's package was apparently too complete to pass up. It included a major financial commitment from Federal Express, which has its headquarters in Memphis. The founder of AutoZone, J. R. (Pitt) Hyde III, is reportedly heading up a group of investors prepared to buy minority ownership in the franchise. Memphis also has commitments for more than half its planned 70 luxury suites in a proposed new arena. Cooperation from both local government and private citizens has also helped secure the bid.
Heisley, a Chicago businessman who was said to be interested in keeping the franchise within a few hours' flight of his residence, would retain majority ownership, said the people with knowledge of Vancouver's plans. Until a new arena is built, the franchise would share court time with Memphis University in the 20,000-seat Pyramid, a 32-story stainless steel facility on the banks of the Mississippi River.
With the Grizzlies expected to become the first N.B.A. franchise to relocate since the Kings moved from Kansas City to Sacramento in 1985, thus ends part of the league's Canadian expansion dream. The team, which never has won more than 22 games since Vancouver and Toronto began their inaugural seasons in 1995, has already had three owners.
After saying that he expects the team to lose $46 million in Vancouver this season, Heisley was given permission to explore a relocation by Stern in mid-February.
Leading up to tomorrow's extended deadline for a relocation application, Heisley was courted heavily by all four of the leading prospective cities.
Louisville officials boasted that the parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken had offered Heisley $100 million -- $5 million annually for 20 years -- to move the team there, rename it the Kentucky Colonels and have it play in a new arena called the KFC Bucket. 
The Walt Disney Corporation's offer of financial assistance for terminating the team's lease in Vancouver and enhancements for a Grizzlies sublease at the Pond, where the Disney-owned Mighty Ducks of the National Hockey League control the lease, helped Anaheim's cause. 
New Orleans has a new arena, but concerns about whether that city has a sufficient economic base to sustain an N.B.A. team -- especially after it lost the Jazz to Utah two decades ago -- hurt its chances. 
Memphis is the smallest market of the potential new cities, but the lure of a new $200 million arena and corporate sponsorship bolstered by Fed-Ex and AutoZone apparently proved too much to pass up.
"It's safe to say we do expect to receive an application by Monday," said Granik, who attended a meeting in New York on Thursday in which Heisley, Dolich and a team lawyer presented a progress report to Stern.
The relocation application will be investigated by a committee of the league's board of governors, which must make a recommendation to the full board within 120 days of receipt of the application.

Another Schoolboy in Draft
Tyson Chandler, the 7-foot star out of Dominguez High School in Compton, Calif., became the first high school player this year to declare himself an early-entry candidate for this June's draft.
As one of three high school players who may be among the first dozen players chosen, Chandler sees himself following in the footsteps of Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady. He will become the 13th player to skip college and go directly to the N.B.A. in the past five years.
But lost in the news that another teenage prodigy had made the jump was the fact that it was the 30-year anniversary of the actions of the player who genuinely paved the way for Chandler and others before him.
On March 22, 1971, Spencer Haywood won a preliminary injunction against the N.B.A. that eventually went all the way to the Supreme Court. The ruling allowed Haywood, then 20 years old, to play for the Seattle SuperSonics despite not having been out of high school for four years before joining the N.B.A.
Based on Haywood's court battle, the hardship rule was founded. Five years later, the early-entry process was adopted, allowing players to forfeit their college eligibility and declare themselves eligible within 45 days of the draft.
Haywood, in a telephone interview from his home in Detroit on Friday, sounded somewhat bitter.
"Because they call it the early-entry rule, these players have no idea of who I am and the struggles I went up against to allow them to play when they feel they're ready," Haywood said. "I'm not obsessed about it, but it would be nice if someone just said, 'Thanks,' and called it the Spencer Haywood rule. Just like they have the Larry Bird exception and everything else." 
The anniversary comes as the league continues to lobby for an age limit while the players union resists. Haywood is still firm in his beliefs. 
"It's just so un-American to impose an age limit on these kids," Haywood said. "If you're from a deprived area in this country and you're allowed to work in any other profession as a youngster, why not the N.B.A.?"

Human Billboards?
Rasheed Wallace decided against the idea, saying it would ruin the integrity of his existing tattoos. But several other players are continuing to discuss the possibility of using their flesh as human billboards, according to Dakkan Abbe, the president and partner of the Manhattan-based Fifty Rubies Marketing. 
Abbe, who came up with the idea while watching a game, has been speaking with N.B.A. players about putting temporary tattoos of brand logos on their arms. He will not divulge either the prospective players or the product lines, but said he hoped to continue negotiating and developing deals.
The league contends that any such venture would be prohibited by the collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the players.
"How can the N.B.A. mandate what goes on your skin?" Abbe asked. "To me, it's no different than a sneaker contract. To draw the line one place or another is hypocritical."
Abbe appeared to be closing in on several deals when word leaked of his venture. Once word spread and negative publicity followed, Abbe's marketing plan suddenly stalled. 
"I think it's become a cultural issue," he said. "By airbrushing Allen Iverson's tattoos away on the cover of a magazine, the N.B.A. has shown they're not comfortable with that part of their game."
Asked if he had received any negative responses from people outside the N.B.A., Abbe acknowledged he had been deluged with e-mail messages. "Mostly friends," he added. "They basically say I'm ruining sports and contributing to the commercialization of it."

HEADLINE: Political Briefing; 
New Orleans Mayor Asks for More Time

BYLINE:  By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
The New Orleans city charter limits mayors to two terms. But Mayor Marc Morial, nearing the end of his second term, wants to serve three. He says there is still work to be done. 
 Mr. Morial argues that beyond the quaint charm and jazzy fun of the city's world-renowned French quarter, major economic and social problems remain, the most serious being a steadily deteriorating school system. So last week he proposed changing the city charter -- on a one-time basis -- so that he could take care of unfinished business. After that, he said, the two-terms-only limit would automatically be reinstated. 
 Changing the charter would require a referendum. The city council could call a special election and put one on the ballot, but its members (several of them possible mayoral candidates) oppose any change. So do three of every five voters, according to one poll.
Besides, some council members argue, the city's schools are run by an independent school board, not the mayor, though some legislators and community leaders favor changing that.
Mr. Morial, whose poll numbers have been good throughout most of his two terms, insists he will not be deterred.
"We shouldn't be afraid to say it," he said. "The schools are in crisis. It's the defining battle of the early part of the 21st century in this city. Everyone should welcome help. The issue is bigger than any person, personality, entity, enterprise or interest group."
Because the city council refuses to call a referendum, the mayor went on, he plans to put the issue on the next election ballot by gathering 10,000 petition signatures. And if necessary, he warned, he will spend $1 million to see that it passes.
"I want to lead this effort," he said. "I've never started a race and not finished it."

HEADLINE: WAITING TO SLEEP: A special report.; 
For Family in Shelter System, Living From Bench to Bench

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Jamall Roper fell silent as his younger brothers and sister talked about being homeless, stranded in a place where hundreds of families like theirs were trying to get into New York City's shelter system. 
 Day after day, and often halfway through the night, the four schoolchildren and their ailing grandmother had endured the city's Emergency Assistance Unit in the South Bronx, the waiting room for families seeking shelter, or, in the end, just somewhere to lie down until morning. 
 "I slept on a bench that was hard," Paris, 9, said softly. Tara, a second grader, blurted out: "The benches are too little and there are too many families. They didn't have no pillows and this lady had a hundred bags and they stole my brother's Game Boy." 
Homeless families have become all but invisible to many New Yorkers. The public image of homelessness is a grizzled derelict or a deranged bag lady. But this winter, when the nightly census in the shelter system rose above 25,000 -- more than at any time since the 1980's -- the people most likely to need shelter in New York City were, as always, children.
And what those children encounter in the system is often hard for them to understand.
For Paris, the security guards loomed large. "We don't get enough rest, so if there's an empty bench, I sleep on it, and the security guard wakes me up and says, 'Go,' " he said.
Their grandmother and sole guardian, Arlene Cruz, 55, who gathered them from New Jersey foster homes four years ago, now had to try to deliver them clean, fed and in uniforms to their Manhattan public school, starting from a different shelter each morning. Each afternoon they had to return to the din of the unit, to wait for the late-night bus to another bed.
Often the shelter assignment came way past bedtime, if at all. Asked where they slept when no beds or benches were available, even Ronald, the 6-year-old, could answer. "Floor," he said in an asthmatic growl.
But Jamall, 11, an honors student, could not speak. Tears filled his eyes, and he was trying too hard to hold them back.
"He has the best understanding of what's going on," Jamall's school counselor, Alana Reed, said later. "He has a sense of responsibility for his siblings and his nana." 
For families like Jamall's, the Emergency Assistance Unit is the mandatory first step. It is perennially in violation of court orders to enforce New York City's right to shelter, and the city's commissioner of homeless services recently acknowledged that it functions as a kind of gantlet.
"I can't screw the front door any tighter," said the commissioner, Martin Oesterreich, referring to tough screening procedures adopted in 1996 to discourage any parent with a housing alternative from using the shelters as a shortcut to a subsidized apartment.
What that means in practice is usually hidden from public view. Citing privacy, city officials have taped brown paper over the windows of the unit, at 151 East 151st Street, and barred reporters. But the experiences recounted by Jamall and his siblings, and corroborated by city, school and medical records and interviews with the adults in their lives, make the consequences for children hard to miss.
Despite Ms. Cruz's efforts, which were praised by school officials, the children began to miss school or arrive late, exhausted and unprepared. Their grades suffered. The whole family fell ill. And Ms. Cruz began to fear she could not carry on.
"I'm drained, but I've just got to keep going," Ms. Cruz said late last month, as tears slid silently down Jamall's cheeks. "I don't want them to take my grandkids and put them back in foster care."
On the day of that conversation, Feb. 23, the children were together in a temporary shelter apartment in the Bronx, a place with beds and blankets, a refrigerator, even closets where their grandmother had hung 16 crisply ironed school shirts for the week. But Jamall knew that the city had still not ruled them eligible to stay, and that only the last-minute intervention of a Legal Aid Society lawyer had kept them from having to apply for shelter all over again. 
"My biggest worry is that they find us ineligible and we have to leave," he said. "And that they're going to take us from our grandma because we don't have a place to live."

Becoming Homeless
Jamall and Paris vividly remember the day five years ago when New Jersey child welfare workers, citing parental neglect and drug use, took them from their mother, Maya, and stepfather, Ronald Jones, who is Tara and Ronald's father. "I tried to run back to my mom," said Paris, who was no more than 4 at the time, "but they caught me."
Jamall was placed in one foster home, Paris and Ronald in another, where, Paris said, the foster parents beat his baby brother. Tara went to a paternal aunt, then on to foster care, too, when the aunt was called to military duty.
It took their grandmother a year to extract all the children from the foster care bureaucracy. She was then living in rural South Carolina, after raising seven daughters in New York, where she had worked in factories, on switchboards, and for the Federal Bankruptcy Court as a clerk for 13 years. 
New Jersey was quick to end its financial support for the children. And South Carolina, Ms. Cruz discovered, would not grant her even a voucher for child care because she was not on welfare, but was working at a low-wage supermarket job. The total public assistance benefit she got for the children -- $286 a month -- barely covered Ronald's day care fees. 
For three years, Ms. Cruz made ends meet by adding a shift as a hospital aide to her supermarket job and by qualifying for food stamps. 
But when Ms. Cruz's health failed and the car broke down, Jamall realized that their home was about to fall apart.
"My grandma kept getting sick," he recalled. "She had to go to the hospital. She had problems paying the bills and stuff. She said she couldn't take it no more."
Ms. Cruz, who had discovered lumps in her neck requiring tests, hoped to get better medical care in New York, and help from relatives. A daughter, Cecily Pereira, sent her children's father to fetch them all at the end of May last year. But in mid-summer, he was jailed on a drug charge, and by fall, unable to afford the rent on the apartment, Ms. Pereira moved into a much smaller place with another working mother.
Ms. Cruz's efforts to find an affordable apartment failed, despite help from a social service agency in East Harlem, where the children were excelling in school. The children's own parents could not help. The father of Jamall and Paris had recently been released from prison and lives in one room; their mother is in residential drug treatment in Philadelphia. 
Reluctantly, in November, Ms. Cruz's sister Mary Campbell agreed to take in the family over her husband's objections, but only through Christmas.
On Dec. 29, when she insisted that they leave -- "It's too disruptive, too crowded, too expensive and has become overwhelming and a burden," she later wrote to city officials -- they turned to the shelters.

Branded Ineligible
The place where the Cruz family had to wait was full of children who could not freely play, eat or sleep. Some things that happened there are hard for Jamall, Paris, Tara and Ronald to forget.
There was the time in January when Tara and Ronald took ill. "The food had food poisoning inside of it," said Tara, who suffered two bouts of acute gastroenteritis and a case of dehydration, according to medical records. "We couldn't bring no food inside. There was no water fountain."
There was the time Jamall had strep throat and their grandmother caught pink eye. Forbidden to stand in line for meals with other families, they had to wait for city workers to bring them dinner. On the third night, no one came.
"We was quarantined in this little room, and we saw mice running all over the place," Paris remembered. "They forgot we were there. Ronald and Tara started crying because they were so hungry."
Finally, at 11 p.m., just before they were sent to a shelter for the night, Ms. Cruz dispatched Jamall to the deli across the street for $2 worth of ham and $1 worth of cheese. ("No bread," she said apologetically. "I didn't have enough for it.") The children devoured the rolled-up slices standing between the inner and outer doors of the unit, trying to stay out of the wind.
But the worst moment came early the next morning, when they had returned to the unit and a worker started screaming at their grandmother. He was angry that they had fallen asleep on the floor waiting for the quarantine room to be unlocked for them. 
"I just wanted to hit him so bad," Jamall said. Ms. Cruz, who had vowed to keep her dignity as she saw frustrated families fighting over the corner of a bench, was appalled to find herself shouting back.
"I just lost it," she said.
By then they had learned that if they left the unit without a pass, their application for shelter would be thrown out. They had to wait until they were called to board the bus to a shelter, usually so late that the unit's hallways were packed with sleeping families. By 6 a.m., they would be roused by a shelter worker's banging on the door and sent out to wait for the bus back again. 
Their grandmother, whose enlarged heart and hypertension had been duly noted on a medical screening form along with the children's asthma, had to line up for another pass so she could take them on to school, clutching hands and counting heads as they changed subways. 
They began to arrive weary and late to the brightly lighted classrooms of the East Harlem Block School, where each morning students recite the school mission: "to enable every student to achieve his/her personal best performance in all areas of their education and human development." 
In the fall, Tara, now 8, earned a 100 for her wishful account of a family Thanksgiving and a 90 on a report about "A Christmas Carol." By mid-January, when her penmanship became a sleep-deprived scrawl, her grade on an assignment was 70. The children could not enroll in the after-school program. The family's pass from the unit expired at 3 p.m., and they had to hurry back to keep waiting. 
"Last week, Jamall fell asleep several times during class and asked if he could sleep through recess," Ms. Reed, an intern who is the older boys' school counselor, wrote on Jan. 19. "Jamall, who normally shows a tough exterior, has cried through our last two sessions as he described his nights in the shelter and his fears that his family would never have a home."
That was one of several letters Ms. Cruz was given from the school, hospitals and doctors. They were all addressed "To Whom It May Concern," and they all pleaded that the family be given a steady place to sleep.
"If something is not done to help this family," Tara's second-grade teacher, Nyesha Patterson, wrote, "four young lives will be destroyed."
But after days of cycling the family through overnight beds, the city ruled that they were not truly homeless, as it typically does even in applications for shelter that are ultimately accepted. They were, in a word that came to be dreaded by the children, "ineligible."
"If they find us ineligible, we have to start all over again," Paris explained. "We already started over five times. They keep on saying we can go back to our aunt, but there's only three rooms and too much people and the landlord don't want so much noise."
Ms. Cruz tried to challenge the city's ruling on Jan. 22 at what is known as a "fair hearing," held in a Brooklyn office. It lasted five minutes and changed nothing. Directed to re-evaluate the family's application, the city ruled again a few days later that they were ineligible.
"The eligibility of this large family was initially in question," city officials said in a prepared statement last week, but they would not elaborate. 
The family had to start over. At 4 a.m. on Jan. 30, they were still waiting for a shelter assignment when a unit worker announced that the remaining families would get no beds that night. 
It was already morning -- the morning Paris took a citywide fourth-grade reading test, the day Ms. Cruz had a biopsy of the lumps in her neck at North General Hospital, the day before Jamall's 11th birthday.
"It's almost like getting punished for hitting bottom -- something you couldn't help," said Ms. Cruz, who has since been told she needs treatment for a thyroid disorder. "You see homeless people and you feel bad and then you turn around and you realize, 'I'm homeless. I am homeless with all these children.' "

A City's Unkept Promises
On Feb. 13, Ms. Cruz called the Legal Aid Society. She waited on hold for two hours, but it was worth it. After a lawyer called the city on her behalf, Ms. Cruz and the children were placed in a short-term shelter apartment on Valentine's Day, and two weeks later, the city acknowledged that the family was homeless. Under a 1995 court order, in fact, the Cruz family had even been entitled to expedited emergency housing because of their medical conditions. 
"This is a very typical case, and the impact on children is on the one hand appalling, on the other hand, all too common," said Steven Banks, director of Legal Aid's Homeless Rights Project. "There are 5,500 families in the shelter system, and five Legal Aid staff members to try to correct mistakes that the city makes on an individual case-by-case basis." 
That is the reason Legal Aid sues the city for overall relief, he added. 
But the longstanding battle to enforce court decrees seems to have reached a new impasse. Despite renewed promises of compliance made by the city last month, there were families left to sleep on the floors of the unit through 6 of the last 10 nights, including 113 children, city records show. That practice had stopped under pressure from a City Council ban in July 1999, only to begin again last summer. And now, like Ms. Cruz and her grandchildren, most of the applicants are shuttled back and forth to shelters each night -- a practice the city is under a new court order to end. 
Leonard Koerner, the city's chief assistant corporation counsel, said last week that the city was doing the best it could. He cited a recently announced program to add 517 rooms or shelter apartments for homeless families over nine months. But he acknowledged that officials had already fallen short on the first installment, and with the possibility of a recession looming, the prospect for reduced demand seems dim.
A confluence of factors is at work, current and former officials say. Housing costs rose sharply during the economic boom as the lowest incomes lagged, new welfare rules made it harder for poor families to rely on public assistance to help pay rent, and federal housing subsidy programs were cut.
Part of the problem, Mr. Koerner said, is that "doubled-up families living in harsh conditions" see the shelters as the only route to an apartment of their own. 
"There are some homeless people, certainly," he added, "but a lot of them are not truly homeless. You have to have a way of differentiating that or you don't have a functioning program." 
He added: "Over all, it works O.K. It's a very hard situation. I'm not going to say there aren't mistakes made."
Typically, the number of families seeking shelter declines in winter, when children are in school, and swells in summer. This winter, the numbers remained high. Last week, 10,385 children were in the system.
"It's all catching up to them," Mr. Banks said. "All the cuts in housing, the failure to address the gap between rents and incomes, the failure to have an appropriate program for survivors of domestic violence." 
Jamall, whose family is still waiting for an opening in a regular family shelter, has reached his own conclusions about why the system works the way it does. "I think they don't want us to have our education," he said. "Because they don't give us enough sleep to not fall asleep in class."

PERSON: William D. Brouse 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
In Proud Defense of the S.U.V.

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: BROOKFIELD, Wis. 

 BODY:
WILLIAM D. BROUSE, the president of the Sport Utility Vehicle Owners Association of America, sits in a cramped office here amid the beautiful, cherry-wood furniture from his 31-year career as the top lobbyist for Wisconsin's savings and loan associations. In his new job, Mr. Brouse sometimes fields phone calls at least as difficult as those he received during the worst of the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980's.
 Last fall, for example, he heard from a Long Island man whose son had been seriously injured while driving a car that was hit by an S.U.V. The caller demanded to know why people should be allowed to drive the big vehicles if they do not use them for what they were designed -- towing trailers and off-road driving. 
 Mr. Brouse drives a black 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee with no trailer hitch, and he has never taken it off road. "I wouldn't want to scratch it," he explained. 
But he said he did not give an inch in the 20-minute conversation, asserting that Americans have a right to drive whatever kind of vehicle they want. 
"We've always had the freedom of choice in this country," he said. "Unlike some of the calls, the guy was easy to talk to and rational."
With his combative approach to issues involving sport utilities, Mr. Brouse quickly became a favorite of talk-radio programs after he established the association last April. Environmentalists suspect his group of being another front for the auto industry, which has a history of bankrolling "grass-roots" groups to campaign against government regulations. But auto executives say they are not financing Mr. Brouse's efforts, and he says the group is something more unusual: a for-profit trade association.
After decades representing savings and loans at the Wisconsin League of Financial Institutions, Mr. Brouse was pushed into a retirement for which he says he was not emotionally ready: in 1998, as its members disappeared, the league was absorbed by the Wisconsin Bankers Association.
Then 64, and convinced that no trade association would hire him because of his age, Mr. Brouse decided to establish his own. He chose to represent owners of sport utility vehicles because of the criticism the vehicles have faced over safety, fuel efficiency and air pollution, and because he loved Jeeps.
As a sergeant in the Air Force serving in South Korea for three years just after the Korean War, Mr. Brouse ran a telephone wire maintenance crew that used a truck with four-wheel drive. He loved the way that truck could chug up and down hills. But what he really longed to drive was a Jeep, which he was never allowed to use. "The Jeeps were reserved for people of rank," he said.
Four decades later, at the S.U.V. association, Mr. Brouse used some of his retirement savings to hire an Internet designer, who built a Web site, www.suvoa.com, to attract members. On the site, he began a defense of what he describes as a basic American right to drive any type of vehicle.
Over lunch at a Greek restaurant near the association's small headquarters in this Milwaukee suburb, he spoke even more strongly: "A tank would be all right if it didn't claw up the road with the tracks."
He also wants the police to pursue the handful of activists, mainly in San Francisco, who have surreptitiously put anti-S.U.V. bumper stickers on other people's sport utilities.
Mr. Brouse also defied convention in structuring the Sport Utility Vehicle Owners Association. George Constantine, the staff counsel at the American Society of Association Executives, said creating such a group as a for-profit venture, by setting an agenda and then trying to recruit members to support it, was an innovative and rare approach.
So far, the association is not making money. Mr. Brouse charges a membership fee of $50 a year, and in 11 months he has attracted 50 dues-paying members. He created associate memberships for people who fill out the group's survey and join its electronic mailing list but pay no dues; there are 3,200 associates. But there are 21 million sport utilities on the nation's roads.
Mr. Brouse says that his organization is still young and that he is confident it will grow. Other groups for owners of controversial products also represent minorities, but larger ones; the National Rifle Association was founded in 1873 but still represents only 4.3 million of the nation's 60 million to 65 million gun owners. Guns are like sport utilities, Mr. Brouse said, in that they pose no danger if used responsibly.
Like many executives of associations, he has been looking for ways to supplement dues with other income. He has installed a link to a Web site that sells auto accessories; members get a discount and the group a part of the profits from referrals. He also hopes to offer group insurance, automobile luggage carriers and clothing with the association's logo. And he may offer introductory memberships at a reduced rate.
And he acknowledges making two mistakes. One was in relying on the Web to recruit members. "We probably should have done more direct mail and that sort of thing," Mr. Brouse said.
The other, he said, was in not soliciting money early from automakers. He had hoped that once he attracted members, he would draw support from the industry's large lobbying budget.
The auto industry has long provided, for example, most of the money for the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, a lobbying group that opposes any tightening of fuel-economy regulations. The coalition publishes a newsletter and encourages its 32,000 members and 8,000 affiliated organizations, including the Farm Bureau, to send letters, faxes and e-mail messages when Congress considers issues relating to fuel-economy standards. 
The coalition is a taxable but not-for-profit group that occasionally asks members for contributions but does not charge dues, said Diane K. Steed, its president and a top traffic safety regulator in the Reagan administration.
Mr. Brouse does encourage sport utility owners to drive carefully, and he says automakers should make safer sport utilities if consumers will buy them. But environmental and safety groups describe his hostility to government regulations as extreme. "They're only going to be designed properly if there are safety, efficiency and pollution regulations, because these are the cash cows for the industry," said Joan B. Claybrook, who was the nation's top traffic safety regulator in the Carter administration and is now president of Public Citizen, an advocacy group.
Mr. Brouse extols the safety of sport utilities, saying their additional weight provides more protection. But government and insurance industry data shows that sport utility occupants have the same death rates as car occupants, mainly because sport utilities roll over more often.
With his aversion to off-road driving and pulling trailers, Mr. Brouse is not the kind of outdoorsman the auto industry cites in contending that sport utilities should continue to be regulated separately from cars. While Mr. Brouse enjoyed off-road driving in the Air Force, he frugally avoids it now for fear of costly damage.
Auto industry officials also express some wariness about backing an organization that they did not help to establish. Moreover, the automakers see little reason to help someone who is already helping them at no cost. As Brian Wallace, a spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, said, "To some extent, he's got more credibility if he's not supported by the auto industry."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Free 800 Calls? Not Exactly

BYLINE:  By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
A COLLEAGUE who spent seven nights at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers last month discovered at checkout that his bill included $107.06 in telephone charges, mostly in $1.44 bites for dialing "800" numbers on his modem. Mark Pruner, president of Web Counsel, a Stamford, Conn., marketing company, was charged $149.70 at the Westin on Michigan Avenue in Chicago for two calls to Connecticut, 50 minutes in all. "I practically fell over," he said.
 Because he was in a long checkout line at the hotel and was scheduled to lecture in 45 minutes, he paid, which my colleague did not. Mr. Pruner was using a new computer and had not incorporated a local Internet access number to get to his e-mail, so he just punched in his Connecticut access number. He had expected to pay perhaps 60 cents a minute, he said, but could not find an information sheet in his room saying how much. When he asked on checkout, it was $3 a minute. 
 Getting into the Internet on a computer, which involves using a phone line unless there is a high-speed network connection, has only exacerbated the issue of staying in touch, which has traditionally ranked high on travelers' list of concerns. A survey in 1999 of 1,207 randomly selected business travelers found that in rating hotels, respondents put phone service as fifth most important after cleanliness, efficient service, safety and express checkout. The survey, the National Business Travel Monitor, was made by Yesawich Pepperdine & Brown of Orlando with Yankelovich Partners of Norwalk, Conn.
Of the respondents, 75 percent said they wanted free local calls and 70 percent wanted no access charges for long-distance calls placed on a credit card.

Disclosing Rates in Advance
The Federal Communications Commission wants consumers to know the charges before placing calls. Last fall the agency's Enforcement Bureau investigated to see how well consumers were being served by a 1998 rule requiring that people away from home be told in advance what rate they would pay and how to reach a company they usually used. As Mr. Pruner might have predicted after his surprise bill, the answer was rather negative. 
F.C.C. agents across the country made calls from 1,700 hotel and motel telephones and coin phones to see if they got pricing information and access to the carriers they wanted. On Nov. 1, John Winston, head of the Enforcement Bureau, announced that three telephone operator services, USLD Communications, the AT&T Corporation and WorldCom, had signed consent decrees, meaning they agreed to changes without acknowledging wrongdoing. The decrees involved fines of $150,000, $105,000 and $56,000 respectively.
The bureau also issued 97 citations for noncompliance, but without fines. Many were to independent places, but familiar names of individual properties cropped up: Best Western, Econolodge, Holiday Inn, Marriott, Doubletree, Embassy Suites, Sheraton, Motel 6, Ramada, Radisson, Comfort, Super 8. The Sheraton in question was not the one my colleague stayed at; it was in Anchorage.
After the citations, the F.C.C. drew up a guide to its requirements, and the American Hotel Association is distributing it to members, according to Kevin Maher, who deals with telephone issues. 
In boldface, the flier says it is not enough for a hotel to put information about its phone service into the usual tabletop portfolio or even in a drawer; the information, including how to reach other telephone companies, must be posted "on or near the telephones used by guests or the public." The flier also says that guests must be able to dial all three types of access codes: 800 codes, 950 codes and 10-10 or 10-15 "dial around" codes that circumvent the hotels' preferred long distance companies. The government receives complaints about failures on these rules: F.C.C., Consumer Information Bureau, 445 12th Street SW, Washington, D.C. 20554.

Bypassing Regular Lines
It's a jungle of phone charges out there. The hotel industry is in the midst of another cycle of changes as many properties install high-speed Internet access, with a flat daily charge for use. These installations mean that regular phone lines are not used for 800-number calls for Web access of the sort Mr. Pruner made; to the hotels, it means that regular lines are not tied up by callers' computers for hours on end. 
Guests who want to use high-speed Internet links are usually asked to call the desk or sign up on registration to accept the daily charge. They must also have a network adapter, since the high-speed links are not regular telephone lines. A few of the latest high-speed links accept the USB connectors that are found on newer laptop computers; most require Ethernet adapters.
Here are some samples of what a few business chains are charging for 800 and similar calls.
Sheraton belongs to the Starwood group, which includes Westin, Four Points by Sheraton, St. Regis and the Luxury Collection and W Hotels. The Starwood policy applies to the 218 hotels with these names that are owned or managed by the corporation, according to Nadeen Ayala, a spokeswoman. Ms. Ayala said that Starwood policy permits hotels to look at the competition and charge guests either 85 cents, $1 or $1.25 for connecting to "800" numbers. The $1.44 a call that my associate was billed, according to the Sheraton Chicago, represented $1.25 plus a 14.5 percent communications tax levied by the city and Illinois. 
After an hour's duration, Ms. Ayala said, calls to "800" numbers incur an additional charge of 10 cents a minute. The Starwood policy for high speed dataports, where they are available, involves a $9.95 daily charge for use, with a charge of 10 cents a minute after the first hour. 
Hilton has high-speed computer lines in 150 of its 300 United States hotels and 56 of its 140 Embassy Suites. Daily charges for these range from $7.95 to $9.95. The regular phones also have two lines in Hilton rooms, so a modem can use one while the guest talks on the other. Calls to "800" numbers are free if the call is less than 60 minutes; after 60 minutes, the charge is 10 cents a minute. Jeanne K. Datz, director of communications for Hilton, said that Hiltons that wanted to deviate from these pricing policies had to get approval and "a few" had. 
All Marriott brands -- Marriott Hotels, Courtyards by Marriott and Residence Inns -- provide 800-number calls free, according to Roger Connor, a spokesman. High-speed Internet access is provided at 160 of 250 Marriott Hotels now, and should be installed in all by the end of the year. The price is $9.95 a day. Courtyards by Marriott, Residence and Fairfield Inns are scheduled to get these lines too, but no timetable has been set. 
At the hotel properties it manages, Hyatt Hotels charges $1 for 800-number calls that lead to a telephone company. Calls to 800 numbers that lead to something else, like a store or a catalog company or the Internet, are free, according to Angela Sikkema. In Florida, she said, charges for calls to 800 numbers are prohibited, and in Texas, the charge is 50 cents. At Hyatt resorts, guests are charged a flat fee of $10 for all telephone use during a stay.

 CORRECTION:
The Practical Traveler column on March 25, about charges for 800-number phone calls from hotels, misstated the title for John Winston of the Federal Communications Commission. He is a spokesman for the Enforcement Bureau, not head of the bureau.

VERIZON CONTRACT WITH LUCENT

BYLINE:  By Angela Starita 

 BODY:
Verizon Wireless, based in Bedminster, agreed last week to pay Lucent Technologies $5 billion to expand Verizon's mobile phone network. 
The upgrade will enable Verizon customers to reach the Internet through their mobile phones, hand-held devices and notebook computers almost 10 times faster than they currently can. The new technology, called 3G for third generation, will be available by the end of the year. After the announcement, Lucent, which is based in Murray Hill, saw a slight upturn in its stock price, which has dropped 85 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Group Urges City to Develop as Biotechnology Center 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Once a week, Dr. Jeffrey V. Ravetch, a professor of molecular genetics and immunology at Rockefeller University, hops the shuttle to visit MacroGenics, the new biotechnology company he helped to found in Rockville, Md.
 "I would have loved to have had a company up here," Dr. Ravetch said. But with lab space nearly impossible to find in New York, he said, he had to look elsewhere for a home for the company. 
 Scientists and entrepreneurs have long complained that state and city officials have been too slow to recognize the potential that the biotechnology industry holds for the city. Now the New York City Investment Fund, a private effort intended to stimulate job growth, is urging officials to provide at least $100 million in direct subsidies and tax incentives. With that level of public commitment, private industry would be willing to come up with another $400 million, the fund contends.
Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed spending hundreds of millions of dollars on biotech and biomedical research upstate. Legislative leaders have made similar pledges that would include projects in the city, like the science park that the New York University School of Medicine has proposed for city-owned land near Bellevue Hospital Center on the East Side of Manhattan.
But Kevin S. Corbett, the chief operating officer for the state's Empire State Development Corporation, said that academic institutions in the city had not made a persuasive case for public financing of biotech projects.
"If you look at this from an economic standpoint, the downstate economy is extremely hot," Mr. Corbett said. "In Buffalo, Albany and Rochester, the money can go a lot further."
According to the investment fund, about 30 new businesses a year emerge from the city's top nine research institutions, but nearly all of them migrate to other states. The biotech industry in the city consists of only about 35 companies, employing fewer than 2,000 people. And New York State has only 87 of the nation's 1,612 biotech companies.
"There is an opportunity for New York to become one of the the top three biotech centers if we move right now," said Kathryn S. Wylde, the investment fund's president.
What is needed in the next five years, the fund said in a report, is about a million square feet of space at rents fledgling companies can afford. Government aid is necessary, the fund says, because developers would have to charge an annual rent of up to $55 a square foot to make a reasonable profit, far higher than the $25 a square foot that it says start-ups can pay in their first year. 
The lab shortage is not the only reason New York has been left behind. Investors in fledgling companies contend that New York academics are less inclined to seize commercial opportunities than their peers elsewhere. "We have phenomenal hotbeds of expertise here," said Mark Leschly, the managing director of Rho Management, a venture capital company in New York. "But often the people doing it don't want to be part of a commercial setting."
Despite the drawbacks, some developers with experience in biotech are eyeing New York. Alexandria Real Estate Equities, of Pasadena, Calif., a landlord for many pharmaceutical and biotech companies around the country, is planning to open an office in New York and hopes to attract small biotech companies as well as larger pharmaceutical companies from Europe, said Joel Marcus, the chief executive. "There are some pretty big challenges," he said, such as recruiting workers to an expensive city. 
LCOR, a real-estate company that specializes in public-private partnerships and was chosen to develop the commercial portion of Queens West in Hunters Point, recently met with top officials of several medical institutions, including Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Rockefeller University, to discuss including a biotechnology center.
Officials at LCOR said that public support would be necessary for a biotech center at Queens West. "If the region wants a new industry, it needs to be induced," said Peter T. Gilpatric, a senior vice president.
Mr. Corbett of the Empire State Development Corporation, however, said the institutions seeking to build a biotech center at Queens West "have yet to present a coherent case for why they need a subsidy." He cited the Lennox Tech Enterprise Center, a high-tech incubator that opened outside Rochester in 1998. It received state funding, but only after the academic community there united behind it and the private sector showed that it was willing to make a substantial investment.
The only existing biotech incubator in the city is the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Center at Columbia University, which opened in 1995. Columbia is planning to build a second incubator building on a city-owned parking lot next to the center. Mount Sinai Hospital is also eager to put up a new research building that would contain incubator space, officials there said.
And New York University's School of Medicine is leading the effort to build the East River Science Park on city-owned land on First Avenue between 28th and 30th Streets, in partnership with the Veterans Administration, Bellevue, and Hunter College. Last summer, the city's Economic Development Corporation designated the site as a science park. 
State lawmakers say they are eager to help the biotech industry take hold in the city. The State Senate has proposed a $500 million fund to support biotech and is committed to providing $30 million for the East River Science Park, said Senator Roy M. Goodman, who represents the East Side. Last week the Assembly unveiled a plan that includes $125 million in capital funds. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said he hoped that a peer review process, rather than politics, would determine how the money is allocated. 
This kind of help cannot come too soon for Dr. Samuel D. Waksal, the chief executive of ImClone, the city's largest biotech employer, with 120 people at its New York headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Dr. Waksal said his company, which makes anticancer drugs, expected to add 100 employees next year. 
"We're looking in the city," he said. "We don't want to move."

HEADLINE: Dennis Ross's Exit Interview 

BYLINE:  By Clyde Haberman; Clyde Haberman, The Times's Jerusalem bureau chief from 1991 to 1995, writes the NYC column for the paper.

 BODY:
There were moments this past year, Dennis Ross says, when breakthrough peace agreements between the Israelis and the Arabs were tantalizingly, almost maddeningly, close. This was especially true on the Israeli-Syrian front. A deal was just waiting to be sealed. With the Israelis and the Palestinians, well, that was always going to be a tough nut to crack. Ultimately, as everyone knows, peace negotiations broke down in an explosion of violence and a near-total exhaustion of mutual good will.
 Now, says Ross, whose job as "special Middle East coordinator" has been eliminated by the Bush administration, "it's going to take time" to put the shattered fragments back together. The new Bush White House seems to have stepped back from the Israeli-Arab conflict, choosing not to entangle itself in that web the way the Clinton administration did. That's probably wise, Ross says. But as a veteran at this business, he adds a cautionary note: "The Middle East has a way of imposing itself on any administration." 
 He should know. For 12 years, he was America's go-between with the Arabs and Israelis, through two presidents and three secretaries of state. This month, he joined the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research organization. It was time, he decided, to get a life, something he didn't have while shuttling constantly to and from the Middle East. 
Throughout the last decade, Ross stayed in close contact with all the key figures in the conflict. So he has a perspective that virtually no one else can claim. Not everyone may agree with his recollections or his assessments. But nobody sat through as many rounds of negotiations as he. And as he left the State Department at the end of the Clinton administration, he agreed to discuss the critical moments in the peace process as well as the personal traits of the leading figures he came to know so intimately. 
It was, if you will, kind of an exit interview, conducted in the sparely decorated house outside Washington where he lives with his wife and three children. It was also a change in procedure for Ross, who spent years keeping his thoughts largely to himself. This is no celebrity diplomat on the order of, say, Richard Holbrooke. "I prided myself on using a lot of words to not reveal anything," Ross says.
A cynic, or perhaps a realist, might say that years of American mediation in the Middle East produced very little. Washington's main achievement, arguably, was to get the ball rolling after the gulf war in 1991 with an Arab-Israeli peace conference in Madrid. But the blockbuster agreements of the last decade -- the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993 and the Israel-Jordan peace treaty a year later -- were worked out by the parties themselves. 
In the final reckoning, there is no escaping the fact that the big ones got away: an Israeli treaty with Syria and a final settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some would call that failure, no?
"I don't feel I failed, and I'll tell you why," Ross says. "Because the United States is never going to impose an agreement. What we can do is make it easier for them to make really hard decisions. In the end, the failure can never be our failure. It may be their inability to get to where they want to go. But it's much more their doing than ours."
That was true on both the Syrian and Palestinian fronts, he says. Syria, under the despotic Hafez al-Assad, would never even have talked peace with Israel without Washington serving as a broker. And as time wore on, the Israelis and Palestinians, too, kept pulling in the Americans deeper and deeper. "My mere presence was kind of a security blanket for both sides."
On the Syrian track, Ross says, an agreement was achingly close last March. That was when Assad met in Geneva with Clinton, who was carrying peace proposals from Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. It was clear to Ross that all Syria had to do was say the word and it would get back the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau that it lost to Israel in 1967.
"We were down to a couple of hundred meters, basically," he says. Disagreements remained on security arrangements and on a timetable for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan. But those were technical issues, and "there were different creative formulas we could have come up with."
There was only one sticking point. "We basically ran out of time with Assad," Ross says. The Syrian ruler simply wasn't prepared to close the deal. He was also in poor health and may have been more concerned at that point with the question of who would succeed him. Three months later, he was dead. Almost seamlessly, his son Bashar al-Assad took over.
"Assad approached negotiations like a man who was absolutely not in a hurry, as a way to show he wouldn't pay more than he had to pay -- and I think he genuinely wasn't in a hurry," Ross says. "Barak at that point was ready to go. But Barak himself got caught by moving too quickly, because he saw there was more resistance at home to doing this deal than he had anticipated.
"There's so much gamesmanship in negotiations, where if one side suddenly signals it's going to go slower, you have to show you don't need it more. Because if you show that somehow you need it more, they'll think you'll give away more. We got into that."
Why didn't they try again with Bashar? "With Bashar, there was only a limited effort made," Ross says. "His focus was understandably internal. We sensed an interest on his part, but the timing was not yet right."
It was maddening for the Americans to be so close and not succeed. "This is one," says Ross, "where there's a deal waiting to be had."
The Palestinian track is far more complex. But when all is said and done, Ross feels those negotiations failed mainly because they ran into a brick wall called Yasir Arafat.
Barak was prepared to give up a lot, including virtually the entire West Bank and sovereignty over the Temple Mount, the Jewish holy of holies in Jerusalem. He was willing to yield so much that it cost him his job in February, when he lost the election to the more hawkish Ariel Sharon. Some senior Palestinian officials were not blind to the opportunity for statehood that was within their grasp. "I had one Palestinian negotiator say to me, 'If we can't do an agreement under these circumstances, we ought to be fired,"' Ross says.
Those circumstances included the deep involvement of Clinton, who all but begged Arafat to make a deal when he summoned the Palestinian and Israeli leaders to Camp David last summer. Clinton could not keep himself from getting more and more immersed in the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Perhaps that was unwise. The Camp David talks ended up producing little more than a sense that the parties were not ready to deal.
Even before Camp David, Barak was in regular contact with the president.
"Clinton probably spoke on the phone with Barak more than any other leader in the world," Ross says. "Barak liked doing business this way. Whatever was important to him usually led to a phone call to the president, and Clinton made it clear that he was available any time to talk. At Camp David, they met every day that Clinton was there." But the Israeli resisted attempts to get him to talk substance directly with Arafat. "Barak feared that everything he would say would be committing himself, and Arafat would say nothing at all," Ross says.
Clinton's desire to make himself available to Barak may help explain the infamous Marc Rich pardon, Ross suspects. Rich was "never a factor" in the peace talks, he cautions. Nevertheless, a senior Israeli negotiator, Uri Savir, approached Ross in 1995 "to say that a man named Marc Rich was prepared to generate several billion dollars for development in the West Bank, but he had some problems with the United States government and needed some help for easing restrictions on travel."
When Ross learned that Rich was a fugitive, "I told Uri to forget it and that any other questions or requests should go through legal channels. Needless to say, none of the money was ever forthcoming for the West Bank, and after 1995 I never heard of Rich again."
That is, until the final days of the Clinton White House. "The president did not discuss Rich with me, and I thought nothing of it," Ross says. But Barak had begun to make several requests of Clinton, including new aid and pardons for the convicted spy Jonathan Pollard and for Rich. "I believe the president found it difficult to respond to many of Barak's requests," Ross says, "and I believe that he may have acted on Rich because he wanted to be responsive in at least some way to Barak."
Many feel that with the peace talks Clinton was desperate to build a legacy, something to counter the taint of impeachment and the Monica Lewinsky scandal. (Marc Rich had not yet become a household name.) That isn't how Ross sees it. "Whatever anyone says about legacy, I honestly think it misses the boat." Clinton came to believe fervently in the peace process, especially after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was killed in 1995 by a right-wing Jewish fanatic. "That had a searing effect on Clinton," Ross says, "in terms of his own sense of obligation and responsibility."
But always there was Arafat, "an interesting complex of impulses and considerations and concerns -- and fears." In general with Arafat, Clinton did more talking than listening, according to Ross, because "Arafat would reveal little about what he could do and not do. Arafat was long on complaints but short on prescriptions.
"At Camp David, the president made impassioned attempts to move him, explaining what he stood to gain and lose. Arafat either would say he needed to think about it or, especially on Jerusalem, he would say he could not accept the idea, even when the idea was deferring Jerusalem and agreeing on everything else."
Ross is convinced, though he knows many will scoff, that "in his own heart of hearts" Arafat wants peace. "But I have come to the conclusion that he is not capable of negotiating an end to the conflict because what is required of him is something he is not able to do. It's simply not in him to go the extra yard." It isn't that Arafat made no concessions, Ross says, even if it may have looked that way to outsiders. But whatever he offered fell way short of Barak's minimum needs.
"Is it because Arafat is basically a revolutionary who can start the process and lay out a certain direction but can't be the one to end it? Is it because he has defined himself by struggle? I've often thought that maybe he wants to be the last revolutionary on the Palestinian side."
And there is no escaping the fact, Ross says, that Arafat hasn't prepared his people for peace. Israelis are not blameless, either. They have generally been indifferent to Palestinian economic suffering and to their frustration over indignities like checkpoint searches, property confiscations and settlement expansion.
But the failings of the Palestinian leadership loom larger for him. Arafat and his aides, Ross says, "constantly socialize hostility." By that he means that Palestinian newspapers stoke a limitless sense of grievance. Textbooks continue to teach hatred of Israelis. Arafat's soldiers run training camps where youngsters are taught to fight the enemy, Israel. Arafat himself has challenged core Jewish beliefs, even claiming there never were Jewish temples on the Temple Mount.
"I'll tell you," Ross says, "when that was first raised, I said to Arafat: 'Forget it. You're going to deny the essence of their faith? No one will accept it on our side. The president of the United States knows the temple was there, and if you proceed that way, what you will tell him is that you are not serious."'
Barak, for Ross, was a fine strategic thinker, and courageous. "But he alienated everybody around him, basically because he didn't trust anybody. He is someone who felt he knew best, that if he thought something was reasonable, ipso facto it was."
Interestingly, more hawkish Israeli leaders fare better. Take former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He may not have been what anyone would call a flaming peacenik, but, Ross says, "he had ambitions that were grandiose. He compared himself to the great leaders who had come before. He would cite Ben-Gurion. But he never quite decided how he would proceed. On the one hand, he wanted to move ahead and achieve peace. On the other hand, he was very mindful of his right-wing base. It was kind of a constant struggle."
Bibi as a wannabe dove. Doesn't that fly in the face of accepted wisdom?
"Well," Ross replies, "I spent a lot of time with him."
As he has with Ariel Sharon, the new prime minister.
"He can be very practical," Ross says. Sharon understands Palestinian grievances. "He also understands that the Palestinian Authority is not going to go away. And he understands that he's not going to be able to coerce the Palestinians into submission. He's going to have to find a new way to deal with them."
Not surprisingly, Ross gives his heart to the old Labor Party lions who made the 1993 Oslo accords happen, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. Never mind that many dismiss Peres as a hopeless utopian, with all his talk of "a new Middle East." To Ross, Peres is "a visionary."
And the martyred Rabin, the warrior turned peacemaker, is irreplaceable. "I found him larger than life," Ross says. "He was such the embodiment of Israel, and his experience so mirrored the experience of Israel that he had inherent credibility."
The "experience of Israel" looms large for Ross, so much so that it became an occasional factor in the peace talks.
He is Jewish, though his religious training was almost nonexistent when he was growing up in Marin County, Calif. His Hebrew is less than functional (and his Arabic is even worse). But with time, his sense of his Jewishness has deepened. When not on the road, he regularly attends Sabbath services at a local Conservative synagogue -- in addition to playing forward on its basketball team.
"My Jewishness has added to my sense of mission," he says. And he is an ardent supporter of Israel, where he has vacationed with his family. "I don't believe you'll ever produce peace in the Middle East," he says, "if Israel isn't strong and if there isn't a strong relationship between the United States and Israel."
But in his line of work, those feelings create complications. His land-for-peace formulas are anathema to Jews with absolutist views on Israel's right to disputed lands in the West Bank, Gaza and, of course, Jerusalem. When Ross started as a peace negotiator in 1989, Bush the elder was president and James Baker was secretary of state. In 1991, Bush and Baker unceremoniously shoved a recalcitrant Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to a peace conference with the Arabs in Madrid. At Baker's side were three lieutenants: Ross, Aaron Miller and Daniel Kurtzer. All three were Jews. "Baker's Jew boys," they were called at one point by Shamir's chief of staff, Yossi Ben Aharon.
With the Palestinians, too, Ross's religion sometimes got in the way, though not often, he insists. Some hard-liners pegged him as hopelessly pro-Israel. Ross feels those attacks had more to do with his being an American than a Jew. It was business, not personal, except maybe when Arafat challenged Jewish history on the Temple Mount. That, Ross took personally. 
Jewish, not Jewish -- it's not nearly as important in negotiations as maintaining credibility, he says. "One thing a negotiator has to be is authentic. You have to be who you are."
He felt that he was always true to that rule, which came with this corollary: never bluff. "You can threaten, but you better be very prepared to carry out your threats." In early 1997, at a difficult moment in talks on an Israeli troop withdrawal from Hebron in the West Bank, he threatened to walk out. "After we closed it, I was asked if I really intended to leave," he says, "and I said, 'You bet."'
Most of all, any high-stakes negotiation requires a real deadline -- it has to be believed." Then why didn't that work with Arafat? He faced several real deadlines. Clinton's White House days were numbered, and Arafat knew that Barak would almost surely lose the election to Sharon. 
Ross shrugs. "Arafat is someone who will never make a decision before he has to," he says. "He always moves one minute to midnight. One of my great concerns was that he was misreading the clock."
So what lies ahead? Eventually, Ross says, Israelis and Palestinians will sit down once again to talk peace. Simple geography says that they have no alternative. And he believes that proposals set forth by Clinton -- the Israelis' compromising on sovereignty over Jerusalem and the Palestinians' giving up an absolute "right of return" for millions of refugees -- will inevitably form the basis for any settlement.
But the Bush administration's inclination to step back from the conflict is probably correct right now, he says. The recent swing through the Middle East by the new secretary of state, Colin Powell, suggests that a good deal more than an occasional American drop-in is needed to "transform the psychology of the region."
This is a time for soul-searching and truth-telling, Ross says. "Each side is not really seeing the needs of the other." The Israelis must "overcome this sense of indifference" to Palestinian suffering. "You can't stick your finger in their eye and expect that they're going to say, 'Fine,"' he says.
But the Palestinians, indeed the Arabs in general, may have the tougher climb. "One thing that has to happen in the Arab world is a good deal more truth-telling about what it takes to do an agreement," Ross says. "The concept of land for peace is always presented as a slogan. But where is the Arab side of the peace? It's not land for nothing. It's always talked about what the Israelis have to do, but it's never talked about what they have to do."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 3-25-01: The Ethicist; 
I Spy Inc.

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
Is it ethical to call your competitors posing as a potential customer in order to get information? Most of the information is available to anyone who calls; we're simply not identifying ourselves as the competition. -- Joel O'neill, San Francisco
 The Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals has a code of ethics that permits acquiring publicly accessible information through patent applications or annual reports, for example, but prohibits misrepresentation. So no false mustache, no fake French accent, no posing. Critics of such professional associations might charge that they are little more than public-relations operations whose purpose is to make spying palatable. But in this case, the group's guideline is a reasonable one. (Whether it is widely followed is another question.) 
 In addition, the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 made it a federal crime to steal an American company's trade secrets, like the formula for Coca-Cola or how Julia Roberts gets so many dozens of teeth into that fabulous smile. (Assuming the Roberts dental magic is a "trade secret," which it is not.) Thus, you may walk into any store and ask, "How much is that doggy in the window?" You may not break into a lab and rummage through the files to learn, "How did you bioengineer that doggy in the window?"
When my boyfriend and I rent a car, the way he follows the requirement to "return the car with a full tank of gas" makes me uncomfortable. He has me sit in the driver's seat and call out when the gas gauge just touches the "full line," hoping that this is gallons -- and dollars -- away from a full tank. He says he has no way of knowing that he received the car with a truly full tank. Is he right? -- Eric West, Washington
He is right on paranoia, wrong on ethics. The rental agreement he signed says fill the tank, not refuel until the semiaccurate gas gauge registers something vaguely fullish. His obligation is unambiguous.
It is true that he can't know if the car's previous renter topped off the tank, but that does not justify tailoring his own conduct to match that of the worst-behaved members of society. He also can't know if other drivers are carrying weapons, but he really ought not mount a machine gun on the roof of the rental car. (For one thing, he'd scratch the paint; that can be a pricey repair.) That there are petty scoundrels among us does not preclude the duty to behave honorably.
Every year my in-laws celebrate Christmas with my son a week early so that they can spend the real Christmas with their daughter's children in Atlanta. They spend the night and pretend it's Christmas Eve, and the next day we all get up early and pretend it's Christmas Day. I feel this is not fair to my son.
Am I wrong? -- M.B., New York
Lying to a child is always unfortunate, and in this case it is particularly ludicrous and unnecessary. Kids love celebrating early and often. Tell your in-laws that you welcome their festive visit but prefer that your son know the actual date (thus sparing you the tricky theological problem of explaining why Jesus' birthday comes twice a year but your son's just once). I suppose you should be grateful that they visit only a week early and not six months in advance -- it's so hard to get that artificial snow to stick to the ground in June. You may want to warn your in-laws that I will run this traditional holiday question in March (avoiding the Christmas ethics rush) and not pretend that this is a December issue of the magazine.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Full-Court Press Fails Again in Hempstead 

BYLINE:  By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
In his toughest election contest to date, James Garner, a Republican, beat back a strong challenge from Hezekiah Brown, a Democrat, on Tuesday to win a fourth term as mayor of the Village of Hempstead.
 Senator Charles Schumer, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, and the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, all campaigned with Mr. Brown, and Senator Hillary Clinton called in at a rally in Mr. Brown's behalf. 
 Mr. Garner said the Democrats "came after me like a ton of bricks." "It was like David versus Goliath," he said. "I ran against the State Democratic Committee. They put a ton of money into this race. But this was a campaign about people helping people, and as a result we came together for the good of the community."
Mr. Garner pointed out that he ran on a slate with three others, two seeking trustee seats and an incumbent trustee, Lance D. Clarke, seeking a judgeship. All three also won, and Mr. Clarke became the first African-American to win a judgeship in the village's 358-year history.
The day after the election, Mr. Brown said he was stunned by Mr. Garner's winning by 802 votes out of more than 5,400 cast.
"We can't figure out how it happened," said Mr. Brown, 62, a village trustee who pledged to cut taxes after what he said had been a 129 percent increase in village taxes during Mr. Garner's 12-year tenure.
Mr. Garner, 55, stressed the economic development that has taken place in the village, including a new Long Island Rail Road station in Hempstead, a new Home Depot and the development of the Times Square Commons, a shopping plaza.
Although Mr. Garner is a vice-chairman of the Nassau County Republican Committee, he ran on the Independence and Unity parties in a village that has a 2-to-1 Democratic registration. Lawrence Aaronson, chairman of the Nassau County Democratic Committee, said local issues and not the county's financial problems determined the election.
"In prosperous times, people don't have the same anger to throw out the incumbent unless there is an overriding local issue," Mr. Aaronson said. "There was no local issue that resonated with the residents."
In another contested mayoral race, James Nevile defeated John O. Maher by one vote in the Village of Baxter Estates. Mr. Nevile received 125 votes to Mr. Maher's 124. Mayor John H. Weaver, who withdrew from the election for personal reasons after the paper ballots were printed, received 10 votes.
The winners of some other contested village mayoral races were Peter T. Imbert in Amityville, Richard Goodwin in Brookville, James Altadonna in Massapequa Park, Claudia Moyne in Sea Cliff and Daniel P. Petruccio in New Hyde Park.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS/for NANCY F. KOEHN; 
An Information Age Led by Business, So Far

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
BUSINESS has scored a number of regulatory victories in recent weeks. Early this month, Congress voted to repeal ergonomics standards meant to protect workers from repetitive strain injuries. In an abrupt turnabout, President George W. Bush last week reversed a campaign pledge to limit power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide. And this week, the Environmental Protection Agency canceled a plan that would have reduced the allowable amount of arsenic in drinking water by 80 percent.
 Those moves, which coincide with other signs that the change in the White House will mean more business-friendly policies -- like the opening of the Alaskan wilderness to oil drilling -- appear to point to a new political climate for corporate America. Nancy F. Koehn, a business historian at Harvard University and the author of "Brand New: How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers' Trust from Wedgwood to Dell" (Harvard Business School Press), takes a broader view. Last week, she talked about what comes next. JULIE FLAHERTY 

Q. Why are we seeing an expansion of the rights of businesses now? Is it more than just a friendlier government?

A. We've seen business become more prominent in the life of the country for some time. It is not brand-new to the Bush administration. An administration can accelerate that perception, but the fundamental drivers of what is going on transcend the White House.
What we're seeing is an inflection point in the history of capitalism as the information age takes hold. Business is leading that transformation. We're seeing businesses experiment with trying to exploit, trying to take advantage of and, over the next few years, make profits from the possibilities of the information age.
Those are Chapters 1 and 2. Coming chapters will be about other actors responding to business initiatives. It will be about workers, politicians and voters making the information age their own, regulating and trying to exert more control.

Q. Are there historical parallels that we should be examining for insight into what happens next?

A. The late 19th century is a perfect analogue. People perceived the country to be ruled by business and what business wanted. If we look back to the second industrial revolution, you think about someone like John Rockefeller and the birth of oil refining. That industry was not initially very regulated.
But as industrialization took hold, a whole lot of other people got in the game. The formation of what would become the A.F.L.-C.I.O. meant the acceleration of the unionization movement. The Sherman Antitrust Act, and others before it, initiated large-scale government regulation. A whole range of social and political movements was formed against what people saw as too much business power. 
I believe we will see extraordinarily vibrant responses on the part of workers and government to the new imperative of the information age over the coming three to six years. It could be a new form of collective action on the part of workers or new policies on intellectual property rights on the Web. It could be anything from sales taxes on electronic commerce to new standards in the workplace, because the workplace itself is changing so rapidly.

Q. Is there some opportunism at work here, with businesses seizing on signs of economic weakness to claim they need more flexibility, less regulation and so on?

A. Businesses, like workers, like politicians, will take advantage of any window of opportunity. That's the nature of the system we live in, economically and politically. Some business people perceive that window now.
But business is hardly monolithic. Almost all the executives I talk to say they have not lived in a more confusing moment. Some signals seem very robust and others seem to point toward a real economic downturn. They wonder: What does that mean for pursuing competitive advantage? For motivating and retaining your most valuable workers? Or, if you're a young enterprise, staying afloat? I do not think this is a moment when most business people are sitting back, rubbing their hands and saying, "Great, let's go for the gusto." 

Q. How much of a backlash will there be from voters, employees and consumer groups?

A. The importance of the stakes involved and people's perception of those stakes are critical determinants. How intensely do people care about the issues? When the economy is very good and people perceive that a rising tide is lifting their boat, a whole bunch of issues can be diluted in their importance. When the tide is no longer rising so fast, people take a different look.

Q. If the stock market continues its downturn, will people view business more critically? Will it affect whether business can keep winning in Washington?

A. The jury is out on that one. We've not been through a moment in history in which the economy was potentially turning downward and so many people were so involved in the stock market. The huge boom market of the 1990's drew in a lot of people. They are not only buying and selling stock, but thinking and talking about the market as part of their daily calculus. How will that affect people's actions in the workplace, in the polling booth? We don't really know that yet.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Technology Tests the Strength of the Fed's Magic Wand

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
EVEN though Alan Greenspan disappointed investors last week by cutting interest rates by only one-half of a percentage point, rather than three-quarters, most Americans still view him as the man who can save markets with a wave of his baton. 
 Mr. Greenspan first earned the maestro moniker by ensuring that the 1987 stock market crash did not cause a recession. He cemented it with forceful interest-rate cuts in 1998, after the Russian financial collapse. 
 Paradoxically, at least one economist says, as Mr. Greenspan's eminence grew in the 1990's, his ability to manage the economy with monetary policy diminished. That economist, James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, thinks that investors may be even more disappointed in coming months when the Federal Reserve's actions do not produce a quick economic rebound. 
Some market strategists have fretted recently that Mr. Greenspan did not cut rates soon enough to remedy the slowing economy. But Mr. Paulsen's work suggests that the problem may lie with the monetary policy tools themselves and the nature of today's economy. 
Mr. Paulsen studied the impact that the Fed's two major policy tools -- changing the Federal funds rate and managing the growth in the money supply -- have had on economic growth over the last 40 years. 
For decades, both had demonstrable economic impacts. Growth in the money supply translated to growth in the economy. And changes in the Fed funds rate had an inverse effect on the economy, with a lag, of course. When rates were raised, economic growth subsequently fell, and when rates dropped, the economy did better.
All of that changed in 1990. Since then, the relationship between real economic growth and changes in the money supply and Fed funds rate has virtually disappeared. 
Mr. Paulsen thinks that the shift has much to do with the dominant role that technology plays in the economy today. While interest rates have huge impact on the fortunes of manufacturing companies, and on sales of cars and housing, the success of technology companies has everything to do with new product introductions, he said. Interest rates have less of an effect. 
"Although the Federal Reserve traditionally has had strong influence on the economic cycle, this suggests that coincident with the substantial growth in the technology sector, the Fed's ability to manage the economy has been greatly reduced," Mr. Paulsen said. "Greenspan gradualism has worked so well for him. You wonder now if gradualism is the appropriate policy."
Even though Mr. Greenspan has cut rates by one and a half percentage points recently, Mr. Paulsen points to another reason why more aggressive easing may be required. Banks' willingness to lend has plummeted, according to the most recent figures from the Fed. The percentage of large and medium-sized banks that are willing to make business loans has fallen below the level seen during the recession of 1990. 
This unwillingness has to do with the fact that long-term bond yields are not sufficiently higher than short-term yields. Banks, which charge rates based on long-term yields and borrow based on short-term yields, have lower profits than they would have if long-term yields were higher. "It used to be, when the Fed would ease, long yields would come down less," Mr. Paulsen said. "Now, long yields fall first."
A result? "They've lost a big piece of the ammunition that makes Fed policy work," he said. "They might have to be more aggressive than they're used to."

Advanced Online Banking, Born of Necessity

BYLINE:  By DAVID LIPSCHULTZ 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
RODRIGO ABREU has not been inside a bank here in more than three years. He has not written a paper check for any regular expense in nearly that long. For almost half a decade, Mr. Abreu, now 30 and a technology executive, has made every kind of scheduled payment through the Internet arm of his bank, Banco Itau. 
 He is paying car insurance, buying stocks and conducting e-commerce through the bank's Web site. His 68-year-old mother and all his other family members are also doing most of their business transactions online. The same goes, he said, for "absolutely everyone I know here." 
 Advanced Internet technology is not generally associated with Brazil, where a vast majority of the population of 171.2 million has no online access. But when it comes to Internet banking, the country is a leader.
"I definitely would put the major Brazilian banks in the very elite in the world of online banking," says Virginia Philipp, an analyst at Tower Group, a research organization based in Needham, Mass., that covers financial services and technology. "Banks across the world look to them as models." 
It was Brazil's dire economic problems that helped pressure major banks -- Bradesco, Unibanco and Banco Itau -- to build advanced electronic payment systems that formed the backbone of the Internet services they offer today. 
In the early 1990's, Brazil's economy faced such inflationary pressures that the currency, the real, would sometimes lose 3 percent of its value in a day. In grocery stores, shoppers heard announcements that the price of bread had just gone up. To combat the hyperinflation, banks built communications systems to clear checks and allow their customers to pay bills as soon as possible. That helped the customers avoid losing money during processing. 
"We were able to cash checks within 24 hours when the U.S. banks were still taking nearly a week," said Milton Monteiro, who is vice president and is in charge of Internet banking at Banco Itau. "We had to be very efficient." 
By 1993, each major Brazilian bank had built a complex private network so that when a customer's paycheck came in, it was cleared overnight and moved into an account that was hedged against inflation. Home banking was coming into vogue and people were already dialing directly into the banks' networks to move money and pay bills instantly. In the United States, meanwhile, manual check processing and human bank tellers were still the norm. 
BY 1996, as the Internet began to take hold, the Brazilian banks not only had their own networks in place but also had the back-office support to advance quickly into online banking.
"In 1998, when U.S. banks were just trying to figure out the Internet, Brazilian banks were well ahead with a huge range of offerings," Ms. Philipp said. 
While many United States banks, like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, are certainly catching up with the range of their online offerings, Bradesco, Banco Itau and Unibanco still have a wider array of Internet services. Brazilians can complete basically any type of financial transaction through the banks' Web sites. Banks offer e-commerce portals, advanced business-to-business services, brokerage services, direct deposit and bill-paying, all integrated into their Web sites.
In fact, under a bill-paying standard now used in Brazil, bank customers can simply type in the bar code number of any bill; the bank immediately knows its amount and pays it upon request.
"When I lived in the U.S., I definitely found myself doing things I had almost forgotten about, like writing paper checks and going to a physical bank branch," said Mr. Abreu, who lived alternately in Palo Alto, Calif., and Brazil from 1998 until last year. 
Brazil's advances in Internet banking, however, do not necessarily reflect technological backwardness among American banks, which for many years operated under far more stringent restrictions about the breadth of their operations. Brazilian banks have long been free to offer both commercial banking and brokerage services, unfettered by regulations that only recently were relaxed in the United States with the end of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act. 
"Because of Glass-Steagall, we've definitely had to go slower," said Dan Hilken, senior vice president for investments at Wells Fargo. 
But the economic crisis was a big factor in prompting Brazil's banks to act faster than their counterparts in Europe and the United States. 
"We built up Internet banking not because it was fashionable like in the U.S., but because it created serious value to the customers and thus the bank," said Candido Leonelli, who is in charge of Internet banking at Bradesco, Brazil's largest private bank.
The relatively long history of online banking in Brazil is seen in its acceptance by customers. Bradesco says that 22 percent of its customers bank online, while Banco Itau says its figure is 25 percent. That compares with 15 percent at Wells Fargo, a leader in United States online banking. 
Those numbers alone, however, do not tell the whole story, because only about 4 percent of people in Brazil even have Internet access, compared with about 50 percent of people in the United States. That means that among Internet users, vastly higher percentages of Brazilians are banking online. 
ACCESS, however, could be the biggest obstacle in expanding the country's Internet banking culture. After figuring in the cost of a computer, its accessories and an Internet service provider, online access can cost more than $1,500 in Brazil -- more than one-third of the $4,200 annual income of the average Brazilian, the World Bank estimates. So even though analysts estimate that Internet access in Brazil will triple over the next three years, the banks will soon encounter a firm ceiling.
Banks are starting to offer financing for computers and sponsoring free Internet access in an effort to put more people online. Even so, with 17 percent of the population making less than $7 a day, it is likely that many Brazilians will not be able to take advantage of the country's banking technology. 
"Finding a way to get everyone access," Mr. Leonelli said, "is definitely one of our biggest challenges."

A Slump That Won't Stay Home

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE 1990's in Washington were mostly about keeping the good times rolling and, in pursuit of that goal, stabilizing nations around the world so that their tremors did not bring America's boom to an early and unhappy end. 
 That was the theory behind bailing out Mexico in 1995, building firewalls around the Asian markets and coordinating a global response to Russia's 1998 economic crisis. 
 But George W. Bush has inherited a very different world.
The economy that investors and global leaders are worried about now is America's own. "Contagion" is no longer the right word for it, because the worry goes far beyond the fear that the Nasdaq's pneumonia might spread to markets abroad. This time the economic connection is direct: For the past eight years, the United States has been the world's largest importer -- the source of demand for Chinese toys and European airplanes and Latin American foodstuffs, and it has also been a huge provider of the billions and billions in capital that have helped emerging democracies thrive. 
Now American consumers aren't consuming at anywhere near that rate. In boardrooms across the country, chief executives are delaying or killing investment projects around the globe. If one of the joys of a global economy is the speed with which prosperity can spread, one of the terrors is that trouble travels just as fast.
Particularly when there is no one to take up the slack. After all, as the No. 1 economy slows down to zero growth -- if America is lucky -- the No. 2 economy, Japan, is in a simultaneous fiscal and political crisis. President Bush alluded to the problem in the most generic way as he sat next to Japan's politically crippled prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, in the Oval Office on Monday. Together, he noted, "we represent about 40 percent of the gross domestic products of all the nations added up." What he might have said is that when the two whales of the world economy are ailing, everyone who makes a living riding in their wake can begin to sink. 
It may already be happening. In Europe, Germany is already feeling shaky. For very different reasons, related more to domestic mismanagement than American distress, Turkey and Argentina are fighting nasty economic crises. And yet what's curious in Washington these days is what is not happening: there is virtually no talk of coordinated, global solutions to what are clearly spreading economic troubles.
"Everywhere you go abroad you hear fears that we are licking our wounds, that we are obsessed with two things, a missile shield to protect ourselves and a way to reverse the declines in our own markets," said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management and the author of a recent book, "The Mind of the CEO," that notes how little the world's corporate chieftains spend time thinking about the politics of the global markets they inhabit.
Most of Mr. Bush's political appointees, including those who will stand at the tricky intersection of global diplomacy and the world's markets, have yet to be confirmed by the Senate. But once they settle in and survey what is looking more and more like a global slowdown, what are their options?
First they must decide what it means to conduct a "humble" foreign policy, to use the new president's favorite term. Will the United States Treasury leap in, as Mr. Clinton's did repeatedly, to stabilize nations whose own mistakes, or unforgiving currency markets, have driven them to the edge of the cliff? Or will the Bush administration take the position that it's America's job to heal its own economic troubles, and the rest of the world's problem to solve theirs? 
It's too early to know for sure. But when the head of the International Monetary Fund visited Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill a few weeks ago, the message on Turkey was pretty clear: Do your best to help them out, but don't expect extraordinary, Mexico-like bailouts from the United States. (It is Mr. O'Neill who called aid to Russia "crazy," and said he didn't understand why the United States should step into to prop up a falling currency.)
"He may be compelled to revisit that subject," said one senior Bush administration official, noting that Turkey is a NATO ally and a key link in keeping sanctions in place against Iraq.
The second challenge is how Mr. Bush will deal with growing sentiment around the world to build economic blocs that could rival the world's most powerful economy. "The United States and the European Union are on the brink of a major trade and economic conflict," said C. Fred Bergsten, the head of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Battles over beef, bananas, farm subsidies, telecommunications and genetically modified foods all sound boring, but they represent a broader struggle over who sets the rules of world trade. If the economic downturn goes global, those disputes become bitter -- and a moment for nations to erect walls.
Mr. Bush insists, of course, that he is a free trader, and he seems committed to the concept, starting with a reinvigorated effort to expand Nafta into a Free Trade Area of the Americas. But he is also under protectionist pressure from friends in the steel industry, among others, and he is looking for ways to accommodate them.
The third, and biggest question, is whether Mr. Bush is right when he says the best cure for the globe is a tax cut at home. If he's lucky, the United States will soon be on the rise again, acting as the locomotive for the rest of the world. If not, he could discover -- as the Japanese did -- that a declining economy translates quickly into declining global clout, making it harder to corral other nations into a coordinated rescue plan.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
A New Role for Greens: Public Enemy

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH has declared that, once again, the nation has an acute shortage of energy. But the enemy his administration has identified is not one of the usual suspects: profligate usage, OPEC or Saddam Hussein. Instead, it is environmentalism.
 As Mr. Bush's energy team prepares a comprehensive energy strategy, its members are meeting with conservationists as well as oil industry lobbyists. But the team has begun outlining what sounds like a supply-side crusade under an anti-green flag. 
 Among the measures under consideration, according to administration officials and some Congressional and industry experts, are: easing clean-air rules for coal-fired power plants; loosening federal standards on river flows to protect fish; giving refiners relief from diverse anti-pollution standards in different states; allowing states to control drilling rights on some federal lands; pushing construction of nuclear plants; and, the headline grabber so far, opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration. 
Mr. Bush has not been shy about taking on environmentalists: last week, he reversed a Clinton administration executive order that tightened arsenic standards for drinking water, a boon to the mining industry. And in a preview to his approach to energy policy, he dropped a campaign pledge to require power plants to control emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. 
Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, called the drafting of the energy plan a search for a middle ground between environmentalists and industry. But he sounded the new battle cry at a Washington energy conference last week, ridiculing a recent newspaper ad from a pro-conservation group, which argued California should solve its electricity shortages by a crash efficiency plan. 
He cited a study his department prepared that claims that the United States will need 1,300 new power plants during the next 20 years. It was the Clinton administration's folly, he said, to think that the nation could limit demand and just let supply take care of itself. 
"Through neglect or complacency or ideology, this approach has led us to the crisis we face today," he said.
THE Bush arsenal includes pointing out that a proliferation of "green tape" has made blocking energy projects on environmental grounds too easy, and that it has cost the nation an adequate fuel supply. And the Bush team also points the finger at people who use environmental rules to simply pursue their own narrow interests. 
"We've had an approach that isn't balanced because it's been so easy to stop projects," said Vice President Dick Cheney, who is heading the energy team. "Nobody wants to be able to see a transmission line from their front yard. Nobody wants a gas pipeline through their community. Nobody wants a power plant in their county. It's going to be very important that we change the circumstances." 
Part of the Bush focus comes out of politics. Environmental groups gave generously to Democrats, while Republicans collected $10 million of the $14 million in political contributions by oil and gas companies and their trade groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
There is also the question of experience. Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney and Donald Evans, the commerce secretary, who is also a member of the energy team, are themselves oil industry veterans. They are very aware that the clean-air act of 1970, as amended in 1990, is the industry's bete noire. And there is no question that it has forced companies to reduce output from older power plants and refineries. 
Yet some of the measures under consideration have, at best, a tangential relationship to the electricity shortage in California. Mr. Bush's backing of legislation introduced by Senator Frank Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, to open a part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration will do nothing to increase the nation's capacity to produce electricity. Oil is not a major fuel for power plants.
Natural gas shortages are a different story. Because it is a clean-burning fuel, power generators have come to rely heavily on it to produce electricity. What seemed like an endless bounty of cheap gas a few years ago now seems more precarious. Prices have soared, and strains on gas pipelines are obvious.
But it's not clear that natural gas is in crisis. Natural gas has been so cheap for so long that companies have not had the incentive to fully exploit known reserves or invest in new infrastructure. High prices -- as opposed to government incentives -- could work to secure more supply relatively quickly, many experts argue. And while it is true that community groups have made it difficult to build gas pipelines, the mother of them all -- a $10 billion gas superhighway from Alaska's North Slope to the lower 48 states -- has been stalled for economic reasons, not environmental ones.
WITH California experiencing rolling blackouts and other parts of the country, including New York, worried about shortages this summer, it seems sound enough to review environmental controls. But the administration also seems to be tailoring the problem to fit a narrow, deregulatory solution long favored by the industry. 
What Mr. Bush is calling an energy crisis -- scattered shortages of electricity generating capacity and last year's isolated gasoline price spikes -- is more complex than the label suggests. An anti-green approach, which focuses on how environmental controls have helped create the problem, may obscure how they could also be part of the solution. 
"I haven't heard a single word from them about energy efficiency," said Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, a Democrat. "Our nation's competitive advantage is technology, not oil reserves, so we ought be using that technology to make our society more efficient." 
A recent study by five national laboratories under the Department of Energy found that market-based energy efficiency policies, like tax credits for fuel-efficient vehicles, could reduce the growth of energy demand by a third through 2010.
David Nemtzow of the Alliance to Save Energy says that energy efficiency regulations Mr. Clinton promulgated at the end of his term, most notably new standards for air conditioners, could reduce projections for future energy needs by 50,000 megawatts through 2020. That's one-eighth of the total projected growth in demand during that period.
Yet the president's budget framework envisions cutting funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs by 30 percent, Congressional experts who have been briefed on the planned cuts said. And in what seems like a bit of smash-mouth budgeting, the administration has even suggested linking funding for efficiency programs to royalties from Arctic drilling.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, at LVMH, Money Is an Object 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE with CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
LAST Wednesday, matinee day, Times Square was jammed with its usual crowd of theatergoers, tourists and office workers on lunch hour. But Sephora, a branch of Europe's leading retail beauty chain that sits in prime space on Broadway near 43rd Street, was curiously free of the gridlock on the sidewalks outside. And those who had ventured into Sephora appeared to be largely browsers. They toyed with the $18 Stila eye gloss and sniffed at the tester bottles of $80 Jil Sander and $42 Versace White Jeans colognes that are stacked on shiny shelves in the vast black-motif emporium. But they were not buying.
 Whether that Wednesday noontime was typical is a matter of increasing concern to Sephora's parent, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton -- or at least to its shareholders. Over the last few years, LVMH, the French holding company piloted by Bernard Arnault, has spent staggering amounts of money building the world's most extensive empire of luxury goods companies. Each has its own gleaming brand name -- Givenchy gowns, Thomas Pink shirts, Chaumet jewelry, TAG Heuer watches, Veuve Cliquot Champagne, Phillips auctioneers, Loewe leather goods. But each, and many more, now belong to LVMH. 
 Yet in the last few months, the United States economy has slowed markedly, and the stock market's fall has wiped away some $4 trillion of wealth. In Japan, where LVMH also has a big presence, the economy is in a dangerous state of stagnation. Europe's economy, which depends on both, is also a worry. And suddenly, Mr. Arnault, whose strategy is founded on the growing wealth of nations, is standing on some unstable ground.
For the very rich, accustomed to their $6,000 Dior evening gowns, $75,000 Ebel watches and $150 bottles of Dom Perignon, money will never be an obstacle. But LVMH's gamble on the ability of brand-name luxury goods to attract millions of new customers is no longer a sure bet.
"It is naivete to believe the luxury business is immune from the downturn," said Walter K. Levy, managing director for retail trends and positioning at Kurt Salmon Associates, an international retail consulting company. "This downturn is as much psychological as real, and that has a disproportionate impact on the luxury market."
In early March, LVMH delivered financial news that confirmed doubts about its outlook, adding to the downward pressure on its shares of the last year. 
The company said that sales growth slowed markedly in early 2001 and that profits had been hurt by a doubling of financing costs. And, in an acknowledgment that economic weakness could have an impact on LVMH's future, Mr. Arnault said the company would limit its acquisitions this year.
"We are going to favor generating cash," he said.
That is quite an about-face. Mr. Arnault, 52, is one of Europe's wealthiest and most ambitious business executives. He was once nicknamed "the Pope of Fashion" for his aggressive -- some would say obsessive -- drive to control so many of the leading luxury design houses. In the last two frenetic years, LVMH has spent roughly $3 billion to acquire about 25 famous, if not always famously profitable, luxury brands.
The spending piled up seven billion euros of debt, or about $6.2 billion --and more than half of that is short term. 
Yet not many of LVMH's new properties generate the kind of cash it needs. Though he invests money in his new treasures -- sometimes liberally -- Mr. Arnault runs a decentralized empire, with little attempt to make them worth more together than they were alone. Several brands compete against one another, leading skeptics to ask whether Mr. Arnault simply collects trendy names for vanity's sake.
"What started to bug me was a misallocation of capital," said Andrew Gowen, a securities analyst who follows LVMH at Lehman Brothers in London. "A lot of acquisitions pushed them into several low-margin, low-return businesses." In January, Mr. Gowen joined several other analysts and cut his recommendation for LVMH from "buy" to "neutral." 
For their part, Mr. Arnault and his No. 2 executive, the American retailing manager Myron E. Ullmann III, make no apologies about any of LVMH's acquisitions. If anything, Mr. Arnault expressed confidence that the collection amassed by LVMH will ultimately vindicate him, regardless of what happens in the world economy.
"Our strategy is to have some stars -- and there are not many stars in the luxury business," he said in a recent interview at his modest Paris offices. "What is a star? It's a name that is the very best. It's a name that is very profitable. But the number of true stars is less than I can count on both of my hands."
Mr. Arnault does have at least a few of those stars in his empire, which he has been building since he became chairman in the late 1980's. But in his relentless acquisition spree, he seems to have picked up some damaged goods, leaving him more dependent than ever on the brown-and-tan leather goods of Louis Vuitton -- which already supplies about half the company's profits.
The most prominent problem is Fendi, the Italian maker of leather goods and accessories, which was said to be hardly profitable and poorly managed when LVMH took control last year. (LVMH does not disclose separate results for its brands.) Under Arnault, Fendi's management tangle has become only more complex.
Together with the Italian businessman Patrizio Bertelli, chief executive of the Prada fashion house, LVMH paid $900 million to share a 51 percent controlling stake in Fendi. But the deal left the five Fendi sisters with a 49 percent stake and job guarantees for them and other family members. As a result, recruiting an executive to run Fendi has been difficult, with some candidates fearing they will be crushed between the mercurial sisters and the powerful LVMH. And Fendi's sales have been flattening, most notably in Japan, after the eclipse of its Baguette bag, which was much-coveted after its introduction in 1997.
ANOTHER potential headache is Donna Karan International, which LVMH agreed to buy in December. Ms. Karan's designer clothes were a far hotter commodity just a few years ago than they are today. Though she made her name with sensuous business outfits for the middle-aged working woman, she has since designed several collections that were amorphous, saclike and poorly received.
Sales for Donna Karan's core women's business, meanwhile, have declined. On March. 13, Donna Karan said its fourth-quarter earnings fell 11 percent on a 6 percent decline in sales, at least partly because of weakness in selling women's clothes. Even so, on Friday, executives close to Mr. Arnault said he would soon increase his bid by nearly 10 percent, to make the deal go through with shareholders who have balked at his earlier price.
Some of LVMH's smaller acquisitions, including watchmakers and perfumers, while not in trouble, do not appear set to make big contributions to LVMH's cash flow, either. Operating margins at the TAG Heuer, Zenith and Chaumet watch and jewelry brands are about 7 percent, far below the 37 percent generated in LVMH's fashion and leather goods division, and below the 10 percent of rivals like Bulgari and Tiffany. Companies in the division that LVMH calls selective retailing -- the Duty Free Shops that line so many airports and the Phillips auction house, which is trying to take on both Christie's and Sotheby's in top-of-the-line works of art, for example -- are barely profitable.
The prospect of more modest margins is unsettling because it comes as LVMH's financing costs have risen, a result of spending for acquisitions and expansion. 
LVMH is not starved for cash. It owns 20 percent of Gucci, the fabled Italian fashion house that remains LVMH's archrival; that stake alone is worth about $2 billion. Its Vuitton leather business, the company's most powerful component, generated about half the company's 2000 operating profit of 1.96 billion euros, or about $1.82 billion. Still, net financing costs almost doubled last year, to 421 million euros or about $375 million, from 227 million euros in 1999. 
DEFECTIONS of executives and designers have also troubled LVMH, which relies on many leading talents in fashion to create distinctive products for its brands.
Within months last year, Gianluca Brozzetti, the president of Louis Vuitton Malletier, announced his departure to run the exclusive British jeweler Asprey & Garrard, and Thierry Andretta, who helped engineer a turnaround at the Celine fashion house, defected to Gucci. 
The most spectacular defection came in June, when Alexander McQueen, the angry and outrageous Scotsman who was brought in as chief designer to revive Givenchy, likewise said he was leaving for Gucci, even though his contract did not expire until next fall. That loss in particular seemed to leave a bitter impression on Mr. Arnault, who had showered Mr. McQueen with perks like a luxurious Paris apartment and a chauffered Mercedes sedan.
"McQueen is very talented, very creative," but he "is always complaining about something," Mr. Arnault said, dismissing the importance of the designer he personally recruited in 1996. Just this month, he found a replacement for Mr. McQueen -- Julien Macdonald. He also said he would not consider closing Givenchy.
"Why?" Mr Arnault asked. "It's very successful. It makes money from fashion and from perfumes."
To some degree, Mr. Arnault's feelings about the McQueen departure reflect his animosity toward the management of Gucci, with whom he has been embroiled in a bitter legal brawl for two years. Mr. Arnault amassed his stake in Gucci in 1999 in what was widely viewed as a creeping takeover attempt. Gucci then sold a controlling stake to Francois Pinault, a French billionaire retailing executive, which sliced Mr. Arnault's Gucci stake to 20 percent.
Mr. Arnault has said he never wanted to buy Gucci, but the fight has gnawed at him and has become a major distraction for his company, costing considerable time and legal expense. And Mr. Pinault remains his archrival in French business.
Although there may have been little surprise in LVMH's decision to slow its expansion in 2001, Mr. Arnault said he was not convinced that the American economy was weakening. 
"I think the main question in America is the morale," he said. "When I go to the United States these days, people seem demoralized. They are depressed. But what I know about the States is that things can change fast -- one way or another. So maybe in three months, people will be energized again. My guess is that if interest rates go down sufficiently, things will come back by the end of the year."
The real question, he said, is what will happen in Japan, which through Japanese buying at home and abroad accounts for as much as 40 percent of LVMH sales. "The economy in Japan has been difficult for 10 years," Mr. Arnault said. "It never really came back."
Even so, the economic problems in Japan or the United States do not mean that LVMH has ruled out buying more companies this year. Mr. Ullman, who made his name in the retailing world by strengthening the Macy and Federated department store chains in the United States, said, "We still have the capacity for acquisitions when there is a good strategic fit."
FROM its beginnings, when Mr. Arnault pioneered the concept of acquiring the businesses of renowned designers, like Dior and Givenchy, and turning the names into valuable luxury goods brands, he has had one strategy. It is centered on cornering as many as possible of the most attractive names in a given luxury products sector -- be it fashion, perfumes, leather goods, or, most recently, expensive timepieces.
Mr. Arnault's success bred imitators. In Italy, a revived Gucci set out on a similar multibrand luxury goods course, and in Switzerland, Compagnie Financiere Richemont, which owns Cartier, did likewise, appearing to confirm the validity of the idea.
More recently, Mr. Arnault has expanded the concept, moving into retail distribution. His goal was to have better control over where and how LVMH goods are sold and to offset excessive reliance on any particular geographic region. For example, 90 percent of passengers on LVMH's Miami Cruiseline ships are from North America, so its shops on the ships are a useful balance to LVMH's heavy reliance on Japanese consumers.
Yet some investors appear troubled by LVMH's dizzying course of expansion.
Its once-coveted stock has declined 37.2 percent in the last 12 months, while the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter luxury goods index has declined just 4 percent. On Friday, the American depository receipts of LVMH closed at a 52-week low of $9.63, down almost 38 percent from its 52-week high last September. 
While LVMH's operating profit rose 17 percent, to a record 1.96 billion euros or $1.74 billion last year, on a 35 percent increase in revenue to 11.6 billion euros, the results still fell short of expectations. And the acquisition drive has caused operating margins to drop to roughly 14 percent, from 25 percent in 1995.
Some securities analysts who follow LVMH say it has become excessively dependent on star performers like Louis Vuitton, its mainstay leather goods business.
"They have done a wonderful job at Louis Vuitton, but that is about it," said Sagrar Maceira de Rosen, who follows LVMH at J. P. Morgan in London. Claire A. Kent of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said she was concerned that within five years the Vuitton brand might not be so trendy and that there would be no comparable LVMH brand to take up the slack.
Mr. Arnault, however, showed little worry about that prospect. Vuitton remains vibrant, he said, and his strategy of amassing so many brands has increased the odds that he will own more winners.
"I think the status of the brands goes up and down," he said. "Fifteen years ago, you had a different picture of the fashion business. What was Donna Karan 15 years ago? Well, in another 15 years, it will be quite different. You can't look at the business as a static thing. These brands are moving. We hope that the brands we are managing are moving upwards, following our stars. And, over the next decade, if we can build from the 15 or so other companies that we have one or two new stars, and make them a success, then it's a very good investment."
Mr. Ullman, who occupies an office across the hall from Mr. Arnault, said the business of LVMH was in large measure about grafting a marketing strategy onto the mystique of designer creativity.
Far from facing exhaustion, the Vuitton brand should even grow in importance, Mr. Ullman said. "It has a huge opportunity as a lifestyle and global fashion brand, beyond the core business," he said. In the meantime, Vuitton is pushing geographic expansion -- after successfully landing in China, it is now focusing on establishing itself in Russia and India, where emerging middle classes thirst for Western-style badges of luxury.
He agrees that the challenge lies not so much in maintaining Vuitton's vigor as it does in injecting the same energy into LVMH's newly acquired brands. But he is short on details. For the moment, Mr. Ullman is personally running the Phillips auction business. At Fendi, LVMH and Prada, the controlling shareholders "desire over time to bring in a managing director," he said -- but they have no candidate. The problem at Fendi, he said, is not one of creativity, given the enduring success of Karl Lagerfeld, Fendi's ready-to-wear designer since 1965. "It's a function of producing, and selling it properly," he said.
FROM a monolithic organization with the various brands reporting directly to Mr. Arnault, LVMH has evolved a new form under Mr. Ullman, who is group managing director: a flattened structure, with six major groups, like fashion and leather, jewelry or perfumes, reporting directly to him.
Mr. Ullman said he was not worried about occasional departures, like Mr. Andretta's. "There is always a war for talent," he said, "and in terms of turmoil within LVMH, there is no major problem."
Though often ill at ease when the center of attention, Mr. Arnault has been skilled at placing attention-getters as chief designers, including John Galliano, the flamboyant English designer whom he named to head the house of Dior, and Mr. McQueen, whom he installed at Givenchy. But like Mr. Arnault, Mr. Ullman played down the damage done by Mr. McQueen's departure. "It was relatively normal," he said. "He wanted us to fund his own company. We chose not to."
Still, part of Mr. Arnault's success has been in his appointments, both in design and management. Concetta Lanciaux joined LVMH in 1986 to become head of human resources, after teaching sociology at Carnegie Mellon University and then holding the main personnel job at Intel Europe. "The key thing when buying companies is to identify talent in those companies," she said. "In industrial companies, it's factories; in luxury its immaterial capital." Mr. Arnault, she said, "knew its important function."
If LVMH succeeds at making acquisitions like Fendi successful, much credit will go to executives like Ms. Lanciaux, who knows the Fendi sisters well and sees them often.
"When we bring companies in, they have their own culture," she said. "They are strong branded companies, and the success of the brand developed a philosophy, and each maintains its own identity. At the same time, you have to equip it to work together."
BUT strong sales and profits at these companies will be of little value if the group's overall margins are pulled down by its retailing. Sephora remains a money-loser partly because of its rapid expansion, from 57 to 460 stores in three years; it will probably not be profitable until 2002 at the earliest.
Duty Free Shops, the chain that Mr. Ullman ran before joining LVMH, depends traditionally on Far Eastern sales and was bruised badly by the economic jolt the region absorbed in the late 1990's. Now Duty Free is rapidly unfolding a plan for development of its "galleria" concept, like one in San Francisco, a collection of stores in a downtown setting that offers luxury goods with higher profit margins than those of the chain's airport stores. But even if all these operations become profitable, expected margins of about 10 percent will be well below what luxury brands can generate.
Mr. Ullman has his rationale for a stronger retail presence. He says it lets LVMH profit not only from its own brands, but also from those of competitors. At Duty Free Shops, he points out, only 20 percent of the merchandise is LVMH's; 80 percent comes from competitors like Gucci. Moreover, the retail outlets are intended to lure new customers to LVMH brands.
One of the contradictions of the business, as Mr. Arnault and Mr. Ullman see it, is the opposition of "precious versus accessible -- something of quality that is attainable," Mr. Ullman said.
"We are not selling Mercedes-Benzes, yachts or vacation homes; we are selling things people don't need to finance," he said.
LVMH is aiming at customers who "are willing to pay for cashmere, but won't pay a penny extra for paper towels," he said.
"While we are cautious about '01," he concluded, "we are strong on our long-term prospects." A lot is riding on that hope.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 1, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods maker, misstated two measurements of its 2000 financial results. Its operating profit rose 26.6 percent, not 17, and its operating margin was 17 percent, not 14. 
The article also referred incorrectly to terms of a takeover of Fendi, the Italian fashion house, by a joint venture of LVMH and the Italian fashion house Prada. LVMH and Prada together bought a 51 percent controlling stake in Fendi for a price that valued Fendi at roughly $900 million. They did not pay $900 million. 
Because of an editing error, the article referred imprecisely to the fourth-quarter 2000 earnings of Donna Karan International, the American fashion house that LVMH has offered to buy. They rose 217 percent, including one-time adjustments. They fell 11 percent, as the article stated, excluding one-time adjustments.
A letter from LVMH appears on Page 18.

When Greenspan Thinks, Just Listen

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
If we could read Alan Greenspan's mind, now that the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates for the third time this year, only to watch stocks keep falling. . . .
 INGRATES. I lower interest rates by a point and a half in just 11 weeks -- the fastest I've moved in my 13 years here -- and the thanks I get from Wall Street is another swoon in stock prices and a lot of complaints about how I'm out of touch or behind the curve. 
 But this isn't about me -- or the markets, for that matter. It is about nursing the expansion back to health, and right now there seems to be some confusion about both the diagnosis and the treatment. 
If only I could get everyone focused on the basics. We are not in a recession, at least not by the classic definition. We haven't had two consecutive quarters in which output contracted. We probably haven't even had one.
That is not to say it won't happen. We economists have a dismal record of seeing the start of recessions. I, for one, completely missed the onset of the 1990-91 downturn.
Part of the problem is that our economic statistics are not always precise enough to pinpoint the moment at which growth tips from slightly positive to slightly negative. And part of the problem is that human psychology is slow to accept change.
In this case, I'm not sure that the markets understand what is happening in the economy, and what is not.
Outside of Wall Street, there are two basic problems. One is a run-of-the-mill inventory correction. When demand suddenly slowed last year, companies were caught with too many unsold goods and too much in the way of unused supplies.
They won't start making their products or ordering from their suppliers again until they have brought those excess inventories in line with reduced demand, which I've said publicly is well under way. In the meantime, manufacturers are suffering, since they are the source of those inventories.
Why is demand slowing? There are several reasons, including sharp declines in consumer confidence and wealth related to the tumbling stock market. But the primary problem is that many companies, eager to take advantage of what appeared to be guaranteed high rates of return on investment, added too much capacity in the last few years, even for an economy that was growing more than 4 percent a year.
As they recognize the problem, companies have cut back on new investment, particularly in technology, broadly defined.
The adjustment has been sharp and painful, and it has set off a downward spiral in equity values and confidence that, if it got out of hand, could lead to serious economic damage. It's not going to help if Japan, the world's second-largest economy, goes deeper in the tank.
Still, I have spent a lot of time convincing myself and anyone who would listen that the United States has undergone a fundamental improvement in productivity in the last five years, and I'm sticking to my story. Managing this downturn or correction or whatever it turns out to be will continue to be tricky and maybe harmful to my reputation.
But if the growth rate of productivity holds up, so will the economy's long-term outlook. And the evidence so far is that I'm right about productivity.
INVESTORS, however, don't always behave rationally. (I think I've made myself clear in the past on that issue.) They can throw caution to the wind on the way up. Equally, they can panic on the way down. So far, this hasn't been anything like the late summer and fall of 1998, when the credit markets seized up in fear over the economic crises in Asia and Russia.
Still, it is part of my job to keep the markets from pulling down the whole economy. So I've done my bit. I got out ahead of the game with a surprise rate cut just after the first of the year. I came back a few weeks later with more interest-rate medicine.
But then the market started to show signs of addiction, demanding more and sooner and mutilating itself to get my attention.
I was happy to administer another dose last week, but anything bigger would have been flirting with malpractice. It's not as if I told the markets that after this it was cold turkey. I have all but promised to dispense another dollop of my feel-good federal funds potion before our next meeting on May 15.
In fact, I have plenty of leeway to keep cutting rates, and I probably will. Inflation is not a concern, despite the upward blips the last few months in the Consumer Price Index. The dollar is holding up nicely.
Despite all that, the market is giving me a vote of no confidence. Funny, a few months ago I could do no wrong. What's changed?
It isn't me.

The World Starts Getting in the Superpower's Way

BYLINE:  By MARC D. CHARNEY 

 BODY:
THE world can be hard on a new president. John F. Kennedy acted early -- and reaped disaster -- at the Bay of Pigs. Bill Clinton got the same result by not acting in Rwanda, and by waiting to act in Bosnia. Both came to publicly rue their missteps. 
 George W. Bush, too, will soon have to decide when, or whether, to use American power -- but in a world far different from the one Kennedy or Mr. Clinton faced. 
 Gone is the cold war, with its assumed need to act everywhere. But gone, too, is the moment when Bill Clinton took office, when the world seemed to wait deferentially on the American president's decisions.
The world's other leaders now have had a decade of living with America as the lone superpower, and they are starting to form new strategies and partnerships -- sometimes in ways America may not like.
This shift in relationships, it has to be said, is a matter of interpretation. Sometimes disagreements make countries adversaries. Sometimes calling them adversaries makes for disagreements. And the Bush administration is far more inclined than its predecessor to see China, Russia and North Korea in particular as cold war-style adversaries, rather than potential partners. The abrupt expulsion last week of scores of Russians accused of spying, retaliation for the discovery of an alleged F.B.I. mole, showed clearly that this administration is prepared to address Russia in cold-war style.
But it is also true that the image overseas of America as the "indispensable" power, in Madeleine K. Albright's famous phrase, has evolved. America may still be supreme -- and the most desired partner if interests can be made to coincide -- but many lesser powers, including some with substantial resentments, are not quite so wary of offending it.
Take the Middle East, where eight years ago Saddam Hussein had been vanquished, but the Arab coalition that had fought him still trembled at his name. It had nowhere to turn for security but to America. In 1993, even Yasir Arafat had to turn to peace talks with Israel, which gained him America's blessing. Now, as a new Palestinian uprising and the crumbling of sanctions against Iraq attest, there are alternatives to doing America's bidding on all the key regional questions -- and Arab leaders are at least exploring them.
Something similar is happening in Eastern Europe, where a resurgent Russian nationalism has spurred President Vladimir V. Putin, despite Russia's economic weakness, to rebuild relationships with other former Soviet republics in hopes of slowing NATO's expansion. It is happening in the Americas, where President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has helped lead OPEC to a new solidarity based on higher oil prices. 
That is why President Bush's agenda last week was so interesting. A new hand in foreign affairs was confronting some of the most serious and fastest-changing challenges to the way America works its will across the globe. He met with the prime ministers of Israel and Japan, and with China's deputy prime minister. Meanwhile, NATO was facing decisions about how to quell the latest Balkan fighting, and the almighty American economy was giving the world jitters.
Here are several glimpses of how these challenges look from outside Washington, or at least outside the White House, and of why the new American president may not have the last word on how they work out.

HEADLINE: REGULATIONS CZAR PREFERS NEW PATH 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 22 

 BODY:
For more than a decade, a Harvard professor named John D. Graham has raised money, eyebrows and hackles by arguing that in many cases the cost of environmental rules vastly exceeds the benefits.
 Dr. Graham, the founder and director of a Harvard center that receives most of its money from industry, has become a pivotal figure in the battles over environmental regulation by arguing a theme that is pleasing to his donors' ears. He asserts that Americans would be far better off if, for example, the money devoted to pesticide control were spent on very different priorities, like hospital emergency rooms, even if in considerably smaller sums. 
 And now Dr. Graham is preparing to bring that view to the new administration. He is President Bush's nominee for a job that would make him a regulations czar, the head of an office in the Office of Management and Budget that must pass judgment on every regulation drawn up by some 50 government agencies. The job would give Dr. Graham enormous clout. 
His nomination as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has thrilled industry lobbyists and others who see it as a sign that the new administration intends to give more weight to strict cost-benefit tests. 
But the nomination has troubled many environmentalists and some scholars, who say his ostensibly neutral research is far from objective. They say Dr. Graham would be a worrying addition to an administration they contend has already shown a penchant for disguising political decisions in a veil of objectivity. 
"The whole strategy is not to criticize regulation per se," said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, an advocacy group, "but to stop it through paralysis-with-analysis." 
Dr. Graham has not spoken publicly since he was nominated this month. Nominees often leave questions for confirmation hearings before the Senate's Government Operations Committee. Hearings have not been scheduled. No member of the committee has publicly voiced opposition to Dr. Graham. 
As an academic, Dr. Graham, 44, has advocated a number of health and safety regulations, like seat belt requirements, on the ground that benefits clearly exceed costs. But he has been more skeptical about most environmental rules, arguing in one 1995 study that in terms of cost-effectiveness, certain Environmental Protection Agency regulations lag behind other agencies by a factor of hundreds, at a median cost of some $7.6 million per year of life saved. A more widely used calculation would try to determine the cost for each life saved, but Dr. Graham argues that what is most important is the total years of life saved. 
In a 1996 speech, Dr. Graham told an audience at the Heritage Foundation that "environmental regulation should be depicted as an incredible intervention in the operation of society." His defenders, like William L. Kovacs, vice president for environment, technology and regulatory affairs at the United States Chamber of Commerce, say he is a realist whose work has helped provide a more solid foundation for industry complaints about excessive federal regulation.
"This is a guy who says, 'Look folks, when you go home you have a one-in-60 chance of dying in an auto accident,' and no one does very much about it," Mr. Kovacs said. But, he added, with "some theoretical cancer risk of one-in-a-million or one in five million, you have people proposing a new regulatory structure." 
In practice, Dr. Graham's ability to recast regulatory priorities would be somewhat restricted. A ruling by the Supreme Court this year upheld a prohibition in the Clean Air Act and other environmental legislation that expressly forbids federal agencies from considering costs as a factor in their decision making, directing that the agencies seek to do everything feasible to protect human health.
But even so, he would have enormous influence, so much so that some industry lobbyists regard the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as one of the most important agencies in the government, overseeing regulations whose cost to the economy has been measured by economists at $700 billion a year.
While the office cannot veto any regulations the various agencies propose, it must review all of them, under executive orders. And in disputes with agency chiefs, the administrator is rarely overruled by the president. 
Under the administrator Wendy Gramm in the mid-1980's, the office was known within government as a "black hole" that swallowed up proposed health, safety and environmental regulations, and some of Dr. Graham's critics say they fear that, under his leadership, it would deserve the same moniker. 
The 1995 study that Dr. Graham wrote with graduate students compared the cost-effectiveness of more than 500 life-saving interventions, like seat belts and radionuclide emission controls at uranium fuel plants, on the basis of available data. The study found that cost-efficiencies ranged from those like seat belts, whose cost Dr. Graham estimated was essentially nothing per year of life saved, to those like the emissions controls, whose cost he estimated at $34 billion per year of life saved.
To ignore the "life-saving opportunities" of such cost-benefit analysis, he said in testimony before Congress in 1995, would represent "a shocking display of statistical murder." 
Dr. Graham was testifying at the time in favor of legislation by Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican, that would have required that any new regulation issued by the government pass a strict cost-benefit test. That bill was opposed by the Clinton administration, and it was defeated. A new, less strict measure now before Congress would require such tests, and if the costs exceeded the benefits, agencies would have to try to justify regulations in writing. 
In both the environmental organizations and in the academic world, Dr. Graham's critics say that nothing is inherently wrong with cost-benefit analysis, and that it should be considered a useful analytical tool. But as a gauge of any regulation, it must try to take account of many uncertainties, and the assumptions made will have an enormous effect on the conclusions.
"It's not inherently good or inherently bad," said Dr. David Ozonoff, chairman of the department of environmental health at Boston University's School of Public Health. "It's inherently biased." 
Dr. Ozonoff said that much of the research carried out at Dr. Graham's Harvard Center for Risk Analysis has amounted to "having the client shoot an arrow, and then the analyst paints a target around it."
Sixty percent of the center's annual budget of $3 million comes from private gifts and grants, most of them from industry trade organizations and large companies, including Monsanto, ExxonMobil, 3M, Alcoa, Pfizer, Dow Chemical and DuPont.
The center's reports have tended to reflect the view of industry, as in a study last summer, sponsored by AT&T Wireless Communication, that concluded that the hazards of talking on a cell phone while driving were relatively small.
In the early 1990's, Dr. Graham solicited money from Philip Morris at a time when he was criticizing the E.P.A.'s conclusion that second-hand smoke was a carcinogen, people close to him said. Accepting tobacco money violated the policy of the School of Public Health, of which the risk-analysis center is a part, and Dr. Graham was ordered to return the money. He later accepted an equivalent gift from Kraft, a Philip Morris subsidiary, the same people said. 
But in interviews, even several critics of Dr. Graham's work said they felt sure that his views predated his fund-raising. And some supporters of Dr. Graham offered testimonials to his objectivity.
"I think they're afraid of him because they're afraid he'll be effective," W. Kip Viscusi, a professor of law and economics at Harvard Law School, said of Dr. Graham's critics.

HEADLINE: Europeans Aim for Larger Role 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM, March 24 

 BODY:
European Union leaders ended a two-day summit meeting here today exuding optimism about their economies and promising greater assertion in foreign affairs. 
 The 15 leaders planned to increase their role in the peace efforts between North and South Korea and will send the Swedish prime minister, Goeran Persson, for talks in Pyongyang and Seoul, according to a draft of their final statement. 
 And they urged the United States to recommit to cutting carbon dioxide emissions as part of a global charter to prevent a deterioration of the world's climate.
The leaders said the steps they were taking to modernize old industries and support new technologies would promote economic growth, which they predicted would be "around 3 percent" during the next year or two. 
But they reached a deal on only one top priority -- a plan to streamline regulation of financial markets by 2005. They eliminated a reference to low interest rates from their final statement, interpreted as a veiled reminder to the European Central Bank that rates could be lower. 
Their draft statement said they would step up their diplomatic efforts in Korea, pledging "substantive talks" with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, on "the full range of issues." Those would presumably include the North's weapons programs, cited by the United States as part of its motivation to develop a missile shield, which many European countries have opposed. 
The statement also underscored "the necessity of efficient international action" to prevent a deterioration in global climate conditions.
The Bush administration has said it will not call for national controls on carbon dioxide emissions. On Friday, Mr. Persson and the European Commission president, Romano Prodi, wrote a letter to Mr. Bush expressing "deep concern."

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Revised forecasts are a reminder how quickly business assumptions can crumble.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
AMID all the hype about the prospects of e-commerce early last year, few statistics got as much attention as those put out by the Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm known for its acumen in the so-called business-to-business realm.
 Specifically, in January 2000 Gartner predicted that by 2004, $7.3 trillion a year in global transactions would flow through the Internet. For the few nonbelievers left among investors back then, the word "trillion" was ineluctably large enough to help them shed any final vestiges of inhibition and jump on the bandwagon with wallets wide open. 
 But like many consulting firms that spent 2000 watching corporations march out of step with predictions of fast-paced Internet adoption, Gartner recently revised its 2004 projections downward -- by more than $1.3 trillion. The new estimates offer a more sober view of what e-commerce is, and is not, but they also provide a reminder of the way commonly held assumptions about e-commerce, and the global economy, have so quickly crumbled. 
Lauren Shu, Gartner's research director, oversaw a team of about 20 people who helped formulate the new projections. She said several factors led to the downward revision, particularly the global economic slowdown. Ms. Shu said that WEFA, an organization in Eddystone, Pa., that Gartner relies on for overall global economic forecasting, recently predicted that the current downturn would slice 16 percent from worldwide sales transactions over the next four years.
With a smaller transactional pie to begin with, Ms. Shu said, the value of transactions going through the Internet will also shrink.
Moreover, as corporations feel the effects of the softening economy, Ms. Shu predicts that they will delay the costly transition to Internet commerce and squeeze more years out of their existing trading methods, no matter how inefficient those methods are in the short term.
Last year's Gartner projections were also based on the notion that regions like Europe and Asia would follow quickly on the heels of the United States in embracing e-business. 
That may still be true of many Asian nations, but Europe's e-commerce excursion has been hindered by a laundry list of cultural and regulatory obstacles, like widely varying tax systems, language hurdles and currency issues.
Ms. Shu said she could not quantify the extent to which Europe was trailing projections until the firm completed its analysis next month.
Just as entire regions have disappointed the more optimistic e-commerce prognosticators, so, too, have whole industries failed to adopt Internet business processes as quickly as once predicted. 
Ms. Shu said there were various reasons for consumer goods manufacturers and others to be slow off the mark. But for all of them, the so-called data standards issue looms large, because most industries are far from agreeing on common formats for transmitting data. 
For instance, consumer goods manufacturers and grocery stores must agree on a common Internet shorthand for every item they sell. Should a 12-ounce bottle of Pert shampoo be "12BPRT" or "PRT12OZB"? And should the shipping date read "03.26.01" or "3/26/ 01"? Until those types of questions are decided, each company will have to customize the data format for its business partners. Any efficiency gleaned from an Internet transaction quickly vanishes. 
On this point, Ms. Shu said that last year's predictions were based, in part, on the assumption that many companies would do business through e-marketplaces over the next few years. If industries rallied around one or two marketplaces, then whatever code those e-marketplaces accepted for transmitting data would become the de facto industry standard.
But few e-marketplaces have lured the corporations in their respective categories, leaving standardization issues in the hands of various industry groups. 
One such group is UCCnet, an offshoot of the Uniform Code Council, a nonprofit organization that created the bar code system. UCCnet is working with a handful of industries to help shape standards.
That task has gone more slowly than anticipated, said Milan Turk Jr., director of global customer business development for Procter & Gamble. His company is working with UCCnet to devise standards in the consumer goods industry.
Mr. Turk said that in early 2000 Procter & Gamble expected to move quickly through the standards-setting stage and soon be able to sell goods to retailers over the Web. 
Now, he said, it will probably be the end of this summer before the data standards are in place to enable the company to display its products online. And it could be six months after that before the company actually starts doing business with its corporate customers online.
"Only once we got down to doing the work," he said, "did we realize just how much work this is."
Still, despite the state of the economy and Procter's recent woes -- including last week's announcement that it will cut 9,600 jobs -- Mr. Turk said the company's enthusiasm for e-commerce "has not lessoned; nor has it lessoned for our trading partners."
Even though e-marketplaces have failed to accelerate the adoption of industrywide data standards -- or, for that matter, generate many transactions -- they are still greasing the wheels of e-commerce, said Leah Knight, the author of the January 2000 Gartner report that included the e-commerce projections.
Ms. Knight, who is now director of marketing for e2 open, an online marketplace for the technology industry, said that she had learned an important lesson since leaving Gartner in October: "Internet sales transactions are less significant than what leads up to that."
Marketplaces like e2 open and an increasing number of others, "are more of a communications vehicle," Ms. Knight said. 
"So rather than communicating transactions, we're exchanging ideas, forecast information, design drawings, capacity inquiries and other information that helps companies work together more effectively," she said. "The actual purchasing and selling isn't as substantial a piece."
Ms. Knight said she was not at all upset about seeing the predictions she made for Gartner undergo such substantial revision. Nor is she concerned, she said, with any criticism of last year's forecast. 
"Had we been able to forecast a downturn in the economy," she said, the e-commerce projections would have been built upon a smaller economic base.
Such explanations do not necessarily placate all of the critics. David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments, an institutional research firm, said that predictions like the one from Gartner last year "seduced investors and companies to overextend themselves."
"The subtext of all these projections," Mr. Simons said, "was that somehow the Internet business models were far superior to what they replaced -- that they were the most fantastic thing since Dell and Gateway invented direct selling of PC's." 
"But the business models weren't revolutionary," he said. "And there will always be so much competition that, for most players, at best it'll be a nice business, not a great one."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
A New Kind of Software Company for India

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India 

 BODY:
At a time when the term start-up evokes images of crashing stock prices and collapsing business plans -- here as much as in the United States -- Ashok Soota might not seem to be a man to watch.
 But Mr. Soota's 19-month-old venture, Mind Tree Consulting, has been celebrated by technology analysts and journalists, even though it is privately held and has all of $15 million in sales. 
 Part of the buzz stems from its pedigree: Mr. Soota, 58, had been the vice chairman of Wipro, one of India's largest software concerns. He helped lead India's drive in the early 90's into the back-office end of the computer business, writing software code for big American companies. 
But most of the excitement stems from Mind Tree's ambition: Mr. Soota wants his new company to leap several links up the technology food chain. Rather than supply programmers for the humdrum work of writing routine software code, he wants to design and build sophisticated computer networks for customers.
"In the early days, there was no need for Indian software companies to differentiate themselves," said Mr. Soota, an intense man given to philosophical musing. "Now, companies are starting to set themselves apart."
In Bangalore, a southern Indian city that has been called the Silicon Plateau, Mind Tree is viewed as something of a leading indicator. Its success or failure could say a lot about India's ability to graduate into the more advanced, lucrative realms of the technology industry.
Other Indian companies -- Infosys Technologies, Satyam Computer and Wipro itself -- are trying to make the same jump. But nobody has set out to do it from scratch, nor with quite the audacity of Mr. Soota.
"By inserting themselves at a higher level in the value chain, they are creating a mind-set in the company," said N. R. Narayana Murthy, the chairman of Infosys, arguably India's flagship software company.
"The question is whether they'll have credibility," he added. "Where do they get the experience to do higher-level work for clients?"
Despite India's reputation for superlative code writing, which has won it a blue-chip roster of customers like General Electric and Nortel Networks, some analysts question how successfully the country can compete in the more-rarefied digital fields of strategic consulting or systems integration.
Infosys is eager to offer high-end services, too. But Mr. Murthy is not about to discharge his army of software writers, who work at a sprawling, verdant campus outside Bangalore. His strategy is to continue writing code while gradually building expertise and to appeal for more complex assignments. "It is a longer-term process," he said, "but it has a higher likelihood of success."
India's technology industry will have $6.2 billion in exports this fiscal year, and total sales of about $8 billion. That is extraordinary growth, given that the services industry did not exist a decade ago. But it still accounts for just 2 percent of India's total economic output.
India also faces rising competition in the low end of the business from other Asian countries like China, Vietnam and the Philippines. With salaries in software companies here rising at more than 15 percent a year, India must expand into new areas that promise a higher return.
"What gives us an edge is that our education system has a bias toward mathematics and engineering," said Vivek Paul, the current vice chairman of Wipro. "But China will be a real threat in a few years."
Enter Mr. Soota, who had already steered Wipro through a transition from making PC's and minicomputers in the 1980's to providing software services. Determined to have a "third inning" in his career, Mr. Soota left Wipro in 1999 and began hunting for seed capital to start his own business.
Unknown to him, another Wipro refugee, Subroto Bagchi, had also been promoting the idea of a high-end software consultancy. A partner at a venture capital firm in the United States, Walden International, put the two men together in March 1999 and suggested they merge their plans.
With $9.5 million from Walden and an Indian venture firm, Sivan Securities, Mind Tree Consulting hung out its shingle six months later. From the start, it behaved differently from a typical Indian company.
First, the founders pledged to donate 3 percent of Mind Tree's after-tax profits to primary education. The company's initial donation went to a center in Bangalore for children with cerebral palsy.
The company logo, a stylized tree, was designed by the children, and their artwork adorns the walls throughout the headquarters, which are two glass boxes in a clamorous residential neighborhood.
Mr. Soota said he chose not to build a suburban campus, like that of Infosys, because he did not want his employees to spend three hours a day commuting on Bangalore's horrendous roads. Likewise, he noted, Mind Tree's philanthropy was part of a broader business strategy.
"It will attract a certain kind of employee, which in turn will attract a certain kind of customer," he said.
So far, Mind Tree has won assignments from Lucent Technologies, Avis and BP Amoco. Though the company is cagey about the project's details, it is designing a Web-based reservations system for Avis, a unit of Cendant. It is also advising Harvard University on ways to promote sports events on the Internet.
In addition to e-commerce projects, Mind Tree advises equipment makers like Cisco Systems, Alcatel and Fujitsu on network management issues. To be close to its mostly American clientele, it has built a development center in Somerville, N.J., and a branch office in Santa Clara, Calif.
"We're not building a small company," said Mr. Bagchi, 44, who plans to move to New Jersey to run those operations. "We've built large successful companies for other people. We're comfortable with growth."
So far, Mind Tree has hired 437 employees. It plans to add 1,000 more in the next year. The company has a five-year revenue target of $231 million. Yet Mr. Soota said he would not pursue a stock offering for three years. He also wants to have 100 clients before going public.
In part, he is only being realistic. The appetite for information technology start-ups is as sour here as in Silicon Valley. But, his philosophical side showing, Mr. Soota sees a lesson in starting his company in such an unforgiving climate.
"It's a good reminder for India's I.T. industry not to take what we have for granted, or become too greedy," he said.

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
March Brings No Sign Of Improving Climate For Print Advertising

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER and ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Call it the March tornado. The first, unofficial advertising returns for the month are in for newspapers and magazines, and the news is generally becoming worse, not better. Declines, particularly in recruitment advertising, are so sudden, so steep and so pervasive that pessimists suspect this advertising vortex may rival the bad days of the early 1990's.
 What has surprised advertising salesmen and advertising buyers is not so much that the boom of a year ago sputtered out, but the speed at which the latest downturn is sucking advertising away. 
 The stomach-churning quality of the drop-off, analysts, advertising buyers and media executives say, reminds them of the early 1990's and the worst advertising recession since World War II. But the optimists among them say that in a period of compressed economic cycles, good times may return as fast as they left. 
The early months of 2000 were the heights of the good times, and the advertising market was at its peak. These boom times made print media -- particularly newspapers -- increasingly dependent on the very types of revenue that have vanished most quickly. As spending swelled to epic proportions, so did newspapers' dependency on recruitment and national advertising. 
Workers were needed; help-wanted classifieds expanded -- even though some of them leached to the Internet. New-economy Internet companies competed to get the public's attention and old-economy brokerage firms competed to invest the public's 401(k) assets. 
Now there is less demand for workers, and help-wanted sections in markets like San Jose, Calif., and Boston have shrunk a quarter to a third or more compared with last year. When it comes to national brand advertising, newspapers are often the first medium to be cut. Why? Newspaper readers tend to be older and thus less coveted by advertisers. Newspapers tend to be more expensive than other media per reader or viewer. And most important, it is much easier to pull newspaper ads at the last minute. 
Ernie Simon, a group planning director at the advertising agency MindShare, explained: "What you're finding with a lot of clients is that they cut what they can cut quickly. A lot of media have long lead times. So things like spot television advertising and newspapers tend to get cut at the last minute."
With sales falling, he said, companies hoping to make their budgets and give Wall Street the margins they promised decide that "getting money back is their first concern."
The optimists, where they exist, are hard put to find many silver linings, though they do stress that, at least for newspapers, real estate advertising is showing an upward trend and automotive advertising is holding its own in some markets. Also, they say that 2001 should be compared with 1999 or 1998, not the good times of early 2000. Looking forward, they argue that the forces that accelerated the decline could accelerate a recovery.
Right now, signs of weakness are everywhere. Last week the Tribune Company, publisher of The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, reported that in February its overall classified revenue was down 12 percent from February 2000. At The Los Angeles Times, the volume of advertising that reached all readers -- called full-run advertising -- was down 11 percent in February.
At The New York Times, total volume was down 6.9 percent in February, compared with February 2000 -- the steepest monthly percentage decline since the advertising economy turned sour last fall. At The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, the largest of the McClatchy Company's newspapers, advertising revenue was down 8.2 percent in February. 
At The Wall Street Journal, a Dow Jones & Company publication, advertising volume, which rose steeply in early 2000, has dropped off almost as fast. In February 2000, ad volume was 49.5 percent greater than it had been in February 1999. Last month, it was off 35.5 percent.
In magazines, optimism is hard to find. Bill Holiber, the publisher of U.S. News & World Report, said, "In the 20 years I have been doing this, I have never seen such a sudden change down."
"Public companies have made promises to their shareholders," he said. "They have to deliver on those promises. So you're seeing massive cutbacks that we began to see evidence of in the middle of August. There was a kind of denial going on and and then the fourth quarter just shocked everybody. And then instead of getting better, it got even worse this year." 
Total magazine advertising pages for February were down 9.7 percent from last year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
The weekly newsmagazines have taken a particularly hard hit. U.S. News & World Report ran 26 ad pages in its March 19 issue -- a drop of 48 percent from the 51 pages it ran on March 20, 2000, according to a tally by the trade publication Mediaweek. So far this year, U.S. News ad pages are down 15 percent; Time magazine, 11 percent; and Newsweek, a Washington Post Company magazine, 26 percent, according to Mediaweek. The weekly news magazines as a category are carrying 35 percent less advertising than they did last year.
Magazine industry executives say that advertisers, in need of cash, are not buying packages for the year, as they do in good years, or even for a few months, as they did last year. They buy month by month, if at all.
"I call it the caveman mentality," said William P. Kupper Jr., publisher of Business Week, a McGraw-Hill publication. "They stick their head out of the cave and then, whoops, the market goes down again, and they pop their head back in the cave. 
Mr. Holiber of U.S. News agreed that advertisers were skittish. "Last week we thought we had lured back in a bunch of advertisers who we thought had bottomed out as far as they would go, but now they're coming back and cutting back their advertising completely," he said. 
Advertising buyers have their own frustrations. A year ago, ad salespeople from some publications would not return their calls. Now, said Jean Pool, president for operations at MindShare, a unit of WPP, it is her clients who do not call. One way to get them back, she said, is to push for lower advertising rates.
"In a bad economy," she said, "it is our responsibility to drive rates down as low as possible." The idea is to have the lowest possible base when the rates start back up.
When rates drop in one medium, like television, advertisers who are still in the game can channel the savings into other media. Thomas Curley, the publisher of the Gannett Company's USA Today, said he was seeing this. "TV prices are collapsing," he said, which means "there are some pockets of opportunity for us as TV money shifts." He credited this process for bringing his newspaper four large advertising buys the last month.
Advertisers in some categories never left. Jyll F. Holzman, the senior vice president for advertising at The New York Times, said that fashion and banking were up more than 20 percent this year. Gannett's chief executive, Douglas H. McCorkindale, told analysts last week that real estate, telecommunications and grocery advertising were bright spots for the company's newspapers.
Jack Fuller, president of Tribune Publishing, the newspaper division of the Tribune Company, is reluctant to compare the current downturn with 1990 and 1991. He said: "When it's going up they forget that it can go down. When it is going down they're afraid it's never going to come back up." But this time around, he said, "things happen faster."

Preserving Progress Born In Tragedy

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
A TWO-DAY conference about the future of the city's five-year-old Administration for Children's Services begins in Brooklyn this morning. A question not on the program: Will there even be an Administration for Children's Services five years from now? Next year?
This city agency was born from tragedy: the death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo in 1995, tormented and beaten to death by her mother, though several public agencies had known of her plight.
 That failure outraged the city and provoked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani into extricating children's services from the super-large Human Resources Administration in early 1996 and making it an independent agency with its own commissioner, who reported directly to him. He gave the agency his attention and resources, and appointed Nicholas Scoppetta, an old and trusted colleague, to be the commissioner. 
 Nobody would be so brash or naive as to say that the agency has solved the intransigent problems of child poverty, abuse and neglect. But the commissioner points to many changes. "You can be in government for many years, look back and realize nothing has happened. You cannot say that about this agency," he said last week. "You cannot prevent every tragedy; but we have made enormous progress. Now we have to focus on how to maintain that."
An independent panel that has monitored the agency for two years as part of a legal agreement credits the city with making "remarkable progress." Among the improvements: the foster care population has shrunk to under 32,000 from 43,000 four years ago; child care workers have smaller caseloads, get more training and higher salaries; the number of completed adoptions in the last six years (20,075) is 65 percent higher than in six years before; more foster children are being placed in homes in their own neighborhoods, and the city is requiring private agencies to do the same.
Many factors contribute to the progress, starting with years of a healthy economy, a drop in the number of unwed mothers, and an end to the crack epidemic. The reduction in foster care numbers partly reflects a comparison with unusually high numbers after the Izquierdo case.
But Mr. Scoppetta and his agency have made demonstrable improvements, the experts argue. What next? Will a fickle public continue to care? Will the next mayor, who is sure to have his own priorities? 
"The biggest tragedy would be if someone decided, 'This system is all fixed, let's go on to the next problem,' " said Douglas W. Nelson, chairman of the panel that has been overseeing child welfare services and president of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a private philanthropy. "There's been a sustained effort to improve child welfare in New York City, in part made possible by the Administration for Children's Services. Most important now is that there be a continued effort to build on the improvements."
PERPETUATING an independent Administration for Children's Services would not guarantee improvement, but it could, the experts agree, help focus attention and fix accountability.
Mr. Giuliani created the agency by executive order. For it to continue, either the next mayor has to accept this mayor's priorities, the public has to vote for a change in the City Charter or -- the most direct way -- the City Council has to act. Council action doesn't look likely, though.
The reason? Classic. A turf battle.
Mary Pinkett of Brooklyn says she thinks the agency is "far from perfect" and doesn't hide her annoyance that it controls Head Start and day care. They are successful programs now run by an agency directly identified with the mayor. Why not by the larger Human Resources Administration, asks the councilwoman.
Ms. Pinkett, who heads the Committee on Governmental Operations, says she has no intention of acting on a measure to make the Administration for Children's Services an independent agency. And Peter F. Vallone, the Council speaker, who is running for mayor, has no interest in alienating a colleague influential in her community. He could push the issue, but he and other city lawmakers have no plans to do so, several Council members said last week.
So there is no movement to perpetuate the agency. "This is a work in progress," said Mr. Nelson, the chairman of the assessment panel. "The temptation is to say, 'We've had five good years. Let's forget about child welfare.' "
Mr. Scoppetta shares his concern. A lot of other New Yorkers may, too, if their memories stretch back six years, to that terrible time when they and the rest of the world learned about the death of a child named Elisa Izquierdo.

HEADLINE: Harmful Effects Of Acid Rain Are Far-Flung, A Study Finds 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Acid rain in the Northeast is not just about lakes without fish, but also about forests losing their trees and soils that hoard acid before leaching it back out to contaminate local waters all over again, according to a scientific study of upstate New York and New England.
 In short, the problem is more densely wound into the ecosystems it affects than scientists had previously believed, the report says -- and thus harder to fight than it had appeared. 
 "It's a lot more complicated," said Charles T. Driscoll, a professor of environmental engineering at Syracuse University and the lead author of the study, which is to be published today in the journal BioScience.
The study, which examined data going back to the early 1960's, bolsters the conclusion already reached by many scientists that lakes and ponds in New York State and New England are not recovering from acid rain pollution. Even after 30 years of federally mandated air-emissions reductions in industry and at coal-burning power plants that are considered primary acid-rain sources, more than 40 percent of the lakes in the Adirondack Mountains at least periodically have acid levels that harm aquatic life, the study says. 
Although new deposits of airborne acid compounds like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides have declined, the study says that decades of acid buildup in forest soils is still being washed into waterways by erosion and spring runoff. In a paradoxical twist on environmental protection, the study found that some improvements in air quality have also proved to be a rather mixed blessing on the acid-rain front. Airborne pollutants that neutralize acid, like cement dust, partly counteract acid rain. Those pollutants are not falling into the soils in the quantities that they once did.
The report, based in part on data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, comes at a time when the connections between air pollution and the nation's electricity-generating needs have become more complicated. Earlier this month, President Bush said he would oppose mandatory emissions reductions of carbon dioxide, an industrial gas most commonly linked to a different environmental problem, global warming. Mr. Bush said a mandatory reduction could hurt what he called an already stressed energy market.
Congress, meanwhile, is considering legislation that would sharply reduce the amount of acid-rain gases that power plants and other industries could discharge. States in the Northeast, including New York, have sued the owners of power plants in the Midwest, where much of the Northeast's acid-rain pollution originates. They have also asked the federal Environmental Protection Agency to issue new regulations on acid rain, with or without action by Congress.
Some environmental experts say that a confluence of forces is reviving a debate about acid rain that had been mostly quiet in recent years. There is greater public awareness of energy needs, they say, and growing evidence that past legislation to address acidic pollution in the nation's waters has not done the job. 
"From our point of view, whether it's science, economic policy or politics, it's becoming more and more clear -- and this report makes it more urgent -- that we act this year to reduce the pollutants that cause acid rain," said Timothy J. Burke, executive director of the Adirondack Council, a conservation group in upstate New York.
Other experts say the debate is not so clear cut. Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, an industry trade group that backed Mr. Bush's decision on carbon dioxide emissions, said his group would support a long-term effort to reduce the gases that cause acid rain and acid soil. But the current acid rain bills now before Congress go too far, too fast, he said. 
"It's far from clear that such a drastic measure is needed to achieve a valid public policy goal," Mr. Riedinger said. 
Dr. Driscoll of Syracuse said that many conclusions in the Hubbard Brook study had been reached by others. The federal Government Accounting Office, for example, concluded last year that reductions in air emissions had not cleaned up the lakes of the Northeast. But, he said, his group found evidence that acid rain was acting like a web in the northern forests, linking and compounding other problems that had seemed unrelated.
The two-year study concluded that the red spruce and the sugar maple have been hurt in different ways by acidified soils. Many tree deaths that had been attributed to things like insect infestation or drought, the study said, had in fact been hastened by acidic soil that made the trees more vulnerable.
Dr. Driscoll said that the group's research also suggested that the interplay between acid rain and global warming, though caused by different types of industrial gas pollutants, is also more complicated than had previously been believed. In particular, he said, many widely reported tree deaths in parts of the Adirondacks and New England in recent years were attributed mainly to shifts in the regional climate. The research suggests, however, that the trees were weakened first by acidified soils that made them less able to withstand climate changes.

HEADLINE: In the Race to Produce More Power, States Are Faced With Environmental Tradeoffs 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BUCKEYE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
Buckeye is not much to speak of these days, a sleepy, isolated desert town along the Salt River Valley 30 miles west of Phoenix. But the quiet is about to give way. 
 Buckeye is near ground zero in the nation's race to produce more energy and the debate over the environmental tradeoffs that come with it. 
 Just 20 miles west of here, power companies are building three natural gas plants within sight of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the largest energy-producing nuclear facility in the country. Within 40 miles of Palo Verde, four more natural gas plants are planned. 
By 2005, Arizona could have as many as 10 new power plants, most of them in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. The state's power capacity, currently 30,509 megawatts a year, would increase by 5,260 megawatts. One megawatt supports about 1,000 North American homes. Thirteen other plants are in the early stages of approval.
The swirl of activity in Arizona represents an important part of a crash construction effort in the West that began even before California suffered rolling blackouts and sharply rising electricity rates. In the wake of those problems, energy companies have dozens of projects under construction, ready to go or on the drawing board in nine Western states, including California. Though some would use coal, wind or nuclear energy, most plants would be fueled by natural gas. 
In Arizona, the new plants have widespread support to serve the state's fast-growing population and to promote new growth in economically sluggish areas like Buckeye. They have been given a boost by Spencer Abraham, the secretary of energy, who said last week that the nation needed 65 new power plants each year for the next 20 years to satisfy rising demand. 
But air quality experts say that the cumulative effect of the new plants will make pollution worse, not only in smog-plagued Phoenix but also in areas hundreds of miles beyond. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, every new plant powered by natural gas is allowed to generate as many as 249 tons of air pollutants each year. Plants in areas that already exceed federal standards have greater restrictions. At a minimum, the plants in Arizona alone would add thousands of tons of pollutants to the atmosphere. 
Regardless of fuel source, all power plants are subject to rigorous federal and state regulations intended to hold emissions of pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides to levels within federal air quality standards. States are also not permitted to approve a new plant if the added emissions would exceed a given area's standards.
But often they do, as power plant emissions combined with other sources of pollution, like cars and construction vehicles, push an area out of compliance. More than half the regions that the E.P.A. currently cites as failing to meet federal air standards for one pollutant or another -- 70 of 114 -- are in 11 Western states. These so-called nonattainment areas, which require the stricter emission controls, include big cities like Phoenix, Los Angeles and Denver, but also many areas well distant from them. 
A recently completed 10-year survey of 49 national parks and monuments by the National Park Service found the air quality steadily deteriorating in 20 of them, including several parks downwind from Maricopa County -- among them the Grand Canyon in Arizona, Canyonlands in Utah and Mesa Verde in Colorado. In some cases, the air quality violates federal health standards, said Christine L. Shaver, chief of the air resources division of the park service.
In 1998, the last year for which statistics are available, the E.P.A. found that power plants all across the country accounted for two-thirds of all sulfur dioxide emissions and 25 percent of all nitrogen oxide emissions. The agency found that the amount of nitrogen oxides, which affect people suffering from asthma and cardiac conditions, had increased by 3.5 million tons from 1970 through 1998, and that power plants produced more than half of it.
"Most of the authority for approving new plants is at the state level so there's no big overview," Ms. Shaver said. "As growth is moving out of the cities, there has been a smushing out of the pollution, and nobody's looking at the overall impact, only source by source. We're concerned about the cumulative effect."
Pollution in the Grand Canyon and the Petrified Forest National Park in eastern Arizona is so bad, park officials say, that it has produced deterioration in vegetation.
"During the first part of the 1990's, things seemed to improve, but toward the end of the decade they were slipping away," said Carl Bowman, the air quality specialist for the Grand Canyon, referring to the rising levels of nitrates and ozone wafting over his park and others. "We're still at levels that are below health standards for humans, so it's not that people notice yet. But plants do."
The public response to Arizona's plans for more power plants has been largely supportive. In a state where the population has grown 40 percent since 1990, to about 4.8 million, Gov. Jane Dee Hull, a Republican, boasts of being "pretty free-market oriented," and the three-member regulatory panel that approves plant construction has not denied a single permit application for as long as anyone can remember.
Even here in Buckeye, residents have expressed little concern about the possible effects of having so many power plants in a small area.
Jackie A. Meck, general manager of the Buckeye Conservation and Drainage District, said there had been "no opposition whatsoever." His assessment was echoed by Sharon Butler, editor of the weekly Buckeye Valley News, who said: "People here welcome the growth."
Governor Hull said the pollution concerns could be overblown, because as newer, cleaner-burning plants began operating, older, less efficient plants would be shut down.
William A. Mundell, chairman of the Arizona Corporation Commission, the state's regulatory panel, said he was sensitive to concerns about the effects of pollution and any additional problems that each succeeding plant might cause. For example, he said, approval for one of the new plants in the Palo Verde area was granted only on the condition that emission levels meet stricter standards than required.
"At what point do you reach a threshold? I don't know," Mr. Mundell said. "But it seems to me that each plant that goes through environmental safeguards should face stricter and stricter standards."
Despite assurances from state and company officials, the expansion has vocal opponents. They include Cathy Lopez, a paralegal whose 9-year-old son suffers from asthma and bronchitis, conditions aggravated by air pollution. Ms. Lopez is leading the campaign to stop the expansion of a 30-year-old plant in the middle of Gilbert, an eastern suburb of Phoenix and one of the fastest-growing towns in the country.
"My son's pediatrician told us we should get out," she said. "He said anybody who lives within five miles of the plant with asthma or a cardiac condition will have a hard time. We don't want to leave. We love it here. But we may not have any choice."

HEADLINE: Some Say U.S. Lags in Blocking Foot-and-Mouth Disease at the Border 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
With foot-and-mouth disease spreading into a fourth European country last week, there is growing concern that the United States has not done enough to block the disease at the border and that should it invade here, America would be hard pressed to stamp it out.
 If the worst should happen, independent experts and officials say, a failure to exclude the disease or to stop any invasion quickly could devastate American food production and international agricultural trade. 
 In the last two years, the Department of Agriculture has reported 18 emergency outbreaks of foreign plant and animal diseases in the United States, a startling increase from the previous average of one or two a year.
Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said the government was seeking to balance its support for the forces of globalization and the need to protect its $50 billion meat industry. "You've got to be able to protect your infrastructure, your farms and ranches, without being seen as creating trade barriers," Ms. Veneman said in an interview last week. "Clearly with this strain of virulent foot-and-mouth disease we're completely justified in the measures we've taken." 
Last week, as Ireland followed Britain, France and the Netherlands in confirming the blight's spread, American officials voiced confidence in a series of measures aimed at keeping it overseas. The Agriculture Department has set up an emergency hot line to give advice on foot-and-mouth disease, halted the importation of meat and meat products from the European Union and placed ports of entry on heightened alert. 
The department has also added inspectors at airports and border posts and deployed teams of beagles to sniff out hidden meats being brought in by travelers. And, Ms. Veneman said, she has sent 40 scientists to assist in the Europeans' containment efforts and provide her office with daily updates.
Still, some agriculture experts and livestock industry representatives say those steps are not enough. They express fears that the Agriculture Department has nothing close to the resources it needs to protect America's 170 million cattle, sheep and pigs. The experience of northern Europe, which despite its expensive and sophisticated surveillance and tracking systems has failed to contain the disease, has worried many who had once felt safe. 
"Quite frankly the department needs much more resources at all borders, and the White House needs to think about this as a threat to our national economic security," said Dan Glickman, the secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton.
Even ranchers and farmers who are generally supportive of the Department of Agriculture's efforts warn that American ports and borders are too porous. "The U.S.D.A. is doing a commendable job with its resources, but no, it's not what ought to be done," said Beth Lautner, vice president for science and technology at the National Pork Producers Council. "We have a good safety net around our country, but what's very disconcerting is that the U.K. has a good one, too, and is overwhelmed by the disease." 
Britain, which produces vaccines for other nations fighting foot-and-mouth disease, had not had an outbreak since 1967. It has ordered the slaughter of more than 400,000 cows, sheep and pigs, and has still not been able to contain the virus. Last week British government experts predicted that the crisis would continue to grow for months.
Other critics assert that the entire American strategy is too passive, because the war is lost if the disease ever reaches American herds. As in Britain, a severe outbreak here would probably require the government to kill vast numbers of livestock and to quarantine farms, driving up food prices, disrupting transportation and upsetting consumers.
"This policy of wait and see is clearly insufficient," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. Mr. Daschle has called for a full moratorium on the importation of all livestock and meat products from all countries.
To Ms. Veneman, that would be the first shot in a disastrous trade war that could ultimately hurt all kinds of American food and farm exports, valued at $59 billion a year, including $4.5 billion a year of meat. "With 96 percent of the world population living outside the U.S., we have to have those markets abroad," she said. "As the economy becomes more global, so too does the food system."
The livestock industry would be at immediate risk. The foot-and-mouth virus afflicts cloven-hoofed animals and generally reduces their ability to gain weight and produce milk. It is not harmful to people, even if they eat diseased meat. It is spread by direct or indirect contact with infected animals. The disease is endemic in every continent, except North America, Australia and Antarctica.
In theory the threat posed by the European outbreak is no greater than threats from infected animals in parts of Argentina, say, or the Korean peninsula. But the high volume of tourism and trade between the United States and European countries makes that outbreak more serious here. 
In addition, the rise of immigration to the United States from regions where foot-and-mouth is entrenched, especially South America and Asia, has increased the risk of its introduction here, as travelers return with food or other traces from diseased animals.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, warned in 1997 that these pressures were forcing inspectors to take shortcuts that "raise questions about the efficiency and the overall effectiveness of these inspections." 
Rather than earmark more money for agricultural protection, President Bush cut next year's budget for the Agriculture Department by 7 percent, to $17.9 billion. Ms. Veneman said that she would maintain the same spending level for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, her agency's main protection office, but that there were no plans for a substantial increase in its budget.
The United States brings considerable experience to fighting the disease. After six outbreaks in the last century, it set about eradicating the blight from North America. In 1947, Washington led a quasi-military campaign in Mexico and pushed the disease south of Panama. In 1954, the federal government established a secure research facility at Plum Island, off Long Island, to develop vaccines. The last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United States was in 1929.
In recent years, the government also established the National Animal Health Emergency Management System, a network of industry, state and federal veterinary groups and the Department of Agriculture. Last year, the network held a military-style exercise based on the scenario of an outbreak in Texas that simulated the task of identifying, isolating and killing infected animals, then burning or burying their carcasses. 
"We had to have pre-emptive slaughters, a scorched-earth policy taking out herds in front of the disease," said Ms. Lautner of the pork council, who took part in the exercise.
But the United States Animal Health Association, an independent group led by state veterinarians, predicts trouble if there is an outbreak. In a 1998 report, the group warned that the first cases could be misdiagnosed because producers are unfamiliar with the disease; that producers and politicians might resist the slaughter of apparently healthy exposed herds; and that the high density of animals in huge dairies and feedlots might exacerbate the disease's spread.
Joe Annelli, head of emergency services for the animal and plant inspection service, counters that his agency is ready. He has stationed 450 foreign animal disease specialists around the country, who can reach any farm in the continental United States by car in four hours or less.
Mass vaccination is viewed by scientists and livestock producers as a last resort, because the vaccines are not foolproof.
Testing for the disease is limited to the remote Plum Island laboratory, the only site in the United States where live virus can be used. All suspected tissue has to be examined on Plum Island, a procedure that critics say costs precious time.
Because of limits on the use of live virus, there is a ban on the production of the vaccine in the United States, which puts the country at the mercy of foreign producers. Dennis Steadman, head of North American operations for Merial Ltd., which agriculture officials say has the contract to produce vaccine in case of a United States emergency, said he was skeptical that his company could ramp up production in time.
"I'd be surprised," Mr. Steadman said. "Just the sheer size of the livestock population in the U.S. would be a tremendous leap in volume."

HEADLINE: As New Economy Cools, San Francisco Quivers 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 25 

 BODY:
It was noon, when the streets of San Francisco south of Market should have been packed with dot-comers taking long, languorous lunches. But the clutches of three and four young high-tech professionals that once filled the sidewalks were gone, the restaurants that they frequented half empty. 
 A lone panhandler begging for change at a street median had crossed out the "www.i'm broke" he had used to appeal to his audience and scrawled, "Anything helps -- if you can." 
 Life here seems different from what it was just six months ago, when San Francisco was the sizzling center of the Internet universe. 
This is where the players in the New Economy flocked to throw around all that stock-option money gushing like geysers from Internet ventures. Though the big guns like Oracle, Cisco Systems and Intel had their headquarters in Silicon Valley south of the city, every start-up company wanted to be here, sometimes in the worst way. The clamor for office space sent commercial rents soaring, with prices for the first time surpassing Manhattan's, traditionally the highest in the country. 
The city was like one big party, but only a chosen few could fit in the door. The rental vacancy rate was nearly zero, with about 50 people applying for each available unit. Trying to buy a house was even harder, with the sticker price on fixer-upper two-bedroom bungalows in so-so neighborhoods rarely less than half a million dollars. People wondered if the boom that was changing the face of San Francisco would ever let up.
But no one is asking that anymore. The party is over, as done as a fallen souffle. Scores of companies have shut down, restaurants and bars that felt like New Year's Eve every night of the week have quieted down, and For Rent signs dot the once dot-com-saturated neighborhood of South of Market, or SoMa. In the last three months, commercial vacancy rates there have more than doubled, to 18 percent, while the vacancy rate for office space throughout the city has soared to 8 percent from 2 percent last year. Defeated entrepreneurs have gone packing. And the city has five times the available apartments that it did last year, local real estate agents say. 
Every day, with each new announcement of layoffs, company closings and stock market lows, this shaken nexus of the New Economy quivers a little more. (The latest announcement, on Thursday, came from the Charles Schwab Corporation, the nation's largest online brokerage firm, which plans to lay off 3,400 workers.)
And just as the exuberance of the New Economy spilled over from San Francisco to once-overlooked neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area, so does its bust. In 1999, when former Gov. Jerry Brown was sworn in as mayor of Oakland, he staked his four-year term on attracting 10,000 new residents and businesses to the downtrodden downtown. Now, with companies suspending construction on half-finished buildings and others folding up, his goal seems unlikely. North of Oakland, in Emeryville, NorthPoint Communications, a provider of high-speed Internet access, set up a shop last year, helping to revitalize the city. On Thursday, NorthPoint shut down, leaving Emeryville with an empty building and putting close to 1,000 people out of work, there and in San Francisco. 
But it is here in San Francisco, which more than any other city experienced the exuberance of the New Economy, that the changing fortunes seem the most profound. Not that it is beginning to look like a mill town mourning the demise of the railroad. This is still the nation's most expensive large city to live in, with only 10 percent of the population able to afford a median-priced home costing $550,000, according to recent figures from the California Association of Realtors. It remains the city where more people dine out more often than any other, the convention and tourists bureau says.
Still, the mood of the city is anxious and deflated. In January, when sfgirl.com, a Web site for high-tech workers, held its second pink-slip party, 500 people showed up in a driving rainstorm, and many of them said they were glad for the break from a job. But now, with the relentlessness of layoffs, no one seems to be celebrating a forced vacation. "It's not as much fun going to Peet's and swapping stories when you know you might not get another job," said Robert Hahn, a 28-year-old patron of a popular coffee shop who was laid off from his sales job in December and has not found another.
Venture capitalists, who financed many of the ill-fated start-ups, say they have learned their lesson. "No more dot-coms -- no more pipe dreams," said Naveen Singha, who said he had poured money into more than 70 failed companies.
In the real estate market, apartment rents have dropped a bit, said Walter Ellingwood, vice president of Rent Tech, a rental and roommate finding service. "The average one bedroom south of Market was $2,847, and now it's $2,610 -- an 8 percent decrease," Mr. Ellingwood said. "The average two-bedroom was $4,433, and that went down to $3,447 -- that's 22 percent. And there's been a huge decrease in three-bedrooms, from $5,921 to $3,974, or 33 percent."
Noe Valley, which became one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city during the boom because of its easy access to the freeways that lead to Silicon Valley, is also feeling the slide. 
"In the starter-home range of $400,000 to $600,000 -- hard to believe but those are starter homes in San Francisco -- it's still very competitive," said B. J. Droubie of BJ Droubie Real Estate. "On the other hand, we've had listings in the $700,000 to $900,000 range that are not getting that response."
The other day, Ms. Droubie said, she asked a seller to lower the asking price on a $849,000 house on the market for a week and a half to $769,000. "The seller," she said, "was somewhat reluctant."
Some people remain stubbornly optimistic about the present state of the economy here.
Patty Beron, the founder of sfgirl.com, which sponsors the pink-slip parties, thinks the mood at the parties "is still positive." The most recent party in San Francisco, this month, drew 1,300 people, more than twice the one before it.
Nobody is hiring for entry-level positions, Ms. Beron conceded. "So kids just out of college are having a harder time," she said. "But they're young and resilient and they've got their looks, right?"

HEADLINE: For Kerik, There's One Way To Run the Police, at a Sprint 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik stood with an aide at the window of his 14th-floor office, wagging his finger at the street below. He was perplexed. Several enormous ornamental lights outside the headquarters of what he often calls "the greatest, biggest police department in the country" were dark, apparently broken.
 How could this be? 
 The aide, John Picciano, did not take a memo or start to make a windy excuse. He sat down and dialed building maintenance. The lights were fixed immediately, which was precisely the time frame Mr. Kerik had in mind.
"I'm not big on doing things that are a waste of time," Mr. Kerik said. "If it's a waste of time, get rid of it. If it's a bad manager, get rid of them." 
In Mr. Kerik's first seven months as New York's 40th police commissioner, a corps of senior staff members have departed abruptly, either for private jobs or for less visible posts in the department. 
The moves, which seemed unfair to some, helped to fuel an impression of Mr. Kerik as a man in a hurry. His marathon days, filled with community meetings and station house tours, have only burnished his image as an intense manager, the kind who often stands during meetings, prefers briefings to lengthy memos and pounds coffee (half regular, half hazelnut) throughout the day.
Mr. Kerik's decision-making style is described by some as impetuous, by others as decisive. But even those who regard his new programs as incremental or ordinary see little evidence of self-doubt.
"If you bring an issue to Bernie Kerik," said Thomas J. Scotto, president of the union that represents detectives and a self-described Kerik fan, "it is usually resolved within 24 hours."
Mr. Kerik has good reason to act quickly. In eight months, after a new mayor is elected, he stands to lose this job, one he has been dreaming about since 1986, when he was a patrolman walking a beat in an untamed Times Square. So there is little time left to reach his goals: continued crime reduction, improved community relations and resurrected morale.
Early returns have been promising. Crime is down and community relations appear to have improved. No less a police critic than the Rev. Al Sharpton offers faint praise. "My fears were that he would be a puppet of the mayor," Mr. Sharpton said. "I'm not saying he's not, but the strings are a lot looser than we thought they would be."
The morale problem, however, which Mr. Kerik has addressed by repairing station houses and praising dedicated officers, may well require more than paint and pats on the back. The department remains riddled with problems. Recruiting has been sluggish. Retirements continue to soar. And only a few weeks ago, bitterness over low pay led 7,000 officers to picket City Hall.
"Although we have a good dialogue," the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Patrick J. Lynch, said, "there is absolutely no way we could bring morale up to where it should be, where people want to stay on the job, and attract new members, unless we get a livable wage."
The starting salary for an officer is $31,305, under a contract that expired in July 2000.
Mr. Kerik's greatest impact has been in community relations, where he has repaired some damage from incidents like the station house torture of Abner Louima. He has begun surveying public attitudes toward the police, retraining commanders in neighborhood diplomacy and devising ways to measure their responses to local complaints.
The progress has been evident at meetings like a City Council hearing this month where Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, who represents a largely black section of Queens, told Mr. Kerik, "You are, in my estimation, one of the good guys."
But not everyone is charmed. Several critics of police policies say they have had trouble arranging meetings with Mr. Kerik. "His outreach does not include the Civil Liberties Union yet," said Donna Lieberman, the interim director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. 
Mr. Kerik, who formerly ran the Correction Department, has been aided in his outreach efforts by the fact that he grew up in a largely black section of Paterson, N.J., that resembles some New York neighborhoods where many people have grown wary of aggressive police tactics.
His personal style is also quite different from that of his predecessor, Howard Safir, a reserved man who often came across as stiff and defensive. Mr. Kerik is gregarious by nature and sometimes hugs officers at promotion ceremonies or whispers remarks into their ears. This openness has helped him forge ties with police labor leaders, despite the bitter contract negotiations. Several said they had already met more times with Mr. Kerik than they did with Mr. Safir.
Mr. Kerik has also been blessed by seven months of relative calm, free of any highly publicized incident of police brutality.
"Certainly he has made some good moves," said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission. "But people are defined by some sweeping program like Compstat or quality-of-life enforcement, or how they respond to crises. And the new programs were put in some years ago, and thankfully there has not been a crisis, so it's difficult at this point in time to really give him a score."
Mr. Kerik's crime-fighting strategies may amount to little more than tinkering, but the overall approach has worked. Crime for the first 11 weeks of this year is down 10 percent compared with the same period last year. He has reorganized the intelligence division to increase information sharing and expanded the warrant squad, which hunts fugitives.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani chose Mr. Kerik for the police job last August largely because as correction commissioner he won accolades as a manager who slashed overtime and jail violence. But the selection was also a nod to loyalty. Mr. Kerik had served as a campaign bodyguard for the mayor in 1993. Today, Mr. Giuliani is godfather to Mr. Kerik's daughter.
The relationship seemed to work to Mr. Kerik's advantage this year, when he persuaded Mr. Giuliani to begin transferring the Police Department's power to prosecute some officers charged with misconduct to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, a move the mayor had previously avoided.
"Bernie was able to get it done," said Michael P. Jacobson, a friend of Mr. Kerik and a former Giuliani aide who is now a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, "partly because he made an argument on the merits and partly because the mayor has a tremendous amount of trust in him."
Other times, the friendship has seemed a liability. Mr. Kerik seemed to follow the mayor's political agenda, rather than a policing strategy, when he held a press briefing several months ago to attack the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for a minor upturn in airport crime, just as Mr. Giuliani was in the midst of a campaign against the Port Authority. 
Mr. Kerik has also been largely distant from the contract negotiations, saying he supports a raise for officers but views it as the mayor's business, not a prerequisite to better morale. "I don't have much to do with the contract," he told supervisors at a briefing last month.
To repair morale, Mr. Kerik has found new equipment for station houses and has visited police officers on the job, something he says never happened when he walked the streets. Mr. Kerik was so intent on becoming a New York City police officer that he quit a job as a New Jersey jail warden in 1986 and took a $27,000 cut in pay, a financial misstep that helped lead him to declare bankruptcy a year later. In his eight years on the force, Mr. Kerik rose to the rank of third-grade detective, serving undercover in a ponytail to make drug buys, and was decorated for saving his partner's life in a shootout.
He clearly still identifies with those adrenaline-packed days. His cuff links are miniature versions of his old shield. His office wall features pictures of him wielding an M-16. And some nights he still patrols with his security detail, making arrests. Mr. Kerik, a black belt in karate who is built like a fireplug, has made four arrests as commissioner.
"When I was a police officer I was very good at what I did," he said. "My instincts were very good. And the problem is -- it's not a problem -- it kind of never goes away."
Although he does not have a college degree, which is a prerequisite for the rank of captain and above, Mr. Kerik is something of a policy expert on management issues. He says performance indicators can gauge everything from sick time to community relations. Recently, he focused on reducing the average response time to emergency calls. It has dropped to just under 10 minutes from 12 since December.
"What gets measured, gets done," he said. 
As it turns out, however, Mr. Kerik has done little to control police overtime, which is likely to top $290 million this year, more than the total city budget for libraries. That kind of money will become very scarce as the economy struggles. And other minefields await. Many people in the communities he is looking to build bridges to are awaiting his decision on whether to discipline the officers who shot Amadou Diallo. 
If Mr. Kerik survives those shoals, he might like to stay on with a new mayor, his friends said. But he called that talk premature.
"Right now, I just want to do the best job I can," he said. "I don't think I would think about that until after."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Hyperbole still outruns reality when it comes to the state of the wireless Web.

BYLINE:  By Simon Romero 

 BODY:
IN Las Vegas one evening last week, when a group of executives from the wireless industry repaired to a bar in a sprawling Venetian hotel and gambling complex, the mood was grim.
 "Get your barf bag out," said Josh Newman, senior editor of Unstrung, an online magazine covering the wireless industry, who had surveyed some of the hundreds of companies in town for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association's annual conference. "I wish companies would start making money instead of generating hype." 
 Having heard of the failure of several wireless start-ups on the eve of the conference, another executive, Greg Clayman, who is vice president for marketing at the wireless messaging company Upoc, remarked, "At least we have money to last us another 18 months." 
David Eun, a venture capitalist with the investment fund Arts Alliance, which is one of Upoc's main backers, added: "The spigot has closed for all but the worthiest of ventures. I expect a lot of consolidation in the next few months."
As they toasted one another's survival with $6 Heinekens (the bar's Manhattan theme apparently extended to the prices), it was evident that the wireless Internet industry, so full of hope and purpose just a few months ago, is frantically trying to redefine itself. 
Out of fashion are grandiose visions of consumers wearing goggles fitted with three-dimensional maps of cityscapes or wielding mobile phones capable of transmitting live video conferences to every corner of the world. Instead, many of the industry's small companies are focusing on relatively more mundane services, like sending short text messages over mobile phones.
Consider Avogadro, a start-up formed last year in Seattle that is named after Amedeo Avogadro, the 19th-century Italian physicist who expounded on a molecular number so large that its exact size is difficult to comprehend. Founded by Thomas Reardon, a former Microsoft executive who helped create the Internet Explorer Web browser, Avogadro creates short-messaging services for wireless carriers.
Text messages are the terse communications that are especially popular among teenagers in Europe and parts of Asia like the Philippines and Japan. Although such messages are cumbersome for anyone trying to use the tiny numerical keyboard of a cell phone to type a comprehensible sentence, large carriers like Sprint PCS and Verizon Wireless see them as a way to generate revenue without costly equipment upgrades.
"We're thinking about what works today instead of getting dreamy-eyed about the future," Mr. Reardon said. "People want to use their phones to communicate with their voice or their fingertips. We just want to make this easier."
Of course, there were companies in Las Vegas whose business plans appeared to have been cribbed from science fiction. Charmed Technology of Beverly Hills, Calif., sponsored a fashion show of wearable wireless technology, like badges that identify potential sex partners by measuring their pheromone levels or earrings that blink when an e-mail message arrives in an in-box.
WebMessenger, a company formed by Russian entrepreneurs, offered the services of its team of software engineers in Eastern Europe to write wireless code for American companies at a fraction of what it would cost in the United States. 
Mostly, though, the shift toward less ambitious offerings seems to portend a shakeout among mobile Internet companies similar to that among dot-coms. With venture capitalists' skepticism mounting, a number of concerns have pulled the plug in recent days including Netmorf, a software developer that made Web sites readable on hand-held computers. 
"We are deeply saddened to report that Netmorf has ceased its operations," says a notice posted on Netmorf's Web site. "A lead investor in the company's next round of financing withdrew unexpectedly, and there was not sufficient time to secure additional funds given the current business and economic climate."
Rumors circulated among the 30,000 people at the conference last week about which companies would be next. 
Many people learned with trepidation of the job cuts at Metricom, a provider of high-speed wireless Internet connections in San Jose, Calif., that has failed to attract enough customers for its relatively costly $70-a-month service. After Metricom said it would reduce its work force of 800 by 22 percent, Merrill Lynch included it in a roundup of companies the brokerage firm called "likely to exit." 
The shakeout in the wireless industry could translate into victory for the big carriers, whose agents roamed the conference assessing potential alliance partners. 
"Size equals power," said Ron Gerber, chief executive of Angelbeat, a wireless consulting company. "We know that Verizon, Sprint and Cingular will be around in six months. Will most of these other guys? Who knows?"
Of course, the carriers already largely control access to the mobile Internet with their "walled gardens," as the industry refers to the controlled menu of choices the carriers make available to their customers through the browser software on their mobile phones. To scale the garden's walls one needs to enter a Web site address, a trying and time-consuming exercise on the tiny number pad. Those obstacles help explain the limited and limiting nature of the mobile Internet compared with the desktop PC version. 
One of the more intriguing issues raised during the convention was whether the mobile and desktop Webs were even of the same species. In a speech, Craig Barrett, chief executive of Intel, argued that there was no such thing as the wireless Internet. 
After all, it is commonly acknowledged that it is almost impossible to surf the Web on a cell phone, or even a pager with a small keyboard, with the same ease as on a desktop computer. And it is hard to assert that there is an interconnected group of wireless Web sites that are easily accessible. Steven A. Ballmer, the Microsoft chief executive, who also spoke at the conference, agreed with Mr. Barrett's assessment.
To be sure, the nascent wireless Internet industry and the dot-coms have one thing in common -- that their development resembles more a route littered with failed experiments than a clean Roman road. 
"It's a dream for people like me," said Douglas Tweet, an independent merchant banker from Vancouver, who roamed the conference in search of ailing companies eager to be acquired by larger concerns. For a hefty percentage fee, Mr. Tweet, a colorful character who peppers his speech with citations of the Bible and other religious texts, puts together such deals. "What's carnage to some," he said, "is carrion to others."

HEADLINE: Another Big Roundup For Mr. Malone; 
A U.S. Cable Baron Bets His Money Overseas

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
John C. Malone spent three decades building Tele-Communications Inc. into a national cable power, before selling it to AT&T in 1998 for $31.8 billion -- some $2 billion of which went directly to him in the form of AT&T stock.
 Now Mr. Malone, 59, has set his sights on building another cable empire, even bigger than Tele-Communications. Only this time, the cable systems are overseas and Mr. Malone is not the hands-on manager. Representing him instead is a team made up of a father and a son, who face some severe cultural, technical and financial challenges as they seek to carry out Mr. Malone's strategy in 22 countries on 4 continents. 
 The father is a crusty, 74-year-old executive, Gene W. Schneider, an old-line Denver cable man who built his own big system, United Cable, before selling it to Mr. Malone a dozen years ago. Since then, Mr. Schneider has put together a Denver-based international cable holding company, United Global Communications, in which Mr. Malone is becoming the controlling shareholder. 
United Global's biggest operating company, in turn, is a European collection of cable companies run from London by Mr. Schneider's 46-year-old son, Mark, a former Washington communications lawyer.
United Global's reach includes more than 1.2 million cable subscribers in Latin America, Australia and the Philippines, but it is the European operation --United Pan-Europe Communications, or U.P.C. -- that is by far the biggest piece. 
U.P.C. represented about 70 percent of the parent company's $900 million in revenue for the nine months of 2000 ended Sept. 30, the most recent numbers United Global has reported. Owning or holding a stake in cable systems with 8.3 million subscribers in 14 European countries plus Israel, U.P.C. will test whether the Malone-Schneider team can successfully provide programming to a culturally and linguistically diverse set of audiences, while also overhauling the systems for the digital era. 
U.P.C. plans to spend $5 billion over the next five years to modernize its systems and provide set-top boxes to offer more than 100 digital channels with cable services and video on demand, as well as telephone service and high-speed Internet access. But financing the effort is no sure bet. U.P.C.'s already sizable debt -- about $6 billion -- and current economic uncertainties here and overseas make the risks difficult to calculate. 
The elder Mr. Schneider, who is United Global's chairman, acknowledges the challenges of upgrading the European systems and persuading consumers to take more services. "But when it comes down to it," he said, "the things people like and want over there are not that different than in the U.S." 
Europe, with its disparate tongues, does not offer the economies of scale for cable programming that are available in the United States. And yet, by using all those additional channels to offer programming either dubbed or subtitled in a variety of languages, U.P.C. can tap into a wealth of existing programming. 
And as it happens, a number of those cable services -- including the Discovery Channel, USA Networks and QVC --are partly owned by Liberty Media, the programming company of which Mr. Malone is chairman and in which he wields voting control.
This means that if European consumers show an appetite for more cable channels and other communications services, Mr. Malone stands to benefit handsomely -- not only through the success of United Global and U.P.C. but through Liberty's other investments, too. 
"Control of cable distribution allows U.P.C. to favor programmers in which Liberty has an interest," said Tom Wolzien, an analyst who follows cable for the investment firm of Sanford Bernstein. "It is similar to what Mr. Malone did in the U.S."
Today, U.P.C.'s average European analog system has 30 channels; after the digital rollout, most systems are to have more than 100. Roger Metz, an analyst who follows U.P.C. for Janco Partners, a Denver investment bank, said Liberty's programming could help fill that bigger pipeline. He noted that U.P.C. had established a translation center in Amsterdam where programming from the Discovery Channel and elsewhere can be dubbed or subtitled in 11 different languages and converted to a digital format. "U.P.C. can always subtitle shows, and Liberty has stakes in many different programmers that U.P.C. can distribute," Mr. Metz said.
Whether consumers will have a greater appetite for foreign programming remains to be seen, of course. In the Netherlands, where English is widely spoken and where U.P.C. has 2.2 million subscribers, some two-thirds of the channels on the current analog system are already of foreign origin. But in bigger countries, like Germany (1.4 million U.P.C. subscribers) and France (382,000 U.P.C. subscribers) the current portion of foreign programming is much smaller. 
U.P.C. has already upgraded many of its systems, and nearly half of the 10 million homes in its markets could receive digital cable. But the company is only now beginning to market digital television services and has just 24,000 digital subscribers around Europe -- although it predicts that the number will grow to 3.5 million homes within seven years. 
U.P.C.'s high-speed Internet access and Internet-based telephone service are attracting more customers so far; more than a half-million households have signed up for one or both. U.P.C. expects the numbers for all of these services to take off later this year when it begins offering customers a combination of digital cable, Internet and telephone service through a set-top box called the Da Vinci.
Mr. Malone, who declined to comment for this article, is betting heavily on the Schneiders. His main investment vehicle, Liberty Media, is in the midst of a deal in which it will put an additional $1.4 billion into United Global and transfer title to systems Liberty owns in Argentina, in exchange for United Global stock. 
When that deal is completed, Liberty will have spent about $2.5 billion in cash and assets to own 43 percent of United Global's equity. Liberty will also control 81 percent of the votes. 
U.P.C., meanwhile, has a rash of European acquisitions pending. If they all go through, U.P.C.'s operations will be the cornerstone of Mr. Malone's overseas empire, with partial or total ownership of systems serving 8.5 million subscribers in Europe and Israel. 
And those subscribers, together with United Global's cable holdings in Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and the Philippines could give Mr. Malone effective control of systems with nearly 12 million subscribers. That would be even more, in other words, than the 10.5 million subscribers Tele-Communications Inc. had when Mr. Malone sold it to AT&T. 
What is more, those 12 million do not include a pending deal by Liberty and the London investor group Klesch & Company to pay about $2.4 billion for 55 percent of Deutsche Telekom's cable operation, which serves 10 million German subscribers.
"In the end, Malone is making a huge bet that he can roll up all these companies and one day sell them to a larger buyer at a big premium, as he did with Tele-Communications," predicted Mr. Wolzien, the analyst. (When Mr. Malone announced the sale of TCI to AT&T, the terms represented a 31 percent premium to TCI's stock price.)
For now, there are no definite plans to combine Liberty's separate European cable holdings with U.P.C.'s systems. "We may cooperate on buying a lot of services," Mark Schneider said, alluding to set-top boxes, for example, which could yield big discounts through volume purchases. But the interests of Mr. Malone and the Schneiders are nonetheless tightly interwoven: he has a 10-year agreement that requires him to vote his United Global shares with the father and son. 
And it is the Schneiders who are making the day-to-day decisions, particularly the senior Mr. Schneider, who is often on the phone in Denver with his son in London. "I talk with my father every day," Mark Schneider said. 
The elder Mr. Schneider made clear that parent and parent company call the shots. "Nothing is done in U.P.C. that the United GlobalCom board does not approve," he said. "It's like General Electric, which has subsidiaries all over the world." 
Right now, the European part of United Global's world is under enormous pressure. Mark Schneider has been forecasting that U.P.C.'s sales will grow from the current annual level of about $1 billion to more than $5 billion a year by 2006. By then, he predicts, subscribers who now spend an average of $10 a month will be spending $25 a month, for a package of entertainment, Internet and telephone services. 
But U.P.C. has only enough money to meet its capital spending program through 2002, when the digital upgrade would not yet be complete. If revenues do not grow sufficiently, U.P.C. could be out of cash in 2003 and would have to find other ways to raise money.
Already, the company has trimmed its capital spending budget to $1 billion a year, from $1.7 billion previously, with most of the cuts coming in Eastern Europe. There, in an illustration of the so-called digital divide, U.P.C. is reluctant to add to its debt because lower household incomes mean smaller potential revenue increases from overhauling the networks.
Although U.P.C. could seek additional financing from Liberty or even Microsoft, which owns 6.5 percent of United Global, such deals could dilute the value of other shareholders' stock. 
No wonder, especially in the current economic climate, that Wall Street is skittish about Mr. Malone's European campaign. United Global's shares closed at $10.875 on Friday, down from a 52-week high of $95. Separately, American depository receipts of U.P.C., which trade on Nasdaq, closed at $6.50 on Friday, compared with $63.50 a year ago. Meanwhile, Liberty's stock, which was trading above $30 last March, ended last week at $14.02. 
And U.P.C.'s bonds are trading at a 30 percent to 40 percent discount to their par value, according to Areyah Bourkoff, a fixed-income analyst at UBS Warburg. 
Dennis Leibowitz, who follows the international cable industry for Credit Suisse First Boston, said that "investors worry that the cash flow won't grow adequately to pay off the high debt load."
Michael Graham, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, raised similar concerns in a recent report on U.P.C.. "Longer term, the company faces a fairly significant financing gap, which we believe will need to be addressed before the stock is viewed as low risk enough for many institutional portfolios," Mr. Graham wrote. 
Technology is another source of concern. 
In many cases, the Schneiders are buying antiquated European systems that do not easily convert to modern digital networks. 
In the Netherlands, for example, the pace of U.P.C.'s digital conversion last fall was too slow to keep pace with customer demand for the company's high-speed Internet service, Chello Broadband. Although the consumer complaints and the critical local newspaper articles have subsided, "the service has not been all that good," said Danny van Doesburg, an analyst with F. van Lanschot Bankiers, in Amsterdam.
And U.P.C. has encountered various bugs with the software that Microsoft developed for cable set-top boxes. As a result, the set-top boxes U.P.C. has started rolling out in the Netherlands use more limited-capability software from the Dutch company Royal Philips Electronics. And later this year, in Austria, U.P.C. will introduce set-top software from Liberate Technologies, an American company. Elsewhere, the company has not decided what software to use. 
Mark Schneider said those early problems were simply the inevitable challenges of starting a new technology-dependent business. "This is a period of building something for the future," he said. "People have to take a longer view." 
Certainly, the long view is what the empire builder John Malone seems once again to be taking.

HEADLINE: In America; 
The Mask Comes Off

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Is this what the electorate wanted?
 Did Americans really want a president who would smile in the faces of poor children even as he was scheming to cut their benefits? Did they want a man who would fight like crazy for enormous tax cuts for the wealthy while cutting funds for programs to help abused and neglected kids? 
 Is that who George W. Bush turned out to be?
An article by The Times's Robert Pear disclosed last week that President Bush will propose cuts in the already modest funding for child-care assistance for low-income families. And he will propose cuts in funding for programs designed to investigate and combat child abuse. And he wants cuts in an important new program to train pediatricians and other doctors at children's hospitals across the U.S. 
The cuts are indefensible, unconscionable. If implemented, they will hurt many children.
The president also plans to cut off all of the money provided by Congress for an "early learning" trust fund, which is an effort to improve the quality of child care and education for children under 5.
What's going on?
That snickering you hear is the sound of Mr. Bush recalling the great fun he had playing his little joke on the public during the presidential campaign. He presented himself as a different kind of Republican, a friend to the downtrodden, especially children. He hijacked the copyrighted slogan of the liberal Children's Defense Fund, and then repeated the slogan like a mantra, telling anyone who would listen that his administration would "leave no child behind."
Mr. Bush has only been president two months and already he's leaving the children behind.
There are many important reasons to try to expand the accessibility of child care. One is that stable child care for low-income families has become a cornerstone of successful efforts to move people from welfare to work.
Members of Congress had that in mind when they allocated $2 billion last year for the Child Care and Development Block Grant. That was an increase of $817 million, enabling states to provide day care to 241,000 additional children.
Now comes Mr. Bush with a proposal to cut the program by $200 million.
Is that his idea of compassion?
The simple truth is that the oversized tax cuts and Mr. Bush's devotion to the ideologues and the well-heeled special interests that backed his campaign are playing havoc with the real-world interests not just of children, but of most ordinary Americans.
Mr. Bush is presiding over a right-wing juggernaut that has already reneged on his campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions (an important step in the fight against global warming); that has repealed a set of workplace safety rules that were designed to protect tens of millions of Americans but were opposed as too onerous by business groups; that has withdrawn new regulations requiring a substantial reduction in the permissible levels of arsenic, a known carcinogen, in drinking water; and that has (to the loud cheers of the most conservative elements in the G.O.P.) ended the American Bar Association's half-century-old advisory role in the selection of federal judges, thus making it easier to appoint judges with extreme right-wing sensibilities.
The administration of George W. Bush, in the words of the delighted Edwin J. Feulner, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, is "more Reaganite than the Reagan administration."
Grover Norquist, a leading conservative strategist, said quite frankly, "There isn't an us and them with this administration. They is us. We is them."
Mr. Bush misled the public during his campaign. He eagerly donned the costume of the compassionate conservative and deliberately gave the impression that if elected he would lead a moderate administration that would govern, as much as possible, in a bipartisan manner.
Last October, in the second presidential debate, Mr. Bush declared, "I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges, like global warming."
And he said, as usual, "No child should be left behind in America."
He said all the right things. He just didn't mean them.

HEADLINE: The New Mayoral Debate 

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom is that this year's mayoral campaign will be a search for a gentler version of Rudolph Giuliani, someone who can preserve the city's gains without bruising its spirit. But in fact this should be a big-picture election. The candidates will have an opportunity to move beyond Mr. Giuliani's signature issues of crime and welfare reform and outline a new agenda for a city that has to worry less about safety and more about prosperity, civic harmony, new development and infrastructure. 
 No one should underestimate Mr. Giuliani's impact on New York City's image and its crime statistics. Only 10 years ago, in a famous Time magazine article on "The Rotting of the Big Apple," one concerned New Yorker was bemoaning how crime was "tearing at the vitals of this city." In recent years, a different city has emerged. The next mayor will have to repair the strained relations with minority communities that have resulted from police excesses. But it is also true that a promise to maintain freedom from crime and fear will be table stakes for candidates in the mayor's race. 
 That said, what else must they bring to the table? In our view, education now becomes central to this campaign. The next mayor will have to get the State Legislature to strengthen mayoral control of the schools. He will have to expand the $12 billion school budget to extend the school day and school year, lower class size and boost teacher salaries. Next come an array of social services and development issues that could be especially difficult if the country goes into an economic slide that pinches the city's $40 billion budget. The city faces chronic problems in low-income housing, foster care, child care and health services for the poor. 
To be sure, a mayor would have to pick a few main priorities from this crowded list. That task will be complicated by an unusual mix of development opportunities that will arise in the next four years whether the mayor is one of four Democrats -- Fernando Ferrer, Alan Hevesi, Peter Vallone and Mark Green -- or Michael Bloomberg, a possible Republican candidate.
The city must continue its development of the Hudson River Park and the larger work of reclaiming decaying industrial waterfront for parks and commerce. But those tasks are simple compared with the needed development of Midtown West, the area between Penn Station and the river. The city could use a more expansive stadium-convention-center complex to augment the Javits Center. But the next mayor must assure that the private partners -- perhaps the 2012 Olympics or a pro team -- add a significant share to the hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars that would be needed for new subway and train lines. 
Indeed, transportation probably ranks second only to education in presenting multiple challenges to the next mayor. He will need to confront mass-transit debt, get a fairer shake from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and complete the Second Avenue subway. 
Then there is the question of atmospherics. We take it as a given that each would try to match the successes of the Giuliani years and repair its rents in the civic fabric. But we also want to hear the candidates' ideas for enhancing New York's place as a world cultural center and for making City Hall a more open, welcoming place.
In some ways, Mayor Giuliani has made his job look easy. He will linger in the city's political lore. But the next mayor needs a vision that is not simply a revision of the Giuliani approach.

HEADLINE: Despite Emboldened Critics, Jesse Jackson Isn't Yielding 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 25 

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson could not have picked a better place to make his point. 
 It was a high school basketball championship game at the United Center, the huge arena where the Chicago Bulls usually play, and it was packed to the rafters. 
 When Mr. Jackson arrived unannounced to take a courtside seat, the crowd's reaction was explosive. There was thunderous applause, scattered standing ovations, teenagers squealing and whooping. Throughout the game, people embraced him, slapped his back or asked for autographs. 
"Do you see people reacting to me adversely tonight?" Mr. Jackson asked. "Do you see how the people are responding?" 
Mr. Jackson's point was obvious: that despite his recent round of troubles -- from the disclosure in January that he had fathered a child during an extramarital affair to questions about the way he raises money for his nonprofit groups -- his popularity was as strong as ever.
But while Mr. Jackson's fans and allies here and elsewhere clearly remain committed, it is equally clear that he is enduring the rockiest episode of his four decades in public life. 
Longtime conservative opponents have been energized, filing complaints with the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission over the financial practices of Mr. Jackson's organizations.
Ambitious members of the black clergy have begun suggesting publicly that Mr. Jackson's role as the nation's pre-eminent African-American figure is on the wane and that the time is right for a new generation of leadership. And a spate of newspaper articles and columns, concentrating mostly on the fact that Mr. Jackson's groups accept money from corporations he criticizes, have forced him to spend time defending his operation.
"He's going through, without a doubt, the deepest valley he has gone through," said Marshall Frady, the author of several biographies, including one of Mr. Jackson.
"Among the conventional power estate, I assume a number who have kind of accommodated him, indulged him and abided him will see this as a marvelous opportunity to get him out of their hair," Mr. Frady said.
The disclosures come at a time of great paradox for Mr. Jackson, 59. In some ways he is now a more respected member of the establishment than ever before. When Bill Clinton was president, he was a special envoy to Africa and persuaded Mr. Clinton and others to sign on to his antipoverty campaign. 
Mr. Jackson was also a high-profile counselor to Mr. Clinton when the president's affair with a White House intern became public and led to his impeachment. And for the last several years, Mr. Jackson has been holding conventions on Wall Street to persuade hundreds of business leaders to invest in minority businesses.
Yet at the same time, Mr. Jackson's political luster has dimmed considerably from 1984 and 1988, when he made bids for the presidency. At last summer's Democratic National Convention, he was sidelined during the prime-time events. 
Among blacks, the attitudes toward Mr. Jackson seem just as contradictory, if not more so. Some civil rights leaders, like the Rev. Al Sharpton, suggest he has become too caught up in the political mainstream, while some black ministers believe he is still too much of an outsider. 
Even before Mr. Jackson's recent troubles, a group of 20 lesser-known black ministers, veering away from Mr. Jackson's drumbeat of criticism of President Bush, wrote to Mr. Bush to congratulate him on his victory. Last week the same group embraced Mr. Bush's proposal to give religious organizations more access to federal money.
Here in his home base, where his every step reverberates loudly, Mr. Jackson has come under intense scrutiny. Some columnists and political consultants, typically those who have not been Jackson loyalists, are accusing him of hypocrisy, particularly over the affair and his acceptance of money from corporations that he criticizes for not having more minority involvement. Others are more upset that he has left himself open to attack. 
"What he did was put everything at risk by brazen, hypocritical and reckless behavior," said Delmarie Cobb, who was Mr. Jackson's national traveling press secretary in 1988 but has since had friction with his organizations. "Yes, they're out to get you," Ms. Cobb said of Mr. Jackson's critics. "What are you supposed to do -- help them? Give your enemies ammunition?" 
Further complicating matters for Mr. Jackson, other prominent blacks have begun to suggest that he is past his prime. In a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine, Mr. Sharpton compared him with an aging pugilist. "Muhammad Ali can't fight no more, but he's still a great champion," Mr. Sharpton said.
David Bositis, a specialist in black politics at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, said: "You have white conservatives who would just as soon like Jesse to drop dead. You have black conservatives who would love Jesse to get out of the way. And for somebody like Al Sharpton, clearly if Jesse was out of the way it would give Sharpton more room to stretch his legs."
Mr. Jackson says there is more than enough room for other black leaders: "The fact that there is emerging more voices, that is a good thing. Who is the pre-eminent white leader? Is it Trent Lott? Is it George W. Bush? Dick Cheney?"
Mr. Jackson's troubles began in mid-January, when The National Enquirer reported that he had fathered a child with Karin L. Stanford, formerly the executive director of the Citizenship Education Fund, one of Mr. Jackson's four interconnected groups. When Ms. Stanford left the organization that year and moved to Los Angeles, Mr. Jackson's groups paid her $35,000 in relocation expenses and consulting fees. 
After that, a conservative watchdog group, the National Legal and Policy Center, filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service claiming that the Citizenship Education Fund violates its tax-exempt status by threatening to oppose corporate mergers and then accepting contributions from those corporations. 
The American Conservative Union has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission contending that Mr. Jackson's Rainbow/-PUSH Coalition had accepted money from the Democratic Party in violation of a nonprofit organization's obligation to be nonpartisan.
Mr. Jackson then released detailed information on his organizations' spending showing that the Citizenship Education Fund failed to list Ms. Stanford and other staff members on a tax form, an omission Mr. Jackson and his chief financial officer said was an oversight that they would correct by filing an amended return.
He also says his organizations have begun a search for a chief operating officer to make them more professional and accountable.
Many of the questions concern what has become the major way Mr. Jackson's groups now raise money: grants by corporations whose merger plans Mr. Jackson initially objected to by criticizing the corporations' records on minority contracting or serving low-income consumers. Companies like SBC and Ameritech contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his groups after Mr. Jackson objected to their mergers. 
Some of the companies ended up contracting with minority businesses run by Mr. Jackson's friends. Ameritech, for instance, sold some of its wireless communications business to Chester Davenport, a Jackson supporter. Mr. Davenport and other minority businesspeople who benefit from Mr. Jackson's efforts often contribute to his organizations, too, helping swell their coffers to about $17 million last year. 
Mr. Jackson says his organizations were doing nothing improper or even unusual. He argues that he is helping corporations by showing them how to find minority business partners and penetrate minority markets. And he says that while he is friendly with many of the minority businessmen he introduces to the corporations, he offers companies several names and does not expect them to choose from his list.
"The same people that you challenge one day, once they come around and honor the law, then we build relationships with them," Mr. Jackson. "Of course that's what we do. It is legal, appropriate and effective."
He added that "those who benefit, contribute" to the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition or his other groups. "Of course they do." 
Critics have also questioned why two of Mr. Jackson's sons, Jonathan and Yusef, both on the board of the Citizenship Education Fund, received a lucrative beer distributorship from Anheuser-Busch although they had no experience in the beer industry. Mr. Jackson, who organized a boycott of Anheuser-Busch in the early 1980's to protest its minority hiring practices, said his sons were qualified to run such a business.
Mary Mitchell, a columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, said, "The point is that a group of people surrounding Mr. Jackson has profited from his civil justice involvement, and I think that's disturbing." Ms. Mitchell has also drawn attention to Mr. Jackson's income: $120,000 from Rainbow/PUSH, $260,000 for his CNN talk show and about $50,000 for speaking engagements.
Such criticism, though, has produced a backlash of its own. Laura Washington, editor and publisher of The Chicago Reporter, a journal about race and poverty, said that many people were "angry and disappointed" with Mr. Jackson but angrier at his black critics, because "that kind of criticism hurts the movement." Indeed, African-American radio shows here have been deluged by callers lambasting Mr. Jackson's critics.
Mr. Bositis of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies said many blacks saw the financial criticisms as harassment or a setup. And he said mainstream black political leaders were "entirely behind" Mr. Jackson "because many of them have events, demonstrations, marches, and have relied upon Jesse to come and speak, to get people enthused." 
Reactions to Mr. Jackson's current problems are so varied in part because he has long been seen as a man of contradictions. For example, his call-and-response cadences make him very effective at stirring people but can also obscure his detailed knowledge of complex issues. And boundless energy sometimes propels him into causes that some consider tangential or trivial. 
Mr. Jackson rebuffs suggestions that he might be weakened by the recent accusations. "In baseball, you cannot stay in the dugout just because you struck out," said Mr. Jackson, who is famously fond of sports metaphors. "In boxing you're measured by how well you can take a punch and not get punch-drunk."
Some observers say Mr. Jackson will rebound, partly because he has not tried to shirk responsibility for his out-of-wedlock child.
Ms. Washington of The Chicago Reporter said Mr. Jackson might be able to capitalize on the fact that Republicans are running Washington. "I think there's a certain segment of the community that believes this is a conspiracy to hurt him, and piling on by the media works to his advantage also," she said. 
Others think Mr. Jackson's sheer perseverance will keep him aloft. Before the basketball game two weeks ago, Jackson coached volunteers on a new campaign to get Chicago parents more involved in their children's education. 
"It's better to get ahead than to get even," he told the volunteers, as if reassuring them about his personal strategy. "Better to get there limping than to never make it out the door because you got even."

HEADLINE: Mr. Annan's Winning Record 

 BODY:
Kofi Annan's candidacy for a second five-year term as United Nations secretary general is welcome and deserves the strong endorsement President Bush gave it on Friday. Since taking office in 1997, Mr. Annan has strengthened the U.N.'s management and moral credibility and repaired its once-frayed ties with Washington. Further reforms are needed to enable the organization to live up to its founding ideals. A second term would allow Mr. Annan to make additional changes and cement a constructive relationship with the new Bush administration and Congress. 
 Mr. Annan's current term expires Dec. 31. To serve again he needs the support of the Security Council, including all five permanent members. Approval of the Council's choice by the General Assembly is usually a formality. 
 Mr. Annan's first four years have brought significant management reforms and leaner budgets. Without those achievements, and changes in the formula allocating international contributions, Richard Holbrooke, the former American representative, would not have been able to persuade Congress to begin repaying America's billion dollars in back U.N. dues. 
But Mr. Annan has been more than a competent administrator. He commissioned tough reviews of past U.N. peacekeeping failures in Rwanda and Bosnia, even though he led the peacekeeping department during those operations. For the past year he has pressed member nations to make peacekeeping more effective. He has also emerged as a voice of conscience on a variety of international issues, especially the problems of Africa and the fight against AIDS.
In other areas, for example Iraq, his effectiveness has been undermined by damaging divisions on the Security Council. It is difficult for any secretary general to uphold the authority of U.N. economic sanctions and weapons inspections if leading Council members like Russia and France are determined to weaken them. 
If given a second term, Mr. Annan must strengthen the understaffed peacekeeping department while continuing to curb patronage and wasteful spending elsewhere in the U.N. bureaucracy. At last year's Millennium Summit, Mr. Annan set ambitious goals for combatting poverty and disease. To this end, he has campaigned to make AIDS drugs available and affordable to those who need them. This work must continue as the epidemic spreads through Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.
Mr. Annan's re-election bid has won strong endorsement from the Organization of African Unity. Asian nations seem prepared to defer their own claim to the secretary general's job under the U.N.'s informal regional rotation system. 
A successful secretary general must court Washington and the Security Council's other permanent members -- Britain, France, Russia and China. Those countries generally decide when to impose or lift international sanctions on misbehaving countries and where to send peacekeeping missions. The United States, Europe and Japan provide most of the organization's finances. But the secretary general must also be a voice for the needs of smaller countries and the 50 percent of the world's people who live on less than two dollars a day. Mr. Annan has managed both roles with competence and grace and should be kept on the job.

EASLICK, DAVID K.

 BODY:
 EASLICK-David K. Longtime telephone company executive and civic and community leader, died Wednesday, March 14, in Naples, Fla., where he had wintered away from his Grosse Pointe Farms home for more than 20 years. He was 80. Mr. Easlick graduated from University High in Ann Arbor and then earned a B.A. degree from the University of Michigan in 1942.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
On Evil and the Citizen, No Answers Are Easy

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
It's rare to walk out of a play and wish it had been longer. But Abby Mann's post-Holocaust drama, "Judgment at Nuremberg," which opened on Broadway yesterday at the Longacre Theater, is a bit too brisk and trim for its own good. This is not to say that the show's two and a half hours fly by but rather that Mr. Mann's famous story about Nazi judges on trial before an American tribunal doesn't shrink comfortably to stage time and space. The play feels edited, nipped and tucked, in short, adapted.
 That's hardly surprising. The material was drawn, of course, from the last round of the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, and Mr. Mann first rendered it in a 1959 teleplay and subsequently as a movie script and a novel. But the constraints of the stage -- no cameras, no intercutting between scenes, no close-ups -- and perhaps a fear of the theater audience's diminished attention span seem to have foisted a need to economize on Mr. Mann and the director, John Tillinger. 
 And for those who remember Stanley Kramer's 1961 film version, the play may be particularly attenuated by the comparison it will inevitably stir. Chiefly what has been excised is the centrality of the lead American jurist, Dan Haywood, an obscure district court judge whose fundamental open-mindedness -- "I'm a rock-ribbed Republican who thinks Roosevelt was a great man," he says at one point -- isn't quite masked by a backwoods affect.
One of the strengths of the three-hour film is that it is painstaking in illustrating Haywood's German education. Mr. Mann's Oscar-winning screenplay told its story largely through Haywood's experience, and in Spencer Tracy's somber and steely performance his delving into the lives of ordinary Germans who submitted to Hitler becomes a powerful narrative all by itself, the story of a fair man bending over backward to see the world from a perspective that baffles and horrifies him.
Here Haywood walks a shortened path; his travels around Nuremberg and his interactions with Germans have been cut way back. He is played by George Grizzard, whose silvery white hair is reminiscent of Tracy's but whose characterization is not. A North Carolinian in the play (in the film, Haywood was from Maine), Grizzard's Haywood comes equipped with a cheery Southern drawl (at first, anyway; he eventually loses the accent) and a hickness that give him an Andy of Mayberry aspect. It's unwisely diminishing, but it is supported by the script, which makes Haywood far more naive than he needs -- or ought -- to be.
At one point Haywood asks his aide, a black military officer, "Hard to believe it really happened, isn't it?" and then is completely dumbfounded when the aide responds: "Not for me. I grew up in Texas." And an intimate conversation between Haywood and a general's widow (Marthe Keller, in a striking if abbreviated turn) is configured into a first-act finale that brings the lights down with cringe-inducing sappiness. "What the hell happened in this country?" Haywood asks shaking his fist at the air. "I've got to find out. I have to."
Still, if the play has sacrificed some narrative depth, it does maintain a fullness of legal and moral argument. The show's strength is in the courtroom scenes. They are of course written to raise provocative questions: What is the responsibility of individuals caught in a seemingly irresistible wave of evildoing? Were most Germans in the dark, as they claimed, about the purpose of Nazi camps? Would a conviction of the judges amount to a condemnation of all Germans? Politics is involved as well. During the trial the Russians invade Czechoslovakia, making conquered Germany a potentially pivotal American ally, perhaps not worth offending with a verdict based strictly on laws and moral imperatives.
So key questions apply to both the Germans on trial and Americans trying them. At what point does patriotism part company with virtue? What man is fit to judge another? On James Noone's set, three walls of dark, mirrored panels reinforce the idea that the issues can be viewed from many angles; at the same time the pure awfulness of mass murder hovers over the trials in photographs of unidentified victims projected across the mirrors like strips of celluloid. Against this backdrop the frantic rhetorical battle to define justice is staged by Mr. Tillinger at a tension-ratcheting gallop and skillfully performed by a company that includes Robert Foxworth as the American prosecutor; Joseph Wiseman and Michael Mastro as prosecution witnesses; Maximilian Schell as the leading defendant, Ernst Janning, a once unassailable jurist now tormented by his accession to Nazi edicts; and Michael Hayden as the German defense lawyer Oscar Rolfe, the role that 40 years ago made Mr. Schell a star.
This production may do the same for Mr. Hayden, whose square-shouldered, dark good looks recall the youthful Mr. Schell and whose poise and fervor as he mounts his increasingly persuasive defense are mesmerizing. His arguments -- that the judges merely acted according to existing law; that working within the system allowed them to help more people than they could have otherwise; and that placing blame on them is unfair when so many others are equally culpable -- take shape in a series of one-on-one confrontations.
Most notable are his cross-examinations of Mr. Wiseman, who plays Janning's former mentor, and of Mr. Mastro, as a twitchy, dimwitted laborer who was forcibly sterilized by the Nazis. His merciless bullying plays on the witnesses' most shameful secrets. And in Rolfe's face-offs with his personal icon, Janning, who disdains any defense because he's already found himself guilty, Mr. Hayden is facing off with an icon of his own. Neither the character nor the actor appears cowed.
The arrogance and surety of a young, gifted lawyer at a career-making threshold is so present in Mr. Hayden's performance that when he gives his summation, accusing the Vatican, Winston Churchill and American corporations that reaped war profits of complicity with the Nazis, the audience applauds as if he were the good guy. For his part Mr. Schell plays Janning as more openly pained, far less stoic than Burt Lancaster did so memorably in the film. 
That may be because stoicism plays well in close-up and is not so perceptible from the rear mezzanine, but in any case it changes the character of Janning, makes him more transparent in the way that melodrama is more transparent than drama.
Nonetheless, in the context of this production, that's not a bad thing. Mr. Schell is an imposing figure onstage, and as he makes Janning's inner crumbling outwardly visible, it gives the audience a visceral tug. When he and Mr. Hayden are nose to nose, the idea of his staring back at his own formidable youth yields a palpable tremor. These are representative moments in a play that gives oratory the muscle, sweat and high stakes of a last-man-standing prizefight. One only wishes it were more of a character-driven story and not merely a debate.

HEADLINE: N.Y.U. Arts Scholarship Program Caps a Patron's Spending Spree 

BYLINE:  By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
Building on an extraordinary seven-month record of donations to the classical performing arts, Alberto W. Vilar, the Cuban-born high-tech investor and opera enthusiast, has pledged $20 million to New York University for an arts scholarship program that will draw students from around the world to New York City.
 The initiative, which is to be formally announced later this week, is to be modeled on the Rhodes scholarship program and will be headed by L. Jay Oliva, the outgoing president of N.Y.U., who promoted the concept to Mr. Vilar. 
 In an interview on Friday, Mr. Vilar recalled coming to Mr. Oliva's office for breakfast in September after reading his three-page proposal. "About six minutes into the meeting with breakfast rolls, I said, 'Let's just go to the terms; this works," ' he said. "We hadn't finished the eggs. I think the waiter was still cooking them in the kitchen." 
A patron of music, maestros and Verdi, Mr. Vilar has lavished money on favorite institutions and personalities for years, as well as on educational and health care organizations. But the last seven months have left many in the classical music world more than a little awestruck. 
In September he gave $14 million to the Kirov Opera and Ballet of St. Petersburg in Russia and $6 million for new productions at the Los Angeles Opera, with an additional $1 million a year for a young artists' program there. In December he gave $5 million to the Muiskverien Opera House in Vienna.
In January at Carnegie Hall Mr. Vilar and the conductor Lorin Maazel unveiled a $5 million competition and training program for young conductors. In February Mr. Vilar announced a gift of $50 million to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington for a training program for arts managers and annual visits there by the Kirov companies. In the same month the Washington Opera received $8 million for a training program for new artists and the production of an opera. 
Records at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University in Indianapolis, which has tracked high-level donors and their favorite charities since 1966, show that Mr. Vilar has no apparent rival for patronage of opera and performing arts.
"It's gloriously wonderful because he recognizes his obligations in terms of giving back to what he has an interest in, which is what philanthropists do," said Dwight F. Burlingame, associate executive director of the center.
In less than a decade Mr. Vilar has had a significant impact on institutions like the Metropolitan Opera, to which he has pledged $36 million for its endowment and productions; Carnegie Hall, to which he has committed $5.6 million to restore its Seventh Avenue facade; and the Salzburg Festival in Austria, to which he has contributed $15 million. Even the current fluctuations in the stock market have not slowed him.
Marc A. Scorcathe chief executive of Opera America, a Washington-based service organization for opera companies, said Mr. Vilar's largesse in the opera world is without peer.
"The benefits will accrue over time," he said, because Mr. Vilar has invested so heavily in programs for young artists. But just as important, he said, Mr. Vilar has raised the profile of charity to the arts.
The N.Y.U. program, which will be called the Alberto Vilar Global Fellows in the Performing Arts, will be open each year to as many as 20 incoming students studying voice, music, dance, composition, film and acting. 
Chosen by international panels, each of the the students will be eligible for $40,000 in annual stipends for the two-year program and will receive master's or other advanced degrees or certificates. They will receive an additional $10,000 each for room and board.
Mr. Oliva and his staff are looking for a site for the program near N.Y.U.'s new Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for University Life on Washington Square South. The headquarters will include space for performances, private practice rooms and student lounges. 
"This program is so uniquely, naturally brilliant," Mr. Vilar said in an interview in Mr. Oliva's campus office. "In a couple of years, when you say, 'I'm a Vilar scholar,' that means you came to the best school and the cultural center of the world. You've studied under a number of extraordinary specialists. You interacted with New York in this live laboratory."
Mr. Vilar, 60, a self-described billionaire and president and founder of Amerindo Investment Advisors, is not a graduate of N.Y.U. but took courses there in a doctoral program in mathematical economics that he never completed.
In his philanthropic career he has supported charities that reflect his passion for music and art education. He said that he had subsidized at least five programs to nurture the careers of young artists.
There is no particular force driving the recent spate of pledges except coincidence, Mr. Vilar insisted. In addition to the arts donations he has made in the last seven months, he has also contributed $10 million to the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University to create a neurological scholars' program.
When asked to explain his accelerated pace of giving, Mr. Vilar said: "I don't have a scientific answer. But I really worked for years, and I was really focused. Then maybe five, six, seven years ago, I began to say I'm in a position to do something in a large-scale way. And I have a very definitive agenda and of course my passion is music."
Mr. Vilar, who is divorced and has no children, said he had most of the perquisites he wanted in life -- homes in England and New York, a Colorado ski house -- and "it's nice to give the money away." He estimated that he had another decade ahead of adopting projects in his three favorite categories: performing arts, arts education and health care.
In the works, he added, are discussions about more gifts to create a department of philanthropy at his alma mater, Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pa., where he is underwriting a $15 million, 65,000-square-foot computer science center, the Vilar Center for Technology. He said he was also working on a donation to another "very large and very well-known academic institution" that would also finance an arts education program.
The charity donations have created a sideline at his financial offices in New York, where a staff of seven works on his philanthropy projects. Mr. Vilar said that he was dipping into his capital to finance his current charities, but that he had established a foundation through an offshore account in the Cayman Islands that he would allow to grow for the next 10 years. "It's got my name on it," he said.
Despite the downturn in technology stocks, Mr. Vilar does not intend to slacken his pace of gift-giving. His own flagship, Amerindo Technology D Fund, has fallen more than 80 percent since last March.
"I've been investing in technology for 30 years.," he said. "I've been investing in technology for 30 years. I was the first public investor in Microsoft, Cisco, AOL, you name it. Secondly, today you would say these stocks are down 50 percent, but in 1998-99 my firm was up 550 percent. The other thing that is important is that a philanthropist doesn't give away his last month's pay. He gives away part of his capital. So what you really say is, how much do I really want to give away? And that's a confidential answer." 
Early this year The Chronicle of Philanthropy and the online magazine Slate jointly published a list of the nation's top donors in 2000. Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, topped the list with a $5 billion contribution to their foundation. 
But Mr. Vilar climbed his way to No. 19 with a total of more than $46 million, including his $14 million donation to the Kirov Opera and his gift to his alma mater.
More often than not, he has attached his name to his gifts. 
"With rare exceptions, there are very few large donations that are anonymous," he said. "They might have happened with the robber barons, but that was probably out of atonement." He noted bluntly that his aim was "to set an example for others."
"We all know a lot of people who could give and don't," he said.

HEADLINE: Analysts Give Fed Rate Cuts Mixed Review 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
Sizing up the Federal Reserve's policies over the last six months, a growing number of economists fear it has been too stingy in its interest rate cuts, a survey showed today.
 The survey by the National Association for Business Economics was taken in early March, before the Fed reduced interest rates by a half a percentage point last Tuesday. It was the third rate cut by the central bank this year. 
The poll of a panel of 267 members of the association indicated many were very concerned about the weakness in the economy and wanted the Fed to act aggressively.
"Goodbye Goldilocks," the association said in a summary of the survey results, referring to a shrinking number of economists who think Fed policy is not too hot nor too cold but "just right."
Even though the panelists would not have known with any certainty what the Fed was prepared to do last week, investors and many economists had widely predicted an interest rate cut.
"I think it's fair to say that one-third of our members would still view the Fed as being too tight," said David McClain, dean of the business school at the University of Hawaii and author of the survey.
At a news conference, Mr. McClain said the views represented a big change from other recent polls by the association.
In the latest survey, only 56 percent of the poll participants described the Fed's posture as "just right." That was the lowest percentage of economists agreeing with Fed policy in more than five years.
The last time the number was lower was in February 1996, when 51 percent of economists viewed policy as "about right." At the time, the economy was in a slowdown after a series of Fed rate increases in 1994-95.
As they did in 1996, most economists who disagreed with Fed policy felt it was "too restrictive." Thirty-four percent in the latest poll described it as such, compared with only 7 percent who said it was "too stimulative."
In 12 of the last 13 surveys, 74 percent to 86 percent of those polled viewed Fed policy as "about right," the association said.
In the latest survey, fully two-thirds of economists said they would prefer monetary policy over the next six months to be more stimulative.

SPAIN: E.T.A. SUSPECTS DETAINED -- The police arrested three people supposedly belonging to the Basque separatist group E.T.A., including a woman accused of organizing what police described as a failed attempt to plant two bombs in Madrid in 1999. The woman, Alicia Saez de la Cuesta, had reportedly been on the run since December 1999, when the police found two vans loaded with more than 3,740 pounds of explosives. Emma Daly (NYT)

SPAIN: BAIL FOR RUSSIAN MAGNATE -- The Russian media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky was freed from prison in Madrid on bail, suggesting that judges may have decided not to extradite him to Moscow to face fraud charges. Mr. Gusinsky, who has denounced the accusations against him as politically motivated, was allowed to return to his luxurious home in southern Spain but must report daily to the police. Emma Daly (NYT)

VATICAN CITY: POPE'S NEXT TRIP -- The Vatican said John Paul II would go to Greece, Syria and Malta in early May, a few days before he turns 81. Vatican officials also disclosed that the face of Pope John XXIII, recently exumed for reburial in St. Peter's, had not decomposed in the 37 years since his death because oxygen had not seeped through three layers of oak, cypress and lead. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)

FRANCE: NUCLEAR WASTE -- A train returning nuclear waste to Germany left France with thousands of police officers lining the route to guard against antinuclear activists who wanted to disrupt the shipment. The waste came from German reactors and had been sent years ago to a reprocessing center in La Hague where remnants of usable fuel were extracted and the rest packed for disposal. But shipments were suspended for three years because radioactivity was discovered on the outside of containers. Suzanne Daley (NYT)

RUSSIA: PORNOGRAPHIC WEB SITE -- A Russian Web site that sold pornographic videotapes of children has been shut down and nine people arrested, law enforcement officials said. The action stemmed from a joint effort, Operation Blue Orchid, by Moscow city police and the United States Customs Service. Many of the tapes were bought by people in the United States, where the investigation is continuing. (AP)

BRITAIN: HUNTING BAN FAILS -- British peers overwhelmingly rejected a bill to ban hunting with hounds. The draft law for a ban had been approved in the House of Commons, but peers voted against it 317-68. They also rejected a compromise option of licensing hunts. (Agence France-Presse)

HEADLINE: Foundation Grants Surged Last Year Despite Slowing Economy 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Despite year-end economic uncertainty, giving by foundations reached record levels last year, with ever-larger foundations changing both the scale and the scope of American philanthropy.
 According to an annual report to be released today by the Foundation Center, foundations gave out $27.6 billion last year, up more than 18 percent from 1999 -- the fifth straight annual double-digit increase. 
 "Foundations have grown so rapidly since the mid-1990's that not even a volatile stock market and slowing economy could keep them from posting record growth in grant dollars," said Sara Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center, an independent clearinghouse on foundation data.
If stock prices continue to fall, shrinking the value of foundation holdings, a decline in grant-making will eventually follow. Still, Ms. Engelhardt said, the huge assets that foundations have amassed should help them weather a short-term downturn. From 1995 to 1999, foundation assets nearly doubled, to $449.6 billion from $226.7 billion, the report said. 
Without question, it has been an extraordinary era for philanthropy, with billions of dollars a year in new gifts flowing into existing foundations, some 10,000 new foundations formed, and vast gains in the value of the holdings of the largest independent foundations.
Whereas philanthropy tended to operate at the margins of policy throughout the 1970's, 80's and early 90's -- with most foundations dividing up grant money to support pilot studies, research reports or small community-based programs -- donors today increasingly practice "high impact" philanthropy, in which they look to transform an entire field. They have been led by George Soros, William H. Gates and Ted Turner, whose announcement in 1997 that he would donate $1 billion over 10 years to the United Nations gave philanthropy a new visibility. 
In the early 1990's, grants of $10 million were a rarity. And nationwide, most grants are still for $50,000 or less. Nevertheless, a big commitment is now one of more than $100 million. Last year the Lilly Endowment gave $105 million for genome research at Indiana University, double the size of any grant it had made in prior years. The Ford Foundation announced a $330 million global scholarship program, its largest grant ever. And the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation started a $1 billion scholarship program for minority students.
"Traditionally, when foundations didn't have enough money to have a major impact on an issue, they tried to influence social policy," Ms. Engelhardt said. "Now people have been able to think bigger, and they tend to pick things where they can make a difference."
For the Gates Foundation, one such thing has been childhood vaccinations in the world's poorest countries, for which it pledged $750 million over five years. 
If an organization is new to philanthropy and needs to find a place where it can make a difference, "vaccinations are an obvious one," said Patricia Stonesipher, president of the Gates Foundation, the nation's largest, with an endowment of $20 billion. 
As with most of Gates's grants, the money will be funneled through existing organizations with experience in the field. But the scale of the money, $150 million a year, is enough to transform that field. At the United Nations Children's Fund, for example, the total budget for childhood vaccinations is only $100 million a year.
"The Gates contribution is a very significant sum of money, and coming after a decade of decline in foreign aid, it's very useful," said Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef. "But I hope people don't think it solves the whole problem, removing the need for further resources."
That is an understandable concern, said Dr. William Foege, chief medical adviser of the Gates Foundation, but what actually happens is that such significant sums only attract greater interest -- and resources -- from others.
"It just changes everything," Dr. Foege said.
That pattern has held true elsewhere. For example, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation's commitment to spend $175 million over five years to preserve open land in California has made a difference far beyond that sum alone. In November, halfway through the initiative, Packard reported that it had already protected 327,000 acres -- surpassing its goal of 250,000 -- and that the $96 million it had released had been supplemented by $245 million from other sources.
"Five years ago the total money, public and private, being spent on land conservation in California was on the order of magnitude of $50 million," said Steven J. McCormick, president of the Nature Conservancy. "It's changed so much so fast that it's hard to get adjusted." 
The new philanthropy is not without its critics.
"A lot of the new Gates-y foundations have become big so quickly that they have become wholesalers, spreading out big chunks of money through well-known organizations," said Pablo Eisenberg, who writes a column for the Chronicle of Philanthropy. "There's a tiny board, with no public accountability or understanding of the community."
Mr. Eisenberg questions whether the nation is getting good value for the tax exemption that philanthropists receive.
"Ten years ago the money given out through philanthropy was greater than the amount lost to taxes," he said, but that is no longer the case.
Others worry that the boom in private foundation spending may undercut government responsibility.
"What's happening now that's really interesting is that where foundations have as much money as the public sector, or more, there's starting to be an unhealthy role reversal, with public groups looking to foundations to take up the slack," said Catherine Cameron, executive director of the Wallace Global Fund. 
In a time of declining foreign aid, and increasing awareness of a global economy, foundations are taking on international roles.
At the Ford Foundation, where about 45 percent of the grant money goes to international work, Susan Berresford, the president, says she senses a far greater understanding that issues like the environment and health are global ones that cannot be addressed effectively in just one country. 
For the same reason, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, in Michigan, has opened offices in Johannesburg and Prague, and hired a program director in Ireland.
"We had always regarded ourselves as a Midwest local grant maker, but this is a logical extension of the work we were doing on the pursuit of peace," said William White, the foundation's president.
"Foundations are trying to figure out how to work together to spread the common values of democracy," Mr. White said. "In countries where they haven't had democracy before, there are great opportunities to go in and help them shape their not-for-profit sector."

HEADLINE: Brazil Flexes New Muscle In Another Trade Fight 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BRASILIA 

 BODY:
First came a bitter trade dispute with Canada in which President Fernando Henrique Cardoso threatened, "If they want war, then war is war." Now Brazil's leaders are standing firm on another trade-related foreign policy issue, this time with the United States.
 The dispute with Washington has to do with patents on AIDS drugs. The one with Canada is over subsidies to aircraft makers and over mad cow disease. 
 What they have in common is the sight of Brazil as it sheds its image as eternally easygoing and cordial and suddenly flexes the muscles that naturally accrue to a regional power with 170 million people and a booming economy. 
"We're probably going to be seeing more of this assertiveness during the last 18 months of the Cardoso administration," said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. 
"The Brazilian government," he said, "feels that Brazil is entitled to much greater international recognition and more of a leadership role" because of the country's growing economic importance. 
In the dispute on AIDS drugs, the United States has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization. It argues that a law here that would force foreign companies to provide their anti-AIDS drugs at lower prices, or license Brazilian companies to do so in the event of a health emergency, violates international trade rules. But Brazil shows no sign of backing down. 
"We will defend our case," Foreign Affairs Minister Celso Lafer said in an interview. "I think we are helped" not only by legal arguments based on Brazilian patent and intellectual property law but also by "what we believe is the moral dimension of our case."
Indeed, Brazil runs a highly successful program to fight AIDS, in part because it is able to provide drugs at prices below those charged by major pharmaceutical companies. The United Nations singled out the program for praise in early March. Many private groups have supported Brazil's stand, as have countries like South Africa and India, which have made similar challenges. 
In recent years, Brazil has been equally determined to defend Embraer, which builds commuter jets and military planes, against its main rival, Bombardier, the Canadian company. A new front in that conflict emerged in February when Canada suddenly announced a prohibition on imports of Brazilian beef, supposedly because of fears of mad cow disease. 
Brazilian officials argued that the beef ban was just an excuse to intimidate them in the aircraft dispute and gave Canada until March 1 to rescind the ban. 
When the Canadians finally gave Brazilian meat a clean bill of health on Feb. 27, the Cardoso administration was able to treat the event as a triumph and announced plans to file complaints of its own against Canada at the World Trade Organization. 
"This was a win-win situation for Cardoso, in that he got the attention of the Canadians and will probably get more attention at the upcoming summit than he would have otherwise," said Kenneth Maxwell, director of the Brazil project at the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to a gathering of Western Hemisphere leaders in April in Quebec. 
The agenda for that meeting focuses on liberalizing trade, in particular on an American proposal to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas as rapidly as possible, perhaps as early as 2003.
Brazil argues that a deadline of 2005 is more "adequate and appropriate," as Mr. Lafer put it, because of the complex issues involved. Brazil was almost alone in advocating a slower approach at first. But that position has now been endorsed by small Caribbean nations and by Ecuador, which becomes chairman of the trade talks in April.

HEADLINE: Congress Begins Planning for Increased Number of Uninsured as Economy Slows 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER and ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
A slowing economy and renewed double-digit inflation in health insurance costs are all but certain to cause an increase in the uninsured later this year and next, in the view of experts from foundations, business and consumer groups and the insurance industry.
 And while the issue is not now a major priority for the Bush administration or either party on Capitol Hill, Congress is beginning to consider tentative steps toward expanding coverage. 
 Republicans and a few Democrats are proposing tax credits to help people buy insurance, and Democrats and a few Republicans are seeking to expand participation in existing federally aided programs.
Still, Congressional action seems less certain than an increase in the number of uninsured, who totaled 42.5 million, or 14.2 percent of the population, in 1999, the last year for which statistics are available. Experts believe the numbers were stable in 2000. 
"You have to have grave concern about coverage," said Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America. "We know from the past that when the economy slides and health care costs go up, that many employers find a need to reduce their benefits." 
Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, echoed his views and added that the situation "puts pressure on small employers." 
Those concerns are also reflected in the advice Congress is getting from its own experts. Kathryn G. Allen, a health policy expert in the General Accounting Office, said, "Any significant downturn in economic conditions would lead to resumption in the growth of the number of uninsured."
That growth, a steady pattern for more than a decade, came to a halt in 1999. The inflation of health care costs slowed in the late 1990's, and record-low unemployment led businesses, even at some low-wage companies, to offer health insurance and absorb premium increases to attract and keep workers.
From 1998 to 1999, the number of uninsured actually dropped by 1.7 million, while the number with private insurance, mostly through employers, climbed by 1.4 million. While authoritative statistics are not available for 2000, William S. Custer, associate professor of risk management and insurance research at Georgia State University, said he thought little had changed in 2000.
"It's really from now on that we would expect to see some changes," Mr. Custer said.
Another student of the uninsured, Larry Little, a vice president at Kaiser, said that in 2000 "the number of the uninsured either held steady or maybe went down a bit." 
In much of the country, labor is still tight. But Dan Danner, senior vice president for public policy at the National Federation of Independent Business, predicted that would change, saying, "As the market softens and there isn't fierce competition for employees in the marketplace, the result is that more small businesses will drop health care, and the uninsured will go up substantially." 
Many small employers were facing increased premiums of 15 percent this year, he said, and "there aren't very many small businesses whose sales are growing that fast." 
The economic fortunes of companies large and small are critical to trends in insurance coverage. Sixty-three percent of Americans get health insurance through an employer. Among the uninsured, more than 70 percent have an employed adult in the family but still have no coverage. Many work for small businesses that do not offer insurance or that require employees to pay more for coverage than they can afford. 
The uninsured are usually adults and are more likely than those with insurance to require hospitalization for conditions like diabetes and pneumonia, as well as more likely to have cancers diagnosed at a late stage. Surveys show that 40 percent of them skip recommended tests or treatments.
Mr. Altman said recognition of these differences was one important change in thinking about the uninsured since the 1993-94 effort by President Bill Clinton to insure all Americans. Now, he said, their problems are no longer dismissed with arguments like, " 'They are all kids. They are all healthy. They just go to emergency rooms.' "
Providing tax credits is one popular solution. President Bush has called for a $2,500 credit, though the administration has been working harder on other tax measures. Many proposals would apply only to more expensive individual policies. Others, like that of Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, seek to help the 7.3 million workers who decline employer-provided insurance.
There is sharp debate about whether tax credits would do much to reduce the number of uninsured. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said a time lag of a year or so between buying insurance and getting the tax credit the next April 15 was a serious problem. Others contend credits would just provide subsidies to people who already buy insurance.
And some say the credits are too small. Iris J. Lav, deputy director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research and advocacy organization, said, "The proposed tax credits are typically of inadequate size to make insurance affordable for low- and moderate-income families." Proposed credits of $2,000 to $2,500 a year are for family policies that typically cost more than $6,000 a year, Ms. Lav said. Even with the credit, a family making $30,000 a year would have to spend 10 percent to 15 percent of its income to buy health insurance, she said.
The Congressional Budget Office, in a report last June, said that tax subsidies "would have to be fairly large -- approaching the full cost of the premium -- to induce a large proportion of the uninsured population to buy insurance." 
But Representative Nancy L. Johnson, the Connecticut Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, argued that adequate family policies could be bought for only $3,000. Janet S. Trautwein, director of Federal Policy Analysis and State Government Affairs for the National Association of Health Underwriters, agreed, saying that in most states a plan covering a single mother and two children could be bought for less than $2,600. 
In Connecticut, Ms. Trautwein's data showed, such a plan would cost $2,536 and the family would have to pay the first $750 in bills as a deductible. In North Carolina it would cost $2,652, but with a $2,000 deductible. In New York, such a plan could not be found for less than $3,820, though with only a $250 deductible.
The preferred Democratic approach is to put more money into Medicaid and into the Children's Health Insurance Program, and to encourage states to open them up to uninsured adults, especially the easily located parents of already covered children. Three states -- New Jersey, Rhode Island and Wisconsin -- already do so.
But Mr. Hatch, for one, argued that with the children's insurance program -- which insures children not so poor as to qualify for Medicaid -- only reaching about a third of the nine million eligible children now, it does not need new burdens.
His frequent Democratic collaborator on health issues, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, disagreed. He said that since insurance was often the first thing to go in a slowing economy, "We should move now to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover low-income working parents and not just their children."
One solution is to put money into both tax credits and an expansion of the children's program, and both Representative Johnson and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said they favored that approach. But Mr. Grassley noted that his committee has many other priorities, and was uncertain when anything would be done. 
Mr. Hatch observed that even with health care, Congress faced other difficult issues, including a Medicare overhaul, prescription drugs, a patients' bill of rights and medical records privacy. He argued that long-range costs were a problem for the federal government and for the states, too, since they pay a share of the costs of Medicaid and the children's program. 
One unreconstructed advocate of universal health insurance, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, complained that in Congress, "You crush the present by invoking the future." 
"I'm willing to consider the future," he said, but "I want to do something now."

HEADLINE: Pension Fund Drop May Require New Government Contributions 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 26 

 BODY:
With the stock market deflating, the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, warned today that the state, county and municipal governments might have to resume contributing to pension benefits for their employees.
 The state suspended government contributions three years ago as the boom on Wall Street pushed state pension funds to unheard-of heights. But Mr. McCall said those giddy times were over. 
 "You've all seen what happened with the stock market," Mr. McCall said at a news conference. "And given the fact the stock market has performed way below everyone's expectations, and that every sector of our economy has been affected by that, it is quite possible there could be an increase" in payments by local governments.
New York City employees and teachers are covered by other retirement funds.
A year ago, the state pension fund totaled $127 billion, but at the end of December, it had fallen to $121 billion. The fund's investments in common stock lost more than $7 billion over the same period.
The market has continued to take a beating in the first three months of this year, though it will remain unclear how much damage has been done until the comptroller's office evaluates the fund again on March 31.
Mr. McCall, who oversees the pension fund, predicted that local governments might have to start paying 1 to 1.5 percent of their payroll to the retirement system. He said a decision would be made within a few weeks, based on a complex actuarial formula.
"What would happen," he said, "based on the performance of the pension fund: if there needs to be additional costs, those additional costs would come from employers, not the employees."
When Mr. McCall became comptroller in 1993, government employees paid 6 percent of their paychecks to the fund. But their contribution declined as the fund prospered.
At present, the most senior employees pay nothing to the retirement system. Only those with less than 10 years' experience contribute, at a rate of 3 percent.
The state constitution prohibits the state from rolling back retirement benefits, so employers would have to pick up the slack should the pension fund be underfunded at the end of the fiscal year, March 31, Mr. McCall's aides said.

 The plan, which will cost $9.95 for a full season of games, signals an end to the ability of fans to get free radio feeds of baseball games online. Baseball fans, and sports fans in general, have used the Web to listen to play-by-play of their hometown teams in areas outside of the local radio station's range. Page C4. 

Groups Join Doctors in Insurer Suit
The state medical associations of California, Georgia and Texas joined individual doctors from seven states -- Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky and Texas -- in a federal lawsuit that accused eight health insurers, including Aetna and Cigna, of engaging in "a pattern of racketeering activity" to deny necessary medical care.

Two Chip Makers Announce Layoffs
Conexant Systems and PMC-Sierra said that they planned to dismiss hundreds of workers and also said that sales this quarter would lag behind already reduced forecasts because demand for communications chips is falling. Conexant said it was eliminating 1,500 jobs and 125 contract employees, about 20 percent of its work force. PMC-Sierra will dismiss 230 employees, or 13 percent of its staff. Shares of Conexant dropped 63 cents, to $10.50. PMC-Sierra fell $1.68 to $32.26. C4.

Higher Power Rates Are Proposed
California's chief power regulator proposed large increases in retail electric rates to help finance the state's spiraling energy costs and encourage conservation that could help avoid more blackouts during the summer. A12.

Blue Chips Rise, but Nasdaq Falls
Blue-chip stocks rose as investors snapped up big consumer and industrial names, but technology stocks slid. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 182.75 points, or 1.9 percent, to 9,687.53. The Nasdaq composite index lost 10.19 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,918.49. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.86 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,152.69. C14.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
In Education, Making More Out of Less

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
THESE days a casual observer might believe that New York is primed for education reform. Parents are voting on a radical plan to privatize five schools, and the candidates for mayor are declaring education to be their chief passion. One of them, Alan G. Hevesi, is already on television with an advertisement promising to "put education first."
 But if you listen to what the candidates are actually saying about schools, it's hard to imagine what is going to change. Most of their proposals could have been written 20 years ago by the teachers' union: more teachers, higher teacher salaries, smaller classes, higher taxes. Meanwhile, they're ignoring the evidence that something new is needed to fix New York City's schools. 
 The latest evidence is a study, released by New York University last week, comparing the local public and Roman Catholic schools. Because the two school system are so extensive -- nearly 300 Catholic schools below the high school level and more than 900 public schools -- New York offers probably the best chance in America to compare two large systems with different educational approaches operating in the same neighborhoods.
Compared with the city's public schools, Catholic schools have larger classes, lower-paid teachers and much smaller budgets. The Catholic system spends only half as much per student as the public system (and that total for the public schools doesn't even include all the money spent by the Board of Education on special education, administrative overhead, and extras like food and transportation.) 
Yet the Catholic school students scored consistently higher on tests, especially in poor neighborhoods, according to the N.Y.U. study. It was done by Raymond Domanico, an independent researcher who was formerly director of data analysis for the Board of Education. 
When comparing just low-income schools from both systems, where 90 percent of students qualify for a subsidized lunch, Mr. Domanico found that Catholic school students were more likely to pass both reading and math exams. The most dramatic difference was on the eighth-grade reading exam, which 35 percent of students in Catholic schools passed, versus 17 percent in public schools.
Mr. Domanico found a similar pattern when comparing schools where 90 percent of students were African-American or Hispanic. Those overwhelmingly black and Hispanic Catholic schools not only did significantly better than similar public schools, but they also scored slightly higher than the remaining, more integrated public schools (where 43 percent of students were white or Asian). 
THOSE results are remarkable -- and remember, they were achieved at half the cost of what the public schools spend. But the education establishment responded with the usual excuses, like the argument that Catholic schools attract families more dedicated to education.
It is an oddly self-effacing argument: if you really believe that higher paid public-school teachers are essential for children, why assume that the most dedicated parents are sending their kids to lower-paid teachers in Catholic schools? True, parents who send their kids to Catholic schools are sufficiently dedicated to pay tuition. But other studies have avoided this bias by tracking students awarded scholarships by lottery to attend Catholic schools, and the resulting test-score comparisons (between the lottery winners and the losers, who remained in public schools) have also been damning to public schools.
Public educators may not see what makes Catholic schools work, but the answer seems obvious to parents who choose them -- and to economists who analyze the behavior of monopolies. Catholic schools must please parents in order to survive. They can't tolerate lazy teachers, chaotic classrooms, restrictive work rules, bloated bureaucracies. They have to compete for students and money. 
New York City public schools do not. As long as the teachers unions remain powerful, as long as city politicians provide budget increases, it doesn't really matter how many students flee. Each departure means one less student and desk to worry about, and therefore more money for administrators' desks and teachers' raises. 
In other cities, politicians have concluded that competition is just as crucial in education as in any other industry. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has tried injecting competition here, most recently by inviting Edison Schools to take over five of the city's schools, but even that small experiment is too radical for the Democratic mayoral candidates to embrace. They prefer to promise more money.

HEADLINE: Contract Gains Ease Sting of Layoffs for Auto Workers 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: KENOSHA, Wis. 

 BODY:
Joe Salazar, a machine repairman at the Chrysler engine factory here, has made one sacrifice as overtime has disappeared and layoffs have begun: he has postponed the purchase of a Dodge Ram pickup to replace his bright red Dodge Durango.
 But hold the pity. That Durango is just two years old, and his 20-foot powerboat is ready on Lake Michigan. "If I got laid off," he shrugged, "I'd go fishing." 
 Mr. Salazar's confidence appears justified. For most of the last century, auto workers have borne the brunt of economic slumps, laid off by the hundreds of thousands during recessions with limited compensation that ran out quickly. But this bout of hard times, while bringing swift layoffs with little severance pay in many industries, is proving far less harsh in auto factories. 
Not only are benefits vastly improved, but auto workers are older and wiser -- and have bigger nest eggs. While other unions struggled in the 1990's, the United Automobile Workers used its strength to win a long list of benefits. As a result, Chrysler's much-publicized layoffs are not likely to inflict nearly as much hardship as other dismissals.
Dismissed workers draw roughly two-thirds of straight-time pay for 42 weeks, through a mix of state and company payments. They then resume drawing full pay -- nearly $50,000 a year -- until the end of the current contract, in September 2003. They also stay in one of the nation's best private health plans.
Chrysler is insulated from the costs of its generous unemployment benefits because its labor contracts have forced it to set aside money for the last decade. 
The pay and benefits were much different at the end of the 1980's, when employment in auto factories here plunged from 12,000 to 2,000, making this city on Lake Michigan between Chicago and Milwaukee a symbol of the industry's woes. Chrysler laid off 5,500 when it closed an assembly plant in 1988, and many received just a few months of company payments to supplement unemployment checks. Their health insurance lapsed too, leaving many stuck in a town that offered few high-paying jobs.
"We went without insurance for a while, to the point that the kids couldn't go skiing because we didn't want them to break body parts," said Jeanie Kukawski, a loan officer at the union-affiliated credit union here. Her husband, Wally, was laid off by Chrysler for six years, helping her paint and sell folk art before being called back.
So generous are the provisions now that they have provoked envy in many blue-collar neighborhoods. The local daily newspaper, The Kenosha News, has published several letters bemoaning that laid-off auto workers earn more than many neighbors who are still working.
"It's really hard to feel sorry for them because you're thinking, 'They're living in a house I could never live in,' " said Glenn R. Woods, 45, a nonunion robot repairman.
Many of Mr. Woods's high school classmates did get union jobs, mainly through relatives. "You've got generations of factory people who don't know what it's like to be on the outside," he said.
To be sure, the cutbacks have frightened many workers, and caught others unprepared. Debbie Guzman, who machines engine cylinder heads, took a beauty-shop job when Chrysler laid her off from 1988 to 1997. She splurged after returning to a $23-an-hour job with lots of overtime, and is now struggling on a smaller paycheck.
"I bought a truck, I bought a van, I bought a house and I almost maxed out my credit cards," said Ms. Guzman, who proudly bore a black windbreaker with her union logo when she showed up for an afternoon shift. "I need the overtime."
Losing overtime hurts. "Compared with last year, when we made $100,000, this year we'll make $50,000 or $60,000," said Dave Laurich, 37, who makes precision tools.
But even $50,000 goes a long way in a community where a steak dinner for two, with wine, still runs less than $40 at the Marina Garden Restaurant. The median home -- typically a three-bedroom ranch -- sold for just $128,000 late last year.
The workers' plight this time is also eased by simple demographics -- the average age is about 50. Few have been hired since the 1980's, as the market share of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler has fallen, and as robots have replaced retirees.
Many workers are thus well along in preparing for retirement. Since workers here tend to start families young, many have also finished paying for their children's college education, often helped by generous U.A.W.-negotiated tuition subsidies.
"The kids are out of the house, many of them have the second home paid for," said Don Gillespie, president of the A.M. Credit Union, whose board is made up of auto union members. Although Chrysler began its layoffs in February, most of those dismissed are in excellent financial shape, and the credit union has had to make only one loan so far.
Many workers, scarred by past layoffs, have been squirreling money away. "I've been saving for a long time -- this doesn't bother me a bit," said Les Vincent, 53, a machine repairman, adding, "1982 was when I put my first check in an I.R.A."
Andy Palmen, the local Chrysler and Dodge dealer, said his sales to Chrysler workers had dropped, but no more than his other sales. The workers "have been able to work quite a bit in the last few years," he said. "They looked at this as an opportunity to get ahead."
John Drew, president of the local U.A.W. chapter, acknowledged that many workers were skeptical when told of the benefits now available, because they remember how bad it was last time.
In 1988, Chrysler had set aside little money for supplemental payments. But in each of the four contracts since, the U.A.W. has insisted that Chrysler put aside large sums. The various unemployment funds now total almost $1.3 billion.
That works out to roughly $100,000 for each of the 12,500 U.A.W. workers being laid off, including about 600 here. The money should be ample, barring additional broad layoffs, because 3,000 to 4,000 Chrysler workers are also retiring each year, and laid-off workers will replace them. Chrysler is offering $35,000 retirement bonuses to speed the process.
Chrysler is also laying off several thousand unionized workers in Canada, who receive similar benefits. It is dismissing 3,600 workers in Mexico and South America, who receive few jobless benefits, and has pushed 2,300 white-collar workers to take early retirement and laid off 2,700.
Factory workers with less than a year of seniority are not eligible for the many unemployment benefits. But the factory here has hired virtually no workers since the late 1970's except for a few skilled specialists, like robot repairmen, and they are not being laid off.
More senior workers whose full pay returns 42 weeks into a layoff can be asked to perform community service or other tasks. G.M.'s Saturn division already has nearly 150 laid-off workers in Wilmington, Del., who are using skills like carpentry and electrical repair to help local nonprofit groups.
Laid-off factory workers' chances of being called back to a job in their hometown someday are much higher than in the 1980's because Chrysler is not permanently closing any factories this time. The current contract specifies for the first time that DaimlerChrysler, Chrysler's parent, "will not close, nor partially or wholly sell, spin off, split off, consolidate, or otherwise dispose of in any form" any factory or unit represented by the autoworkers' union.
DaimlerChrysler agreed to the provision in September 1999, because it was extremely profitable then and because it set a precedent for the U.A.W. to insist on a similar provision at Ford, which was spinning off its parts subsidiary. But Ford negotiated the spin-off as part of its contract anyway.
A DaimlerChrysler executive who insisted on anonymity said the contract language received limited scrutiny in 1999 because no one anticipated that Chrysler's operations would develop serious problems so quickly. DaimlerChrysler now rues the commitment and fears the union outsmarted it, the executive said.
"It was a suicide pact, it was the most foolhardy thing imaginable, and it shows how out of touch people were with reality," he said.
But all these provisions have not reassured some workers, like Ms. Guzman, 45. She frets that if laid off, she might never find another job or be left with little when the current contract expires. Other local employers have also been laying off workers, notably Motorola, across the state line in northern Illinois.
Ms. Guzman has 27 years of seniority -- U.A.W. negotiators have made sure workers continue accumulating seniority and pension benefits even during yearslong layoffs -- and that could make other employers leery of hiring her.
That is because of a quirk in the contract that gives Chrysler the right to demand that workers show up within five business days when called back from layoffs, even if they haven't worked there for years. Workers who do not show up may lose their place. So employers here who hire Chrysler workers risk losing them on short notice.
Asked whether she would return to work if laid off, even if she had found another job, Ms. Guzman responded emphatically, "I would."
John Milisauskas, manager of the Kenosha County Job Center, said the average wage of available local jobs over the last eight months was $10.63 -- far less than Chrysler workers are used to. But while some employers have reservations about giving jobs to Chrysler workers, others do not, and the choice of jobs has become much more diverse since the 1980's, when this was still a fairly insular factory town.
The county now has 23,000 people who commute to jobs elsewhere, mainly in northern Illinois, while 36,000 live and work in the county, Mr. Milisauskas said.
High wages do not hurt American automakers as much as in the 1980's, because their main rivals now manufacture many cars here and pay the same wages. But foreign automakers provide less-generous benefits, notably for health care.
Mr. Salazar said that while a layoff might seem to some like a paid vacation, it could be stressful. "We want to be normal people, working and having fun," he said. "Nobody wants to be laid off, believe me."
The workers here are waiting for the overtime to return and fretting about who might be laid off next.
Raffaella Laurenzi, who installs engine blocks, continues to eat out, but has made one sacrifice -- her annual vacation in Italy to visit family. "They wanted me to go this year," she said, but I said, "I'm sorry, I can't go. I'm short of money."

HEADLINE: Big Business of Cattle Theft Is a Growing Threat to Ranchers 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: SCENIC, S.D. 

 BODY:
Gunslingers brandishing pistols at dawn may be a thing of the past. Even in this wind-scarred outpost of the South Dakota Badlands, it is hard to imagine posses on horseback hunting down outlaws, six-shooters blazing.
 But one rough-and-tumble signature of the frontier is not only alive, it is on the rise. Cattle rustlers are plaguing ranchers from Kansas to Oregon to Texas, using creative strategies and crafty techniques to steal and sell millions of dollars worth of cows. 
 Geno Hunt discovered that 22 of his 3-week-old calves had been torn from their mothers and taken from his ranch in Cherry Creek, S.D., when he heard the cows bawling, their teats swollen with milk. 
At 4 one morning, Susie Mackey, in Spring Hill, Kan., was awakened by the rumble of trailers. She dashed out in pajamas and bare feet and, armed with a cell phone, jumped in her car, called the police and chased down bandits who had hightailed it with 24 of her specially bred cattle, getting them all back and bringing about the arrest of the suspects. 
And in Jerome, Idaho, David Zortman says that last June, rustlers posing as employees loaded up 40 or 50 of his calves nearly every day, spiriting away some 1,600 animals before he caught on in July.
"People are like, 'Is that still going on?' " said Larry Hayhurst, a state brand inspector of Idaho. "Yes, people are stealing a lot of cattle. It's big business."
So big that states are waging war on many levels, from using high-tech investigative techniques to passing laws to appointing special prosecutors to focus exclusively on rustling. 
Rustlers are lured by the high price of beef -- $1,000 or thereabouts a cow. But they are thriving, paradoxically, because much of cattle country has fallen on hard times, losing more and more people, according to the 2000 census. 
"You have a shrinking population in rural communities, with rural areas losing schools, businesses, losing Main Streets," said Jerry Derr, investigative chief for the South Dakota Brand Board. "You used to have more of a network of people who watched each other's property."
Small ranches, unable to make it, sell out to large cattle raisers, creating ranches with more cattle and land to keep track of. More ranchers take second jobs in town, entrusting their ranches to employees. And with their children less likely to stay on the family spread, many ranchers are older and "don't get out and check their property as much as they used to," Mr. Derr said. 
Ranches are also increasingly vulnerable to economic downturns, so losing even some of a herd can be devastating. 
Investigators believe there is a network of cattle rustlers across the Midwest and West, some stealing animals by posing as employees or cattle brokers and others selling the cattle at livestock markets.
Often, rustlers load cows into trailers or semi-trucks, helped by dogs and portable corrals. 
Sometimes, the thieves kill cattle on site, shooting them or carving them with chain saws before carting away the meat. In one Idaho case, Mr. Hayhurst said, a rustler stealing calves cut off their ears, which sometimes have identification numbers, and sliced off their brands before burning a new brand into their hides.
And increasingly, there is white-collar cattle rustling, in which people hired to raise or sell a rancher's cattle skim money off the sale. These thieves often use technology to fudge financial records or move money between bank accounts. Last year, a husband-and-wife team, Buck and Bobo McMillan of Milton-Freewater, Ore., were convicted of racketeering for stealing $500,000 worth of profits from the sale of cattle they managed for six ranchers.
"What we're seeing more and more of is large cases that involve fraud or embezzlement from half a million to a million dollars worth of cattle," said Larry Gray, who investigates cattle thefts in Texas and Oklahoma. 
States are working hard to stem the thefts. Some implant computer chips in cattle for use in sting operations so that when the cattle are stolen they can be identified by a scanner. Some use DNA fingerprinting to prove that cattle have been rustled, matching a stolen calf with its mother, for example. 
But the most dependable weapon is two centuries old: the cattle brand. And the biggest problem investigators face is that many states do not require branding. Thieves can steal cows in, say, western South Dakota and sell them after only a few hours drive since South Dakota east of the Missouri River does not require brands, while the western part of the state does. And in branding states, calves too young to be branded make easy targets.
Cattle producers and government agencies are discussing a possible national identification system, in which cows might be stamped with numerical ear tattoos or implanted with computer chips (in the tail or some other part that does not become hamburger). But because national identification is championed by food safety advocates as a way to trace contaminated beef, many ranchers worry about its potential to inundate ranchers with lawsuits over food poisoning cases.
No one keeps numbers on how many cattle are stolen, mostly because they are difficult to track. Many cattle graze in pastures so large, "you can wear out a good horse in a day just getting across it," said Darryl Howard, chief brand inspector for the North Dakota Stockmen's Association. "It could be months before you know anything is missing."
But figures from several states show cattle thefts are increasing. The Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association recovered $7 million in stolen livestock in 1999, up from $4 million in 1998. Mr. Derr said that in South Dakota west of the Missouri River, theft reports had doubled to 1,000 annually from about 500 over the last five years. 
Many thefts go unreported, investigators say, because ranchers, proud of their independence and invincibility, do not want to look weak or invite retaliation. Mr. Derr said that when a man was suspected of stealing from a neighbor, the man responded by shooting the neighbor's remaining cows in the ankles, causing them to die slow deaths, unable to reach food or water.
The other day, as Mr. Derr drove through the wintry moonscape of the Badlands, he gestured toward a ranch and said, "Here's a guy, somebody stole a bunch of his cattle, but he won't report it to me because he's afraid of seeming vulnerable."
When they are reported, cattle thefts are notoriously difficult to solve, because they involve "evidence that moves on its own," Mr. Derr said. "If you don't have any witnesses, you usually can't prove the cattle didn't just walk away."
Mr. Hunt, whose Black Baldy calves were stolen off their mothers last May, offered a $10,000 reward, about twice the calves' value at the time, and a hefty sum where he ranches. No one came forward.
Cases that get solved are the exception, like the one last month, when Mr. Derr, in a low-flying plane, spotted 400 stolen cows he had been searching for in the pasture of a man suspected of taking $1.1 million in profits from sales of cattle he had been hired to manage.
And last year, Mr. Derr found cows stolen years before and used DNA to prove that calves in the rustler's pasture bearing different brands were the offspring of the stolen cows and were also considered stolen property. Investigators are frustrated that many prosecutors place a low priority on cattle cases, partly because of evidence problems.
South Dakota plans to designate a special prosecutor for livestock crimes. And recently, the State Legislature approved two laws. One allows a second type of brand, done by freezing the hide, so that ranchers who dislike hot-iron brands will have another option. The other makes cattle theft a felony in all cases.
"You can steal a flashlight out of a car if the window's open and that's a felony in South Dakota," said Bob Gadd, executive director of the Brand Board. "But if you steal a calf out of a pasture, that's a misdemeanor. We want people who steal calves out of pastures to get more than name recognition."

HEADLINE: MEDICAL RETREADS: A special report.; 
Doctors Punished by State But Prized at the Hospitals

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and FORD FESSENDEN 

 BODY:
One doctor performed an unneeded hysterectomy on an ailing patient without giving her a routine checkup; she had a problem with her lungs. New York State proclaimed another doctor an imminent danger after he botched baby deliveries. A third doctor cleared patients for surgery without examining them.
 These doctors have three things in common: all practiced medicine at a New York City hospital; all were disciplined by the state for negligence; and then all easily found work again. Two of them are still treating patients today. 
 While their practices differ significantly, their cases together illustrate how easy it is for doctors who have been disciplined to find work at other hospitals or to be retained by the hospital where the problems occurred. 
Legally, of course, doctors who have been disciplined but have not lost their medical licenses are allowed to look for new employment once their punishment is behind them. Hospital administrators, often doctors themselves, argue that almost every doctor who errs deserves a second chance, or even a third. And scores of doctors get them, sometimes moving from hospital to hospital between punishments for negligent or incompetent care.
For its part, the State Health Department has been criticized for failing to revoke more medical licenses. Officials there say that a complicated disciplinary system makes it hard to do so, and they contend that hospitals share the responsibility to weed out bad doctors.
"Should it be easy for disciplined doctors to find work?" said Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the state health commissioner. "My gut reaction is absolutely not. People are not unemployable just because they have made a mistake, but when you break the trust of public good, I don't think you should be able to practice."
Yet interviews with health care policy experts and hospital administrators and a review of state data indicate that many New York hospitals routinely hire and retain doctors with bad records -- especially those who bring in a lot of money. An examination by The New York Times of the disciplinary records of doctors, matched with hospital admitting records, found that more than three-fourths of doctors disciplined over the last eight years resumed working almost immediately after the state punished them.
The data identified 285 doctors who were disciplined yet kept their medical licenses from 1992 until 1999. The review looked only at doctors who had been disciplined for reasons relating to patient care, as opposed to the dozens of doctors who are punished for things like Medicaid fraud or drug use. Of the 285 doctors disciplined for clinical reasons, 51 could not be located. Of the remaining 234, 199 were still working with patients.
Medical errors have generated an unprecedented level of attention since the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences concluded in a 1999 report that such mistakes killed 44,000 to 98,000 hospitalized Americans a year. In recent weeks, New York City hospitals have come under criticism for being the worst in the state at reporting medical mistakes -- including those that resulted in deaths -- to the Health Department.
Dr. Novello has made disciplining doctors one of the hallmarks of her administration. Last year, she took action against 411 doctors, a 21 percent increase over 1996.
Yet neither the state nor the federal government lays out how hospitals should handle problematic doctors, nor does the national organization that accredits hospitals. Industry executives acknowledge that hospitals themselves largely do not have specific rules on hiring and monitoring doctors who have been punished by the state; those that do frequently ignore them. Further, when hospitals do dismiss a doctor for poor care, interviews with administrators show, they often do not communicate with other hospitals to prevent the doctor from practicing elsewhere. 
"Coordination is painfully lacking in most of health care right now," said Martin J. Hatlie, president of the Partnership for Patient Safety, an educational and consulting organization. "The accreditation bodies, legislatures and regulators are not working in sync." 
Many health care policy experts say that hospitals are hardly pressed to make do with troubled doctors in New York City, where the ratio of doctors to the population is 50 percent higher than the national average. State data shows, however, that doctors with disciplinary problems are often among the top third of moneymakers at their hospitals.
"There is not a labor shortage of doctors," said Renee Pekmezaris, a hospital consultant and former director of the Nassau-Suffolk Health Systems Agency. "But there is a shortage of doctors who provide a stream of patients."

The Lapses
A Hysterectomy For a Lung Condition
In 1995, Dr. Ashok M. Dhabuwala, a gynecologist at New York Methodist Hospital in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was punished by the state for performing unnecessary hysterectomies on three patients. In one case, the doctor admitted at his disciplinary hearing, nothing in the patient's chart justified the surgery. Dr. Dhabuwala's license was suspended for two years, but the state reduced that sentence to probation. Methodist then immediately reinstated his privilege to practice there. 
Hospital executives acknowledge that in reinstating Dr. Dhabuwala, they ignored their own policy, dating from the 1980's, which states that doctors whose licenses are suspended or who are put on probation by the state are to be automatically discharged from the hospital.
And Dr. Dhabuwala was no exception; the executives said that over the last several years, Methodist has not removed any punished doctors. 
The hospital's board "did not realize their own bylaws say that they should be suspended," said Lyn Hill, a Methodist spokeswoman, who discovered the policy only after several months of inquiries from a reporter. "They assumed that our bylaws were the same as everyone else's," she said, referring to other hospitals.
While there is no state or local data on whether city hospitals have policies regarding sanctioned doctors, Susan C. Waltman, general counsel for the Greater New York Hospital Association, said most hospitals had none.
According to data from the State Health Department, Methodist has more doctors who have been disciplined or investigated for negligence than any other major hospital in the city.
In the obstetrics and gynecology department, Dr. Dhabuwala and a colleague were disciplined for botching cases, and another doctor was hired briefly even though he was in the middle of a high-profile investigation into a patient's death. Two surgeons are now under investigation by the Health Department; one is the president of the hospital's medical board. 
Among the state's 253 hospitals, only two others, Oswego Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital of Newburgh, both upstate, employed three doctors at the end of 1999 who had been disciplined, according to state records.
In the case of Dr. Dhabuwala, state documents show that he performed hysterectomies on two patients without conducting a physical examination.
In a third case, a 38-year-old woman went to the doctor complaining of pain in her side and lumps in her abdomen. Without consulting the radiologist who took a chest X-ray of the patient, the state files said, Dr. Dhabuwala performed a hysterectomy. The X-rays revealed a problem with the patient's lungs.
Dr. Dhabuwala said in an interview that the charges against him were false, although a review board sustained the original findings of the state's Office of Professional Medical Conduct.
"What was done to me was a total injustice," Dr. Dhabuwala said. "There was not a single complication in any of those cases." 
Dr. Dhabuwala also denied that he had ever given inappropriate care to his patients, including in the cases of the hysterectomies.
A colleague in the obstetrics and gynecology department at New York Methodist, Dr. John Luke, has faced similar troubles since gaining admitting privileges in 1983. According to state records, Dr. Luke performed a hysterectomy and terminated a patient's pregnancy -- a pregnancy she was unaware of -- without conducting proper tests to determine why she was bleeding.
In another case, Dr. Luke left a piece of surgical equipment in a patient, causing an infection he failed to treat promptly. The state's file on Dr. Luke lists other problems with pregnant and gynecological patients.
In 1993, Dr. Luke's license was suspended for three months and he was put on probation and required to attend medical education classes. The state also cited him for a 1987 conviction for insurance fraud.
Dr. Luke said in an interview that although he disagreed with the charges against him, he was forced to sign a consent order that resulted in his suspension and probation because he could not afford to defend himself, and that a lawyer had given him poor advice. 
But while the state was harsh, the hospital was not, Dr. Luke said. "They were very supportive because I had a very good reputation. They told me when my suspension was finished I could come back."
Ms. Waltman of the hospital association said most hospital administrators believed that if the state did not pull a doctor's medical license, it was giving a "vote of confidence" that the doctor was fit to continue practicing.
Not all hospitals agree. At Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, for instance, the president, Dr. Spencer Foreman, automatically suspends the privileges of doctors who are suspended or put on probation by the state.
While each doctor is given a hearing, not a single one in 15 years has convinced the hospital that he or she should be retained, Dr. Foreman said.

The Reticence
Out at One Hospital, In at Another
Dr. Niels H. Lauersen had delivered thousands of babies in nearly 25 years of practice in New York, and was working at his fourth city hospital in August when Dr. Novello, the health commissioner, suspended his medical license. The state was considering negligence charges against him -- the second set of allegations against him in three years.
Dr. Lauersen started his career in obstetrics and gynecology at New York Hospital in 1979, then went to Mount Sinai and Lenox Hill Hospitals. (No one at New York Hospital, now part of the New York Presbyterian system, would comment on his departure.) He was forced to resign from Mount Sinai in 1984; the hospital would not provide further details. Executives and former employees there contend that there were problems with the way he managed his patients' pregnancies. 
Dr. Lauersen said he left New York Hospital to go to Mount Sinai, and left Mount Sinai because he also had admitting privileges at Lenox Hill, and did not believe that he needed to work at both. In 1998, Dr. Lauersen was forced to resign from Lenox Hill amid more allegations that his care was inadequate. A malpractice case was also filed against him involving a baby who suffered brain damage after Dr. Lauersen twice tried unsuccessfully to deliver the boy using forceps. Dr. Lauersen characterized his departure as "a disagreement" with Lenox Hill and would not comment further.
More than a dozen of his former colleagues, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in interviews that Dr. Lauersen's troubles were widely known at Lenox Hill, and residents were discouraged from working with him even as the hospital kept him on. Administrators at Lenox Hill would not comment on his practice there. In general, health care policy experts say, key hospital administrators are usually doctors themselves and are reluctant to punish one of their own.
"The physicians around that doctor may take his side," said Dr. Mark R. Chassin, a former state health commissioner who is now the chairman of the department of health policy at Mount Sinai Hospital. "They feel the whole process is unjust."
While the state pondered his case, Dr. Lauersen, on probation, quickly found work with St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, at the Manhattan campus on West 11th Street. He had been there several months before the state decided to suspend his license pending a hearing and proclaimed him an "imminent danger" to his patients' health.
Perhaps more significantly for St. Vincent, the state said, Dr. Lauersen provided false information about his employment history and the investigations against him; Dr. Lauersen was also the subject of a federal insurance fraud prosecution.
Dr. Mark G. Ackermann, a St. Vincent spokesman, said the hospital looked into Dr. Lauersen's background. "We had heard hearsay that his departure was under less-than-ideal conditions," he said. "But there were no people who would comment on that when we checked on the references. We did all of our due diligence, we reached out to a number of individuals at Lenox Hill, including the department chairman, and no one would give us any information about the reasons for his departure. If we are not given entirely accurate information, well, we have done our best."
Jean Brett, a Lenox Hill spokeswoman, said: "Lenox Hill Hospital did respond to all written inquiries about Dr. Lauersen submitted by St. Vincent. It did disclose in writing that Dr. Lauersen was suspended." 
Dr. Novello said the state depended on hospitals to communicate with one another, but noted that they often fell down on the job. "We assume that the process works and cases like Lauersen show there are may loops out there in which patients are totally left hanging and at risk. You have to ask yourself here, why was public good not served?"
Dr. Novello added that publicizing the names of doctors and hospitals she punishes -- a controversial tactic that has become the hallmark of her tenure -- is meant to keep the doctors unemployed.
Most patients rarely find out about a doctor's past problems. Hospitals, as a unspoken rule, will not discuss a doctor's record, citing the right to privacy.
Jennifer Froman is the mother involved in the Lenox Hill delivery case, and her son Jake is severely brain damaged. She blames both hospitals for disregarding Dr. Lauersen's checkered past.
"Lenox Hill knew what they were dealing with and they did nothing about it," Ms. Froman said. As for St. Vincent: "It is disturbing to me to think that a hospital would take on this man knowing his problems, and I certainly think that they knew them. It makes you feel like there is no protection."
In October 2000, the state revoked Dr. Lauersen's medical license for good, upholding several charges of gross negligence and of fraudulent practices relating to false information the doctor gave to insurance companies and hospitals about his disciplinary history. Three months later, he was convicted in federal court in Manhattan of health care fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 10. 

The Billings
Despite Troubles, Making Money
At Methodist in Park Slope, Dr. Dhabuwala's practice generated $1.62 million in charges in 1999, placing him in the top 10 percent of all doctors who admitted patients at the hospital that year. A sizable portion of those came from Park Slope Midwifery, where he is the consulting doctor. Dr. Dhabuwala admits each of the group's laboring mothers for 25 percent of the practice's fee, he said.
In 1999, amid his legal troubles and the State Health Department investigation, Dr. Lauersen made $944,796 in charges for St. Vincent, putting him among the top third of doctors who generated patient charges for the hospital. Charges are the amount hospitals bill to patients or insurance companies; the hospitals do not always collect fully on such bills. 
Though both are gynecologists, the two men could not have had more different practices: Dr. Dhabuwala treats many poor and working-class women from Brooklyn; Dr. Lauersen offered fertility treatments along Park Avenue and counted a few celebrities among his patients. What they did share was the ability to bring in patients -- and revenue -- for their hospitals.
This is often the case among doctors who are punished and work again. In 1999, the last full year for which records are available, 32 hospitals had doctors with bad records among their top third of revenue generators, state data shows.
Dr. Habib M. Monas, for example, was disciplined by the state in 1998 on charges of negligence and fraudulent practice. An internist, Dr. Monas is one of the top earners among doctors at both Long Island Jewish Medical Center and Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx. He also admitted patients to Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center in the Bronx and New York Presbyterian Hospital, but was suspended by both those hospitals, where his billings were relatively low, after the state took action.
The state record in Dr. Monas's case is sketchy, and he did not respond to telephone calls or a registered letter requesting an interview. According to state records, Dr. Monas admitted that he cleared two patients for surgery without examining them at Our Lady of Mercy in 1997. The state ordered his license to be suspended for five years; all but two months was stayed with probation.
Dr. Monas now admits most of his patients through Westchester Square, according to state records. Even though he was on suspension for two months in 1999, he still generated $4.3 million in charges for the hospital -- 5 percent of the center's total billings that year.
His practice at the hospital actually grew in 1999, despite the suspension. "He was a physician in good standing here," said a spokeswoman, Lisa Nenner.
At Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Dr. Monas brought in $662,733 in charges in 1999. He was reinstated there as soon as his license was restored.
Asked whether the hospital had any rules that governed disciplined doctors, Julie Barovick, the deputy general counsel for Long Island Jewish, responded, "I am not going to tell you our policies." Then she added, "I don't really know them."

 BODY:
 German import and factory prices increased more than expected in February, suggesting that the European Central Bank may wait until next month before reducing interest rates. 
Some central bank officials said last week that inflation, which has exceeded the bank's 2 percent ceiling for nine months, was waning and economic growth would be hurt by weakness in the United States. Import prices in Europe's largest economy rose 0.6 percent in February from January and 5.4 percent from a year ago, the Federal Statistics Office said. Producer prices rose 0.3 percent from January and 4.7 percent from year ago, a separate report showed.

HEADLINE: P.& G. Suit Against Amway Is Revived 

BYLINE:  By GEANNE ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
For decades, Procter & Gamble has been dealing with a public relations nightmare: a false and harmful rumor that the company says was fueled in the 1980's and 90's by some Amway distributors who sell paper goods, soaps and other household staples in competition with P.& G.
 Now, a federal appeals court panel in New Orleans, in a decision issued last month and revised on March 12, has resurrected a suit P.& G. had filed against Amway. The decision that could offer companies very powerful ammunition against mudslinging competitors. 
 The suit deeply troubles First Amendment advocates, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit also agreed to consider their arguments. 
To P.& G., the case, which had been dismissed earlier by a lower-level federal judge in Houston, is about bringing to justice people who have unfairly competed by rumor-mongering.
To Amway, the case is about freedom of speech and an effort by P.& G. to make the company and its distributors scapegoats for a rumor that has persisted both within and outside the Amway network.
The gist of the rumor is that P.& G. has ties to Satanism and that a lot of the company's profits go to the Church of Satan. The rumor historically implicated P.& G.'s "man in the moon" logo, associating it with the devil. Though the company stopped using the logo on its products in the late 1980's, that has not stopped the stories from resurfacing.
In the early 1980's, amid a flood of angry calls to the company and boycotts of its products, P.& G. tried to squelch the rumor with a public relations blitz, an effort in which Amway assisted. P.& G. also sued a dozen people, half of them Amway distributors. The suits have been settled, with admissions of fault and retractions.
But in 1995, an Amway distributor who lived in Utah forwarded the rumor to other distributors over a telephone messaging system. Some distributors then printed fliers that circulated it to consumers with the message "We offer you an alternative" and contact information for Amway distributors.
So P.& G. decided to go after the company as well as some of its distributors, including the Amway distributor who widely disseminated the rumor.
He testified that he had believed it to be true, and retracted it shortly after sending it out.
Amway asserts that it has done nothing but try to stop the rumor and that it is not responsible for its distributors, many of whom sell Amway products out of their homes. But P.& G. says Amway should have reined them in. P.& G. says it has sustained major losses, including hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and other damages.
In a move that is significant for the lawyers and executives watching the case, the Fifth Circuit opinion kept alive P.& G.'s claim under one of the most potent weapons in commercial law, the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.
The law, passed in 1970 to combat organized crime, metes out harsh penalties for violators and big incentives for plaintiffs and their lawyers in the form of triple damages plus lawyer fees. Although the law has been applied many times in civil as well as criminal cases, experts say last month's decision in the P.& G.-Amway case is the first in which a federal appellate court has permitted this type of claim.
"The logical import of this decision is that in addition to the normal single damage remedies that companies have had for misstatements by competitors in the marketplace, there may now be a treble damage RICO remedy," said Gregory P. Joseph, head of the litigation department at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in New York and an expert on the civil applications of RICO who has represented P.& G. on an unrelated matter. "Potentially this does open the door to a significant level of RICO litigation between competitors."
The court also revived other claims, including a claim under federal trademark law.
The case was sent back to the district court in Texas, where some of the distributors were based.
To Joseph P. Suarez, senior counsel for Procter & Gamble, the Fifth Circuit's decision was a major victory. P.& G., he said, was "validated in our attempts to bring Amway and its distributors to justice after 20 years of this rumor."
To Amway, the panel was just plain wrong. On March 2, the company moved to have the case thrown out, and is prepared to take it to the Supreme Court if need be, said Charles L. Babcock, a partner at Jackson Walker L.L.P. in Houston who represents Amway.
The company contends, among other things, that there was no RICO violation, in part because the distributor spreading the rumor believed it to be true and so there was no fraud.
What worries free-speech advocates is the possibility that First Amendment protections might not apply under federal trademark law to words found to be motivated by economic concerns.
"Anything that would attempt to impose a RICO penalty on anything involving speech is frightening." said Lucy A. Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. 
Michael A. Mohr, vice president and general counsel of Alticor Inc., Amway's parent, said: "This speech was innocent, and it was about religion. When you've got speech between individuals about a public figure," like P.& G., "on a matter of public concern, I think the First Amendment applies."
P.& G. contends the purpose of the speech was not to express religious views but to take business away from a competitor.
Why this long and tough battle, which has broken out on other fronts as well, including a claim by Amway that it is the victim of smear campaign waged by P.& G.? 
"When a rumor or stories float around about a company, you have to take it seriously," Mr. Suarez said. The federal trademark and RICO statutes, he added, are very powerful tools that will "get the attention of people who are saying bad things about your trademark."

HEADLINE: German Heritage, Americanized Future; 
Siemens Seeks Opportunities And Skills in the New World

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Klaus Kleinfeld has a dream: he is returning from one of his myriad trips abroad, and a customs official at Kennedy Airport asks him where he works. "Siemens," he answers.
 "In reality, they usually respond with, 'Oh, you mean the furniture company,' " said Mr. Kleinfeld, chief operating officer of the Siemens Corporation, the American arm of Siemens A.G. and no relation whatsoever to those "see Seaman's first" guys. "My dream is that, soon, they'll say, 'Oh, you're the innovators, the guys who make those great gas turbines and those machines that let a doctor see your heart.' " 
 Siemens is working hard to make that dream come true. For three years, it has been pressing to Americanize this quintessentially German company, well known in Europe as an engineering and telecommunications powerhouse. The goal is to make it a name that, if not as well known as its archrival, General Electric, is at least in the same league. 
It will be no small task. Like G.E., Siemens is a conglomerate, in businesses as diverse as power generation, medical equipment, light bulbs and mobile phones. But G.E.'s name is plastered on almost everything it sells. Though many Siemens brands -- Westinghouse, Osram Sylvania and such -- are well known, their connection to Siemens is not.
There is more at stake than corporate ego. On March 12, Siemens listed its American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange. Now it must not only persuade American customers to view Siemens as a one-stop shopping place; it must persuade American investors that it belongs in their portfolios.
Siemens, a 154-year-old company based in Munich, has been reinventing itself, shedding lackluster businesses and buying new ones, and judging all its operations on profits, not just sales and employment.
"We've gone from being basically an employment company to being a shareholder-value company," Gerhard Schulmeyer, chief executive of the United States unit, said. "In other words, we've Americanized."
Siemens is following in some big European footsteps. Companies like Bertelsmann and ABB already do business in English. And in recent years, European auto, chemical and pharmaceutical companies have snapped up American companies. Daimler's purchase of Chrysler and the creation of Hoechst Celanese are just two examples. And management methods have long been one of the biggest intangible exports of the United States.
Siemens is trying to catch up. In the last three years, it has spent $6 billion to buy American companies, bringing its United States revenues to $16.2 billion last year -- 22 percent of its total $73.8 billion.
Just last month it agreed to spend an additional $1.5 billion for Efficient Networks Inc., a maker of modems in Dallas. Although Siemens operates in 193 countries, nearly 20 percent of its 460,000 employees are in the United States -- not that many fewer than the 24 percent in Germany. And the American presence will probably increase: Siemens forecasts $25 billion in United States sales by 2004.
Until recently, though, all the American companies in the Siemens family operated as separate fiefs, just coincidentally huddled under the same umbrella. For example, their sales forces were not encouraged to cross sell, even though someone buying, say, a Westinghouse turbine could logically also be in the market for Sylvania lighting systems.
"The businesses grew tremendously, but not as one company," Mr. Kleinfeld said.
Siemens is now setting up shared back-office facilities in the United States so that the different businesses can share the costs of common functions like processing payroll, and use combined strength to buy common items like insurance. It also just opened a center in Atlanta to help the American units incorporate Internet technology.
This year it asked its 100 highest-level unit executives to prepare game plans for increasing their sales in the United States. The exercise culminated in a five-day meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., in February at which each of those business leaders presented a plan to the corporate executive committee.
"We wanted to be sure that everyone is in alignment on this idea of getting better known in the U.S.," Mr. Kleinfeld said.
Participants found the meeting pretty intense. "We were asked to set goals that not only targeted year-over-year growth, but that were aimed at closing any value gap between us and our closest competitor," said Randy H. Zwirn, president of the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation, and the first American to sit on the executive board of the company's global Power Generation Group.
The Americanization process is also crossing the Atlantic back to Europe. Siemens A.G. has adopted American accounting principles and made English its official language. It is also issuing quarterly reports that break out profitability by operating group. "In Germany, accounting principles are driven by saving tax, but American shareholders want to see profits," said Mr. Schulmeyer, who will retire as American chief in September and hand the title to Mr. Kleinfeld.
Indeed, Siemens is now judging its businesses in terms of their "economic value added" -- that is, measuring the efficiency with which each unit invests its capital. It is basing 60 percent of the compensation of its top managers on the economic-value-added performance of their own units and of the business groups to which those units belong. And it is offering stock options as part of managerial compensation, even though options are heavily taxed in Germany. 
It has even picked up the American penchant for lobbying. Until recently, Siemens's Washington office existed primarily to advise the home office on the way political and economic winds were blowing. But in June, Siemens hired as its chief lobbyist Gregg Ward, a lobbyist for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a former assistant secretary of energy under the first President Bush.
Mr. Ward dismissed many of the academicians that had populated the office, and replaced them with seasoned lobbyists. Right now, he said, they are "deeply engaged" in trying to influence energy legislation.
"Siemens Corp. is still perceived around here as the subsidiary of a German company," Mr. Ward said. "We want to position ourselves as an American company with a proud German heritage."
As recently as five years ago, Siemens executives would have been stunned by any intimation that the heritage needed tinkering. Back then, management was satisfied as long as the employment rolls and patent counts stayed high.
"We were driven by pride in our engineering process, not in our bottom line," said Mr. Schulmeyer, who joined Siemens in 1994 and became its American chief in January 1999.
It showed. James Stettler, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London, recalls that in the mid-90's, when G.E. had operating margins of 18 percent in power generation and 14 percent in medical systems, Siemens's margins in those units were 0.7 percent and 7 percent."They just never focused on costs," Mr. Stettler said.
Shareholders grew impatient, and by 1996 many were asking Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens chief executive, to resign. In the United States, that might have presaged an ouster; in Germany, he got a second chance.
From 1995 to 1998, Dr. von Pierer cut some 13,000 people from Siemens's payroll. By law, German companies must pay extremely high severance, and the job cuts cost Siemens nearly $3.2 billion.
Then, Siemens started cutting low-growth businesses. It sold its retail arm, its electromechanical components, its power-cable business. All told, Siemens sliced businesses that had accounted for $19 billion in annual revenues.
Shareholders applauded. Indeed, while Siemens's income has gone up nearly 150 percent the last three years, its share price in Germany has tripled.
Siemens has introduced a $25 million advertising campaign aimed in good part at persuading American investors to view it favorably. But it will not be an easy sell. For one thing, Siemens lost $100 million in the United States last year. The loss was primarily an accounting quirk, the company says, resulting from write-offs of good will associated with its buying binge. Still, in this jittery market, red ink is a red flag.
Siemens's timing was off in other ways, too. It listed its American depository receipts just in time to join in on one of the most precipitous market dives in years. And to make matters worse, Infineon Technologies, a semiconductor company in Munich that is 71 percent owned by Siemens -- and that of late has accounted for about a quarter of Siemens's income -- issued a profit warning the day after Siemens's A.D.R. listing. 
Siemens was barraged with questions from reporters and investors. In a terse news release the day after it listed, Siemens insisted that it would still show double-digit sales and earnings growth this year. Still, the market punished Siemens badly. Its shares, which opened at $112.25, closed at $110 that day; 24 hours later, they were down to $106.75. They rose $5.45 yesterday to close at $104.75.
"In this world of uncertainty, even though Siemens has done well, it will take more changes to excite the market," Mr. Stettler said.
Sustained growth may prove elusive. Some of the company's units are robust -- the clamor for turbines, for example, has the plants of the power generation unit working at full tilt. Its medical equipment division, which makes high-ticket items like CAT scanners and magnetic resonance imaging devices, has gone from being a money loser to operating with margins as high as 13 percent. Its lighting and various automation units are doing fine, too.
But Infineon remains a major drag, and Siemens's mobile phone unit may soon be one as well. Sales around Christmas -- usually a strong selling time for mobile phones -- were disappointing throughout Europe, still the most important market for Siemens, and European analysts say phone sales continue to soften. The weakening European economy has already bruised Nokia and Ericsson, Siemens's prime competitors, and many analysts say that it is a question of when, not if, Siemens will suffer, too.
Even Siemens's fans are nervous. "They've set ambitious goals," said Chris Heminway, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in London, who advises clients to buy the stock. "But they'd be more easily achievable in an environment when everyone is investing in capital equipment."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a picture caption in Business Day on Tuesday with an article about efforts by Siemens of Germany to become better known in the United States misstated the company's financial results.

HEADLINE: A Strange Waltz in Vienna 

BYLINE:  By Stanley B. Greenberg; Stanley B. Greenberg is chairman of Greenberg Research.

DATELINE: VIENNA 

 BODY:
I am an American Jew, yet found myself in Vienna under attack by Jorg Haider, one of Europe's more notorious anti-Semitic politicians. I was in Vienna doing what I normally do, conducting polls and providing advice to political leaders and their campaigns -- this time for the Social Democratic candidate for mayor, the incumbent, Michael Haupl. I had provided similar services for Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Tony Blair, Nelson Mandela and Ehud Barak. As a rule, I keep to the background, offering my ideas privately and far away from the TV cameras. Vienna was to be different.
 Mr. Haider led the Freedom Party to prominence by attacking foreigners and Jews, expressing admiration for some of Hitler's policies and championing some populist ideas of his own. His party got 27.9 percent of the vote here in the local election in 1996. 
 Speaking before his party convention, Mr. Haider declared, "Haupl has a strategist called Greenberg," eliciting giggles in the room. "He specially flew him in from the East Coast." For Mr. Haider, "East Coast" means New York City and powerful Jews, the people who brought down Austrian president Kurt Waldheim and have tried to extract reparations for the Jewish victims of Nazi aggression. Mr. Haider spoke more about the foreigner, then intoned: "Dear friends, you have the choice on 25 March between spin-doctor Greenberg from the East Coast or the Viennese hearts." This was greeted by massive applause.
I was not alone in the line of fire; Haider had singled out Ariel Muzicant, leader of the Jewish community in Vienna, for derision. He scoffed at his given name, which is also the name of a popular washing powder. And Mr. Haider wondered mockingly how "anyone with such a name can have such dirty hands," economically summoning up the "pollution" fears and class-struggle steretypes of of 1930's anti-Semitism.
Mr. Haider's candidate in Vienna, Helene Partik-Pable, spoke of foreigners who "won't integrate." "They carry on with their own lifestyle," she said. "That leads to tensions involving noise, dirt and so on." She further declared, "We need to introduce zero immigration."
My first reaction was a certain pride in being attacked by Mr. Haider. But that was bravado, on the whole. The refrain of "East Coast" was unnerving.
One Saturday, after touring the city, I went to the Naschmarkt. The air carried many inviting scents -- Austrian sausages on the grill, and Chinese stir-fry, the fruity tang of olives pickling in open tubs, Turkish doner rotating on a vertical skewer. So many aromas, most of which Mr. Haider would wish away. I accidentally bumped into Mayor Haupl, who was campaigning there. A few of the TV cameras turned to film me, and I did my best to disappear without seeming to pull a trench coat across my face. I was determined to avoid becoming a TV image two weeks before the election.
The notion entered my mind of other Jews hiding, seeking anonymity, in an earlier age. But I soon realized I was in a different time. I have been given the chance -- denied my relatives in Eastern Europe, decades ago -- to fight. With polls and focus groups, I helped develop issues and themes to deny Mr. Haider what he thrives on, namely voters frustrated and alienated and looking for foreigners to blame. The Social Democrats made a new effort to harness social changes that many Austrians find frightening -- by encouraging high-technology employment, investing more in schools and public transport and enhancing retirement security.
I also came to realize that I was not alone in Austria. Mr. Haider closed his campaign with a flurry of neighborhood rallies continuing the refrain about the "East Coast." The Social Democrats finished with a rally of some 2000 supporters jammed into the Museumsquartier, the Hapsburgs' former stables. Mayor Haupl concluded his last campaign address with a warning about Mr. Haider: "His attacks against the East Coast and against our consultant Greenberg, against the president of the Jewish community" make him "personally responsible" for "anti-Semitism." "This policy is against all of us," Mayor Haupl said.
On Sunday Vienna voters made their choices. Mr. Haider's Freedom Party lost almost one-third of its support, plummeting eight percentage points from the previous high. The Social Democrats made historic gains, taking up those eight points and winning an absolute majority on the city council.
I could focus on the fact that, last Sunday, one in five people in one of Europe's most tolerant and progressive cities voted for the anti-Semite. But I prefer to dwell on the fact that I had the opportunity to help drive back one of the dark forces of our time and I did not fight alone.

HEADLINE: Justices to Revisit Affirmative Action in a Test Case for Bush 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court set the stage today for a renewed debate over affirmative action, accepting a constitutional challenge to a federal contracting law that presumes that companies owned by blacks and members of other minorities are eligible for special treatment as "socially and economically disadvantaged" enterprises.
 The case, to be argued in the fall but with briefs due by late spring, will provide the first test of the Bush administration's willingness to defend current federal policies on highly charged subjects like race. 
 As a senator from Missouri in 1998, Attorney General John Ashcroft voted against reauthorizing the disadvantaged business enterprise program at the Department of Transportation, the policy under attack in the case the court accepted today. Asked this month on the NBC program "Meet the Press" whether he would defend the policy before the court, Mr. Ashcroft told the host, Tim Russert: "I defend the law of America. Obviously, I will defend the Department of Transportation's regulations." 
The plaintiff in the new case, Adarand Constructors, is the same white-owned contracting company in Colorado Springs whose challenge to an earlier version of the policy led in 1995 to a Supreme Court decision that federal programs containing racial preferences were constitutionally suspect.
The court did not strike down the program in the original Adarand case, instead sending it back to the lower courts to see whether it could survive the newly articulated standard of "strict scrutiny." In September, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, said the program met the test and was constitutional.
The contracting program has evolved in the intervening six years and, according to a brief the Clinton administration filed with the Supreme Court on Bill Clinton's last full day in office, "differs substantially" from the one the court found constitutionally dubious in 1995.
Whether those changes -- which prohibit the use of quotas or set-asides and make the presumption of economic disadvantage easier for competitors to challenge -- create a constitutional difference is a central question in the new case.
Another question is how far-reaching an examination of affirmative action the court intends to make with this case as its vehicle. On one level, the new appeal, Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Mineta, No. 00-730, is little more than a factual dispute about whether the disadvantaged business enterprise program was sufficiently "narrowly tailored" to the compelling governmental interest in easing barriers faced by minority-owned companies in public contracting.
On this basis, the Clinton administration labored to persuade the justices to pass on the case. "The allegation that a court of appeals has misapplied settled law to the particular facts of a case is not the sort of matter that ordinarily warrants this court's review," Seth P. Waxman, then the solicitor general, told the court in a brief filed on Jan. 19.
The fact that the court still granted the case suggests that at least some justices -- the votes of four are needed to accept a case -- are after bigger game. There is a suggestion in the appeal filed for Adarand by the Mountain States Legal Foundation that no federal affirmative action program is constitutional unless it is intended to redress discrimination practiced by the government itself.
Some Supreme Court decisions have suggested such a rule, but the court has never actually gone so far. In opposing review on that broader ground, the Clinton administration's brief quoted from a separate opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 1989 affirmative action case, City of Richmond v. Croson, in which Justice O'Connor said: "It is beyond dispute that any public entity, state or federal, has a compelling interest in assuring that public dollars, drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens, do not serve to finance the evil of private prejudice."
Justice O'Connor's vote will be critical to the outcome in the new case because she is the court's swing justice on affirmative action, as she demonstrated in the earlier Adarand case. In that case, decided by a 5-to-4 vote, she wrote for the court that the minority contracting program was constitutionally dubious but added that "we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact."
Given the persistence of racial discrimination, she said, "government is not disqualified from acting in response to it."
Whatever the court had in mind in accepting the new case, the decision to do so did not come easily. The justices considered the case in their weekly closed-door conference four times since late January, an unusually long period of review at this stage. 
The Adarand dispute dates to 1989, when despite being the lowest bidder on a contract to install guardrails on a stretch of Colorado highway, Adarand lost the job to a minority-owned subcontractor. Under the disadvantaged business enterprise program as it then was, the general contractor received a $10,000 bonus from the federal Department of Transportation for using a subcontractor that qualified under the program.
Adarand now argues that changes to the program since then have not cured the basic constitutional defect of incorporating a racial classification into federal law and regulations. The Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative law and policy group based in Denver, which is representing Adarand, has close ties to the Bush administration. Gale A. Norton, secretary of the interior, worked there as a lawyer.
In a second case today, the court followed up on its ruling last week on arbitration in the workplace by accepting an appeal by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That federal agency is authorized to sue employers on behalf of workers who claim they have been discriminated against. The question in the case, E.E.O.C. v. Waffle House Inc., No. 99-1823, concerns what power the agency retains to seek remedies on behalf of workers who are covered by binding arbitration agreements.
Last week, in Circuit City v. Adams, the court ruled that employers may enforce agreements to take all workplace-related disputes to arbitration, requiring workers to waive their right to go to court. The E.E.O.C. argues in the new case that it should still be able to sue for relief like back pay, reinstatement and damages on behalf of workers who are covered by arbitration agreements and who cannot bring the suits themselves. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., ruled in 1999 that the agency could sue for injunctions to stop illegal workplace practices but could not seek "victim-specific relief" like back pay and damages.
In light of the decision last week, which is expected to encourage more employers to insist on arbitration agreements, the question of the federal agency's role has taken on added importance.

HEADLINE: Senate Extends Restrictions on Advertising 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
In the first setback to Senators John McCain and Russell D. Feingold, the Senate narrowly voted tonight to extend their campaign finance bill's restrictions on issue advertising by unions and corporations to all outside interest groups in the period just before elections.
 The amendment, proposed by Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, passed, 51 to 46, despite warnings by Mr. Feingold and another backer of his bill, Senator John Edwards, Democrat of North Carolina, that the provision would not pass constitutional muster with the Supreme Court. 
 Arguing for the proposal's defeat, Mr. Edwards said it posed "a very serious constitutional problem" on free-speech grounds. 
But the amendment drew votes from Democrats and Republicans who wanted to reduce the number of outside groups running issue advertisements against candidates, as well as opponents of the overall McCain-Feingold bill who jumped at the opportunity to deal the measure a blow.
A number of Senate Republicans who usually oppose any restrictions on issue advertising as an encroachment on free-speech protections voted for the amendment. Their ranks included such party leaders as the majority leader, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, also changed his vote at the last minute to support the amendment. As Mr. Thurmond stood and voted, Mr. McConnell, the chief opponent of the McCain-Feingold effort, was standing at his side.
Over all, 24 Republicans and 27 Democrats voted for Mr. Wellstone's provision.
It was not clear tonight how serious a problem the amendment would pose to the effort to overhaul the campaign finance law. "It's always a downside when you put in a provision you fear is unconstitutional," said Senator Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican who supports the McCain-Feingold measure.
But the vote raised the stakes even higher on another battle expected in the next few days -- an effort by the bill's opponents to add language saying that if any part of the measure is found to be unconstitutional, then the entire act is struck down.
Such a provision is supported by President Bush, but has long been resisted by the proponents of a campaign finance overhaul. They say the provision is intended to undermine the ban on unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties that is the centerpiece of their bill. 
Mr. Thompson said he thought tonight's vote would cause senators to "think longer and harder" about making each part of the bill contingent on whether all the other parts get court approval.
Mr. Wellstone said he had included a provision in his own amendment saying that if it was found unconstitutional the rest of the McCain-Feingold bill would be unaffected.
Mr. Wellstone argued that his measure was needed because the McCain-Feingold bill would rein in advertising by unions and corporations 60 days before an election and 30 days before a primary but would still allow other groups to run "sham issue ads on television."
"I think that without this amendment," he said, "there will be a proliferation of new stealth groups all operating within this loophole." 
The vote came as the Senate opened its second week of debate on the campaign finance bill, with proponents of the effort to overhaul the campaign finance law bracing for several make-or-break votes and struggling to fashion a compromise. 
After approving the Wellstone amendment, the Senate turned tonight to a rival proposal to the McCain-Feingold bill, a measure sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.
Mr. Hagel's bill, which has the support of Republican leaders and tacit backing from the White House, is widely considered the most serious challenge to the McCain-Feingold legislation. "I think we have the votes to defeat it," Mr. McCain said.
The heart of the McCain-Feingold bill is a ban on soft money, the unlimited and unregulated contributions to political parties which reached record sums of nearly $500 million in the 2000 election cycle. The bill also restricts certain types of paid broadcast issue advertising by unions and corporations, which its proponents say is drawn narrowly enough to pass constitutional muster.
Mr. Hagel, by contrast, proposed a cap on such donations to the national parties at $60,000 an election -- or $120,000 through a full primary and general election cycle.
To offset that cap, Mr. Hagel would also raise the limits on hard money, the regulated direct donations to parties and candidates, limits that were set into law in 1974.
Mr. Hagel's bill would allow individuals to give $3,000 a candidate each election, instead of the current limit of $1,000. And it would allow donors to give as much as $75,000 a year in cumulative contributions to all federal candidates and parties, instead of the current limit of $25,000. The McCain-Feingold bill would permit a smaller increase in the cumulative donation limit, to $30,000 a year.
Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Mr. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, say that the majority of senators seek some increase in the hard-money limits, now a generation old, and that they were amenable to that to prevail this week.
As the debate continued on the Senate floor, the duo sought to find the level of increase that would maximize Republican support without driving away Democrats, who have generally backed the bill.
"We're slightly narrowing the gap," Mr. McCain said, after a midday-strategy session. "There has to be a very careful balance. It's a razor balance we have to achieve."
A consensus measure was being drawn up by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. Ms. Feinstein's proposal would increase the individual contribution limit to $2,000 an election, and permit rises in future years to allow for inflation.
Her measure would also raise cumulative donation limits. Individuals would be allowed to donate $65,000 in each two-year election cycle to candidates and political parties.
The Senate today also defeated, 40 to 56, a proposed constitutional amendment by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, to give Congress the power to place limits on campaign spending.

HEADLINE: Bush Takes Tax-Cut Drive Back on the Road 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: BILLINGS, Mont., March 26 

 BODY:
President Bush used visits today to a minority-owned business in Kansas City, Mo., and a tractor supply company here to tell Americans that his economic policies, including tax cuts, were intended as much for people lower down the economic ladder as for those at the top.
 "Oh, I've heard the rhetoric," Mr. Bush said in Kansas City at Bajan Industries, a company that boxes and assembles greeting cards and has a racially diverse work force, including more than a dozen people formerly on welfare. 
 The president was referring to criticism that his tax cut was too generous to wealthy Americans. He said such talk disregarded the fact that many businesses file tax returns more or less as individuals do or have owners whose profits are taxed as individual income, meaning that the upper-level rate cuts he has proposed would benefit entire companies. 
And that, the president said, would give those businesses more money to invest, grow and hire more people.
"We should not let the rhetoric of a few in Washington cloud the issue, and the issue is, How do we get more money into the coffers of the small businesses?" said Mr. Bush, who cited Bajan as an example.
Mr. Bush's remarks were not just an attempt to present his tax cut as egalitarian, a notion disputed by many Democrats and even a few Republicans. It was also an effort to portray himself as aware of, and concerned about, any economic pain or worry that middle-income and struggling Americans feel.
With the stock market in the doldrums and other clouds hovering over the economy, Mr. Bush's success or failure in trying to convince Americans that he is an agile steward of fiscal health could have a profound effect on his presidency.
And so he set out to talk about the economy around midday in Kansas City and then later in Billings, both at the tractor supply company and at a local convention center packed with about 10,000 people. On Tuesday, he will be in Kalamazoo, Mich., where he is to deliver what aides described as a major economic address.
"The president knows that we are in the middle of an economic downturn," said the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, who added later, "There is no dispute."
But Mr. Bush, who had previously said the economy was "sputtering," stopped short of the phrase that Mr. Fleischer used. "It has slowed down," the president told reporters in Kansas City, "and we'd better do something about it."
Mr. Bush and other administration officials have for months expressed concern about the direction of the economy, pointing to signs of trouble as a way to make the case for their tax cut and emphasizing that they inherited the situation from President Bill Clinton. 
But some critics have accused the administration of worsening the economic woes by eroding the confidence of consumers and investors. 
Mr. Bush appears to be walking a somewhat fine line and, according to aides, will do so in the speech on Tuesday, framing some troubling economic omens as a summons to action but also warning against any kind of panic that would make matters worse. "He will explain why it's not a contradiction to sound an alarm now but also be bullish about the economy's future," one administration official said.
Mr. Bush's travels this week are another effort to put pressure on Democratic lawmakers whose support he wants for his budget and his tax plan. 
In fact, he spoke in Billings about the possibility of coaxing back into politics former Gov. Marc Racicot, a Republican who, not so incidentally, has been mentioned as a possible contender next year against an incumbent Senate Democrat, Max Baucus, who was standing just a few yards from the president.

HEADLINE: Council's Plan Trims Giuliani Tax Cut While Seeking to Raise Vallone's Profile 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, plans to release an alternative city budget proposal this week that would redirect and trim back Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's tax cut package, increase schools spending by $549 million and restore financing to libraries, cultural institutions and programs for senior citizens.
 The Council's alternative budget for the 2002 fiscal year, set to be issued tomorrow, is filled with obvious links to Mr. Vallone's campaign for mayor, as the Democratic leader of the Council tries to define himself as a champion of the city's middle class. 
 "Our tax cuts are targeted to first-time home buyers, working families with children and the working poor," Mr. Vallone said yesterday in a statement. 
The Council budget plan is sure to inspire protests from the mayor. It advocates maintaining a $2 city fee on city hotel rooms that Mr. Giuliani has long wanted to abolish, as well as rates on business taxes the mayor wants to cut by 10 percent.
"We have not seen this budget yet," said Sunny Mindel, the mayor's director of communications. "But in the nascent days of the mayoral campaign, it seems as though the race to City Hall is boiling down to who can raise taxes more."
The mayor and the City Council may also argue over the Council's proposal to cut money for some of Mr. Giuliani's favorite projects, such as $194 million he wants to set aside in next year's budget for professional sports arenas. Finally, the Council, as it does each year, is projecting that city revenues in the 2002 fiscal year will be higher than the mayor's estimates.
With this extra money -- the smaller tax cuts, reduced spending in certain areas and increased revenue estimates -- Mr. Vallone and Council members are laying out their own set of priorities.
First, they want to restore $155 million worth of programs that the mayor each year proposes to cut and the Council, just as predictably, fights to get retained. They want to restore money to budgets for city libraries, cultural institutions and parks.
The Council plan also calls for an extra $549 million in 2002 for the city school system, although details were not available yesterday as to where this extra money would be invested.
And the Council is advocating its own set of tax cuts. Its leaders intend to propose a child-care tax credit, worth $20 million a year, that would save a family that earns $28,000 and has two children $144 a year. A mortgage recording tax for first-time home buyers would be cut, saving an estimated $2,200 for a buyer of a home that has a $300,000 mortgage.
Tax abatements for owners of co-op apartments or condominiums would also be expanded. Finally, the Council has proposed reducing the city's commercial rent tax in a way that small businesses would see a bigger cut sooner, instead of giving an across-the-board cut to all businesses that pay the tax.
Collectively, the Council package would cost the city $2.12 billion over the next four years, $366 million of that in the 2002 fiscal year. The mayor's package, by comparison, would cost a combined total of $3.39 billion over the next four years.
City Councilman Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the Finance Committee, said he hoped that the Council could find a way to restore the mayor's proposed 10 percent reduction in business taxes. The Council has advocated a smaller tax cut package in an effort to reduce budget deficits that the city has said it expects to face in the future.
"You have to be prudent with the tax cut package," Mr. Berman said. "And you want to use the money available to help as many people as possible, which I believe our package accomplishes."
Politics will no doubt intrude into this year's budget debate, Council members acknowledged yesterday. The mayor and City Council are expected to have their traditional spats over the makeup of the tax cut package and the level of funding for schools, among other items. The squabbling may be more intense because of the national downturn in the economy, which has already led the mayor to announce that he intends to push for deeper spending cuts.
In the Council, several veteran members beside Mr. Vallone are struggling to raise their own profiles, including Mr. Berman, who is running for city comptroller.
"You are going to have conflicts of ideologies on the Council," said one Council member running for higher office who asked not to be named. "Some people will try to spend more on service enhancements and others will want to play the part of the fiscal conservative."

HEADLINE: Bush Team's Counsel Is Divided on Foreign Policy 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
Two competing foreign policy camps are emerging in the Bush administration -- an ideologically conservative Pentagon and a more moderate State Department -- which have already provided President Bush conflicting advice on central issues.
 At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld is collecting a hard-line group of advisers who have supported arming the Iraqi opposition to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and who are deeply skeptical of the European effort to form a rapid deployment force alongside NATO. 
 On the other side of the river, at the State Department, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell stepped out in front on Iraq with ideas to modify sanctions, but found his policy belittled at the Pentagon. Although he is a product of the Pentagon, he has usually been a cautious warrior.
In a sign of the back-biting, European diplomats were told by Paul D. Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defense and one of the most avid backers of the Iraqi opposition, not to consider the State Department's description of sanctions policy to be the last word, and to be wary of its more accommodating stance on the European force, officials said. 
On other issues, the State Department appears to be more open than the Pentagon to possible missile negotiations with North Korea. On Russia and China, too, General Powell is likely to place more emphasis on working with allies than is Mr. Rumsfeld, who has a history of supporting a unilateral approach.
"At some point the president is going to have to decide what foreign policy he wants, because he is not going to get consistent options on many issues," a senior administration official said.
In an ideal world, there is nothing wrong with the president's receiving clashing recommendations -- as long as the differences are discussed in private and the president's decisions, once made, are carried out, this official said. Indeed, all administrations endure policy debates, but try to prevent them from becoming public ideological cleavages. 
Although the administration is still in its relatively early days, there is evidence that the disputes are unlikely to be kept quiet, in part because of the strong ideological undercurrents.
Word has gone out to conservative writers and think tanks from administration hard-liners to "keep up the pressure," a think tank policy analyst said.
Mr. Bush, who is inexperienced in foreign affairs, has acknowledged that he will rely on his most senior policy advisers. So as the competition among them intensifies, Vice President Dick Cheney, who collected his own foreign policy specialists, more powerful than any gathered by previous vice presidents, is likely to be an important arbiter.
From the State Department, at least, Mr. Cheney is seen as leaning more toward the Pentagon, where he served as secretary of defense under President Bush's father.
The national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, who has projected herself as a policy coordinator rather than a policy maker, also prides herself on having Mr. Bush's ear. So far, Ms. Rice's predilections in the interdepartmental rivalry are not clear.
As Mr. Rumsfeld selects a markedly conservative group of officials to serve under him and as General Powell chooses a more moderate lineup heavily dominated by career Foreign Service officers, the battle lines seem sharply drawn.
Mr. Rumsfeld, for example, has selected Douglas J. Feith for the chief policy job at the Pentagon, officials said. Mr. Feith, who served in the Reagan Pentagon, is close to Richard Perle, a neoconservative who served the Reagan administration and is on the board of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative defense analysis group. The position of assistant secretary for international security affairs has gone to Peter W. Rodman, a staff member at the Nixon Center who is viewed as a conservative on Russian and European issues.
In contrast, General Powell chose Richard Haass, an advocate of sanctions reform and an opponent of arming the Iraqi opposition, as the head of policy planning at the State Department. Mr. Haass is another veteran of the previous Bush White House and has served as director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution.
For the most part, General Powell has turned aside suggestions of hiring ideologically driven Republican loyalists for the State Department.
"It is very clear that Rumsfeld wants a Pentagon populated with a conservative team who see themselves in a policy clash with Powell -- and they are gearing up for it," said Robert Kagan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and columnist at the conservative Weekly Standard.
"It's fair to say that this is shaping up into a Shultz-Weinberger battle royal of the Reagan administration," he said, referring to the policy and personal frictions between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger.
In the current situation, though, the principal players -- General Powell, Mr. Rumsfeld and Ms. Rice -- have by all accounts maintained cordial personal relationships going back a long time. There is none of the personal animosity that permeated the Shultz-Weinberger relationship, colleagues say. The three players have been meeting once a week for lunch and check in with each other on the phone every morning at 7:15.
But on policy issues, in contrast to what was expected, the new group re-creates the ideological divisions within the Reagan foreign policy team rather than the more cohesive approach of those who served President Bush's father.
Tests of how the competing spheres are reconciled will come in several areas: Iraq, where a new sanctions policy is being formed; Taiwan, where the battle will be over selling advanced weapons; Russia, where the fight will be over how to deal with Moscow on missile defense; the Balkans, over how far to assist the Europeans in peacekeeping; and North Korea, where the question is whether to pursue missile talks begun under President Clinton.
Mr. Rumsfeld has said that the European deployment force makes him nervous because he sees it as possibly weakening NATO. 
General Powell said last month that the United States went into the Balkans with its NATO allies and would leave with them. So far Mr. Rumsfeld has not addressed this issue.
Administration officials say they have now started the policy review on Iraq even though many of the senior posts at the Pentagon and the State Department are yet to be filled. 
Mr. Cheney's shop is also playing a role. His national security adviser, I. Lewis Libby, has shown sympathy toward arming the Iraqi opposition against Mr. Hussein, while at the National Security Council itself, one assistant on the Middle East, Kenneth Pollack, who openly opposed arming the opposition, has left. 
At the State Department, much of the sanctions policy is based on assessments drawn up by Mr. Haass, who has said economic sanctions should be eased to stop punishing the Iraqi people, while financial and military sanctions should be tightened. 
To this end, the State Department has proposed to states neighboring Iraq that United Nations monitors be posted on their borders as well as at key foreign airports to prevent Mr. Hussein from importing materials that would help him manufacture weapons of mass destruction. 
At the Pentagon, however, Mr. Wolfowitz has made it fairly clear that he believes sharpening sanctions is probably not possible, and that trying to topple President Hussein is more desirable.

Johnson & Johnson is expected to announce today that it will acquire the Alza Corporation, a fast-growing concern that creates alternative ways to deliver medicine to the human body, for $11.8 billion in stock, executives close to the deal said.
 The transaction, which the boards of both companies approved late yesterday, is intended to bolster Johnson & Johnson's prescription drug business amid increased competition. 
 Johnson & Johnson, the drug giant and maker of consumer health products, has struggled over the last year to overcome the loss of one of its best sellers, the heartburn drug Propulsid, which the company took off the market after it was linked to heart problems and dozens of deaths.
Two of Johnson & Johnson's other major drugs -- Procrit, a medication for anemia, and Risperdal, for schizophrenia -- face increasing competition from competitors. 
By acquiring Alza, which developed the technology behind the Nicoderm nicotine patches sold by GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, of New Brunswick, N.J., the sixth-largest seller of prescription drugs in the United States, will gain access to technology and a research-and-development team that has repeatedly succeeded in finding better ways to deliver medicine to the human body.
For example, Alza's newest drug, Concerta, is similar to Ritalin, the treatment for attention deficit disorder in children. Ritalin and similar drugs must generally be taken more than once a day. Concerta is a time-release product, which works for 12 hours. For children who take drugs for attention deficit disorder, Concerta eliminates the midday visit to the nurse's office for more medicine.
Under the terms of the transaction, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay Alza 0.49 share for each share of Alza, or $41.83, the executives said. The stock ratio is fixed, they said, and there is no "collar" on the deal that would alter the transaction amount if the stock price of either company were to fluctuate.
The price represents a 39 percent premium to Alza's share price of $30.05 on Friday. Alza stock jumped $8.70 yesterday, or almost 29 percent, to $38.75, after The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times reported that the two companies were in talks. Shares of Johnson & Johnson fell $2.83, or 3.4 percent, to $85.38.
Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment yesterday.
Alza, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., sold $432 million of prescription drugs in the United States last year, according to IMS Health, a company that tracks pharmaceutical sales -- an increase of more than 90 percent over such sales the previous year. Alza is the 42nd-largest prescription drug seller in the United States.
Alza introduced Concerta in August, at the start of the school year, and the drug already has 23 percent of revenue among attention-deficit-disorder treatments, IMS Health indicated. Analysts expect more than $200 million in Concerta sales this year. Ditropan XL, Alza's drug for patients with overactive bladders, is also expected to exceed $200 million in sales this year.
Wall Street analysts said yesterday that they were still trying to get more details on the deal, but they generally approved of it.
Neil B. Sweig, of Ryan, Beck & Company, said that the acquisition would hurt Johnson & Johnson's earnings in the short term, but that both companies could benefit. Alza would gain the help of Johnson & Johnson's much-larger sales force, he said, while Johnson & Johnson could add products to its pipeline.
"This could prove very beneficial over the next 10 years to J.& J.," Mr. Sweig said. 
One problem for Alza, he said, is determining how to manage the myriad of agreements it has with competitors of Johnson & Johnson. Alza has developed or is developing new delivery systems for many different prescription drugs. 
While Johnson & Johnson has made dozens of acquisitions over the last five years, a deal with Alza would be by far its largest. Until now, the company's biggest deal was in 1999, when it acquired Centocor Inc., a biotechnology concern that sells ReoPro, a popular anti-clotting drug used in angioplasty, for about $5 billion in stock.
Johnson & Johnson and Alza are not new to each other; J.& J helps Alza sell Concerta under a joint marketing agreement, and Alza receives royalties from Johnson & Johnson's sale of Duragesic, a skin patch for chronic pain.
Abbott Laboratories tried to acquire Alza in 1999, but the companies abandoned the deal after the Federal Trade Commission expressed concern about the potential monopoly they might have had in sales of drugs for prostate cancer.
Among a wide variety of consumer products, Johnson & Johnson makes Tylenol and Band-Aids. It also has a large medical-device business, but has been focusing more on sales of prescription drugs because of their higher profit margins.

 BODY:
ORPHAN TRAINS
The Story of Charles Loring Brace and the Children He Saved and Failed
By Stephen O'Connor
Illustrated. 362 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $27.
 For some 80 years the orphan trains described in Stephen O'Connor's book took stray and destitute children from New York's grim slums to the countryside, where they were chosen by farmers, artisans and merchants for employment or adoption. The scenes Mr. O'Connor evokes seem strange by today's standards: hundreds of newly transported children, most of them boys, being picked by strangers for what was intended to be redemptive labor, a new life-saving chance. 
 And yet, as Mr. O'Connor points out in "Orphan Trains," his insightful and fascinating piece of social history, that practice, which lasted until about 1930, was the immediate predecessor to today's foster care system.
In chronicling one of the first ambitious, privately sponsored social welfare programs in the United States, Mr. O'Connor provides an absorbing portrait of the nation at a moment of wrenching change, a moment that has in many ways not yet passed. Mr. O'Connor's last book, "Will My Name Be Shouted Out?," was also about children, ones he got to know while teaching creative writing in blighted areas of New York. In "Orphan Trains" Mr. O'Connor extends that interest backward, illustrating some of the special features of American life and history. 
He tells the stories of individual children who were on the orphan trains, from John Brady, who became governor of Alaska, to Charley Miller, who was hanged for the murder of two young men on a freight train. He writes a concise economic history of New York to account for the sudden emergence of homeless, destitute children during the first third of the 19th century. He explains the theological thinking that influenced the changing American perceptions of children, from congenitally corrupted creatures that needed to be set straight through sternness and discipline to innocent creatures corrupted by an evil world. And, while he shows what went wrong with the ambitious orphan train effort, Mr. O'Connor maintains a firm, non-utopian grasp of reality, avoiding the mistake of imposing today's judgments on yesterday's actors.
The book's main protagonist is the great, flawed visionary pioneer Charles Loring Brace, a complicated, contradictory minister and former journalist from Connecticut who wanted to be famous and to do good. "During the early 19th century, when, for better and for worse, one's moral character occupied a place in the public imagination akin to 'fitness' and 'success' today," Mr. O'Connor writes, "certain expansive natures" responded "to moral challenges the way contemporary joggers respond to marathons, or venture capitalists to promising start-ups." The author gives a keen sense of Brace as one of those expansive natures who found his life's work among New York's poor just before and in the decades after the Civil War.
"Orphan Trains" provides a gripping description of the urban disintegration that prevailed, especially in New York; family violence; infectious disease; unemployment; and alcoholism. "Throughout the 19th century," Mr. O'Connor writes, "between 20 and 30 percent of children became orphans before age 15, but only one-third of the children living in orphanages had lost both parents." In other words, poverty led many families, in Mr. O'Connor's words, "to park their children during family crises." It was against this background that Brace -- who at 25 was imprisoned on ridiculous charges for a month during a trip to Hungary -- became America's pioneer children's advocate.
His approach differed from that of later social welfare advocates in many of the ways that the 19th century differed from the 20th. In 1853 he became director of the newly created Children's Aid Society, and among his earliest and most successful programs was what came to be called the Newsboy Lodging House, created to help get New York's large squadrons of urchin newsboys off the streets.
The lodging was not free, nor was anything that Brace created later, because he seemed to anticipate the problem of welfare dependency and addressed it by treating the beneficiaries of his services as independent contractors, expected to work and to pay for what they got. This included children, because, as Mr. O'Connor points out, child labor, abhorred now as a crime akin to slavery, was accepted as natural and good in the 19th century.
"The assumption was that if children got into trouble, it was up to them either to contact the C.A.S. or to take care of the problem themselves -- often by running away," Mr. O'Connor writes. "That was what independence was all about." 
Mr. O'Connor spends a good deal of time examining the results of what became Brace's best-known program, the orphan trains, which Brace saw as a way of draining the cities of potential delinquents by putting them to work where they were needed, mostly on Midwestern farms. Mr. O'Connor makes the case that Brace and others in the aid society deluded themselves into thinking that the program worked well when, in fact, record-keeping was poor and there were many instances in which the children lived like indentured servants, or worse. Even at the time Brace had his detractors, including members of the Irish-American Catholic clergy who saw the orphan trains as a Protestant plot to destroy the faith of Catholic children. But in the end, Mr. O'Connor gives Brace the benefit of the doubt: 
"He knew that, especially given the limited funds available for helping the poor, it would be impossible to save every child, and so he considered failure (children suffering abuse in solitude and silence; children running away in fear or homesickness; children whose anger and pain turned inward, driving them to drink, violence and worse) to be an inevitable component of his humanitarian labors." 
"Orphan Trains" is a moving and instructive story, and as he tells it, Mr. O'Connor never loses sight of the real people and real lives at its center.

To the Editor:
Re "As New Economy Cools, San Francisco Quivers" (news article, March 26):
 It's unfortunate that the lavish Internet scene is lagging in San Francisco, but for many residents this is a long-awaited reprieve. 
The dot-com invasion has led to rampant citywide evictions, particularly among nonprofit cultural groups that can't afford the sky-high rents. 
 Gentrification has been a constant threat to San Francisco's diverse arts scene, sending many aspiring artists and musicians packing. Anyone on a fixed income, including students and the elderly, has felt the presence of the Internet profiteers.
It's a shame that the Internet economy is facing a downslide, but one hopes that the audacity and greed that seemed to accompany it are gone for good.

HEADLINE: Now, Live From Alaska, It's King Crab 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
THERE it was, a king crab from Alaska, an enormous, reddish-orange beast with a spiny round body and gangly legs. Not lying there frozen. Alive and fidgeting. It had arrived a few hours earlier, having taken a cross-country flight to New York, and it seemed a bit dazed. (Just as well: its future was decidedly bleak.)
 David Pasternack, the chef at Esca, served the snowy meat still warm, with a splash of lemon and a drizzle of fruity extra virgin olive oil. The texture was lush, almost creamy, the flavor sweet, barely hinting of the sea. It was not the stringy, salty king crab I remembered. 
 Until recently, live king crabs rarely made it to the East Coast. Crabbers went far out into Alaskan waters, kept their catch on board for a week or more and then brought the crabs to shore, where they were cooked and frozen. Dealers on the West Coast would get a few live crabs, but what turned up here, thousands of miles from where the crabs were hauled up, was just the huge frozen legs: cheap and abundant. Chain restaurants loved them for all-you-can-eat specials, but no serious chef would ever go near them. 
The Japanese have always been able to buy live king crabs. But with the Japanese market faltering, shippers see that they can make American dollars by keeping king crabs alive and flying them across the continent. And they are taking better care of the frozen legs as well.
"Live king crabs usually go to Asian communities on the West Coast, in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Vancouver," said Ken Kachmarik, a salesman at Steve & Mike's Shellfish in San Francisco. "But in coming years you're going to see more and more live seafood in the market everywhere." It is partly a response to demands of top chefs for the freshest seafood.
Dan Kim, the owner of Alaskan Feast in the Fulton Fish Market, said that bringing live crabs to New York was new for him. "In the past, most of them went to Japan, but they're buying much less due to the economy," he said. 
That means more crabs for New York. 
Sushi Yasuda, a Japanese restaurant on East 43rd Street, boils the crabs and uses the meat for sushi, dressed with a little lemon, at $5.50 apiece. At Le Bernardin, Eric Ripert sometimes receives live king crabs, which he boils, serving the meat on lightly sauteed green cabbage dressed with truffle vinaigrette and scattered with black truffle as a special on his $77 prix-fixe menu. Browne Trading, his supplier, sent him two live king crabs on Monday, enough for 16 portions.
Those crabs, like the ones at Esca, are brown or golden king crab, Lithodes aequispinus, which averages five to eight pounds. It is related to the more abundant red king crab, Paralithodes camtschaticus, the largest, which can weigh 20 pounds and measure six feet across. 
Some East Coast companies ship crabs directly from Alaska, packed in plastic-foam boxes with frozen gel packs (the cold makes them dormant). Those are usually headed for restaurants, to be cooked within hours.
On the West Coast, where Asian markets are the primary buyers, the crabs are flown from Alaska to Seattle, where they are refreshed in seawater tanks before being repacked in plastic foam and catching a flight to their final destinations. These crabs, having spent a shorter time in the box, tend to be livelier and more appealing in the market tanks. They are also less likely to die en route. Crabs can survive about 24 hours in the box. 
The live crab operation is like day boat fishing: the vessels are smaller and go out for shorter lengths of time, to bring back a premium catch that sells for more money. 
The Alaskan king crab season is staggered throughout the fall, winter and spring, depending on the fishing ground and the type of crab (only mature males can be trapped). Last year's total catch was 12.7 million pounds. This year's is expected to be somewhat less.
"Our strategy is to maintain the stock and set quotas to sustain it," said Forrest Bowers, an Aleutians and Bering Sea biologist with the Alaska Fish and Game Department. "We only harvest 10 to 20 percent of the legal males. It is illegal to take females. The fishery could even rebound, with the right environmental conditions."
The golden crab season in Alaska started last month. The crabs are harvested under a strict quota. 
Most king crabs are from the icy Bering Sea, both in American and Russian waters. Golden crabs come from waters as deep as 1,600 feet, off the Aleutian Islands and southern Alaska. Red king crabs prefer the sandy bottom of shallower water. Laura Fleming, of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, said that 99 percent of the crabs caught are processed by cooking and freezing.
There has also been an improvement in the way frozen crab legs are handled, Ms. Fleming said. The shippers maintain a subzero temperature from boat to truck to market. 
Live king crabs cost about $12 a pound wholesale. Retailers are few and charge up to $17.95 a pound for whole crabs and $24 to $30 for cooked legs.
The best meat is in the legs. Unlike most other crabs, king crabs have only six legs, not eight, and two claws, which are not so prized as the legs. The body of the crab has a little meat, but it usually goes to canners.
Mr. Pasternack has been getting five or six crabs once or twice a week. "This is the first season I've had them, and I can't get over how delicious the meat is," he said. He usually serves the crab simply cooked, dressed with olive oil and tossed with fresh pasta at $24 a portion. Last week, he said, a Japanese customer bought an entire crab to share with his dinner guests.
Rod Mitchell, the owner of Browne Trading, in Portland, Me., said that some of his other clients for live king crabs are Daniel in Manhattan and Emeril's in New Orleans. "The restaurants put them on as a special because they never know when they'll have them," he said.
Until the early 1980's, frozen king crab legs were everywhere and selling for less than $10 a pound. In 1980, crabbers in Alaska brought in 130 million pounds. Then there was a sudden shortage, caused by changes in water temperature and currents and other environmental conditions. Since then, the king crab harvest has remained at 20 million pounds a year, or less, and the price has more than doubled. 
Those frozen crabs may have been plentiful, but their quality was in no way up to freshly caught crab. Few fish markets sell them today. At Citarella, they are $19.99 a pound. A single leg weighs nearly a pound and provides nearly three-quarters of a pound of meat. 
In years past, when I had king crab, it was served cold in a salad or as a crab meat cocktail or hot with melted butter. Frozen crab legs that I bought last week and slowly thawed in the refrigerator were better than frozen king crab legs of the past. The shells were thin and easy to remove by cutting with kitchen shears. The meat was still wet and a little stringy. But it was a far cry from the sumptuous fresh meat. 
Then I tried steaming them gently for a few minutes in the shell, without thawing, just to warm them. The difference was astonishing. Though the steamed crab meat was a bit saltier and not so buttery as the fresh, it was good. But once it has been warmed, it must be served without delay. Refrigeration gives the texture that old stringiness. Mr. Ripert said that fresh cooked crab also tightens in the refrigerator. Like the crabbers, I learned that king crab requires careful handling. 
A few fish markets in the New York area sell live king crabs. One of them is Westfield Seafood, 220 South Avenue West, in Westfield, N.J., where whole crabs are $17.95 a pound. "We cook most of them here and sell the legs," said Vince Bruns, the owner. Last weekend, the legs were $24.95 a pound. "They've been a big hit, but the right price is probably $30 a pound, which is what we'll sell them for if we don't put them on as a weekend special," Mr. Bruns added. 
In Chinatown, A.E.G. Seafood, 206 Centre Street (Grand Street), expects to have live king crabs on Friday, $12.50 a pound whole. 
You will need a very large pot.
But if all you can find are frozen legs, just remember to steam them for a few minutes, remove the shell and serve them warm.

HEADLINE: An Overnight Sensation, 200 Years in the Making 

BYLINE:  By AMANDA HESSER 

DATELINE: SANLUCAR DE BARRAMEDA, Spain 

 BODY:
I TASTED more than I could count. Each time, a cool stream coursed through my mouth, leaving a trail of honey and melon, green apple and almonds. Sometimes even salt. Then I'd have a sliver of jamon, a fried anchovy or a shrimp fritter, and thirst for more of that chilly liquid. Back and forth, back and forth I'd go until it was time to amble on to the next tapas bar and start all over. 
 The drink was, of course, sherry. But not the usual fino. It was manzanilla, a sherry made only in this tiny seaside town, where the Atlantic and the Guadalquivir River join, wrapping the town and its bodegas with the humid, coastal air that nurtures this wine. 
 Many wines owe their flavor to the quality of the grapes or the skill of the winemaker. With manzanilla, it is really this ocean air that makes it what it is. It is light and dry like a fino, but with a cleaner, more delicate, almost tangy finish. It is a fine wine, and the antithesis of the stuffy old banker's drink many people associate with sherry. 
And after far too many years in obscurity, manzanilla is finally coming to the forefront of the sherry industry. The Spanish have long thought of it as simply an esoteric wine from Sanlucar, the traditional Andalusian drink, the drink for tapas.
But in recent years, Andalusia has revived its wine culture. While many mass-produced sherries fell out of favor, manzanilla has come into fashion. It is almost inescapable in restaurants in Seville and has even made inroads in New York, at places with a Spanish flavor, like Meigas and Pipa, but also at restaurants with American cuisine, like Gramercy Tavern. 
Fino, of course, is also a lovely drink. But after a glass, it sometimes weighs on your palate. Manzanilla is more like a fine Champagne. It is subtly flavored, cool on the tongue and leaves nothing behind but optimism about your next taste. Its faintly salty quality makes you thirsty and hungry.
In Andalusia it is drunk as an aperitif with tapas, but also as a wine through the meal. You almost cannot order the region's abundance of seafood -- langoustines grilled on a plancha, roasted fish, fried calamari and fried anchovies -- without being served a glass. But it goes perfectly with many other foods, from the Spanish tortilla to roasted chicken, roasted peppers and cured meats.
Taste it and see. It is no surprise that it has begun to stand out among sherries -- wines that have been plagued with a reputation as cheap and low grade.
International sherry sales have sunk by more than 30 percent over the last decade, producers say. In an attempt to cushion this economic blow, the Spanish government gave grape producers for the sherry industry incentives to cut their vineyard acreage. They did so by half: just 70 million liters are now produced annually. All the while, consumption of manzanilla in Spain and around the world has quietly grown. Now, of all the sherry consumed in Spain, almost 60 percent is manzanilla. Twenty years ago, it was just 15 percent.
There is still a lot of image mending to do. Finos like Osborne's Tio Pepe and Domecq live on as the musty drink of the elderly -- in Spain, in the United States, even in long-faithful Britain. "I was shocked to find, when in Britain last year," a friend recently wrote me, "that I was laughed at, first by friends and then in a pub, when I asked for sherry." 
Had he ordered manzanilla, he might have cut a better figure. Manzanillas like those produced by the bodegas Lustau, Barbadillo and Vinicola Hidalgo have turned their obscurity into cachet.
Traditionally, said Timothy Holt, the export manager for Vincola Hidalgo y Cia, "manzanilla producers were local family bodegas with no financial clout." And so, it was mostly drunk locally.
When you order sherry in Seville these days, though, the assumption is that you are ordering manzanilla. The waiter simply asks which brand. 
The word manzanilla showed up in the Spanish language about 200 years ago, about the same time the solera system of making sherry began in Sanlucar. But it is unclear exactly why the drink is called manzanilla. "Manzana," in Spanish, means apple, and "manzanilla" could be a diminutive of it, a reference to the apple's fruity aroma. But "manzanilla" also means chamomile, and if you order a manzanilla at an unusual time of day, you may actually get chamomile tea.
Manzanilla has a number of forms. 
Most common is regular aged, which is about three years old. Manzanilla fina is bottled slightly younger, with a lemon yellow color and a light, dry, green apple flavor. Manzanilla pasada is darker, and a few years older, with stronger notes of wood and nuts.
All of these -- and all sherries, for that matter -- are made with the palomino fino, a fragile, juicy white grape. "But the destiny is different," Mr. Holt said, standing small among high stacks of barrels in the dim, yeasty smelling bodega in Sanlucar, "and entirely because of the microclimate here they come out differently."
The palomino grapes are grown throughout the Jerez region, which sprawls across the southern tip of Andalusia. The best come from the lower altitudes on the chalky soil. Some manzanilla bodegas, like Hidalgo, own their own vineyards. Others buy grapes from growers.
The location and the design of the winery and the way the wine is aged are perhaps even more crucial to the wine's character than the grapes themselves. In Sanlucar, it is most desirable to be near the water, where the benefits of the microclimate are greatest. 
Then there is the physical structure of the winery. 
"It's not just the shape but the thickness of the walls and the orientation," Mr. Holt said. "It's so positioned that it catches the sea breezes, but also the sun's effect is reduced." Hidalgo's bodega, which has been around for 200 years, has thick stone walls and a cathedral roof made of conical Arab tiles. There are three layers of tiles and mortar sandwiching an air pocket that helps prevent the relentless heat of the summer sun from penetrating the interior. The structure is both solid and breezy.
Not all wineries are the same. The bodega where Lustau's manzanillas are kept is an old, more rudimentary building in the center of town. It is on a higher elevation, tucked among other structures. The windows are simply covered with straw mats, and the barrels are more cramped together. 
Once the palomino grapes are harvested, they are made into wine, then a few months later brought here and aged in oak barrels. Hidalgo's bodega is stacked high with these barrels, some of them 200 years old. Inside, it is dark and cool, and bats fly around during the day as if it were night.
During the sherry's time in wood, it develops a flor, or yeast cap, on its surface that looks much like cottage cheese. In most of the Jerez region, that flor thins out during the summer and winter, exposing some of the sherry to oxidation, which gives fino its typical pungent, nutty fragrance and body. 
In Sanlucar de Barrameda, however, the flor is thick and fluffy throughout the year, minimizing oxidation and giving the wine a fresher tang, often described as salty.
It's not salty exactly, but there is a kind of briny crispness that makes manzanilla distinguishable from fino. Manzanilla is light, dry and delicate, with a sweetness that's faint and fleeting like the sweetness in spring water. 
Like all sherry, manzanilla is aged by the solera system, a complex method of blending that ensures a consistent product. When a sherry is bottled, it is drawn in small amounts from barrels that have reached the end of the solera cycle. Sherries in younger stages of development are called criaderas. 
After bottling, the amount drawn out is replaced by the first criadera (which is also the oldest), the second by the third and so on until the youngest criadera is replenished with wine from the latest vintage. 
"The Spanish say that with the solera system, young wine is taught by the older wine," Mr. Holt said. "But also, the young wine provides the nutrients that allow the flor to live on and, in that, the solera system and manzanilla are inextricably linked."
Hidalgo's solera system is more than 100 years old. Lustau's is about 50. So, presumably, the latest manzanilla will contain a bit of every vintage, whether an atom or a drop.
Lustau's manzanilla solera has been managed by the same man, Pepe Espinar, for most of its existence. Mr. Espinar has worked in this bodega for more than 30 years, so he has experienced many of the vintages and has been witness to their every change in weather and flavor. 
Mr. Espinar, a small compact man dressed in a workman's indigo jumpsuit, took me through the bodega with sherry glasses in one hand and in the other a cana, the long slim ladle used for tasting sherry. Its end is a tall and narrow cylinder that can puncture the flor without causing too much damage and scoop up just a shotful of the liquid. His cana is fashioned from flexible bamboo, so that once he captures a shot of the manzanilla he can pour it at arm's length into a glass, using a whiplike movement. In Jerez de la Frontera, whale whiskers were supposedly once used for canas. 
As we tasted the young, unfiltered manzanillas, I could see the finished sherry evolving. All the flavors were there -- the apple, sometimes cherry, the yeast, the wood -- but fragmented. As they get closer to bottling, they lose their slightly sulphurous aroma and take on more of a uniform, whole flavor.
Hidalgo, which was founded in 1792 and is still owned by the same family, makes a number of manzanillas. There is La Gitana, the flagship; manzanilla Hidalgo, the lightest and driest; and manzanilla pasada, which has more wood, nuts and fruit in its aroma. 
Lustau makes a similar array of sherries, some of which are produced at its bodega in Jerez de la Frontera, others aged by almecenistas, or warehouses, which age sherries for producers to their specifications -- a common practice throughout the Jerez region.
Because manzanilla is produced in the same way as fino, it can also be made into other sherries like amontillado, an aged form of fino, or oloroso, a fortified, aged sherry, sometimes sweetened with Pedro Ximenez grapes (fortified to 17 percent alcohol; fino and manzanilla are fortified to only 15 percent). There is also palo cortado, a high-quality aged sherry with characteristics of both sweet oloroso and full, nutty amontillado. It has a gentle raisiny sweetness and an aroma of hazelnuts. 
What is perhaps most surprising with a great manzanilla is its price. 
Hidalgo and Lustau manzanillas are both around $12, which is about the same as most finos; aged sherries like amontillado and manzanilla pasada are more expensive, but rarely more than $30. Think of what $12 will get you in a Chianti.
These manzanillas are made from vineyards on the best soil in Jerez. They are produced in relatively small batches and aged in old barrels soaked with decades of character. 
You can drink chilled manzanilla throughout the meal. It easy to do. Each sip is ethereal. It is a small, finessed pleasure. It lacks the weight and pedigree of something like a Bordeaux, and does not ask you to revere it. It simply fills that brief pause between slices of jamon and olives in the most delicious way.

MUSHROOMS WITH MANZANILLA
Time: 15 minutes

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms (like shiitake, oyster and white button) trimmed and cleaned, thinly sliced
Sliver of peeled garlic

 CORRECTION:
An article last Wednesday about manzanilla, a sherry made in the Andalusia region of Spain, misidentified the owner of Tio Pepe, a producer of another type of sherry, fino. It is Gonzalez Byass, not Osborne.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Asales pitch tries to connect with fans as baseball season starts.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the advertising for Nynex that tried to sell telephone services by proclaiming "We're all connected"? Major League Baseball is introducing a campaign that could well carry that theme as it seeks to strengthen ties with fans and build ties with nonfans who think the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Florida Marlins might be menu items at Red Lobster.
 The campaign, "Connect with it," includes television, radio, print, outdoor and online advertising. It is meant to foster a closer, more emotional attachment between baseball and the general audience that Greta Garbo described in "Ninotchka" as "the messes." That is becoming increasingly important as ratings for most televised sports, including baseball, decline year to year amid a perceived glut in sports programming, while at the same time many marketers begin to rethink their ad budgets as the economy softens. 
 "We want to turn up the flame and remind people why they're connected, or should be connected, to the game," said a rhyme-minded Kathy Francis, vice president for marketing at Major League Baseball in New York.
"The game is all about bringing people together in many forms," Ms. Francis added, "through personal connections, through statistics, through stories, through purchasing apparel" and other licensed merchandise.
The campaign is the first work for Major League Baseball from the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, which agreed last week to be acquired by the Interpublic Group of Companies. In October, Major League Baseball consolidated various advertising assignments, with billings estimated at $20 million to $30 million, by naming FCB San Francisco to handle those tasks for the 2001 season.
Not surprisingly, the campaign is timed to begin with the new season, which starts on Sunday with a game in San Juan, P.R., between the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays.
"Our challenge is couplefold," said Patrick Kiss, executive vice president and managing partner at FCB San Francisco, perhaps coining a word. "It's getting people to go to the park more often and getting people to tune in to baseball on TV more often."
Mr. Kiss called that intended target of the campaign "latent fans, who go to one game instead of three" each season "and don't tune in as often as they should" to games televised in their local markets as well as nationally by ESPN, Fox Broadcasting and TBS.
Another target of the campaign, Mr. Kiss said, is "avid fans," the ones who get "goose bumps" watching footage of the home-run slugger Hank Aaron "when he was 25" or an "electric" feeling when they attend a World Series game.
Or electric goose bumps, perhaps, watching Hank Aaron play in the World Series, as he did with the Milwaukee Braves in 1957 and 1958.
So the initial commercial in the campaign tries to cover all the bases, so to speak, offering 60 seconds of baseball stars from yesterday as well as today, interspersed with shots of contemporary fans from all demographic groups.
The fast-paced spot cuts from vintage scenes of all-stars like Aaron, Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson and Ted Williams to recent shots of outstanding players like Randy Johnson and Mark McGwire. The fans are glimpsed in ardent moments, holding signs, cheering, coming to the ballpark with their faces painted.
As those scenes appear, the word "Connect" is superimposed on screen, followed by phrases like "with a hanging curve," "with a kindred spirit," "with a hero," "with an era," "with your heritage" and "with heaven." The last pops up during glimpses of the World Series in Yankee Stadium.
"People mark time by baseball," said Tim Brosnan, executive vice president for business at Major League Baseball, offering as examples the World Series, known as the fall classic, and the remembrances of summers past through the quests to break home-run records in 1961 and 1998.
"We want to celebrate those deep connections," he added, "to get fans in seats, fans buying products, corporate sponsors and more viewing of our television programs."
To that end, Mr. Brosnan said, Major League Baseball is working with Fox, part of the News Corporation, "to understand the underlying reasons" for the "erosion in broadcast-television numbers" and find solutions.
Fox and its siblings, FX and the Fox Family Channel, will show the spot, along with ESPN, part of the Walt Disney Company, and TBS, owned by AOL Time Warner. There will be additional commercials in June, to promote the All-Star Game, and in September, to promote the postseason schedule leading up to the 2001 World Series.
"And everything we're doing this year will be about showing baseball's connections with its broad fan base," said Jacqueline Parkes, senior director for advertising at Major League Baseball. That would include campaigns for baseball's Web site (www.mlb.com) and licensed merchandise in addition to public service announcements.
Additionally, Major League Baseball is to provide its teams with a 30-second version of the initial commercial, Ms. Parkes said, which they can run in their local markets on local TV stations. Eighteen of the 30 clubs have asked for the spot.
Before FCB San Francisco was hired, the image campaign and public service announcements had been handled by Vigilante in New York, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the Bcom3 Group. Duties for consumer products like licensed merchandise had been handled by the Lord Group in New York, a joint venture of Dentsu and the Young & Rubicam unit of the WPP Group.
"Our first assignment as an agency was 'Could you go to the World Series and shoot a couple days?' " Mr. Kiss recalled, adding with a laugh, "We said, 'We could do that.' "
"As a big New York Mets fan," he added, "I was thrilled."
Who has the heart to tell Mr. Kiss how the Series turned out?

PERSON: Sherwin Rosen 

HEADLINE: Sherwin Rosen, 62, Economist Who Focused on Labor Matters 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Sherwin Rosen, the president of the American Economics Association and a pioneer in the study of why wages and incomes vary, died on March 17 at Bernard Mitchell Hospital at the University of Chicago. He was 62.
 The cause was lung cancer, said William Harms, a university spokesman. 
 Professor Rosen was a microeconomist who focused largely on the issues surrounding labor. One of his most influential papers, which was published in 1981, was "The Economics of Superstars." It explored why celebrities and sports stars make so much more money than others in the same field.
Professor Rosen concluded that someone with even a slight talent advantage over a competitor could command a much higher salary by dint of the fact that his or her work reached a broader audience. For example, two singers might sound nearly the same but the one who sells recordings and appears on television shows will receive a higher income than the one who appears only in nightclubs.
The paper attracted a lot of attention outside the field of economics as the salaries of actors, athletes and chief executives soared in the last 20 years. It also inspired related studies by other economists.
"The real test of whether you make a big contribution in economics is how much you affect the research in the field," said Gary S. Becker, the Nobel economist at the University of Chicago who was a longtime friend and colleague of Professor Rosen. "And on that one, there is no question he affected the research of quite a few people."
Professor Becker said that Professor Rosen also did groundbreaking work in the late 1960's by using statistics to show that physically risky occupations rewarded workers with premium wages.
"I think Rosen had a very good chance of winning the Nobel, if he had lived longer," he added. "In economics, 62 is a young age."
Professor Rosen was born in Chicago. He graduated from Purdue University in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science. He subsequently studied economics at the University of Chicago, where he received his doctorate in 1966.
He taught at the University of Rochester for more than a decade before joining the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1977. He was the chairman of the economics department from 1988 to 1994 and served as editor of the Journal of Political Economy from 1986 until his death.
Earlier this year, he assumed the presidency of the American Economics Association, one of the highest honors in the profession. A short time after, he was told he had cancer, Professor Becker said.
He is survived by his wife, Sharon, of Chicago, and two daughters, Jennifer Lynn Rosen, of Chicago, and Adria Jill Rosen Zurita, of El Cerrito, Calif.

HEADLINE: Political Peacekeeping in the Balkans 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has made clear its desire for an early withdrawal of American peacekeeping troops from the Balkans. That is an understandable goal. But it cannot be achieved until sufficient stability has been brought to the region to allow the removal of outside military forces without risking a rapid return to armed conflict. 
 Recent raids into Macedonia and southern Serbia by armed bands of ethnic Albanians show just how volatile the military situation remains. The guerrillas seek to exploit a variety of grievances that have been growing for the past decade during the breakup of the old Yugoslavia and the repressive dictatorship of Slobodan Milosevic. 
 The recent clashes between the guerrillas and the Macedonian army have subsided, with the Albanian forces pushed back into the mountains outside Tetovo, Macedonia's second-largest city. But if political, economic and social inequities in the territories of the former Yugoslavia are not effectively addressed, further ethnic bloodletting is likely. That is sure to increase the pressure on NATO to play a more forceful role in policing the region, precisely what the White House hopes to avoid.
The specific remedies needed in Macedonia, southern Serbia and Kosovo are different. But in all three areas, Western governments should work closely with moderate Albanian leaders who reject violence and promote the interests of their community by political means. NATO's secretary general, Lord Robertson, and Europe's top diplomat, Javier Solana, lent useful support to this approach during a visit to Macedonia earlier this week.
Macedonia's large Albanian minority was never subjected to the violent repression and political disfranchisement Mr. Milosevic inflicted on the Albanians of Kosovo and southern Serbia. Macedonia is a multiethnic democracy, but a fragile one. Although an Albanian party participates in the governing coalition, many Albanians feel unfairly treated. They want equal constitutional status for Slavs and Albanians, more decentralized government, official status for the Albanian language and international monitoring of the next census. Macedonia's government should support these proposals.
In Kosovo, the most urgent need is building new structures of self-government to replace the ousted Serbian administration. Last year successful local elections were held. Now the United Nation's administrator, Hans Haekkerup, needs to move on to a provincewide vote. Doing so would allow nonviolent Albanian parties to increase their power and prestige at the expense of the armed extremists.
In southern Serbia, Albanians were denied basic political rights during the Milosevic era. Serbia's new democratic government must regain their confidence by working cooperatively with elected Albanian local officials and by bringing more Albanians into the police and military forces. Belgrade must also see to it that Yugoslav army commanders involved in the Kosovo repression are not sent to areas inhabited primarily by Albanians. 
Improving political and economic conditions in the Balkans will take time, as the slow progress in Bosnia has shown. During the months ahead, NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo can help maintain stability by improving border security. More inclusive political arrangements in all three areas will reduce the potential for violence and speed the completion of NATO's mission.

HEADLINE: Publisher Named At Mercury News 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., March 27 

 BODY:
The president of The Miami Herald was named publisher of The Mercury News of San Jose today, replacing Jay T. Harris, who quit last week in a dispute over cost-cutting plans of the parent company, Knight Ridder.
 The Miami Herald executive, Joseph T. Natoli, 45, has spent his entire career with Knight Ridder, first as an accountant in the company's suburban division and then in management at The Miami Herald. 
 Mr. Natoli's appointment takes effect immediately.
Knight Ridder, based in San Jose, is the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher, with 32 papers in 28 markets. Gannett is the largest.
Mr. Harris left the Mercury News on March 19 after seven years as its publisher. He said he did so in hopes of forcing Knight Ridder to "closely examine the wisdom" of the profit targets it set for the paper.
Earlier in the month, Mr. Harris said the paper would have to lay off some employees because of significantly lower ad revenue during Silicon Valley's economic slump. But when he resigned, Mr. Harris said the paper had been unable to find a way to meet Knight Ridder's profit goals "without risking significant and lasting harm to The Mercury News."

HEADLINE: Computer Associates Considers Severance for Some It Fired 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Computer Associates is considering offering severance payments to some of the employees it fired two months ago, the company said yesterday.
 In recent interviews, about two dozen former employees said that the company had dismissed several hundred of its 18,000 workers worldwide since November. The action, they said, was actually a mass layoff by Computer Associates, a software company based in Islandia, N.Y., that is struggling to rein in costs. 
 The company disguised the mass layoff as individual firings of nonperforming workers, they said, to avoid paying severance benefits. The firings have angered former employees, who accuse the company of acting in bad faith. The company's employee handbook says workers will receive two weeks of severance pay for each year they have worked for the company unless they are fired for poor performance. The firings may also have violated labor laws, employment lawyers said. 
Three former executives who fired employees stepped forward in the last week to offer accounts similar to those given by employees. The layoffs were directed by top management, they said, and were tightly scripted by the company's human resources department so the company could avoid paying severance packages to fired employees.
Computer Associates, which makes the software that many big companies use to manage their computer systems, said that it did not have a mass layoff and that the dismissals were a standard year-end pruning of unproductive employees. "C.A. is continuing to hire employees, as needs arise," said Bob Gordon, a company spokesman.
But the company has now decided that it may offer some employees severance pay after all, Mr. Gordon said yesterday.
"We are reviewing the terminations of folks who left in January to determine if anyone who was eligible for severance didn't receive it," Mr. Gordon said.
About 240 employees were terminated in January for performance reasons and did not receive severance pay, he said. In addition, 76 employees who were dismissed for other reasons did receive severance pay. Mr. Gordon declined to say how many people had lost their jobs since November, when former employees say the layoffs began, or whether the company's work force had shrunk in that time.
The company did not say how many employees might receive payments but said it would not need to take a one-time charge to earnings to cover the cost.
Since the dismissals were first reported, executives and employees involved in the firings have continued to come forward with their accounts. They say the company, whose revenues plunged 53 percent, to $783 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2000, from $1.67 billion for the comparable period in 1999, is furiously trying to cut costs.
Henry Crouse, a former regional vice president at the company, said he got the call on Friday, Jan. 12.
Two weeks earlier, he met in Blue Bell, Pa., with three other executives. The managers, who oversaw about 15 salespeople in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, knew that their group, like others in the company, was far behind its sales quotas. With the economy slowing, customers were reluctant to sign new contracts.
Led by a senior vice president who would be fired a few days later, the executives at the Blue Bell meeting discussed which salespeople might be expendable, Mr. Crouse said. (Another person who was at the meeting but asked not to be identified confirmed Mr. Crouse's account. ) Because Mr. Crouse had just been promoted, and his salespeople were all behind on their quotas, he had little basis on which to decide, he said.
"I could have fired myself, and it would have made as much sense," Mr. Crouse said.
Nevertheless, the group agreed on six salespeople who would be fired if necessary, he said. Then they waited.
"On Jan. 12, the phone call came -- 'Fire them now,' " Mr. Crouse said. To ensure that employees would not receive severance pay, the managers followed the directions of Computer Associates' human resources department, he said.
"There were two people in each termination meeting, human resources and you," Mr. Crouse said. "Just tell them they're being terminated for poor performance. Get up and walk out and let H.R. handle it."
Employees call Jan. 12 "the day of blood," Mr. Crouse said. "The way these terminations were handled was embarrassing."
Mr. Crouse was fired last week, after kicking and breaking his office door when a $680,000 software sale he had negotiated fell through. He said the company told him it had fired him because he "had a pattern of being too intense," but he attributed his firing to the collapse of the sale.
Mr. Gordon said the company could not discuss the circumstances of Mr. Crouse's firing unless Mr. Crouse agreed to allow it to do so. Mr. Crouse declined.
Another former executive, a senior vice president who insisted on remaining anonymous, said that at the end of December, she and other executives were told to plan to dismiss 20 percent of their employees. "It was supposed to be for performance reasons," she said. "I was very bold, and argued and said, 'I don't think this is the right thing to do. I've been a good manager and I've been weeding out my pipeline every quarter.' "
A few days later, the orders came, she said. "We were told: 'Be careful. Do not say that this is a reduction in force. Do not say this is a layoff,' " she said. "We were told no severance, and the reason being, hey, you're not performing, you're going to get no severance."
Earlier this month, the senior vice president got another order.
"I had a sales rep in my office, and an H.R. person came in and said, 'Can I talk to you?' " she said. The senior vice president was led out of her office to a conference room. "I said, 'We're doing the doomsday walk, aren't we?' and she said, 'I have Chris on the line for you.' I knew the drill. I knew there's no severance. And that was that."

Positive Consumer Confidence Report Gives Shares a Lift

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stock prices climbed again yesterday after investors were heartened by an unexpectedly strong report on consumer confidence, raising some hopes that personal spending will revive the weakened economy.
 Still, some market strategists said investors appeared to be rallying around a rally since stocks made a stunning reversal late Thursday from their recent steep losses. 
 "The market will use -- during a time of rebound -- any evidence it can find that things aren't going to be bad as a plus," said David A. Henwood, chief investment officer for Raymond James & Associates. 
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 260.01 points, or 2.7 percent, to 9,947.54. Since a late turnaround on Thursday from a steep intraday loss that would have put it in a bear market, the Dow has gained 558 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 29.48 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,182.17, putting it nearly 40 points below the point when it entered a bear market on March 12. And the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 53.77 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,972.26.
The stock market began to pick up strength after the Conference Board, a New York research group, reported that its consumer confidence index jumped to 117 in March from a revised 109.2 in February. Economists had expected the index, which had fallen for five months, to drop again, to 105.
Some analysts questioned, though, whether yesterday's report signaled a turnaround in the economy's prospects. "Today's consumer confidence data does not register a brand new world," said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. "Being so oversold, you will see supply rallies. The question is whether this is a trading market or an investing market."
Though they are unsure why this rally began or how long it will last, some investors are using the optimism to seek trading gains. And some money managers said it was hard not to get caught up in the excitement.
"There's a pressure that maybe I ought to be chasing this," said Brett Gallagher, vice president of Julius Baer Investment Management, who manages $400 million in stocks for foundations and wealthy individuals. Among the stocks leading the Dow higher, I.B.M. gained $4.10, to $99.50; United Technologies rose $2.70, to $74.46; and SBC Communications advanced $2.65, to $43.90.
But another Dow stock, Johnson & Johnson, fell $2.13, to $83.25, after the company said it would acquire Alza, a maker of drug delivery systems, for stock valued at $10.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Russia's Spy Riposte: Film Catches Americans in the Act 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 27 

 BODY:
Indulging its own version of spy mania, Russia's intelligence services released television film on the main news channels tonight showing United States military attaches buying information from a Russian agent.
 The news programs also broadcast an audio tape of a Russian scholar, currently on trial for espionage, phoning Capt. Robert Brannon, a senior American naval attache here, and discussing what kind of armaments were aboard a Russian intelligence ship sent to the Balkans during the NATO military campaign in 1999. 
 In a day of Russian protest and bluster following the Bush administration's decision to expel 50 Russian diplomats for espionage, Moscow again summoned the ranking American diplomat here, John Ordway, and gave him the names of four diplomats who must leave the country within 10 days. Russian law enforcement officials promptly identified one of the diplomats as Paul A. Hollingsworth, a first secretary at the embassy. Embassy officials said they would not comment on the identities of those expelled. 
The Russians did not demand the expulsion of the C.I.A.'s Moscow station chief, a United States intelligence official said. The station chief, like his counterpart in the Russian S.V.R. in Washington, is known to the host government, and is the official liaison channel for contacts between the security services. The United States did not expel the Russian station chief in Washington, either. 
The Russian action was virtually identical to the American move. 
Moscow declared four American diplomats persona non grata, and demanded that 46 others leave by July, the official said. By this afternoon in Washington, none of the United States diplomats -- presumably C.I.A. officers under diplomatic cover -- had left Moscow. 
Though both President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have said they hope that the espionage crisis will not harm relations between the two countries, it seemed clear that Russian officials were seeking to discredit American arguments that it was Russia's overexuberance that brought on the crisis. 
The conflict has spilled over to the diplomatic field, with Russia's Foreign Ministry lashing the Bush administration over the meeting of senior American diplomats in Washington with Ilyas Akhmadov, a representative of the Chechen rebel leadership that the Russian Army has been trying to defeat. Moscow's protest carried a more indignant tone today after three car bomb attacks during the weekend attributed to Chechen militants killed 22 people. All the attacks were in the Stavropol region, which adjoins Chechnya.
"After the Stavropol events," said Aleksandr Yakovenko, a Russian Foreign Ministry official, "after all those bloody terrorist acts, this meeting in Washington looks immoral to say the least."
At the same time, Mr. Putin's government appeared to be going out of its way today to accentuate its initiatives in places where the Bush administration has either hesitated to become more deeply involved, as in Israel, or has resorted to military force, as in Iraq. 
In a message to the Arab summit conference in Jordan, Mr. Putin proposed suspending all economic sanctions against Iraq on the condition that it accept a "revival of international monitoring" that would prevent it from pursuing "banned military programs." 
As for Israel and the Palestinian territories, Mr. Putin said the "most burning issue" now was to normalize the situation by Israel's "lifting blockades, including economic ones, from the West Bank and Gaza and ending violence." 
On the spy front, a state television broadcast opened with a man standing at a telephone booth near the American Embassy in Moscow. He was placing a call to Captain Brannon, stationed here as a naval attache since 1998. The caller, Anatoly Popov, was identified as a Russian convicted of attempted hijacking in 1976.
The video documented how a meeting was arranged at a cafe near the embassy. While Captain Brannon paced the sidewalks near the restaurant, two unidentified American military attaches were shown meeting with Mr. Popov and paying him $400 for a maritime chart of the Yenisei River delta area in northern Siberian. Mr. Popov also promised to provide a map of "minefields." 
In the broadcast, Mr. Popov said he later turned himself in, fearing arrest. 
In a second episode involving Captain Brannon, the television broadcast played an audio tape of a telephone conversation between the naval officer and Igor Sutyagin, a researcher at Russia's U.S.A. and Canada Institute charged in 1999 with revealing state secrets after he helped compile a book on Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal. The book was based on unclassified literature and his own scientific analysis. 
Mr. Sutyagin's defense has rested on the assertion that he never had any access to classified materials. On the audio tape, he answered Captain Brannon's questions about what kind of armaments were aboard the Russian intelligence ship Liman. 
Captain Brannon was interested in whether the crew of the Liman was equipped with shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles as it prepared to leave for the Balkans. Mr. Sutyagin said the ship did not have such weapons. Mr. Sutyagin wanted to know if Captain Brannon had received his fax, and the American replied that he had, adding that he had been much more pleased with the "envelope" Mr. Sutyagin had sent. 
The contents of the "envelope" were not disclosed, but a Russian commentator said that when Captain Brannon's name came up in the trial of Mr. Sutyagin, the American official left the country abruptly. He later returned.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 30, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday describing a videotaped exchange between an American naval officer and a Russian scholar accused of espionage reversed the identity of the speakers at one point. It was the American who asked the Russian whether he had received a fax.

The SAT Debate Ought to Be Broader

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A MONTH ago, when Richard C. Atkinson, president of the University of California, proposed dropping the SAT requirement for applicants, he opened a vigorous national debate on whether College Board exams properly identify students who will do well in college.
 But by focusing on how to predict academic success, the discussion has mostly skipped over a deeper issue: How do we define broader goals for college graduates? Are scores on any high school test the best way to identify young people most likely to achieve those goals? "The Shape of the River," a 1998 book by William Bowen, former president of Princeton, and Derek Bok, former president of Harvard, argued against academic performance alone and for "contributions that individuals make throughout their lives" as the aim of college admissions. 
 Most people probably agree that universities should train students for economic, political, intellectual and moral leadership. These require academic skills, but also more. 
Dr. Atkinson noted that the SAT's test of mental agility had little to do with mastery of course work and that it distorted lives of adolescents who buy costly preparation packages and agonize over tiny score changes. Instead, he proposed to find tests more aligned with secondary-school curriculums. On these, students could excel from more conscientious high school study.
But small advantages in scores on any test may not be the way to predict college graduates' community service or business creativity.
White students have higher average SAT scores than blacks. Yet a Harvard School of Public Health team found that white college students were three times as likely to engage in binge drinking. In itself, propensity for alcoholism should not disqualify youths for college, but it is not entirely irrelevant. Higher SAT scores don't predict responsibility; tests aligned with high school curriculums may not do better.
A study at the University of California at Santa Barbara found that students who sacrificed to attend -- going into debt or taking part-time jobs -- were more engaged in academic, cultural and volunteer activities than affluent students with higher SAT scores. Dr. Bowen and Dr. Bok reached similar conclusions.
Surely college students need academic competence. But a qualifying level can be set by a passing score on standardized exams. Beyond that, score gradations are less important.
Little is known about forecasting college or lifetime success; research predicts only freshman grades. Students with higher SAT scores do slightly better in freshman year than those with lower, but the margin is small. Better high school grades also predict slightly higher freshman grades. Scores on College Board subject tests (called SAT II exams) do the same. The three do slightly better in combination.
But nobody knows if these can predict later college grades or completion, or character, creativity, civic engagement, religious leadership or business acumen.
The University of Texas now admits students in the top 10 percent of high school classes, without regard to SAT scores; Florida admits the top 20 percent. That approach tries to ensure that entering classes include at least some top students from mostly minority schools.
Opponents condemn such percentage plans, because one school's A may denote less knowledge than another's B. Yet this valid criticism fails to ask what qualities of ambition, discipline and sacrifice take youths to the top ranks of troubled schools. Might immigrant 10-percenters from El Paso be better bets for leadership than lower-ranked students from Dallas, though the latter do better on tests?
The University of California has a similar admissions policy, for the top 4 percent. With the university taking three times that many graduating high school seniors from within the state, the plan has barely affected admissions; SAT scores still play a big role. Instead of calling for a better standardized test, Dr. Atkinson might have urged including a larger percentage of top-ranked students. A gradual expansion could be monitored to be certain admitted students can do college work.
Of course, it would be wrong for colleges to drop the preparation of academic stars as their exclusive goal for the sake of adopting an equally extreme notion that they should produce only moral, political or economic leaders. Universities' multifaceted roles are what make admissions complex.
Dr. Atkinson stepped gingerly beyond a narrow goal of seeking better academic merit, saying campuses should also seek students who make great progress in troubled circumstances. But he did not say whether such students are desirable because they will get better grades or because they have other strengths.
The California proposal invites a broader discussion of universities' mission, and which traits predict high school applicants' contributions to it. That discussion should begin.

HEADLINE: School Management Company Faces Ouster in San Francisco 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The private company trying to win approval to manage five low-performing public schools in New York City has moved a step closer to having a similar contract revoked in San Francisco.
 An investigation by the San Francisco Unified School District of complaints lodged against Edison Schools Inc. and the charter school it operates there concluded that the company violated several terms of its charter. According to a report issued by the district on Monday, the violations included inadequate financial reporting and Edison's failure to have an independent community board oversee the school. 
 But the investigation found no statistically significant evidence that the school tried to persuade academically deficient or special education students to leave, as critics have charged.
The San Francisco school board was expected to vote last night on a resolution to revoke the Edison school's charter. If the resolution passes, as is expected, the district is required to give the company 90 days to correct the violations. If adequate steps have not been taken by then, the district can revoke the contract, which runs through the end of the 2002-03 school year.
On Monday, the board's curriculum committee voted 2 to 1 to recommend that the full board vote in favor of the resolution, and board members who have stated their belief that the Edison contract should be revoked make up a majority of the board.
The San Francisco vote comes as Edison Schools is in engaged in an election, which ends on Friday, in New York City on a proposal to run five low-performing schools beginning next fall. The parents of a majority of the students in each of the New York schools must approve a measure to convert the schools to charters under Edison's management. 
Jill Wynns, the president of the San Francisco school board and a vocal opponent of Edison, said, "Although we recognize that a number of parents are satisfied with the education their children are receiving at Edison, the fact is that we've received a great many complaints indicating serious deficiencies that we are obligated to investigate."
Gaynor McCown, an Edison Schools executive, yesterday called the district's investigation "a sham." The company provided a detailed response to the report, presenting evidence that contradicts some of the district's conclusions about test scores and a changing student population. 
"Are there issues?" Ms. McCown said. "Yes, there may be one or two small issues. Does it rise to the level of revoking the charter? Absolutely not."
The district's report also faulted Edison for high teacher turnover after each of its first two years managing the school. In the spring of 1999, after Edison's first year operating the school, 21 of 26 teachers left in a dispute over Edison's longer working hours. Edison agreed to a pay increase for teachers, but 18 of 25 teachers left after the second year, according to the investigation.
The inquiry also found that a free after-school program managed by a community group moved out of the school after Edison asked the group to pay rent for its space in the school. The Edison school now runs an after-school program that charges parents about $200 a month, the report said.
The report states that after Edison took over, the school's population of students who are classified as "English language learners" and economically disadvantaged declined, but its population of Latino students and students classified as educationally disadvantaged increased.

HEADLINE: Arizona Owes Growth Spurt Largely to an Influx of Hispanics 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, March 27 

 BODY:
Population growth that is giving Arizona two additional Congressional seats came about largely because of a soaring Hispanic population in the state in the last 10 years, according to census figures released today.
 As the state population grew to 5.1 million in 2000, a 35.4 percent increase over the 1990 adjusted population of 3.7 million, the Hispanic population grew by nearly 80 percent, to 1.29 million from 733,153. Hispanics now make up a quarter of the Arizona population, compared with less than 20 percent a decade ago. 
 The 2000 census shows non-Hispanic whites being nearly 64 percent of the population, compared with 57 percent in 1990; American Indians, nearly 5 percent, a drop of 0.68 of a percentage point from 1990; and blacks, about 3 percent, a drop of 0.24 of a percentage point. 
The new census also showed that unlike in Florida and other states where the rising numbers are spread out fairly evenly around the state, the growth in Arizona was highly concentrated in metropolitan areas. The state's most populous county, Maricopa, which includes Phoenix, grew by 40.9 percent, to 3 million from 2.1 million in 1990.
Pima County, which borders Mexico and includes the state's second-largest city, Tucson, grew by nearly 23 percent, to 843,746.
Tom Rex, research manager for the Center for Business Research at Arizona State University, said the growing number of Hispanics in Arizona reflected a vacuum in the labor pool. With fewer native-born people to fill jobs as the country's economy was heating up in the early 1990's, he said, larger numbers of Hispanics were drawn to fill the jobs, which paid higher wages than were available in Mexico and other countries.
"We don't know yet how many of these people came from other countries or from California and Texas," Mr. Rex said. "But it's fair to conclude that the bulk of them entered the country illegally. In a sense that immigration bailed the country out. Otherwise, a labor shortage would have had a real effect on our economy."
To examine population trends in the last decade, The New York Times compared 2000 census figures to adjusted figures from the 1990 census to improve accuracy after the completion of the 1990 census.
The adjusted 1990 figures were based on a detailed survey of 170,000 households conducted several months after the original census was completed. The second survey found that the 1990 census missed 8 million people, many of them poor blacks and Hispanics, and that it double-counted about 4 million people.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A New Look at Race in the States"This month, the Census Bureau is releasing state population figures by race and ethnicity.

HEADLINE: Florida Has More Hispanics Than Blacks, Census Shows 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 27 

 BODY:
Leading a shift in the ethnic and racial makeup of the country, Florida now has more Hispanic residents than blacks, 2000 census data released today show.
 A million more Hispanics moved to Florida in the last decade, causing a surge in the statewide population that will enable the state to gain two Congressional seats. 
 "This is higher growth than we thought we'd be having," said Lance DeHaven-Smith, associate director of the Florida Institute of Government at Florida State University. Florida's overall population grew by three million residents, or 23.5 percent in the 1990's, census data show. 
Also surprising was the fact that the Hispanic population had spread throughout the state and was no longer concentrated in the south. Statewide, the Hispanic population grew by about 63 percent to 2.7 million people. Hispanics now account for 16.8 percent of Florida residents. 
The growth among Hispanics here is being driven not just by a surge in Cuban-Americans but also by people from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Colombia and other Latin American countries.
Considering plentiful service jobs, proximity to their countries of origin and government services that support immigrants, the growth of the Hispanic population in Florida is understandable.
"Because Spanish is spoken so often here, it draws individuals and investors from Latin American countries here," said Katherine Condon, demographer and research associate at Florida International University. "They feel comfortable coming to Florida because they can speak their own language."
In addition to giving Florida more political power in Washington, the growth in the Hispanic population also promises to affect politics, public education, the labor force and the economy.
"The diversity among Hispanics is certainly growing," Ms. Condon said.
And along with it, Hispanics' political influence should grow, too, and not just in Miami, which has a politically powerful, well-established Cuban-American population.
"Because Cubans have gotten into the political and economic structure, then other groups of Hispanics can use that to get their foot in the door," Ms. Condon said. 
The state's most populous county, Miami-Dade, grew by 16 percent, to 2.3 million people. The number of Hispanics there, meanwhile, grew by 338,330 people, or 35.5 percent.
Black Floridians, demographers said, risk being overshadowed as the third-largest segment of the state's population. The percentage of blacks in Florida increased to 14.4 percent, from 13.3 percent in the last decade. The new data show that 2.3 million blacks live in Florida.
The comparison of census data uses an adjusted figure for 1990 that was revised to include estimated undercounted residents. The 2000 census is considered more accurate and was not adjusted.
Though the data released yesterday did not include a breakdown by age of the state's residents, the growth among non-Hispanics can almost certainly be attributed to an increase in retirees, demographers said.
"They keep coming for the dream as much as anything else," said Mr. DeHaven-Smith of the Florida Institute of Government at Florida State. "That dream is warm weather, flowered shirts, outside life on the beach. And that has become part of our culture." 
He said growth in some counties in central and northern Florida reflected both the spreading out of the state's Hispanic population and retirement-age citizens looking to move farther from urban centers. The trend began in Miami and is continuing in places like Orlando and Tampa.
"We have watched this population move literally up the coast," Mr. DeHaven-Smith said. "In the 1970's, Miami was a Jewish retirement community. This is the exact same place that was little brown Jewish women laying in the sun. Today it is Hispanic women on Roller Blades."

 BODY:
Democrats Propose Giving $300 to Every Taxpayer
Democrats introduced legislation in the Senate that would give all taxpayers a $300 rebate check this year and give most of them $150 more by withholding less money from their paychecks in the second half of the year. Some Democrats said this would relieve the pressure on them to vote for the tax-rate reduction over 10 years that President Bush favors.
 At the same time, the president's plan to abolish the estate tax suffered a serious blow. The congressional staff that puts the price tag on tax measures calculated repealing the tax on large estates would cost two and a half times what had been projected. Page A16. 

Rate Rise Approved in California
California's power regulators approved the largest utility rate increases in state history to avert more blackouts and keep electricity producers from collapsing in bankruptcy. A1.

Abbott to Cut Price of H.I.V. Drugs
In the latest drug industry response to the growing global debate on the prices of AIDS drugs, Abbott Laboratories said it would sell two of its treatments for H.I.V. infection at "no profit" in Africa.

STIMULUS FOR MALAYSIA

 Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia announced a 3 billion ringgit ($789 million) fiscal stimulus package to offset the effects of a global slowdown on his country's export-driven economy. 
In addition to new spending to build schools and universities, Mr. Mahathir said his government would accelerate the construction of a controversial hydroelectric dam in the rain forests of Borneo, lower social security payments by workers and require banks to increase lending 8 percent a year. Stock-ownership regulations will be eased to encourage foreign investment, but the prime minister's decision in 1998 to peg the nation's currency to the United States dollar will stand. Wayne Arnold

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
Competition among premium airline services intensifies.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AS the list of movies nominated for the Academy Awards indicated, people can sit through just about anything for two hours.
 Hence many frequent business travelers accept the discomfort of a cramped airline seat in steerage -- on a short flight. But even as businesses begin cutting back on travel expenses, many of the most frequent business travelers, who also tend to be among the most highly valued employees, are still demanding premium accommodations, especially on those all-night flights across the Atlantic or those 15-hour slogs to Asia. 
 "The way I see it, I'm working 24-7 when I'm traveling, which I do a couple of times a month, and I deserve a certain basic level of comfort," said a young investment banker who regularly flies from New York to London. She usually takes in Virgin Atlantic's new Upper Class service, started late last year to appeal to the well-heeled business traveler. It features sleeper-bed seats, lavish departure and arrival lounges, and amenities like massages. 
"Flying in comfort is nonnegotiable, from my point of view," she added. "The day somebody tells me to fly coach is the day I look for another job."
There's no doubt that corporate controls have suddenly tightened on air fares and hotels. In the last few weeks, several major domestic airlines have warned that their first-quarter profits will suffer, partly because companies cut travel spending this winter as the flagging technology industry sent the economy south.
On the other hand, business travel remains a long-term imperative in a global economy where, according to Business Travel Executive magazine, 80 percent of corporate travel departments will be booking international trips by the end of this decade. And according to a recent survey by Runzheimer International, nearly three-quarters of 182 North American travel managers questioned reported an increase in domestic business travel last year despite rising costs, and a 51 percent increase in international trips. 
Naturally, the recent cutbacks in business travel, the most profitable market segment for airlines, are worrisome for the carriers, given uncertainties about how long the situation will last. But even as cuts are made in some areas of travel, many airlines and company travel departments are also grappling with a separate question: How much of the corporate air fare dollar will continue going toward an increasing supply of first-class, business-class and premium economy-class seats that airlines have been rushing to add to attract weary business travelers? 
Last year, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the two major British carriers on the lucrative North Atlantic routes, led an audacious new push for the premium long-haul market, about 90 percent of which is business travel. British Air spent $300 million while the considerably smaller Virgin Atlantic spent $100 million to redesign cabins with more, and more luxurious, accommodations, including pod-like sleeper seats, high-quality food and in-seat entertainment systems.
Many other long-haul domestic and foreign airlines have also been rushing to refurbish their higher-end services.
Long-haul carriers laid down these high-stakes bets on the premium business-travel market just before the United States economy became shaky, however. While both British Air and Virgin Atlantic reported that their premium services continued growing last month, competition is intensifying in a tough market. As a result, corporate travel departments are probably going to be driving tougher deals when they spring for premium travel. 
"Companies are certainly exercising much tighter control over costs," said Ray Grainger, the general manager for sales at British Airways, which dispatches marketing teams to corporate travel departments to help tailor in-house travel policies to channel more customers into its Club World business class or its World Traveler Plus premium coach.
Some companies, he said, "just recognize that there is more to life than just the cheapest price, so therefore they'll pay a bit more money in order to realize a better quality of service for their employees when they travel around the world."
Airlines typically negotiate volume discounts with business clients, and neither British Air nor Virgin Atlantic officials would say how much a seat in their competing premium cabins really costs when purchased by a loyal corporate client. For round-trip travel between New York and London, Virgin lists Upper Class walk-up fares at $6,900; British Air's competing Club World fare is $6,800.
Whichever way the economy goes, one interesting note to the battle for the high-end market is that airlines are now openly promoting the services not as a way to get more work done, but as a way for executives to relax, sleep, dine well or have fun with a wide variety of in-seat entertainment options.
"This is the only time some of these people have to go to the cinema," said Paul Moore, the director of corporate affairs for Virgin Atlantic.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bush Speech Promoting His Tax Cuts 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by President Bush yesterday in Kalamazoo, Mich., as recorded by The New York Times.
 Oftentimes what I try to say in Washington gets filtered and sometimes my words in Washington don't exactly translate directly to the people. So I've found it's best to travel the country. I'm coming in from Billings, Mont. We had about 12,000 people show up last night to hear -- gave me a chance to talk -- about what tax relief means and common-sense budgeting will do for our nation. 
 You see, it's the president's job to look for warnings of economic trouble ahead and to heed them, and to act. I got elected because the people want the president to act, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. My approach is based upon common sense, and here it is:
We must put more money in the hands of consumers in the short term and restore confidence and optimism for the long term. We need an immediate stimulus for our economy and a pro-growth environment for years to come. Some in Congress want America to choose between these goals, to think of the moment and not the future. But lasting prosperity requires long-term thinking, and if we face facts and act boldly, I'm confident we can build the long-term prosperity we seek. . . . 
In the short term, the American consumer needs a hand. About 25 million families are carrying more than $10,000 in credit-card debt. Many families have tried to reduce their debt by tapping into their home equity and, partly as a result, the average homeowner's equity share in his or her house declined in the 1990's. More than a few consumers counted on their earnings in the stock market to help them carry their obligations. They need tax relief fast. In fact, they need it yesterday. So I strongly support the idea of backdating tax relief to get cash into the consumers' hands as swiftly as possible. And I applaud the members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, who have come forward to endorse quick action on tax relief. Yet our economy needs more than a pick-me-up, more than a one-time boost.
Our economic health depends on people feeling comfort and confidence about long-term decisions to start a new business, to invest in a new idea, to buy a new home. And the people who make those decisions don't care only about this year's tax rate; they care about next year's rate and the year after that. 
Immediate tax relief is good news, but tax relief that gets yanked away next year is not such good news. Lower rates do not stimulate much economic activity unless people can rely on them for years down the road. We must rebuild business confidence and market confidence and consumer confidence through a permanently improved business environment.
Lower tax rates mean a new home will be more affordable, not just the first year, but every year. Lower rates mean that a new investment will have a better chance of success, not just the first year, but every year. Lower rates mean that a start-up company will keep more of its earnings, and not just the first year, but in every year.
The long-term growth of our economy also depends not only on real, meaningful tax reductions, but also on increasing productivity. America has prospered more than any other major economies in recent years because our productivity has grown faster than that of other major economies, and faster than we ourselves once believed possible. Since 1995, in fact, productivity has grown nearly twice as fast as it did between 1975 and 1995.
And what makes productivity go up? Well, you know as well as anybody, it's education and investment. If our productivity is to continue to grow, our people must know more tomorrow than they know today. They must read better. They must calculate faster and more accurately. They must understand science more deeply. So our education policies must insist upon results. We must be bold enough to measure our children's progress. We must hold schools accountable. And we must give parents and children better options if our schools fail to teach and will not change. And if our productivity is to continue to grow, our tools and machinery and equipment must work better and faster.
Our present tax code discourages investment by small business and entrepreneurs. The vast majority of American businesses pay tax on the personal schedule, not the corporate schedule. It's important for Congress to hear this. The number of unincorporated businesses and sole proprietors are huge. But they're the backbone of economic vitality in America. Back in 1990, they faced a top rate of 28 percent. Today the unincorporated business can face a maximum federal rate of nearly 40 percent.
Those taxes come right out of cash flow, making it harder for small-business owners to make investments that raise productivity, boost incomes, provide benefits to their workers. High taxes discourage potential entrepreneurs from taking the risk of starting a new business in the first place. Small business generates approximately 75 percent of America's net new jobs. High tax rates are weighing those businesses down.
And so I've submitted a plan that not only reduces the rate at the bottom end of the economic spectrum, but raises the top rate as well, to give small businesses the lift they need to continue providing the job base that'll keep America strong.

HEADLINE: The President on the Economy 

 BODY:
President Bush took to the road yesterday to assert his authority as the nation's economic helmsman and plug for Congressional passage of his unaffordable and regressive 10-year, $1.6 trillion tax cut proposal. "It's the president's job to look for warnings of economic trouble ahead and to heed them, and to act," he told Michigan businessmen. "I got elected because the people want the president to act, and that's exactly what I'm going to do." But of course he cannot award tax cuts unilaterally, and the political motivation for his foray into the hinterlands was to generate pressure on Congress to support a tax cut of the size, duration and distribution that he has proposed. 
 Mr. Bush was clearly concerned that his tax proposals may founder in the Senate, where they currently lack the votes for passage, and where Democrats are backing an immediate short-term tax cut as a way to erode support for the bigger Bush package. But his third and latest rationale for his plan is no more persuasive than the first two. 
 When the big tax cut was first proposed on the campaign trail, under far more exuberant economic conditions, Mr. Bush argued that because the government was stockpiling surpluses as the economy continued to grow, the people who pay most of Uncle Sam's bills deserved a large tax break. But once it became apparent late last year that a sudden slowdown was threatening to end the 10-year economic expansion, Mr. Bush slapped a new label on his plan. It suddenly became a necessary stimulus, never mind that only $5.5 billion of the $1.6 trillion went to taxpayers in the first year of the plan. 
On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats began clamoring for more immediate tax breaks to encourage consumer spending, so yesterday the president sought to regain the initiative. He endorsed the idea of putting more money in the hands of consumers in the short term by making more of his tax cuts retroactive, and he put forth a third rationale for his overall plan. Long-term tax relief is needed, he said, to encourage investment by small businesses and entrepreneurs, thus giving a populist gloss to a cut that would mostly benefit the wealthy. 
What is most worrisome about the president's speech is that it shows an alarming lack of appreciation for the role that the prudent management of public finances played in the past decade's economic expansion. Mr. Bush's 10-year tax cut plan, with a price tag that seems increasingly as uncertain as the estimated surpluses used to justify it, is a threat to that very pillar of economic growth.

HEADLINE: Abbott to Sell Low-Cost AIDS Drugs in Africa 

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
In the latest drug industry response to the growing global debate on the prices of AIDS drugs, Abbott Laboratories said yesterday that it would sell two of its treatments for H.I.V. infection at "no profit" in Africa.
 The announcement by Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Ill., follows similar offers earlier this month by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. All of the makers of AIDS drugs are under increasing pressure to reduce the prices of their medicines in African nations and other developing countries. Health officials estimate that in Africa alone, 25 million people may be infected with H.I.V. 
 And yesterday, it also became clear that the debate on the high prices of AIDS drugs is moving to the United States, where the typical cocktail of medicines that can keep the virus at bay costs $10,000 to $15,000 a year.
Members of the Consumer Project on Technology, a patient advocacy group in Washington, said yesterday that they had formed a nonprofit company that would soon ask the government to allow it to make and sell a low-cost version of d4T, an AIDS medicine that is sold by Bristol-Myers for $10 a day in the United States. The group said it believed it could sell d4T, which is sold under the brand name Zerit, for 10 percent or less of the Bristol-Myers price.
The group argues that under a 1980 law known as the Bayh-Dole Act, the government must grant the nonprofit company a license to sell a low-cost generic version of Zerit. A provision in the Bayh-Dole Act allows the government to require a company selling a drug developed with government-sponsored research to grant a license to another party if it is shown that the drug company is not making the invention available to the public on "reasonable terms." The advocates say they will show that Bristol-Myers' price for Zerit is excessive and that it is creating hardships for patients.
The consumer group says government grants covered most of the cost of discovering and developing Zerit, and the government holds certain patent rights on the drug. Yale University also holds a patent on Zerit, and in the early 1990's it granted Bristol-Myers an exclusive license to sell the drug, which was approved in 1994.
James Love, director of the Consumer Project, which was founded by Ralph Nader in 1995, said that he had researched how much Bristol-Myers paid for the clinical trials to have Zerit approved, and that he believed that the company paid less than $15 million for those trials, but has generated more than $2 billion in revenue from the drug.
A spokesman for Bristol-Myers said yesterday that Mr. Love's figures were "inaccurate." But he said he could not immediately provide the amount the company had invested to develop Zerit. Bristol-Myers earned $618 million from Zerit last year.
The government has never approved a petition under the Bayh-Dole Act. But a spokeswoman at the National Institute of Health said if the government received the petition, "it will be taken seriously."
"There is a clearly set-out process whereby a group can do this," she said.
Bristol-Myers said yesterday that it did not have an immediate comment. "This is the first that we're hearing of this, so it's impossible for us to say anything," said John Kouten, a company spokesman.
A spokesman for Yale said yesterday that officials could not comment without seeing the group's proposal.
Mr. Love said the group was in the process of appointing directors to the new company's board, which does not yet have a name. He said the group expected to file the petition with the Department of Health and Human Services in mid-April.
If the petition is successful, Mr. Love said, the group may also ask the government to let it sell cancer drugs and other medicines that the government discovered.
In the other development yesterday, Abbott Laboratories said that it was offering to sell its two antiretroviral medications, Norvir and Kaletra, in Africa at prices that would cover the company's costs of manufacturing, distribution and import duties. Rick Moser, a company spokesman, said that the price of each drug for a patient was likely to be less than $1,000 a year. The price would vary, he said, from country to country.
To receive the lower-priced drugs, Mr. Moser said, a government or group must apply to a consulting firm that Abbott has hired, Axios International, to help distribute the medicines. Those who want to buy the drugs must prove that they can properly and consistently treat patients, he said.
Patients taking AIDS medications must be monitored by health professionals to ensure that they are taking the drugs properly and are not having significant side effects.
"AIDS has taken an unprecedented toll on the health, economic and social structures of Africa," said Miles D. White, Abbott's chairman. "Abbott has taken this action to give people most affected by this disease a better opportunity to access care."
Some advocates for AIDS patients praised Abbott's move yesterday, but questioned whether the prices Abbott is offering would really provide no profit to the company.
Kate Krauss, a member of Act Up Philadelphia, said that it wanted Abbott and the other drug companies to offer voluntary licenses to their products so that generic manufacturers could make lower-priced versions of the drugs.

HEADLINE: Buffett Says Stocks Are Still Too Costly 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 27 

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, one of America's most respected investors, said today that many United States stocks were still overvalued and their prices must decline further before he would consider them good investments.
 Mr. 
Buffett stopped short of calling the economic downturn in the United States a recession. 
 "We're in a slowdown, that's for sure," he said.
Mr. Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, spoke at a news conference to announce the delivery of 50 new aircraft to Executive Jet, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary. Executive Jet will use the Cessna aircraft for its NetJets fractional ownership program, in which several owners buy a plane on a time-share plan.
Mr. Buffett said he would start buying shares again "when businesses sell for less in the market than they're worth."
He reasserted his well-known aversion to shares in high-technology companies, saying he has not bought any, despite the plunge in share prices for dot-com businesses in the last year.

HEADLINE: Tremors in the Economy, Uncertainty in the Capital 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27 

 BODY:
The politics of prosperity is giving way to the politics of uncertainty.
 Even before it becomes clear whether the nation is slipping into recession or just enduring a wrenching slowdown, Republicans and Democrats alike are scrambling to adjust to the abrupt change in the outlook from last year, when economic cockiness suffused policy and political considerations. 
 "It's like an earthquake," said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana.
After an election campaign that focused on how to apportion the spoils of affluence, President Bush now faces the possibility of governing in a period of diminished expectations. He could also confront the tricky task of dodging the blame that inevitably gets directed at the occupant of the White House when the economy turns down. 
Just today, Mr. Bush said his policies were intended to deal with "reality as we found it" upon taking office, months after the slowdown first became apparent. 
On his signature issue of tax cuts, Mr. Bush further de-emphasized his original argument: that getting the projected federal budget surplus out of Washington and into the hands of taxpayers was the only way to ensure it would not be spent on a bloated government. Instead, he called more forcefully than in the past for Congress to rework his $1.6 trillion proposal so that it gives the faltering economy an immediate kick.
For their part, Democrats have abandoned their traditional response to economic trouble: fiscal stimulus in the form of additional government spending. Determined to avoid being cast as impediments to a quick recovery, they are coalescing around a smaller tax cut that would give a sizable, one-time push to the economy in the short run and provide more of its benefits in the long run to the lower end of the income scale than would Mr. Bush's proposal.
But it is not just tax cuts that have been put in play by the changing economic landscape. The budget-surplus projections, the foundation for the agendas of both parties, will only become more suspect if the economy remains weak for an extended period. 
"I don't think there's any doubt, given what we now know about the economy, that this $5.7 trillion has already partially evaporated," the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Dachle of South Dakota, said of the projected surplus over the next decade.
With Wall Street having made the 50 percent of households that have invested in stocks feel like losers for the last few months, the drive to create personal investment accounts within Social Security could become harder to sustain. And free trade, a tough sell in Congress even during the boom of the 1990's, could face new resistance if the unemployment rate starts ticking up. 
Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said members of Congress were already hearing about layoffs in their districts and were wondering how constituents would handle losses in the stock market and whether it would be possible to continue moving people off the welfare rolls. "Most members of this body have been here only for some pretty good times," Mr. Portman said, "and the politics of prosperity is what we've gotten used to." 
Because the economic outlook has remained so murky, members of both parties have had trouble determining how sweeping an overhaul in policy and strategy is necessary. 
Still, Republicans and Democrats too have moved with unusual speed to get out ahead of what might or might not be the end of the decade-long expansion, keenly aware that it is a cardinal sin in politics to appear detached when jobs, retirement plans and a general sense of security are on the line. 
"If you go back through the history of the postwar era, in many if not most cases the political establishment and the forecasters didn't even recognize the recession until we were well into it," said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group. "This time the recession was cited in advance, before it even happened. We've speeded up the whole process."
Mr. Bush has tried to pin the "downturn," as the White House has taken to calling it in the last two days, on the preceding administration. He could be lucky in getting the down phase of the business cycle out of the way early in his first term, assuming the bad news does not linger.
But a deep or prolonged economic problem would almost certainly undermine Mr. Bush's political standing. And with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, it would not help his party, either.
In his speech in Michigan today, Mr. Bush said his policy goals after cutting taxes were to create private investment accounts within Social Security and to negotiate more free-trade deals around the world, steps he said would help maintain prosperity for the long run.
But opponents of the president's Social Security proposal have already stepped up their campaign against it, in the wake of the fall in share prices.
And even supporters of expanded trade say that winning authority from Congress this year to negotiate trade deals in Latin America and other regions could prove difficult for Mr. Bush if American workers and industries feel beleaguered by the economy.
"One of the things trade-expansion advocates have noted with dismay in recent years is that we were not getting widespread support even with low unemployment and high growth," said Daniel Tarullo, a Clinton administration official. "People fear that when those favorable economic circumstances turn, it may be even more difficult to move forward."

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Ask $300 Rebate for Taxpayers, and Further $150 Cut for Most 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27 

 BODY:
Seeking a political edge on the question of tax cuts, Democrats introduced legislation in the Senate today that would give all taxpayers a $300 rebate check this year and give most of them an additional $150 by withholding less money from their paychecks in the second half of the year.
 Some Democrats said this proposal, whose cost they put at $60 billion, would relieve the pressure on them to vote for the across-the-board tax-rate reduction over 10 years that President Bush favors. 
 At the same time, the president's proposal to abolish the estate tax suffered a serious blow. The Congressional staff that calculates the cost of tax legislation estimated that repealing the tax on large estates would cost $662 billion in the next 10 years, two and a half times what the White House projected when it submitted Mr. Bush's budget outline last month. 
The two developments put Republicans in Congress on the defensive.
On the question of rebates, they accused Democrats of distorting the idea Republicans first broached last week of allocating $60 billion from the budget surplus in the current fiscal year for an immediate tax cut. Republicans insist that the one-time stimulus be combined with long-term tax reduction.
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader, said of the Democrats: "What they're trying to do is give everyone $300 with no real tax cut. I don't think they want a tax cut."
Concerning estate tax repeal, Republicans threatened to twist the arms of the staff of the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan experts who use computer models to determine what tax legislation would cost. "They need to review their methodology," Mr. Nickles said. "This is ridiculous."
Democrats, meanwhile, were upbeat after months of uncertainty about how to respond to the Bush tax plan.
"We're mystified as to why the Republicans will not take us up on their offer" to lower taxes by $60 billion this year, said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. 
"Is it possible," Mr. Daschle said, "that the Republicans have just met the first tax cut they don't like, or is it that tax relief for everyone is being held hostage by their commitment to a massive tax cut for the very few?"
Republicans replied that such talk was nonsense. Asked about the Democrats' motive, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, who first suggested the $60 billion cut for the current year, said: "Whatever they're trying to do, it isn't going to work -- from the standpoint of passing or from the standpoint of helping the economy. It's a nice gesture, but it's not what the economy needs."
Under the Democratic plan, the government would send a $300 check to everyone who paid income or payroll taxes in 2000. A couple would get $600.
In addition, the lowest income tax rate, 15 percent, would be reduced to 10 percent on the first $6,000 of taxable income for an individual and $12,000 for a couple filing jointly. That would mean a tax reduction in the second half of this year of $150 -- $300 for a couple -- which would be reflected in lower withholding from paychecks beginning July 1. 
Democrats maintained that the economy was now shaky, that Mr. Bush's plan would do nothing until next year and that their plan would give the economy a quick and needed lift. Republicans countered by saying the only way to help the economy in the long run was to give upper-income taxpayers a large tax cut that they would use to invest and create jobs.
In a speech today to the National Association of Business Economists, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said: "Some suggest we send a rebate to taxpayers now and stop there. That's not good enough. If we want to change consumption patterns, we need to make a permanent change in people's tax burdens."
Much of this was just political jockeying, each side often seemingly more interested in making a case than in passing legislation. But at the day's end, it seemed possible that a compromise could be worked out.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, suggested that Republicans might be willing to pass a stimulative tax cut for this year if Democrats would agree on a specific date later in the spring for a vote on Mr. Bush's long-term tax plan.
Democrats did not completely reject the idea. "That forms the basis of a discussion," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee.
The debate on taxes and the budget is centered in the Senate, evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, because the House of Representatives now operates in so rigidly a partisan manner that the outcome is predictable and compromise is out of the question.
Three weeks ago, on a nearly straight party-line vote, the House approved the across-the-board tax-rate reduction that the president sought. 
On Wednesday, a vote is scheduled in the House on a budget blueprint that closely tracks the president's proposals. On Thursday, the House plans to vote on two other aspects of Mr. Bush's tax plan: a tax cut for married couples and an increase in the tax credit for families with children.
The House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled this week to consider the other big item in Mr. Bush's tax package, a gradual repeal of the gift and estate tax. But the prospects for such a measure were shaken by the cost projection from the staff of the joint tax committee.
In the budget outline it sent Congress last month, the White House estimated that the 10-year cost of the phased-in repeal would be $266.6 billion. But the committee staff built into its computer model various legal strategies wealthy taxpayers would use to avoid income taxes if there was no gift or estate tax, and concluded that the true cost over 10 years would be $662.2 billion.
Moreover, that figure assumed that people with large inheritances would be subject to capital gains tax on the inherited property, an additional tax that Mr. Bush did not include in his proposal. Without the capital gains element, the cost of the Bush plan would be even higher.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Calls for Better Data Collection 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27 

 BODY:
The biggest payoffs in efforts to improve economic forecasts are likely to come from raising the quality of the data collected, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today.
 Mr. Greenspan said that economists needed to put more emphasis on ways to better analyze the output of an increasingly complex society. 
 He said this effort was likely to yield more benefits than building ever-more-complex computer models that try to predict where the economy is headed.
"I suspect greater payoffs will come from more data than from more technique," Mr. Greenspan said in remarks delivered to the National Association for Business Economics.
He said that in the 1960's, economists were "increasingly mesmerized by the possibilities of econometric models as a crystal ball for the future." 
But it became apparent, he said, that even the most sophisticated models had drawbacks.
"We soon learned that the economic structure did not hold still long enough to capture its key relationships," he said.
Mr. Greenspan told members of the association, which represents economists working for businesses and government agencies in the United States, that while the Federal Reserve had found economic models useful, he thought that greater benefits in forecasting would come from devoting resources to improving the data that was collected.
He said this effort was critical, given that the economy is now much more greatly influenced by fields like computer technology and medical services that are hard to measure in terms of the gross domestic product.
"Over time, and particularly during the last decade or two, an ever-increasing share of G.D.P.," Mr. Greenspan said, "has reflected the value of ideas more than material substance or manual labor input."
In an age of the microprocessor, fiber optics and the laser, he added, the problem of precisely measuring output has grown more complex.
He said the Fed and other agencies were devoting more resources to improving methods of measuring the economy, and adding, "I am encouraged by the progress that economists and economic statisticians have been making to date in tackling the daunting task of measuring real output and prices in a rapidly changing economy."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Calls for Tightening Controls on Electricity Rates 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani called yesterday for the temporary imposition of more stringent price controls on wholesale electric power rates in New York State, saying that with last summer's surge in prices and the discomforting shortage of extra power supplies in the city, government intervention is needed.
 The proposal -- outlined yesterday in a speech to more than a hundred Wall Street, real estate and electric utility executives -- represents a subtle redirection of blame by the mayor for last summer's spike in electric prices and similar jumps he fears might result this year. 
 Last summer, after retail prices increased 43 percent in July, the mayor blasted power companies for gouging the public. Now he is turning his sights toward the state and the federal government's management of electric power deregulation, saying that with a limited supply of power in New York City and growing energy demand, it is too early to allow power generators to freely set their own prices. 
"The double-digit price increases that New Yorkers had to pay last summer are just unacceptable," the mayor said in a speech at the historic 23 Wall Street, former headquarters of J. P. Morgan & Company.
"Deregulation should not be abandoned, it should be completed," the mayor, a Republican, continued. "The problem is, unfortunately, when it was done we didn't think through all of the impacts it would have, how quickly it would have an effect on us, and it needs some adjustment right now."
New York City, Mr. Giuliani said, should be able to avoid the waves of power blackouts that have plagued California, another state that moved quickly and aggressively toward deregulation in the 1990's.
To prepare New York City for this summer -- when the city's peak power demand is expected to hit 10,535 megawatts -- a fleet of small electric generators is being installed to produce 404 megawatts, a small margin of surplus capacity, he said.
To speed the construction of the needed new permanent power plants -- four have been proposed in Queens and one each in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx -- the mayor also urged the state to accelerate environmental and regulatory reviews for the plants. And he asked civic leaders and judges not to try to block these projects and also urged more power conservation.
"This has ramifications beyond just the economy," the mayor said, referring to blackouts that could occur if the city's power supply is not increased. "It goes to whether people are going to live or die. Whether people are going to be safe."
The mayor's pleas did little yesterday to sway the power projects' critics. In a statement after his speech, opponents of several of the power plant projects disputed the need for so much new electricity capacity and questioned why most of the new or expanded plants would be built in lower income neighborhoods. 
The mayor "cannot scare New Yorkers into believing that we'll be sitting in the dark," said Eddie Bautista, a leader of Communities United for Responsible Energy. 
Mr. Giuliani anticipated such a response, saying after his speech, "I am good at teaching people reality."
The mayor's call for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose a lower price cap on wholesale electric rates in the state and perhaps the entire Northeast region put him somewhat at odds with the Pataki administration and the electric power industry. The cap is now $1,000 per megawatt hour, and the mayor's advisers said yesterday that he would like to see it set at $250.
The state's Public Service Commission and the independent organization that coordinates wholesale electricity prices are primarily backing a separate mechanism for preventing price surges this summer, a so-called circuit breaker. Unlike a fixed cap, their plan would limit the wholesale prices only when day-ahead prices surge at least $100 a megawatt hour.
The current average in New York over the last year is about $60 per megawatt hour, said Carol E. Murphy, a spokeswoman for New York Independent System Operator, which administers wholesale energy costs in the state. If a $250 cap is imposed, it could encourage electric power generators to raise their prices to this level, she said. "It would have a contradictory effect," she said.
John S. Dyson, a former deputy mayor who is advising the mayor on his energy policy, said the Giuliani administration would be open to other approaches to prevent price spikes this summer.
"As long as it works, the mayor is open to whatever everyone will agree on," Mr. Dyson said.

HEADLINE: BUSH SAYS REBATE ISN'T A SUBSTITUTE FOR HIS TAX PLAN 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: KALAMAZOO, Mich., March 27 

 BODY:
President Bush urged lawmakers today not to let the momentum in the Senate for a one-time tax rebate serve as a substitute for his 10-year tax-cutting plan that he values at $1.6 trillion, saying that the immediate measure would not do nearly enough to revive the economy.
 In a speech here that came as Mr. Bush's tax cut encountered growing trouble in the Senate, the president said that enacting a $60 billion quick-fix measure that many Senate Democrats and Republicans favor made sense only in concert with a broader, more permanent reduction in rates. 
 "Some in Congress want America to choose between these goals, to think of the moment and not the future," Mr. Bush said. "Our economy needs more than a pick-me-up, more than a one-time boost." Nonetheless, as Mr. Bush spoke, Senate Democrats introduced legislation that would give all taxpayers a $300 rebate check this year and reduce amounts withheld from their paychecks by $150 more. Such a plan, some said, would relieve the pressure on them to vote for the president's 10-year tax plan. Page A16. 
But Mr. Bush argued in his speech, which underscored an intensifying political battle over who gets credit for responding best to Americans' economic pain, that the Democrats' plan was shortsighted. 
"Our economic health depends on people feeling comfort and confidence about long-term decisions -- to start a new business, to invest in a new idea, to buy a new home," Mr. Bush said. "And the people who make those decisions don't care only about this year's tax rate; they care about next year's tax rate, and the year after that.
"Tax relief that gets yanked away next year is not such good news," the president continued. "Lower rates do not stimulate much economic activity, unless people can rely on them for years down the road."
Mr. Bush's speech, which at nearly 30 minutes ran much longer than his remarks on the stump usually do, represented one of his most forceful and wide-ranging attempts yet to make the case for his tax cut.
But it also sought to make clear to Americans that he was acutely conscious of some of the economy's troubles and that he was wholly prepared to find solutions.
Mr. Bush said, "It's the president's job to look for warnings of economic trouble ahead and heed them, and to act. I got elected because the people want the president to act, and that's exactly what I'm going to do."
Mr. Bush's comments clearly reflected his administration's concern that the enactment of a rebate, cast as the tonic the economy needed, would further jeopardize the prospects for his entire package being passed, because lawmakers would feel they had taken action and satisfied voters.
The president supports an immediate tax cut, as he made clear again today, but does not want it isolated from the rest of his plan.
The White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, told reporters, "He will not support anything that does not permanently cut taxes, because that's an excuse for the politicians to spend more money." Mr. Fleischer meant that it would leave too much of the surplus in federal coffers for spending projects.
Mr. Bush said he wanted to take immediate and long-term steps at the same time.
"We need an immediate stimulus for our economy," Mr. Bush said, referring to some of the ideas gathering force in the Senate without throwing his explicit support behind any single measure. He later added that Americans "need tax relief fast. In fact, they need it yesterday."
White House aides billed Mr. Bush's speech to businesspeople in an enormous gymnasium at Western Michigan University as a major economic address.
He framed his proposals for energy exploration, improvements in public education, free trade and private investment accounts within the Social Security system as facets of an overall strategy that would encourage economic growth.
Mr. Bush also seemed to be responding to critics who had claimed that his administration's expressions of economic gloom, which they have used to build support for a tax cut, had only made matters worse.
The president tempered his stated worries about the economy with statements of faith in its essential sturdiness, describing it as a "great athlete" who is "somewhat winded but fundamentally strong."
"This is an economy that has done amazing things," Mr. Bush added, "and it's on the verge of even greater accomplishments and achievements." 
But Mr. Bush also pointed to an array of statistics that suggested that economic growth had begun slowing long before he took office.
"As many Americans know firsthand, U.S. stock markets have been declining steadily for more than a year," he said, ticking off the percentage declines over the last year in major stock indexes. "In the final quarter of 2000, the American economy grew at a sluggish 1.1 percent pace."
Mr. Bush said that he had chosen to deliver his speech in Michigan because unemployment here had risen more over the last year than in any other state. It was 4.5 percent in February, up from 3.3 percent a year earlier, according to state figures.
But the president also wanted to put pressure on Michigan's two Democratic senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, to back his tax cut, which has yet to garner the support it needs in a Senate divided 50-50 along party lines.
The most expensive element of Mr. Bush's 10-year plan is an across-the-board reduction in tax rates, and many Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans have expressed particular concern about Mr. Bush's desire to lower the top rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent.
As Mr. Bush explained his thinking today, he at one point bobbled his words, saying that his plan "not only reduces the rate at the bottom end of the economic spectrum, but raises the top rate as well."
He defended a top-rate reduction as a measure that would help the many businesses that essentially file taxes as individuals.
"Those taxes come right out of cash flow, making it harder for small-business owners to make investments that raise productivity, boost incomes, provide benefits to their workers," he said.
Mr. Bush portrayed himself as someone pursuing a solution driven by common sense, not party ideology, and invoked a former Democratic president for that purpose.
"John F. Kennedy supported tax cuts to jump-start a sluggish national economy, in the 1960's," Mr. Bush said, adding that a former Republican president, Ronald Reagan, had effectively used the same tool "to break us out of stagflation in the early 1980's."
A sweeping tax cut now, Mr. Bush added, would help the economy "come roaring out of its doldrums."

HEADLINE: SENATORS DEFEAT EFFORT TO DERAIL A SOFT-MONEY BAN 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27 

 BODY:
The Senate handed a decisive victory today to the supporters of an overhaul of the campaign finance law, comfortably defeating a rival proposal that would have limited but not prohibited the unregulated large donations to the political parties that escalated to nearly $500 million in the last election.
 The 60-to-40 vote to kill the centerpiece of legislation sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, reflected strong Senate sentiment to enact a ban on the unrestricted donations, which are known as soft money. The ban is at the heart of legislation sponsored by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin. Roll call and news analysis, Page A18. 
 Although Mr. Hagel had the backing of Republican leaders and tacit support from President Bush, Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold picked up a handful of Republican supporters. 
"Our principal goal has been for a long time to get rid of soft money," Mr. Feingold said. "This was the vote that got rid of soft money."
Even Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who has long been the chief opponent of the McCain-Feingold legislation, conceded that if any campaign finance bill makes it through the Senate this week, "it will not have a penny of soft money in it."
However, in a reminder that Senators McCain and Feingold still face perilous challenges as they try to shepherd their measure to passage, Mr. McConnell would not commit today to a final vote on the campaign finance legislation on Thursday. And he left open the possibility of using parliamentary maneuvers, like a filibuster, to block a final vote.
"We scripted the beginning," Mr. McConnell said in a pointed exchange with Mr. McCain about how the voting would proceed. "We did not script the end."
The McCain-Feingold bill has been killed repeatedly in the last five years by Republican-led filibusters. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has said he will discourage such a tactic this time. Mr. McCain and some Democratic supporters warned today that they would tie up the Senate if they were denied a final vote. And the vote defeating Mr. Hagel's limit on soft money suggested for the first time that they might be able to break a filibuster. 
Other challenges loom this week for Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold, including the question of whether quarter-century-old limits on regulated donations will be raised and by how much. The two are also trying to fend off a provision that would kill the whole bill if the Supreme Court found any part of it unconstitutional.
For more than a week, the Senate had been heading toward today's critical test of strength between Mr. McCain and his close friend Mr. Hagel, whose proposal was considered the most comprehensive and potent challenge to the McCain-Feingold legislation. Under the Hagel proposal, soft-money donations would have been limited to $60,000 annually to national political parties. The limit on individual contributions to federal candidates would have tripled to $3,000 an election, and the cumulative contributions by individuals to candidates and parties would have risen to $75,000 a year. The McCain-Feingold legislation, by contrast, would ban all soft money. It would not increase the individual contribution limits. It would increase the cumulative total for individuals to $30,000 a year from $25,000.
Mr. Hagel argued that Mr. McCain's bill would "weaken the parties and put more control in the hands of wealthy individuals and independent groups that are accountable to no one." Mr. Hagel presented his measure as a compromise, saying it was one that was "constitutional, does not weaken political parties and that President Bush will sign." 
Mr. Hagel's opponents said that if all the provisions of his measure were added up, couples could still donate $540,000 every two-year election cycle to candidates and parties, and it would do little to limit the influence of money in politics. 
"The Hagel bill is so watered down, has so many loopholes in it, it is like Swiss cheese," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
In a sign that Mr. Hagel knew he lacked the votes to win, he moved unexpectedly in the last minutes of debate to split his bill into three parts and have a separate vote on each.
The Senate killed by a vote or 52 to 47 his proposal to triple the individual contribution limits to candidates and parties, an increase opposed by many but not all Democrats. By even greater numbers, it defeated his proposal to cap soft-money contributions to the national political parties at $60,000 a year. Two Democrats -- Senators John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Ben Nelson of Nebraska -- broke with their party to vote for Mr. Hagel's cap on soft money. Twelve Republicans broke with their party to vote against the cap. 
Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold also tried to defeat Mr. Hagel's provisions for increased disclosure requirements for candidates, parties, groups and individuals. But when it became clear that the provisions would pass, senators began switching their votes to be on the side of disclosure, and the provisions were ultimately approved unanimously. Negotiations continued behind the scenes over proposals to raise the limits on regulated contributions that individuals can make to candidates and political parties. Even some supporters of the McCain-Feingold measure say that the 1974 contribution limits are now impractical because they were never adjusted for inflation. But the debate is over how much they should be increased.
Democrats lag behind Republicans at this kind of fund-raising and many of them fear large increases. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said today that he would "reluctantly" support an increase in the current individual limit of $1,000 a year to a candidate to $2,000. He said that could be coupled with an increase in the cumulative limit on donations to parties and candidates from the current $50,000 a campaign cycle to $65,000.
But he said: "That's as far as I can go. I want to serve notice." 
In a sign that the McCain-Feingold coalition could still fracture, the Senate began debate on a proposal by Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, to raise the individual donation limit to $2,500 and the cumulative two-year limit to $100,000. 
Supporters of the overhaul legislation also face a critical battle over whether it will be subject to an all-or-nothing review by the Supreme Court. Mr. Bush, many Republicans and some Democrats say that to ensure a balanced bill they want to include a provision calling for the entire bill to be struck down if any part of it is found unconstitutional.
The issue took on heightened significance after Republican opponents of the McCain-Feingold bill unexpectedly teamed up with liberal Democrats on Monday night to pass an amendment sponsored by Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, that broadly restricts political advertising by outside groups in the last days before an election.
Some Republicans who voted for it did not hide the fact that they thought the amendment was unconstitutional and could kill the bill in court. Mr. McConnell said of his support for Mr. Wellstone's provision, "I thought that something that was a little bit unconstitutional ought to be made a little bit more unconstitutional." 
Mr. Daschle said he was working hard to convince all 50 Democrats that it was important to keep the bill's component parts severable. Mr. Lott, however, said the bill had to have an all-or-nothing clause and "that is a nonnegotiable item." --------------------

HEADLINE: At Lunch, Talk of Lieberman For President Is the Appetizer 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27 

 BODY:
As recently as this morning, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut scoffed at the idea that he would seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 if Al Gore decided to run again, saying it would be "very awkward."
 But just in case Mr. Gore backs away from another bid, Mr. Lieberman is moving energetically to lay the groundwork for a campaign of his own. 
 In the most telling example, he invited nearly two dozen political operatives, old friends and Democratic thinkers to a private luncheon on Capitol Hill last week to mull over his political future.
While the participants were assembled to discuss how Mr. Lieberman could capitalize on his attention from the campaign by positioning himself as a national spokesman for centrist Democrats, several said in interviews that the underlying purpose seemed to be an effort to begin thinking about how best to frame a possible presidential race.
Many said that they and Mr. Lieberman were concerned that he not appear too brazen, and eager, to run, and that the senator even made clear that he would defer to Mr. Gore. Still, Tom Nides, Mr. Lieberman's campaign manager last year, said some attendees urged him to stop insisting that Mr. Lieberman would wait for Mr. Gore to decide.
"People said: 'That's kind of silly. Why are you precluding yourself from that?' " Mr. Nides said. "But Lieberman said, 'Gore gave me an opportunity, and I respect that.' "
For all the public protestations, participants said that the two-hour session touched on fund-raising and other mechanics necessary should the senator decide to run. "I remember some discussion about how he had done well in the last campaign in helping raise money for the ticket," one participant said.
Many said that while the longest single discussion was about an economic policy speech that Mr. Lieberman gave on Monday, it was unavoidable that the session would be interpreted as the first step toward a presidential drive. "You're not naive," a friend of Mr. Lieberman said when asked about the meeting.
Even more striking is that several top lieutenants to Mr. Gore during the campaign last year attended the luncheon on Wednesday, at the Monocle restaurant.
Among them were Ronald Klain, who was Mr. Gore's vice-presidential chief of staff and who supervised his legal team during the postelection stalemate; Tina Flournoy, Mr. Gore's finance director who became Mr. Lieberman's political director, and Stuart E. Eizenstat, an official in the Clinton and Carter administrations who has worked closely with Mr. Gore.
Others included Mickey Kantor, a former commerce secretary; Robert Barnett, a prominent lawyer and literary agent; Jim Kennedy, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's press secretary; Al From, chief executive officer of the Democratic Leadership Council; Sherry L. Brown, Mr. Lieberman's Senate campaign manager; and Bill Andresen, his top aide on Capitol Hill.
The attendance of the Gore loyalists by no means signifies that they would defect to Mr. Lieberman. Several people who attended said they were far from making up their minds. "There was no blood oath," one participant said. "No one signed up to do anything."
Other attendees said Mr. Lieberman's political aspirations were an unmistakable theme -- and that many of the participants could eventually form the core of a Lieberman-for-president organization.
"Joe's a national leader of the party now and there's a lot of people interested in him running," said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democratic Network, a group that helps moderate Democrats. "But there's a long way to go between now and 2004."
Separate from the luncheon, Mr. Lieberman is forming a political action committee and taking other steps that could help him run for president.
Dan Gerstein, Mr. Lieberman's spokesman, said the gathering was something of a kitchen cabinet for the senator. He was careful to note, though, that it was not his boss who was promoting himself as a presidential prospect.
"Any discussions about the future," Mr. Gerstein said, "were more initiated by friends who were at the meeting."
Lanny Davis, an official in the Clinton White House who has known Mr. Lieberman since their days at Yale, said: "Were there people in the room that would love Joe Lieberman to be president of the United States because they're his friends and admirers? Yes. Count me in. 
"But it's too early for him to start planning a presidential campaign. It's not too early for him to start taking advice about speaking out on issues."

Bush Digs In on His Tax Plan
President Bush said a measure introduced by Senate Democrats for a one-time tax rebate of $300 should not substitute for his 10-year tax-cutting plan, which he values at $1.6 trillion, because the rebate would not do enough to revive the economy. A1

The Democrats' proposal would also give most taxpayers an additional $150 by withholding less from their paychecks later this year. Separately, a Congressional analysis said Mr. Bush's plan to repeal the estate tax would cost two and a half times what the White House had projected. A16

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
The Lehman analyst who viewed Amazon.com through a no-nonsense microscope moves on.

BYLINE:  By Gretchen Morgenson 

 BODY:
RAVI SURIA, the convertible bond analyst at Lehman Brothers who shot to fame on his rigorous and skeptical research reports on Amazon.com and other stock market darlings, has left Lehman to join Duquesne Capital Management, a $4 billion hedge fund in New York City. 
 Mr. Suria, 30, joins Duquesne as a managing director. Stanley Druckenmiller, chairman of Duquesne, was George Soros's top lieutenant at the Soros Fund group until he resigned to open his own shop last June. 
 "The past couple of years have been extremely rewarding, and Lehman was a wonderful firm to work for," Mr. Suria said. "But I am excited about this new opportunity to put my research to work for investors in the fund."
Clients of Lehman Brothers who followed Mr. Suria's advice the last year have certainly done well. The analyst burst onto the scene last June with a scathing report on Amazon in which he questioned the retailer's long-term prospects for profitability. The report was unusual for the depth of its analysis and contrasted sharply with upbeat reports on Amazon by the great majority of Wall Street firms. The day before the report came out, the stock closed at $42. Yesterday, Amazon's shares closed at $11.64.
With many Internet retailers in bankruptcy or on the brink of failure, it is hard to believe that only nine months ago Mr. Suria was virtually alone on Wall Street in questioning that Internet retailers like Amazon could be more profitable than traditional merchants. Since then, other analysts have become much more dubious about the industry in general and about Amazon's prospects in particular. 
And Mr. Suria was also a leader in debunking the investment myth that gained great currency during the Internet mania, that Web companies should be held to a more forgiving set of analytical standards. Last month, for example, Mr. Suria wrote another report on Amazon in which he predicted that the company's creditors would grow fearful of Amazon's ability to pay its bills and would stop financing the company later this year. According to a report in The New York Observer, John Doerr, an Amazon director, called Lehman's chairman in an attempt to suppress publication of the report. When it came out a few days later, Amazon dismissed the report's conclusions. 
When asked about Mr. Suria's move to the hedge fund, Bill Curry, Amazon's spokesman, said, "We have nothing to add."
In addition to his work on Amazon, Mr. Suria won praise from investors for his extensive and cautionary report on the telecommunications sector last fall. In the report, dated Nov. 2, Mr. Suria examined the extremely high debt levels amassed in the industry and predicted a severe shrinkage in stock values for the big telecommunications companies and bankruptcies for the so-called new- economy telecoms. Since then, several small companies -- including Northpoint Communications -- have filed for bankruptcy protection and many stocks of the companies still in operation have plummeted. Market values of the large companies have fallen significantly as well.
Mr. Suria, who began his career on Wall Street in 1994 at PaineWebber and rose to head its convertible bond research, was not a perennial bear. Last April, for example, he wrote a positive report on the energy sector, a call that has also proved to be prescient for investors. He joined Lehman in April 1999.
A native of India, Mr. Suria has a background in engineering but became enthralled with finance when he was studying for his M.B.A. at Tulane University. On March 16, Mr. Suria returned to Tulane to accept the first Rising Tide Award from the A. B. Freeman School of Business. The award, which is to be presented annually, is given to an outstanding alumnus of the school.

HEADLINE: Disney Is Cutting 4,000 Jobs Worldwide 

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
In a move executives described as the most significant job reduction in the company's history, the Walt Disney Company will eliminate 4,000 jobs, about 3 percent of its work force, through buyouts and possibly mandatory layoffs, the company announced yesterday.
 The order will affect every Disney division worldwide. In a letter to employees, Michael D. Eisner, the Disney chairman, and Robert A. Iger, the president, called the job cuts "the most difficult series of decisions the company has made in the last 20 years." 
 John Dreyer, a Disney spokesman, said it was the first time the company had ever announced a worldwide reduction of its work force. The only previous big job cut in the company's history came during the Arab oil embargo of the early 1970's, which curtailed the number of visitors to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., and prompted Disney to eliminate1,700 jobs there. 
Yesterday, Disney executives cited the sputtering economy and, in particular, the recent slowdown in advertising sales, which has directly affected such big Disney divisions as the ABC television network and the ESPN cable network.
The plan announced yesterday will offer employees a voluntary buyout that will include unspecified severance incentives. If the buyout does not achieve the desired cuts by July, Disney will impose mandatory layoffs with what Mr. Eisner and Mr. Iger, in their letter, referred to as "lesser severance benefits."
Disney will take a one-time charge of $250 million, the majority of which will be spread over the next two quarters, to pay for the severance expenses. Mr. Dreyer said the company expected to save $350 million to $400 million with the cuts.
But the company is not otherwise changing its immediate financial forecast. "Excluding the charge," Mr. Dreyer said, "we do not believe this will alter our previously established growth targets."
The announcement came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Disney's shares ended the session at $29.20, up $1.28, or 4.6 percent, on the day. 
Wall Street analysts said that the Disney jobs announcement was not surprising and that the action might help the company financially.
"How do you say when people are losing their jobs it's a good thing?" said Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst with Merrill Lynch. "But it is a prudent move to do this in this economic environment." With earlier cost cuts announced by the company, Disney will have saved about $900 million by fiscal year 2003. "That's a sizable number," she said.
Previously announced cuts include the decision in January to scale back the Go.com Web portal. Disney has already cut more than 500 of the 2,000 employees in the company's Internet group and has taken a $790 million charge to write down the value of its Internet assets. 
In their letters to employees yesterday, Mr. Eisner and Mr. Iger said: "We need to face up to the increasingly pressing challenges of the softening economic environment. We must also uphold investors' confidence in our future while maintaining our core commitment to quality and creativity in all we do.'
Ed Hatch, a media analyst with SG Cowen, said one part of Disney's business certain to be affected by the softening economy and the devaluation of investors' stock portfolios would be the company's theme parks. "People will think twice about taking a trip to Disney World," he said.
Indeed, Disney had already announced a hiring freeze at its largest theme park, Walt Disney World, which alone employs nearly half of Disney's overall work force of 120,000.
But Mr. Dreyer, the spokesman, said the company had taken into account projections of lower bookings in the spring and summer at its parks and was nevertheless "on track to achieve growth in park attendance" this year.
Mr. Hatch, the analyst, also said that "the same shocks" from decreased advertising that are hitting other media outlets will hit Disney and ABC this year "and they'll face it with possibly weaker programming."
Other big media companies have announced layoffs recently, including NBC, which said in January it would cut 300 to 600 jobs, 5 percent to 10 percent of its work force. AOL Time Warner announced the same month that it would eliminate 2,000 jobs, about 2 percent of its work force.
Christopher Dixon, an analyst with UBS Warburg, said that while the slower economy and the slump in ad sales were real factors in the decision, the Disney move was also consistent with the company's overall goal of cutting costs sharply.
"We'll take it at face value at this point," Mr. Dixon said. "But I think Disney may be using this as an excuse to accelerate an ongoing cost-saving policy."
Mr. Dixon noted that the Disney film studios had more or less stopped active production for now because of the threat of strikes by writers and actors later this spring. "This may be an opportunity to clean house at the studio," he said, "which is not going to need six development executives at every level."

HEADLINE: Lose-Lose Situation 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27 

 BODY:
Not only did the Senate defeat the campaign finance proposal that was most to President Bush's liking today, it also raised the prospect that he might be forced into an unenviable political bind:
 Does Mr. Bush sign a measure that he has repudiated, and one that was championed by a political foe? Or does he veto the bill and open himself to attacks that the candidate who amassed the largest campaign warchest ever to win the presidency opposes reform? 
 Mr. Bush could have stomached a proposal sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. 
His aides worked ardently behind the scenes to muster support. But the measure was a colossal failure, losing the votes even of many Republicans.
That has left the president to contend with the more ambitious proposal promoted by his persistent rival from the Republican primaries, Senator John McCain of Arizona.
When it comes to Mr. Bush's approach to Mr. McCain, it may be difficult to separate the political, personal and policy considerations.
"It's a no-win," said a Republican who is close to the president. "If he signs, he capitulates to his rival. And if he vetoes it, he gives McCain one teeney step toward heroism."
Others who have talked to Mr. Bush in recent days suggested tonight that he might go ahead and sign the legislation.
"He told me that he is not in the mood of vetoing a campaign finance bill right now," said Senator Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican who flew to the state with the president for a rally earlier this week. "I think his message to us was we have to pass a bill that satisfied us." 
The hope in the White House, of course, is that the bill, which is sponsored by Mr. McCain and Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, will be so larded with objectionable amendments that it never survives Congress. That way, the bill could die quietly, and no one could blame the new administration.
But the McCain-Feingold measure has picked up such potency, largely because many Republicans signed onto it, that Mr. Bush must brace for the possibility it will reach him in one piece.
"When you have one bill on your desk and it's labeled 'campaign finance reform,' it is hard to veto," said Trevor Potter, an expert on election law who was Mr. McCain's counsel during last year's campaign. "The public is not going to make the fine distinctions between the various plans that all of the political players have been arguing about in the Senate."
Mr. Bush has insisted that he favors reform, and earlier this month he called for a partial prohibition of soft money, the large, unregulated donations to political parties.
But his prescription differs sharply from that of Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold, who favor a ban on soft money. Mr. Bush endorsed a ban on such donation by unions and corporations but not by individuals.
Mr. Bush's advisers have expressed concern that the McCain-Feingold proposal would endanger their party politically. Throughout his presidential campaign last year, Mr. Bush emphasized that donors should have unfettered rights to express themselves in political campaigns and that the parties themselves should not be threatened.
His advisers asserted that the McCain-Feingold legislation could enhance the power of independent advocacy groups at the expense of the parties.
Some advisers to Mr. Bush say that he could perhaps avoid a sign-or-veto climax by working with Congressional leaders to fashion a compromise. The president already has a meeting scheduled for Wednesday with Republican House and Senate leaders.
But it would be no easy trick accommodating both Mr. McCain and Republicans on the other side of the issue, like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who are bent on smothering the legislation.
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, sought to embolden his party to defeat the bill by saying publicly last week that Mr. Bush told him "we could not count on a veto."
"He'd have to come up with the best of both worlds," said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican representative from Oklahoma who now teaches government at Harvard. "Look like an advocate of reform and do it without buying into the idea of completely cutting off soft money. After the votes this week, Bush has to understand that people want some change."
Mr. Potter said that Mr. Bush could save face by highlighting elements that may be in the final product that the White House advocated, like a possible increase in the limits for regulated contributions.
"His choice is: Does he in fact claim credit for the things he does like, or declare defeat?" said Mr. Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission. "But can he sustain saying, 'I didn't get what I wanted?' What does that say about his leadership qualities?"
People who are close to Mr. Bush and his top aides said that no one should underestimate the enmity toward Mr. McCain and how that could play into the White House's calculations.
"I don't think he wants to surrender," the friend said of Mr. Bush. Speaking of the president's aides, he added, "I don't think they want to give John McCain this victory. And that may be an unwise posture on their part. They have to weigh how salient this is against the main issue, which is the economy right now."
Indeed, the ultimate question may not be Mr. Bush's feelings about Mr. McCain, or even about the merits of changes in the campaign finance process. It may be a question of how deeply the public cares about whether a bill is passed.
"Nobody wants to be viewed as against campaign finance reform," said Al From, who heads the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrist Democrats. Asked if voters really would oust a politician who is seen as anti-reform, he replied: "It's more of a symbolic issue. Will people cast their votes on it? Probably not very many."
Veto or not, the overriding question for Mr. Bush is this: Does the politician who collected a record $100 million for his campaign want to give the Democrats ammunition to deride him as the man who blocked reform, no matter how flawed he feels that reform measure may be?

HEADLINE: March Survey Of Consumers Is Brighter 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
A crucial measure of consumer confidence rebounded sharply in March after falling for five consecutive months. 
 Financial markets interpreted the data, which were much better than anticipated, optimistically. Stock prices jumped after the figures were released at 10 a.m. By the close, all three major market indexes had risen by more than 2.5 percent. Page C13. 
 But economists were reluctant to read much into one monthly figure from the Conference Board. They said the recent decline in consumer attitudes might be bottoming out, which should help put a floor under measures like retail sales. 
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has said many times in recent months that he considers consumer sentiment an important economic barometer. 
Economists pointed out that the performance of one indicator over one three-week period said little about the overall health of the economy and practically nothing about whether the Fed would cut short-term interest rates before its next scheduled meeting in May. 
Additional economic data, including employment figures for March, are expected to be a factor in determining when, or if, the Fed will make a move. 
"No matter how much importance Mr. Greenspan puts on the confidence data, both the equity and the bond market are probably overreacting" to the new figures, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. 
In its monthly report, which covered the first three weeks of March, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to 117.0 from 109.2 in February. It was the first increase since September. 
The Conference Board's monthly survey is based on a representative sample of 5,000 households across the country and is considered an important indicator because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
The confidence index reached an all-time high of 144.7 in January 2000. It reached that level again in May last year. 
Given the generally gloomy news that has been released so far this month, most economists had expected the index to post a decline. Consumer attitudes about the present situation were little changed from a month ago, but expectations about what the economy would look like in six months were much brighter. 
"If confidence is stabilizing, all that says is that consumer spending won't take off," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst and managing director at J. P. Morgan Chase. "These numbers are strong historically, but well off the recent peaks." 
Mr. Fine and other economists said that despite the improvement, consumer confidence remained fragile. 
Indeed, since the list of companies announcing layoffs and lower earnings rose in the first three weeks of March and since stock prices have moved sharply lower, the surprise is that confidence rose at all. 
Lynn Franco, director of the consumer research center at the Conference Board, said that as bad as things seemed earlier in March, those surveyed considered things even worse in January and February. 
"Fuel bills have been a bit smaller," Ms. Franco said, "and the shock of the dramatic slowdown from the first half of last year to the second half has lessened a bit." 
"And there could also be a sense that the Fed is on the case," she added. "One would expect the effects of easier monetary policy to filter through the system relatively soon. That may alleviate concerns about conditions getting much worse." 
Should the March employment report show a spike in the unemployment rate, the sense of unease could quickly return, economists said. Those figures are expected to be released on April 6.
"We have had a pretty ugly trend in initial unemployment insurance claims for the last five or six weeks," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. 
"If that trend continues or the numbers rise," Mr. Resler said, "it will be something people will sit up and take note of. If there are many more layoffs, confidence will deteriorate." 
Confidence rose in every section of the country except in the Middle Atlantic states, a region that includes New York. The consumer confidence index for the Middle Atlantic region slipped to 98.9 in March, from 101.8 in February. Respondents in the Middle Atlantic states were markedly less optimistic about the future than they had been in February.

HEADLINE: Britain Reluctantly Considers Animal Vaccination 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: CARLISLE, England, March 27 

 BODY:
As Britain prepared to slaughter hundreds of thousands more healthy sheep that may have been exposed to foot-and-mouth disease, the government indicated today that it might reverse policy and use vaccination against the outbreak.
 A switch to a fiercely debated vaccination program would fuel assertions by some government critics that, after more than five weeks of rampaging infections through hundreds of farms and the killing of 441,000 pigs, sheep and cows, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government was only now acknowledging that its policy of destroying animals had failed. 
 In Parliament, Agriculture Minister Nick Brown called the epidemic "an unprecedented outbreak that has not yet reached its peak." An additional 59 cases were confirmed today, bringing the total to 694.
While Mr. Brown did not commit the authorities to a switch to vaccination, he did say that the government "is considering whether to use vaccination." 
The government has resisted vaccination out of concern it would hurt Britain's livestock and meat exports. Current tests cannot distinguish between an infected animal and a vaccinated one, making it difficult to prove that animal products are not diseased.
The European Union outlawed vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease a decade ago in order to qualify member countries' livestock and meat as free of both foot-and-mouth disease and vaccine for export to countries that included the United States.
Britain banned all meat and livestock exports when the outbreak was first identified on Feb. 19. Now, Mr. Brown said today, Britain has asked the European Union for "a contingent decision permitting the use of vaccination during the present outbreak, so that it can be deployed immediately if we conclude that is the right approach."
Earlier today, Mr. Blair himself said that a switch to vaccination, which "may have seemed utterly unpalatable a short time ago," was now "on the agenda."
Tim Yeo, the Conservatives' agriculture spokesman, said that by adopting vaccination, the government would be "admitting that its other policies have failed."
But for all the debate about vaccination, there was no sign today that the government was slowing its mass cull. More than 700,000 animals have been marked for destruction.
By tonight, military and other authorities had readied mass animal graves on the Welsh island of Anglesey, at Birkshaw Forest in southern Scotland and at a disused airfield at Great Orton near this northwestern city, where some 16,000 infected animals have already been buried. The huge pits are to be used mainly to bury apparently healthy sheep brought from farms within a two-mile radius of infected animals. The slaughter began on Anglesey today and will begin at Great Orton airfield on Wednesday, the authorities said.
Mr. Brown, the agriculture minister, also said today that the likely source of the disease was a farm in northeastern England at Heddon-on-the-Wall, where there was speculation that pigs had been fed contaminated swill containing illegally imported meat. The highly contagious disease was then carried by air to nearby sheep. The account awoke memories of Britain's earlier battle with mad cow disease, which was also ascribed to cows being fed animal matter. Mr. Brown proposed a ban on the use of swill -- used to feed fewer than one percent of Britain's 7.2 million pigs and usually made up of leftovers from restaurant, hospital and school meals. He also urged the introduction of a 20-day "standstill" period during which animals would not be transported after arriving on farms.
The speed with which the disease has spread has been linked to the distances animals now travel between farm, market and slaughter.
By the time foot-and-mouth disease was identified at Heddon-on-the-Wall, four days after it had first been diagnosed at an abattoir in Essex, 200 miles to the south, "infected animals had already spread through markets and dealers to Cumbria, Dumfries and Galloway, Devon, Cheshire, Herefordshire and Northamptonshire" -- areas stretching from southwest England to Scotland.
Mr. Brown also said it had been difficult or impossible to track the movements of infected sheep because of unrecorded animal sales. The remark reinforced suspicions among some farmers that the government was seeking to shift part of the blame to questionable farming practices.
The most contentious issue facing the government, though, is whether it should resort to vaccination, a tactic some critics call unreliable.
"I don't think the basic scientific view has changed," said Chris Bostock, head of the Animal Health Institute, who has criticized vaccination. "What has changed is what's happening in the field, and whether the circumstances now match those in which you would choose to use emergency vaccine."
The discussion is laden with scientific disputes, and the bottom-line question of the long-term economic impact and even politics. The crisis has prompted heated debate over whether Prime Minister Blair should put off plans to seek re-election in May.
In a telephone interview, Professor Bostock said the debate involved two approaches to vaccine: whether it was to be used as an emergency measure, or as "long-term policy, which means you are accepting that you have endemic disease."
Since the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak started, Britain has rejected both approaches on the grounds that vaccination would damage the export business and not necessarily work. But, with the government itself acknowledging that the epidemic has yet to peak, it is now being considered to reinforce mass culling to build a "firebreak" around the worst infected areas in Cumbria, Devon, southern Scotland and parts of Wales.
Foot-and-mouth disease, which afflicts cloven-footed mammals, is not normally fatal in animals and rarely affects humans. However, the disease produces painful blisters in the mouths and feet of infected animals which, before they recover, become unfit for sale through weight loss. Even when they do recover, they must be slaughtered before countries or regions regain their coveted status as disease- and vaccine-free exporters -- a process that can take up to a year.
Prof. Julian Wimpenny, from the Cardiff School of Biosciences, said "the technology exists now that can distinguish between an animal that's infected and one that's immunized."
But Professor Bostock at the Animal Health Institute countered that, saying that while new forms of testing were being developed that might enable veterinarians to judge the health of a herd, "even the best test available is not reliable on an individual animal."
Moreover, he said, "vaccinated animals are not necessarily protected against infection. They can still be infected and they can still act as a potential source of infection."
Britain has identified the virus afflicting its livestock as one called Pan Asian Type O. But that is only one of seven main types, all of which respond to different vaccines, and there are up to 80 sub-types. The Animal Health Institute holds 500,000 cattle-size doses of the vaccine against the Pan Asian Type O virus, and 10 million more doses are thought to be available elsewhere in the European Union. But Britain has some 44 million sheep, 11.3 million cattle and 7.2 million pigs.
Within Europe, the Netherlands has treated a far smaller outbreak with vaccination surrounding an infected area, coupled with the slaughter of infected animals and healthy ones within a two-mile radius.
Such is the scale of the disease in Britain, however, that delays in removing culled animals from farms and even their incineration on pyres that draw smoke across the countryside have helped spread the disease. "You cannot guarantee that you are not putting virus particles into the atmosphere" from the pyres, Professor Wimpenny said.
The British authorities and some scientists have argued that vaccination, even as an emergency measure, is unreliable, costly and would divert personnel from destroying animals. Not only that, vaccination can take one or two days to take effect, meaning that animals could pass on the disease during that period.
But the counterargument, which the government now seems to be considering, is that, as an emergency measure, vaccination would act as a reinforcement to mass culling.
"You can use vaccine very quickly and still cull animals," said Peter Midmore, a professor of rural studies at the University of Wales.
"The role for vaccination is to achieve widespread protection and lower the risk of infection."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Bush Shapes His Presidency With Sharp Eye on Father's

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27 

 BODY:
When George W. Bush was elected governor of Texas in his first try at a statewide office, a close friend marveled at his rather glitch-free campaign. The friend recalled that Mr. Bush told him, "Never underestimate what you can learn from a failed presidency."
 While Mr. Bush does not consider his father to have been a failure as president, people who know him say he does view his father's tenure as a supreme disappointment, simply because the elder Mr. Bush could not persuade voters to re-elect him. They say the former governor blames the people around his father, as well as himself, for not working hard enough to ensure that re-election in 1992. 
 Now that George W. Bush has reached the White House, no one should underestimate how his approach to the presidency has been molded by the experiences of the elder President Bush, and his desire to avoid the mistakes that he believes cost his father a second term. 
That is why, his friends and associates say, the 43rd president has been far more inclined than the 41st to mix politics with governing, to show deference (some even say reverence) to conservatives, to demand loyalty from aides and to pursue an ambitious but more narrowly focused agenda.
"When you've got a functional family, doesn't everybody learn from their father and mother?" asked Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, who is close to the president and his father.
The contrasts between father and son have much to do with personality. George W. Bush has been far more hospitable to Congress than his father, who actually served in Congress, perhaps because the younger Mr. Bush is, by nature, a more gregarious politician.
But the times and circumstances are different, too. As president, Mr. Bush's father had to contend with the fiercely partisan George J. Mitchell, the Senate leader, and a Democratic-led Congress in no mood to be courted.
"It's not Bush 41st's fault that there was a George Mitchell reign of terror in those days," said Richard N. Bond, whom the first President Bush installed as Republican Party chairman. "They wanted to destroy Bush's presidency."
The times may have changed, but here are some lessons that Bush II has gleaned from Bush I:

Politics Is Not a Dirty Word
Campaign-style trips, like the two-day, three-state tour Mr. Bush began on Monday, were not so common in the elder Mr. Bush's administration. Once he was in the White House, Bush No. 41 cringed at the thought of blatantly political activity; he seemed to view it as an ugly chore. He was slow, even, to start his re-election drive. The younger Mr. Bush has since expressed his concern that his father never made the most, politically, of his soaring popularity after the Persian Gulf war.
In reaction -- and in a nod to the political success enjoyed by President Bill Clinton -- the current president has not hesitated to venture onto the road to pitch his tax cut.
"Sometimes my words in Washington don't exactly translate directly to the people," Mr. Bush said today in Kalamazoo, Mich., "so I found it's best to travel the country."
Thus far, Mr. Bush has been on the road nearly a third of his time in office, far more than his father, Mr. Clinton, Ronald Reagan or Jimmy Carter in their first two months in office. In all, the president has traveled to 25 states and spent nearly 30 days away from the White House. (His father had spent about 17 days on the road by now; Mr. Clinton, roughly a dozen.)
"He talks about using his political capital wisely," said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's counselor. "I've heard him say his father had a great deal of political capital from Desert Storm that could have been spent more wisely."
Attention to politics has permeated the administration. Mr. Bush's address to Congress last month was one example of the way he has packaged his proposals in a disciplined and systematic way, focusing on a handful of big themes. His father's addresses to Congress reflected a much more scattershot approach. 
Mark McKinnon, who was Mr. Bush's campaign media adviser, said that by watching his father early on, "he learned that the crisis of the moment should be seen in the context of a much longer picture."

Don't Tolerate a Sununu
When President Bush's friends are asked about lessons learned from the father, they invariably cite former Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire, the elder Mr. Bush's first chief of staff.
Mr. Sununu had no Washington seasoning and was widely viewed as a divisive figure in the White House, but the elder Mr. Bush felt indebted to him because Mr. Sununu had helped him win the New Hampshire primary. Mr. Sununu was pushed out of his job only after the younger Mr. Bush, in an unbridled conversation, let him know of the dissatisfaction. 
And for years the elder Mr. Bush stood by Nicholas F. Brady, his old friend and Treasury secretary, even as conservatives repeatedly called for his resignation.
"Loyal to a fault" was how one friend described the ex-president.
The son, on the other hand, expects loyalty from below and appears less tolerant of people who are not team players. Mr. Bush has had a closer and longer relationship with his top orbit of aides than his father did with Mr. Sununu.
His aides also say Mr. Bush knows not to let them linger on when they are not succeeding. It was no accident that Mr. Bush quickly dispatched Linda Chavez when her nomination for labor secretary ran into trouble.
And Mr. Bush is intent on keeping backstabbing to a minimum.
"He was the one who gave Sununu his marching orders," said Gregory Slayton, president of an e-mail marketing company who is a friend of Bush the father and son. "Loyalty is a big deal. He talked about that all the time. He felt that in the re-election campaign for his dad, some of the professional staff didn't fight it out at the end. They were more concerned about their next job than getting his dad re-elected."

Be Nice to Alan Greenspan
From the start, the first President Bush had a strained relationship with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. In fact, he blamed Mr. Greenspan for costing him the election by not moving fast enough to speed the recovery from the recession of the early 1990's.
"I reappointed him and he disappointed me," the elder Mr. Bush once said.
Mindful, perhaps, that it did not help his father to be on Mr. Greenspan's bad side, the younger Mr. Bush has tried to seduce his father's foe. He sought him out for a meeting even before taking office, clapped a hand on his shoulder and said, "I talked with a good man right here."
The entreaties may reflect the determination of Mr. Bush not to let the economy tarnish his presidency, as happened with his father.
While the elder Mr. Bush suffered because the economy did not improve in time to help him get re-elected, his son may be paying the price for an economic picture that he inherited. Successful or not, the son seems more aggressive in promoting his economic policies.
"The lesson learned from the economic side of former President Bush's administration is you have to market the policy well," said Ron Kaufman, an adviser to the elder Mr. Bush. 

Protect Your Right
A most obvious lesson Mr. Bush has learned from his father is to stroke conservatives. While conservatives never trusted the elder Mr. Bush, his son has gone out of his way to win them over. He is filling jobs at all levels of his administration with conservatives, from Attorney General John Ashcroft to the White House staff. And he has embraced conservative positions on matters including abortion and the environment, with his opposition to regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and to stricter standards on arsenic in drinking water.
"This fellow saw the right wing crush his father," said Robert S. Strauss, the former Democratic chairman who is an old Texas friend of the elder President Bush. "He's not going to let anyone get too far to the right of him. In fact, he's overreacting a bit right now, and it's going to come home to haunt him."
Rahm Emanuel, a senior aide to Mr. Clinton, argues that the public is not as tilted to the right as the new president. "He's done everything to assure that the base of the party is happy going into the midterms," Mr. Emanuel said, "but he's done nothing to expand the 49 percent of the vote he got. Name me a suburban district that supports more arsenic in water."

Vice President Does Matter
An obvious lesson is that Mr. Bush picked a vice president who has been tested. People close to Mr. Bush said he heeded his father's counsel in settling on Dick Cheney -- and was determined not to tarnish his presidency with a vice president like Dan Quayle, who was continually criticized as not being ready for the job.
"Clearly, Dick Cheney is no Dan Quayle," Mr. Slayton said.
