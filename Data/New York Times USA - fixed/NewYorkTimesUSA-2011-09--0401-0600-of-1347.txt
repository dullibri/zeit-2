HEADLINE: No Job, No Insurance, No Health Care

 BODY:
Workers who lose their jobs in the economic downturn typically suffer a double whammy: they lose not only their incomes but their employer-based health insurance as well. Millions are forced to forgo the medical care that they cannot pay for. 
The depressing facts are laid out in the Commonwealth Fund's latest biennial health insurance survey. An analysis of the data found that nine million working-age adults who lost their jobs between 2008 and 2010 became uninsured. Most of those could not find affordable coverage from insurance companies, and some were turned down when theyapplied.
Of that number, nearly three-quarters delayed needed care because of the cost. They were sick but did not visit a doctor, or chose not to fill a prescription, or skipped a recommended test, treatment or visit to a specialist.
Nearly three-quarters had problems paying medical bills when they did visit a doctor or a hospital. They used up their savings, struggled to pay medical debts over time, took out loans when they could, declared bankruptcy or ended up unable to pay for other basic necessities like food or housing.
Substantial help will not arrive until 2014, when the major provisions of the national health care reforms kick in. The reforms will provide subsidies to help millions of Americans buy insurance on new exchanges and will greatly expand Medicaid coverage for the poor.
In the interim, Congress should extend unemployment benefits to help the jobless pay for health care. It should also re-establish the subsidies provided by the 2009 stimulus package that helped laid-off workers stay on their former employers' policies while looking for work.

HEADLINE: A 9/11 Tally: $3.3 Trillion

BYLINE: By AMANDA COX

 BODY:
Al Qaeda spent roughly half a million dollars to destroy the World Trade Center and cripple the Pentagon. What has been the cost to the United States? In a survey of estimates by The New York Times, the answer is $3.3 trillion, or about $6.6 million for every dollar Al Qaeda spent planning and executing the attacks. While not all of the costs have been borne by the government -- and some are still to come -- this total equals one-fifth of the current national debt. Costs are broken down here under three main categories: direct damage, shown in blue; the two wars that followed (assuming both can be linked to the attacks), in yellow; and other types of response, in gray. Experts differ on some of these numbers, as well as what should be included in a tally. Here, no attempt has been made to account for some of the imponderables: For example, are oil prices higher because of the Iraq war? But it is clear that it was the nation's response, rather than the damage from the attacks, that accounts for the bulk of the cost. 
Based on E.P.A. guidelines used to evaluate new regulations. Current guidelines suggest the value of life is around $8 million, but estimates vary widely

HEADLINE: From Firebrand to a Bit of a Grump, a 'Hippie Mayor' Evolves

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
MADISON, Wis. -- When Paul Soglin was busted in 1969 at the wild Mifflin Street block party, the arrest was something of a badge of honor. The city had refused to grant a permit for the gathering, which was intoxicated with left-wing politics, among other things. Mr. Soglin was happy to defy the ban.
''There was an underlying theme of taking a sharp stick,'' he recalled recently, ''and poking it in the eye of authority.'' 
A leading Vietnam War protester, Mr. Soglin went on to become a counterculture folk hero here in Wisconsin's capital by winning election as mayor in 1973 at age 27. In office, he thumbed his nose at the establishment by naming as police chief a man who wore a ponytail.
Decades later, Mr. Soglin is back in control of City Hall. But the old ''hippie mayor,'' as he was widely known, is now rankling some students for backing a crackdown on rowdy parties and calling for an end to the annual Mifflin Street party.
At 66, his hair is flecked with gray, and Mr. Soglin, who is now in his third stint as mayor over four decades, confesses to being a bit of a grump.
''The binge drinking,'' he said during a recent interview over diet green tea, ''has become much worse.''
Some students say their mayor is suffering from an affliction that might be called ''baby boomer amnesia,'' a condition that young people say is common among parents of a certain age.
For his part, Mr. Soglin says he has hardly become a prude. He has shown no inclination to change the Madison police policy of overlooking possession of small amounts of marijuana in one's home (a moot point since the Dane County District Attorney's Office declines to prosecute minor cannabis cases).
And he said that under-age drinkers who do not cause a ruckus ''will be left alone.'' But he supports a measure to impose fines of hundreds of dollars on those who host big, raucous parties.
As for the Mifflin Street party, once a celebration of Madison's liberal ethos, he sees it as a danger that needs to be stopped. He points to the 162 arrests at the party in April, including for sexual assault, robbery and a stabbing.
''By noon,'' he said, ''you had kids who were staggering drunk.''
At the University of Wisconsin here, known for both its academic and its social rigors, some students are raising their eyebrows about the man they perceive as a cranky old dude.
Allie Gardner, the 19-year-old chairwoman of the Associated Students of Madison, the elected student government, said Mr. Soglin clearly had a problem with ''the drinking culture.''
Her biggest criticism of the mayor, however, is that he has failed to include students in the formulation of any new policy. When Mr. Soglin was a student, she noted, he called on the power structure to listen to the younger generation.
''We'd liked to be listened to, too,'' Ms. Gardner said.
Mr. Soglin remains an iconic figure in Madison, still a man eager to raise the roof in protest. During the enormous demonstrations that engulfed Madison over Gov. Scott Walker's plan to limit the power of unions, Mr. Soglin marched virtually every day, and slept in the Capitol one night.
Matthew Rothschild, the editor of The Progressive magazine here, referred to him as ''the same old irascible, opinionated, principled Paul Soglin.''
He said Mr. Soglin was able to defeat the incumbent mayor, Dave Cieslewicz, earlier this year in large part because ''voters wanted a street-fighter'' unafraid to square off with Mr. Walker and other Republicans.
Madison remains one of the strongest liberal bastions in America. Many neighborhoods gave more than 90 percent of the vote to Barack Obama in 2008. In the last six elections, voters have elected Tammy Baldwin, who is the only openly gay woman in Congress.
But much has changed in Madison, a city that was once largely populated with Nordic immigrants. During Mr. Soglin's first mayoral bid in 1973, whites accounted for about 96 percent of the enrollment in Madison schools, according to Mike Wetzel, a spokesman for the district. Today, nonwhites account for about 50 percent of the student body.
The Madison police say there are now street gangs with Chicago ties, and the poverty rate has grown sharply over the decades. Nearly 50 percent of children in the city's schools qualify for subsidized lunch, up from 16 percent in 1986.
In a city once seemingly immune to recession, with its reliance on the university and the Capitol, the budget has been squeezed. Mr. Soglin, who worked as a lawyer and consultant while out of office, said he was ''exasperated'' by the city's lack of financial discipline, a major reason he decided to try to return to City Hall.
He acknowledged that his pro-business stance had sometimes created ''suspicion among my friends on the left.'' But he added, ''If you want to bring about change, government needs to have a healthy tax base.''
Some Republican leaders have praised Mr. Soglin for his commitment to fiscal responsibility and safer streets.
''On some issues, Paul sounds downright conservative,'' said Brian Schimming, a vice chairman of the state's Republican Party. ''When he ran this time, his message wasn't about idealism. It was more like, 'I know how to run this place.' ''
Mr. Soglin acknowledges that he has grown to favor ''a sense of order.'' That was not exactly a central theme during his protest days, and it causes some amusement among plenty of free-spirited young people.
''It's a little ironic,'' said Mike Verveer, a representative on the city's Common Council, ''since it was the student vote that originally got Paul elected.''

HEADLINE: The Unemployed Confront Competition and Despair

 BODY:
In an article on Metropolitan's cover last week, ''After Layoff, Hope, Fear and Insomnia,'' Jennifer Gonnerman chronicled the months of efforts by a forklift driver, Frederick Deare, to find work after the Old London snack company closed its factory in the Bronx last summer and moved its operations to North Carolina. Mr. Deare, 54, finally landed a job, making less than he had collected in unemployment benefits. Following are some of the more than 180 reader comments posted over the Labor Day weekend on NYTimes.com.
I admire Mr. Deare very much. His spirit, his refusal to despair, gives us all hope. 
Joseph G. Anthony,
Lexington, KY
I completely relate to this story. I was laid off nearly two years ago, and then lost the part-time job I finally found that was keeping me afloat. It paid less than unemployment, too. The irony is that if I had not taken that part-time job, I would still be receiving unemployment benefits. Now I'm 60, without a job, no unemployment, no health insurance and zero prospects. I have a great resume, which I've sent to thousands of companies. The few interviews I've had were futile. It's hard to compete with the hundreds who apply for every job, especially considering I'm twice the age of most applicants. Age discrimination might be illegal, but who's going to sue every company that doesn't hire them?
I started out optimistic, but it's become pointless to even get up and look for a job. The thing is, the unemployment rate could be 9 percent or 20 percent; it makes no difference if you're the one without a job.
Soon to be homeless,
NYC
This story is exactly that of my 59-year-old brother, who is now working at a call center for a fraction of what he made in the construction industry. This is the tragedy of the current crisis. We are workers now competing with the world and we are being forced to accept lower wages. The only solution is for workers of the world to unite. It does no good to demand higher wages in the U.S. if a company can use low-wage workers somewhere else in the world. It also does us no good if companies can move to low-wage states like Texas.
Janet,
Salt Lake City, Utah
Mr. Deare, your story hits painfully home for me. My father has been in and out of manufacturing jobs throughout his employment history. He has been unemployed from his last job for about two years now. He's a shadow of the man I know him to be. He had the option of relocating with his company, but with his family and friends already settled here, how is relocating to another state even a viable option?
I sincerely hope the job market changes in the near future because, needless to say, there are millions of others like my father and yourself who want nothing more than to show up to work each day and financially provide for their families.
PSV,
Westchester, NY
This man needs to pull himself up by his bootstraps. He needs to start out at the low end, maybe stocking shelves at a grocery store, delivering food on a bike, washing dishes or maybe he can get a peanut cart and sell those delicious candy-coated cashews. Either way, he has to want to improve his lot. The time spent talking with the reporter for this article could have better been spent by applying for the jobs I listed above. We all make our own luck, and this man is no different.
Bruce Goldensteinberg,
NY
Good luck, Mr. Deare. I can't help but think of how much easier your job quest might be if you didn't have to compete against thousands of illegal immigrants in the area, who are willing to take much less pay. And just think, many more are likely to start arriving, now that word of Obama's order to deport only those with criminal backgrounds has surely spread throughout emigrant nations.
DHM,
NJ
He was unemployed for 290 days, yet still found the money to have a smartphone? I bet he had premium cable, too. Let's get our priorities straight, America!
Jen L,
Cincinnati, Ohio
So the supposed tragedy here is that a high school dropout, felon, with a history of drug addiction and a lack of marketable skills had trouble finding a job? And the problem here is the economy? Really?
knasky,
kailua, hi
I see a lot of people claiming that the problem is illegal immigrants. It's not. The immigrants do the work; the businesses do the hiring. And it's not just immigrants who are willing to take low wage jobs -- if you read the article, you would see that many Americans take low-paying jobs, as well. Consumers drive the market. So stop buying your cheap China-made wares at Wal-Mart and shop with your feet and your conscience. Many immigrants come to this country and work for themselves, as business owners. NYC has thousands of immigrant entrepreneurs, so maybe take note and think about what type of business you could start while you're waiting for the human resources department to call.
Nix's mate,
Boston to SD
Third anniversary of my firing coming up on Labor Day -- of all ironies. And while it may be cold comfort to Mr. Deare, my three college degrees have not gotten me hired. G.E.D. or Ph.D., we're all in this together. Part-time gig driving cars for a dealer -- pride rides in the trunk. Wish Mr. Deare well. There's little hope or comfort to be found, but like most Americans, he soldiers on. Perhaps Congress can find the same determination and dignity.
DDH,
CT
What about all the other employees laid off at Old London? As the article notes, NONE of the 25 former co-workers Mr. Deare kept in touch with had found jobs by last spring. Unfortunately, those stories are far more common, but much less heartwarming. When are our leaders going to do something about this national disaster?
qzitss,

VIDEO:Artists Reflect on Sept. 11 <check>
Remember?
Ten years ago Don DeLillo wrote that the attacks of Sept. 11 would change ''the way we think and act, moment to moment, week to week, for unknown weeks and months to come, and steely years.'' The historian Taylor Branch spoke of a possible ''turning point against a generation of cynicism for all of us,'' and Roger Rosenblatt argued in Time magazine that ''one good thing could come from this horror: it could spell the end of the age of irony.'' 
They were wrong, of course. We know now that the New Normal was very much like the Old Normal, at least in terms of the country's arts and entertainment. Blockbuster video stores (yes, that's how many of us watched movies back then) placed warnings on some films -- ''in light of the events of Sept. 11, please note that this product contains scenes that may be disturbing to some viewers'' -- but violent pictures continued to top most-rented lists. Despite rumors of their demise, black humor and satire, too, remained alive and well on ''Saturday Night Live'' and The Onion, which ran headlines like ''Rest of Country Temporarily Feels Deep Affection for New York.''
Ten years later, it is even clearer that 9/11 has not provoked a seismic change in the arts. While there were shifts in the broader culture -- like an increasingly toxic polarization in our politics, and an alarming impulse to privilege belief over facts -- such developments have had less to do with 9/11 than with the ballooning of partisanship during the Bush and Obama administrations, and with unrelated forces like technology, which gave us the social media revolution of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and which magnified the forces of democratization, relativism and subjectivity.
Economic worries -- sparked by 9/11 and amplified by the 2008 Wall Street meltdown -- accelerated trends already in place, including the Internet's undermining of old business models in music and publishing. Warier than ever of taking risks, Hollywood looked even harder for special-effects extravaganzas that could readily find a global audience, and Broadway doubled down on shows starring big-name celebrities that could guarantee advance box office.
In response to 9/11, the artistic community quickly mobilized. Jane Rosenthal, Craig Hatkoff and Robert De Niro put together the Tribeca Film Festival (which had its 10th anniversary this spring) to help revitalize a ravaged Lower Manhattan. And musicians including Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, the Who and Jay-Z did a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden.
There was also an outpouring of art, like Bruce Springsteen's ''The Rising,'' Neil Young's ''Let's Roll'' and Anne Nelson's earnest play ''The Guys.'' Such works served useful purposes -- cathartic commemoration, therapeutic expression, public rallying -- but in retrospect, many of them now feel sentimental or heavy-handed. Later on, anger over the war in Iraq and worries about the erosion of civil liberties under the Bush war on terror would produce a wave of politically engaged movies and plays -- including Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' and David Hare's ''Stuff Happens''; unfortunately, a lot of it turned out to be obvious or shrill. Terrorist plots popped up on TV shows like ''Law & Order'' and ''CSI: NY,'' while new counterterrorism-themed shows like ''The Unit,'' ''Sleeper Cell'' and the forthcoming ''Homeland'' proliferated.
Some eloquent or daring works of art about 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq eventually did emerge -- most notably, Kathryn Bigelow's harrowing film ''The Hurt Locker,'' about a bomb disposal squad in Iraq; Gregory Burke's haunting play ''Black Watch,'' based on interviews with soldiers who served in Iraq with a Scottish regiment; Amy Waldman's novel ''The Submission,'' which explored the fallout of 9/11 on American attitudes toward Muslims; Donald Margulies's play ''Time Stands Still,'' about the Iraq war's effects on two journalists and their relationship; and Eric Fischl's ''Tumbling Woman,'' a bronze sculpture commemorating those who fell or jumped to their deaths from the twin towers (it was removed from Rockefeller Center after complaints that it was too disturbing, too soon).
Compelling as such works are, however, none were really game-changing. None possess the vaulting ambition of, say, Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic ''Apocalypse Now,'' or the sweep of Mr. DeLillo's ''Underworld,'' which captured the entire cold war era. Instead, these 9/11 works feel like blips on the cultural landscape -- they neither represent a new paradigm nor suggest that the attacks were a cultural watershed. Perhaps this is because 9/11 did not really change daily life for much of the country. Perhaps it's because our A.D.D. nation -- after the assassinations of J.F.K., R.F.K. and M.L.K. in the '60s, and decades of violence on 24-hour news -- has become increasingly inured to shock.
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Some critics have argued that not enough time has passed for artists to gain sufficient perspective on 9/11. Tolstoy, after all, wrote about Napoleon's invasion of Russia more than 50 years later; in this respect, it may be decades before larger narratives (concerning American vulnerability and American decline) surface as animating ideas in ambitious works of art. Then again, Picasso created ''Guernica'' in 1937, only weeks after the savage bombing of that town during the Spanish Civil War.
In the meantime, a lot of post-9/11 culture seems like a cut-and-paste version of pre-9/11 culture -- or a more extreme version of it. Indeed, pop culture has slid so far into the slough of celebrity worship and escapist fluff that the antics of the Kardashian sisters now pass as entertainment. Sensationalism continues its march, and so does the blurring between news and gossip. Reality shows, which took off in 2000 with ''Survivor,'' continued to snowball in popularity. James Patterson, Michael Crichton and John Grisham continued to dominate best-seller lists. Even things thought, after 9/11, to be verboten -- like blowing up New York for a big-screen thrill -- soon made a comeback: In ''Cloverfield'' (2008), the Statue of Liberty is decapitated as a monster trashes the city.
For that matter, the last decade often seemed to be all about recycling. Old television shows (''Get Smart,'' ''Miami Vice'') and comic books (''Spider-Man,'' ''X-Men'') were recycled into films. Old movies (''Arthur,'' ''The Karate Kid'') were remade. Jukebox musicals were assembled onstage from old pop songs (''Jersey Boys'' and ''Rock of Ages''), and vintage soul and roots rock enjoyed a revival.
''Instead of being the threshold to the future,'' the critic Simon Reynolds writes in his astute new book, ''Retromania,'' the 2000s ''were dominated by the 're-' prefix: revivals, reissues, remakes, re-enactments.''
In fact, several prominent novels dealing with 9/11 drew heavily from earlier classics. Ian McEwan's ''Saturday,'' which captures the precariousness of post-9/11 daily life, reads like a contemporary variation on Virginia Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway.'' Jonathan Safran Foer's ''Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close'' features a hero named Oskar, who resembles the hero of the same name in Gunter Grass's ''The Tin Drum.'' And Mohsin Hamid's chilling novel ''The Reluctant Fundamentalist'' -- which recounts the effect 9/11 has on a successful Pakistani immigrant -- borrowed the structure and central themes of Camus's novel ''The Fall.'' Why this eagerness to pour new content into old vessels? In ''Retromania,'' Mr. Reynolds suggests technology in the 2000s contributed to a ''fading of the artistic imperative to be original.'' In the case of 9/11 novels, familiar forms may also provide narrative strategies for artists trying to subdue an event that seemed to defy representation -- one that reminds us of Philip Roth's 1961 observation that American reality stupefies and infuriates the writer because it is ''continually outdoing our talents.''
No doubt this is why many powerful works to emerge about 9/11 and its aftermath have been documentary or fact-based. In the past, with traumatic subjects like Vietnam and AIDS, this has been the trajectory over time: News accounts and witness testimony give way to memoirs, which in turn give way to more metaphorical works of the imagination.
While writers struggled to find words to describe the unimaginable, photographers captured the devastation of 9/11 with visceral eloquence. ''Here Is New York: A Democracy of Photographs,'' a project that invited everyone from professional photographers to regular New Yorkers to share their images, created a choral portrait of the city through personal acts of bearing witness.
The Power of Bare Facts
In terms of narrative scope and harrowing drama, no novel has yet to match ''The Looming Tower,'' Lawrence Wright's nonfiction account of the events that led to 9/11. Terry McDermott's book ''Perfect Soldiers'' drew a portrait of the real 9/11 hijackers that was far more compelling than the crude jihadi stereotype in John Updike's novel ''Terrorist.'' Alex Gibney's documentary ''Taxi to the Dark Side'' similarly provided a more indelible portrait of the dark side of the war on terror than such fictional films as ''Rendition'' and ''Redacted.'' The straight-up documentary ''9/11'' (using video shot that day by Jules and Gedeon Naudet) possesses a raw power totally lacking in Oliver Stone's ''World Trade Center,'' which imposed a conventional Hollywood frame around the story of two survivors, trying to make a chaotic nightmare yield an inspirational story with the soothing illusion of closure.
In fact, 9/11 poses distinct challenges to the artist. As with Mr. Stone's movie, there is the danger of trying to domesticate an overwhelming tragedy. There is also the question of presumption: How does one convey the enormity of the event without trivializing it? How does one bend art forms more often used for entertainment or artistic expression toward the capturing of history?
In ''On the Transmigration of Souls,'' the composer John Adams used taped sounds of New York to create what he called a ''memory space'' in which the audience could mourn. In his novel ''The Zero,'' Jess Walter used a Kafkaesque sense of the absurd to conjure the post-traumatic stress disorder the nation suffered. And in their TV series ''Rescue Me,'' Denis Leary and Peter Tolan looked directly at the post-9/11 lives of firefighters for whom ''normal is dead and buried underneath ground zero.''
All too often, however, artworks keyed to 9/11 felt mercenary or narcissistic. Craig Wright's play ''Recent Tragic Events'' was a slick romantic comedy about a blind date that takes place the day after 9/11, and Neil LaBute's ''The Mercy Seat,'' also set on Sept. 12, used the attacks as an excuse for another of his cynical treatises on the venality of man. Novelists were equally solipsistic, using 9/11 as a plot point, as a mirror of their characters' inner lives, or as a device to try to inject importance into otherwise slender stories. In Helen Schulman's ''A Day at the Beach,'' 9/11 leads a hip downtown couple to reassess their marriage. And in Frederic Beigbeder's ''Windows on the World,'' a fictional storyline about a man and his sons caught in the World Trade Center on 9/11 is crassly intercut with the intellectual musings of a self-important narrator.
Fantasies and Forerunners
Sept. 11 and the emotions it generated -- fear, anger, a desire for revenge -- also fueled the success of several entertainment franchises. The hit counterterrorism show ''24,'' its co-creator Joel Surnow told the New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer, was ''ripped out of the zeitgeist of what people's fears are -- their paranoia that we're going to be attacked.'' The series frequently used torture as a way of gathering intelligence; it depicted the fight against terrorism much as members of the Bush administration did: as a struggle for American survival that required all means necessary.
In the case of the Syfy Channel's remake of ''Battlestar Galactica'' -- which depicted some humans who survive an attack by enemy robots -- its executive producer Ronald D. Moore noted that many plot elements were ''informed by the 9/11 experience and the war on terrorism.'' Fans of Microsoft's hugely popular video game ''Halo,'' in which humans face off against an alliance of alien species bent on holy war, have also pointed to parallels between the aliens and Al Qaeda.
For that matter, fantasy epics -- pitting good versus evil in stark Manichaean terms -- dominated the box office in the last decade: among the top-grossing films were ''Avatar,'' two installments of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' three installments of ''Harry Potter'' and ''The Dark Knight.'' Superheroes like Spider-Man and Iron Man ruled, and so did vampires. There was a lot of intellectualizing about all this: arguments that the fantasy boom embodied Americans' need for escapism after 9/11; that superhero sagas offered audiences a way to process the tragedy; that vampires, like terrorists, pose a deadly threat but often hide in plain sight. Steven Spielberg said his 2005 remake of ''War of the Worlds'' reflected post-9/11 anxiety. Time's Richard Corliss described the Joker in ''The Dark Knight'' as ''the terrorist as improv artist.'' And bloggers compared Voldemort and his Death Eaters in ''Harry Potter'' to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.
It's too easy, however, to see every recent pop culture phenomenon as a metaphor for combating terrorism. Voldemort sprang from J. K. Rowling's imagination well before 9/11. The Tolkien novels, like Batman, Spider-Man and many of their superhero brethren, predate 9/11 by decades, as do the first ''Star Wars'' movies. Curiously, the best-known terrorist-themed movies remain ones made before 9/11, including ''Air Force One'' (1997), ''True Lies'' (1994), ''Patriot Games'' (1992) and ''Die Hard'' (1988). Some of the works of art that would prove the most resonant in the post-9/11 world also turn out to have been written before the attacks. Tony Kushner began work on his play ''Homebody/Kabul,'' which unfolds into an examination of the West's relationship with Afghanistan, back in 1997. And such early Don DeLillo novels as ''Mao II'' (1991) did a more prescient job of conjuring the post-9/11 era -- in which terrorists have changed ''the rules of what is thinkable'' -- than the flimsy novels he wrote after the attacks.
It is another measure of how resistant 9/11 remains to artistic treatment that several of the more memorable artworks that captured the city's sense of loss did so by indirection. Colum McCann's novel ''Let the Great World Spin'' focuses on New York City in 1974, when Philippe Petit walked between the twin towers on a tightrope. And Ric Burns's documentary ''The Center of the World'' and Camilo Jose Vergara's photographs on exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York make us re-experience the loss of the World Trade Center by recounting its history.
At the same time, other artistic creations -- unrelated to 9/11 -- took on new depth or new meanings. Christo and Jeanne-Claude's monumental project ''The Gates,'' conceived in 1979 and only realized in 2005 with the support of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, threaded Central Park with 7,500 gates wrapped in saffron fabric, turning that great communal space into a work of art that was at once visionary and interactive, ephemeral and enduring. The largest public art project in the city's history, it became, for many New Yorkers, a symbol of hope, of transcendence, of healing after 9/11.
''It's not that everything is different after 9/11; it's more that we look at the same stuff through a different prism,'' says Kate D. Levin, the city's cultural affairs commissioner. In the case of ''The Gates,'' she adds, something that had ''nothing to do with 9/11, something that was completely about aesthetics'' became ''that much more profound.''

HEADLINE: Downtown's Rebirth, 10 Years and $24 Billion Later

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A DECADE after the Sept. 11 attack, downtown Manhattan is resurgent. The residential population has doubled. Two skyscrapers -- 1 and 4 World Trade Center -- are rising at ground zero, due to open in 2013. The next year, the exuberant PATH transit hub is scheduled to come online. The national memorial is open; two streets have been built. A far more diverse array of businesses call downtown home today, including a large cluster of media companies, law firms and nonprofit organizations. And just last week, both the northbound and southbound platforms of the Cortlandt Street subway station were open.
That is not what most people expected. 
''I had a lot of skepticism about whether the World Trade Center area could be recreated as a vibrant, 24-hour place,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the City University of New York's Center for Urban Research. ''But I have to say that despite much botched planning, the delays, posturing and bureaucratic politics, things are actually coming along very well.''
But progress does not come cheap. The cost of rebuilding the trade center, several related projects and the downtown public transportation system will run close to $24 billion -- probably not all that surprising given the institutional rivalries, the political squabbling and the complexity of building 26 interdependent projects on a cramped 16-acre site next to a river and with two transit lines running underneath.
Financing the reconstruction has been equally complex. After the terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush promised more than $20 billion in federal aid for New York. But slightly more than $6 billion was spent on the clean-up and emergency aid. Of the remaining $14 billion, only $8 billion was actual cash for rebuilding -- the rest came in the form of tax incentives. The insurance proceeds from the site itself came to $4.5 billion.
The state provided tens of millions of dollars in additional tax breaks for downtown tenants and employers.
One World Trade Center (the former Freedom Tower) alone cost $3.2 billion to build. New security concerns in the post-Sept. 11 world contributed to the building's being redesigned three times over the past decade. Still, this year, that building landed a glamorous lead tenant, the media company Conde Nast Publications. But it cost taxpayers plenty: $47.5 million in rent rebates and millions more in sales tax and commercial rent tax exemptions.
Goldman Sachs's new tower across West Street from the World Trade Center site, a relative bargain at $2.4 billion, received $1.65 billion in tax-free Liberty Bonds, which saved the bank millions in financing costs. Goldman threatened to abandon the project after the state botched negotiations for the tower. That led the state to enlarge its incentive package to include $115 million in tax breaks and cash grants, in what critics described as the most egregious example of corporate welfare in city history.
Goldman's share of the Liberty Bonds illustrates the size of its taxpayer bounty. The bonds accounted for 69 percent of the project's cost. But the developer Larry Silverstein got only $2.6 billion in Liberty Bonds, or 41 percent of the $6.3 billion projected cost of building three towers on the trade center site itself.
Other developers, meanwhile, got a total of $1.6 billion of the tax-free bonds for 15 luxury buildings containing a total of 5,700 apartments to repopulate Lower Manhattan. Fewer than 5 percent of those units were set aside for poor and working-class New Yorkers.
Fearing the loss of businesses in Lower Manhattan, the Pataki administration provided dozens of companies with $313 million in cash grants for staying downtown, although there was little chance that the American Stock Exchange, Century 21 or the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan would leave.
But nothing in the area can compare with the transit hub, with its white-winged super-structure designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The hub's cost has swelled to $3.44 billion from $1.9 billion over the past decade, though it will serve only 80,000 PATH riders daily. Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan serves seven times that number, and yet its planned renovation has largely stalled.
Still, given the area's remarkable rebirth, people may be willing to overlook that. ''If you had told me the day after 9/11 that downtown would be doing as well as it's now doing in attracting businesses and so many residential tenants, I would have said, 'Get out of here,' '' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, who was instrumental in getting the $20 billion in federal aid.

HEADLINE: State Challenging Hospitals' Tax Exemptions

BYLINE: By BRUCE JAPSEN. 
brucejapsen@gmail.com

 BODY:
Facing a budget deficit exceeding $11 billion, the State of Illinois in recent weeks has begun challenging the property tax exemptions of some of its best-known hospitals, saying they should pay more because they are not providing enough charity care.
The Illinois Department of Revenue moved last month to strip property tax exemptions from Prentice Women's Hospital, a sparkling new medical center in Chicago's tony Streeterville neighborhood; Edward Hospital, a rapidly expanding medical center in the western suburb of Naperville, and Decatur Memorial Hospital in central Illinois.
If successful with those three, the state is expected to look for other not-for-profit hospitals with low percentages of charity care, with an eye toward challenging their property tax exemptions, too. A Department of Revenue spokesman said the agency was reviewing parcels owned by 15 hospital systems, but declined to say if the tax exemptions would be challenged in each case.
All three of the hospitals the state is focusing on provided free and discounted medical care that ranged from 0.96 percent to 1.85 percent of patient-care revenue, according to the revenue department. The state also said that each one had been operating as a ''for profit'' business when the state's Constitution says that ''only charities are entitled to a tax exemption.'' 
In anticipation of new tax challenges, hospitals in Illinois are preparing a lobbying push that would seek to redefine the qualifications for tax exemptions. The new definition would go beyond just charity care and expand to include patients' unpaid debts, costs of medical care not covered by Medicare health insurance for the elderly, Medicaid coverage for the poor, as well as direct costs that teaching hospitals pay to train doctors and conduct research.
In interviews, executives of the Illinois Hospital Association told the Chicago News Cooperative that they had discussed with state policy makers a plan to draft a broader legal definition for hospital tax exemptions. The lobbying group -- which is adding staff members to bolster its effort -- would also figure into a hospital's tax exemption the cost of subsidizing money-losing services like emergency care, trauma care, burn units and neonatal intensive care units.
''We strongly believe that charity care should not be the sole determining factor for a hospital's nonprofit, tax-exempt status and respectfully suggest the legislature establish clear standards for tax exemption,'' Dean Harrison, chief executive of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, the parent company of Prentice Women's Hospital, said in a statement.
The hospital industry's push is at odds with the changes under way at the Department of Revenue, which is acting in the wake of the State Supreme Court ruling last year upholding the revocation of the property tax exemption for Catholic-owned Provena Covenant Medical Center in downstate Urbana, in Champaign County. For that hospital, the value of care provided to indigent patients amounted to less than 1 percent of its revenue in 2002.
The Department of Revenue cites the state's Constitution that allows tax exemption only on property used exclusively for charitable purposes. In the Provena case, the state had argued the hospital should lose its tax exemption because only 302 patients received charity care worth $832,000, or just 0.7 percent of the hospital's $113 million in revenue that year, state records show. In the Supreme Court ruling, justices noted that 13 percent of Champaign County's more than 185,000 residents had incomes below the federal poverty guidelines.
Since the revenue department moved to strip the three hospital tax exemptions, State Senator Iris Y. Martinez, Democrat of Chicago, has intensified her effort to pass a bill that she and others introduced earlier this year requiring hospitals to provide 3.5 percent of their annual revenue in charity care. The level advocated by Ms. Martinez would still be far less than the 8 percent that the Illinois attorney general, Lisa Madigan, proposed five years ago.
''Hospitals think they should get tax exemptions for merely what they do in the community,'' said John Colombo, a professor of law at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has followed the issue of nonprofit hospital tax exemptions nationally. ''It's problematic: The overall number that each of these hospitals is reporting is abysmally low. Given the state of the economy, one would expect the charity services going up.''
Services like prenatal care may be expensive for hospitals, Professor Colombo said. ''But in reality the prenatal care can be a mint to them once it results in women coming into the delivery room to have their babies.''
For the year 2007, Northwestern Memorial HealthCare showed charity cases as 1.85 percent of its $1.18 billion in net patient revenue. Edward Hospital showed charity care at 1.04 percent of its $448 million in net patient revenues that year. Decatur Memorial reported costs of charity care at 0.96 percent of its $252 million in net patient revenues in 2006, the year revenue department officials evaluated the hospital's recent ownership change.
The hospitals argue that their contributions are significant, even though charity care is a small percentage of their business. Community benefit provided by Northwestern's flagship, Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Chicago's Gold Coast, has increased more than 10 percent since 2005, to $255 million, according to Mr. Harrison. And Edward Hospital said it treated patients ''24 hours a day, 7 days a week, regardless of their ability to pay.''
Mark Deaton, the Illinois Hospital Association's general counsel, said hospitals ''in some fashion relieve the burden of government'' because of the community benefit they provide.
But analysts say hospitals that pay taxes provide community benefit in other ways. Provena's Urbana hospital now pays about $1.2 million annually in taxes.
''A million dollars in revenue will fix pot holes, help schools and infrastructure and make the city safer,'' Professor Colombo said. ''Those tax dollars are a pretty big community benefit.''
The Chicago area has seen a rising number of for-profit hospitals that serve the poor while still paying taxes on their property. For example, Vanguard Health Systems , the for-profit hospital operator, has bought five former nonprofit hospitals in the Chicago area, two of them former nonprofit hospitals near the poor Austin neighborhood on the West Side. Vanguard pays taxes on the properties.
''The relative amounts of charity care provided by not-for-profit tax-exempts are not materially different from the amount provided by for-profit hospitals,'' said Jim Unland, a longtime analyst of Illinois' health care industry and president of the Health Capital Group, a consulting firm in Chicago. ''This raises the issue of whether the tax-exempts are getting prejudicially favorable treatment.''
The battle comes during a period of high unemployment and related loss in health benefits by hundreds of thousands of Americans that analysts say are in greater need for discounted and free medical care.
Hospitals say they will challenge the Department of Revenue in court. They intend to respond by mid-October to the denial of their tax exemptions by the agency's director, Brian Hamer.

HEADLINE: Europe's Fiscal Fantasies: While confidence in major banks drains away, political leaders dither

 BODY:
Europe's leaders believe they can stave off economic disaster without taking real action. They keep pretending that they will not have to ask taxpayers to help shore up fragile banks, that ever larger doses of austerity will let weak economies like Greece pay off their debts, and that Europe can continue to reap the benefits of monetary union without the shared responsibilities of greater fiscal union. 
No one else believes this -- not credit markets, which have bid up interest rates on sovereign debt; not the International Monetary Fund, which has warned repeatedly that major banks appear undercapitalized; and not the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which last week forecast negative growth in the coming quarter for Germany, France and Italy, the euro zone's three biggest economies.
The immediate fear is that one or more major European banks may fail. Confidence is plummeting because they have large holdings of Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds. A major bank failure would damage America's economy as well -- which helps explain the urgent pleas from Washington last week for Europe to come up with a strategy for recovery and growth. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner met with European finance ministers on Friday to talk about what such a strategy might look like. But so far, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy have shown none of the political leadership necessary to forge a long-term solution.
Meanwhile, the real world keeps intruding on Europe's political fantasies. The healthy appearance of major bank balance sheets vanishes when future write-downs and partial defaults are factored in. Added capital must be set aside for this contingency, and much of it may have to come from public funds. In return, governments must demand a share of future profits and a stronger regulatory hand.
Countries like Italy and Spain already find it impossible to finance their debt without emergency purchases by the European Central Bank, which is only a temporary solution. Issuing common European bonds would be a good step since Europe as a whole can borrow much more cheaply than its debtor countries.
Most important, European leaders must shift from austerity policies that are leading to recession, not relief. They need to stimulate demand in stronger economies, like Germany, and defer austerity measures in fragile ones. One reason Greece keeps missing its deficit targets is that recession is shrinking tax revenues almost as fast as the government can slash spending. Now Italy, whose growth rates have lagged behind Europe's for a decade, is being forced to swallow the same bad medicine.
Energizing growth requires not just easier monetary and fiscal policies, but continued pressure for labor market reforms and privatization of inefficient state companies. It will also require more centralized coordination of fiscal policy for the euro zone's 17 countries. Yet most are still dragging their feet at carrying out the modest reforms their leaders agreed to in July.
There is no time to waste. A debt and banking meltdown in Europe this fall could fracture the euro and drag the world into renewed recession.

HEADLINE: Employee Suit Exacerbates Lab's Issues

BYLINE: By JOHN UPTON. 
jupton@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Marian Barraza, like many who have worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, considered Livermore more than just an employer. Mrs. Barraza, a soft-spoken administrator, worked at Livermore, the federal weapons research lab, for 38 years. She met her husband there. One of the couple's two daughters and many of Mrs. Barraza's friends still work there.
''The lab has been my life,'' Mrs. Barraza, 59, said. ''I started there when I was 17 years old.''
But in 2008, after the United States Department of Energy stripped a contract to run the lab from the University of California and handed it to a mostly private-sector coalition led by Bechtel, the contracting giant based in San Francisco, Mrs. Barraza was laid off. 
Now, feeling as though she has been ejected from her family, Mrs. Barraza has joined some 130 former Livermore workers in suing the lab's management company, claiming that extensive layoffs were illegally aimed at senior staff members who earned the highest salaries and were closest to reaching retirement. Damages could exceed $100 million.
The lawsuit is a symptom of a troubled, multiyear effort to make Livermore, once among the crown jewels of the nation's science establishment, relevant and cost-effective in a post-cold-war world.
Privatization of the lab's management was supposed to lead to greater efficiency and increased employment, but instead it led to cutbacks that have left the lab with around 6,800 permanent employees, down from some 9,400 in 2005.
Some scientists at the lab contend that the quality of scientific research has suffered, as evidenced by a sharp drop in the number of peer-reviewed research papers produced by lab employees.
Security risks, which had helped prompt the Energy Department to overhaul lab management, have remained a problem. And Livermore's biggest project, the National Ignition Facility, a giant array of lasers designed to fuse hydrogen atoms, has been plagued by delays, cost overruns, and heath and safety concerns.
''Everybody thought that with privatization we could save money and get more transparency,'' said Peter Stockton, a senior investigator at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight who has studied the national laboratories since the 1970s. ''It's done pretty much the opposite.''
Bechtel officials blame inflation, increased tax obligations and a $100 million decline in federal appropriations between 2007 and 2008 for the abrupt decision to replace hiring plans with firing plans. The promised greater efficiency, they say, is still in the works.
Lawyers for the management company declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Few argue that the nation's network of federal government research laboratories -- and especially Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the two flagship nuclear weapons labs -- were not in need of change after the cold war ended.
Livermore was founded in 1952 by the University of California to provide competition for the nuclear bomb builders at Los Alamos, which the university also managed. The lab cultivated a quasi-academic atmosphere in which basic research and the esoteric engineering needed to build nuclear weapons were considered worthy ends in themselves. Budgets were rarely an issue.
But without an arms race, Livermore and Los Alamos were institutions without a mission. The federal government was still interested in the basic science, but pressure mounted for the labs to prove themselves worthy of billions in taxpayer funds.
Meanwhile, university officials who oversaw the laboratories' management contracts drew criticism for a laissez-faire approach to operational issues.
''The management of the labs was, well, my God, they just had one travesty after another,'' Mr. Stockton said. ''The arrogance oozed from them.''
Even liberal critics of Livermore's management -- including the peace activists who operate its neighborhood watchdog, Tri-Valley CAREs, one of the groups hoping to see the weapons laboratory reinvented as a civilian science center -- agreed that opening up the management contract to competition was a good idea.
In 2006, the Department of Energy solicited bids from contractors interested in running Livermore. It received three bids, rejected one of them, and eventually awarded the contract to Lawrence Livermore National Security L.L.C., a partnership led by Bechtel and the University of California that also includes the URS Corporation, an engineering design firm, and the Babcock & Wilcox Company, an energy and services products provider. The same group was awarded the Los Alamos management contract.
Warning flags were raised at the time about the bidding process. David Hobson, an Ohio Republican who was chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, told the Energy Department in a 2006 letter that many potential competitors had declined to bid because they believed the fix was in.
''Unfortunately, the Department of Energy's national laboratories are not viewed as a competitive marketplace but as a playground for political patronage,'' Mr. Hobson wrote.
The department declined to comment. The new management company took over Livermore in October 2007, with the promise that it would improve efficiency, bolster security and increase the lab's work force from 9,411 full-time employees in 2005 to as many as 11,500.
But by 2009, the number of permanent full-time workers at Livermore had fallen to 6,900.
Meanwhile, problems that were supposed to have been addressed by the privatization effort persisted. A 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said, for instance, that security flaws lingered at the laboratory.
Bechtel's spokesman, Jason Bohne, acknowledged that problems persisted at Livermore, but he said the management company was reducing operating costs and improving accountability through new purchasing processes, consolidation of business functions and other measures common to businesses.
''Making changes to these large, complex laboratories with firmly entrenched cultures was expected to be difficult, as change often is,'' Mr. Bohne said. ''Some of the change is still in progress.''
Since 2008, federal funds appropriated for laboratory operations have crept back up almost to the 2007 level of more than $1.2 billion, but the Livermore head count remains drastically below what it was four years ago. Lynda Seaver, a lab spokeswoman, said spending on staff and operations had fallen because of a substantial increase in management fees.
Since 2008, the companies and the Department of Energy have not disclosed details of the fees paid to the management company.
A union representing Livermore workers says the scientists who remain are fearful and are prevented from discussing problems with their research publicly. Under the terms of the management contract, such problems could limit performance bonuses payable to the management company.
''Scientists raising any issues that would put the performance bonus at risk is strongly frowned upon,'' said Jeff Colvin, a computational physicist and union representative at the laboratory.
Ms. Seaver said that was not the case. ''Scientists have never been restricted in what they can say,'' she said. ''Academic freedom is why many of them choose to work here.''
Mr. Colvin told a National Academy of Sciences working group investigating the impacts of privatization on the national laboratories that the number of peer-reviewed articles published by laboratory scientists, which he says is a measure of productivity among scientists, fell from approximately 1,400 in 2005 to about 800 in 2010. The academy plans to publish a report to Congress in November.
As for the laid-off employees, they lament what once had been. ''It was a great place to work until the contract changed,'' Mrs. Barraza said, weeping during a recent interview in her lawyers' Oakland office as she recalled her surprise layoff. ''It's not the same place that it used to be.''

HEADLINE: New York on a Tightrope of Crazy Optimism and Grace

 BODY:
The Big City Book Club kicked off on Tuesday with a live online discussion of ''Let the Great World Spin,'' Colum McCann's award-winning 2009 novel, which Ginia Bellafante, the Big City columnist, called ''a portrait of the city in perhaps its most vivid period of decline.'' Readers debated the book's view of salvation, its evocation of 9/11 and its thematic interest in beauty. Edited excerpts from the conversation appear below.
The club will meet again on Oct. 18, to discuss ''This Beautiful Life,'' by Helen Schulman.
GINIA BELLAFANTE 
The book is a 9/11 narrative by implication, Mr. McCann's idea being that New York is, fundamentally, a place where wondrous things rise from the ashes. We can argue about whether or not he is right in his assessment, but I think it is fair to say that above all, ''Let the Great World Spin'' is an enormously hopeful book.
The novel's haunting, surreal set piece is Philippe Petit's high-wire walk between the twin towers in August 1974. It is against the backdrop of this episode that disparate lives clash and merge and find solace in one another. Here the World Trade Center stands not only as spectacle but as a profound symbol of unity.
To my mind, the most evocative passage in a book full of evocative passages is the scene in the Park Avenue apartment of Claire, who has lost her son in Vietnam and is hosting a consortium of mourners from all strata of society. They have gathered on the morning that Mr. Petit is conducting his walk and with an incredibly economical, if nearly silent, sense of juxtaposition, Mr. McCann delivers the devastating effects of one pointless war and then another.
But in the end, I am compelled by the book's sense of optimism. It ends with Jaslyn, a child of terribly grim circumstance, having landed into a good home and the Ivy League. Mr. McCann means this to stand as a testament to the city's resilience. But at the same time it seems to undermine his own message by the inadvertent suggestion that poverty is surmountable only by serendipity and the charitable impulses of private citizens.
New York in the years since 9/11 has become a place where class divisions seem ever more pronounced, where an outcome like the one Jaslyn experiences in the book feels less possible rather than more.
So I suppose we can begin with the question: Is McCann's conclusion naive? Ambivalent? Inspiring? All of the above?
DAVE, MAMARONECK, NY
McCann's theme is fundamentally Catholic (big ''C''). The ''Great World,'' including its institutions, are fundamentally corrupt and sinful. Salvation comes, if it comes, through suffering and the redemptive power of grace, which by definition is serendipitous, random and, of course, gratuitous. ''The wind blows where it wills, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.'' John 3:8.
GB You raise an excellent point. There is something of a disconnect, I think, between the book's power as a testament to New York and its evocation of a city hardly sustained by institutions at all. I think McCann genuinely believes that New York is a fantastic place -- even the prostitutes are cheerful! But a city cannot be a great city if it is sustained merely on random acts of grace -- and private philanthropy. In a way, the book is a Bloomberg-era fantasy: the kind and wealthy will take care of things. So the book is spiritual, yes, but also conservative.
JASPH, KANSAS CITY
Philippe Petit's 1974 feat remains for me the most audacious act of human creativity and daring ever. With that as the connecting line through it, the book was bound to be a work of great optimism. What's more crazily optimistic than wire-walking? The novel itself is a kind of high-wire walk from story to story, and you sense sometimes that McCann is not completely sure of his footing -- he's losing and rediscovering his balance as he goes.
It's unlike any book I've ever read.
GEORGE--KYPREOS, NYC
The couple, to me, with their obsessive but slightly frivolous (or maybe just aesthetic?) nostalgia for a past era, was an interesting parallel to how many New Yorkers today feel about the era that the book is set in. [Among the book's characters are a couple who style themselves in the mode of the 1920s.]
I'm not sure if the author intended it as a point of satire or criticism (or self-criticism), or as a means of building on the theme of nostalgia, but in any case, I found that it gave the couple's story more emotional weight because I easily sympathized with their desire to reclaim a previous, seemingly better time.
GB You're right -- there's an interesting parallel here. The couple depicted live with the signifiers of Gilded Age artifice. They have ''authenticity'' -- the crime and grime and grit of '70s New York -- and they reject it. Are those of us who pine for the New York of 40 years ago, without its Red Lobsters in Times Square, just as ridiculous? Probably.
ADS, CONNECTICUT
I'll admit to deeply ambivalent feelings about the book. I found the plot lines contrived, much of the dialogue less than convincing, and few characters that really resonated as fully formed.
That said, it offers a strange and strangely compelling comfort. The NY McCann invokes is simultaneously beautiful and terrifyingly ugly, both mired in grief and ecstatic in vitality. Individual moral heroism exists alongside indifference, and the shadow of Vietnam hangs over the whole.
I don't think McCann is at all nostalgic about the past he invokes; rather, I think he is holding it up to the mirror of our own dark time, with an abiding belief that life will, as then, find a way to move on.
CJF, BOSTON, MA
I don't think that the importance of how Corrigan [a radical monk working and living among prostitutes in the Bronx] sees ''something beautiful'' can be overstated. The pursuit of this beauty (in the most unexpected of places, the edge of society) is what Corrigan has pursued his whole life. The same is true for Petit, although he's literally walking on the edge.
Yet the book concludes with Jaslyn similarly noticing the beauty of the everyday -- Page 349 sees her noticing details that would be considered inconsequential. Beauty, then, is the tie that binds the ''baroque courting of death'' and the moments ticking away before death's arrival. Moments of consequence can occur on both a macro and micro level.
One other interesting topic for conversation: how the book's namesake poem mirrors the character development over time. ''Locksley Hall'' by Tennyson features a protagonist who is comparable to the book's general arc toward progress and hope.
EVIEAL, NEW YORK, NY
The tightrope-walking incident was something that had all New Yorkers staring at the twin towers for the morning -- from all parts of the city, including the ferries, and uptown, and everyone on the streets downtown, and people trying to find out about it from across the country (pre-Internet and cable news!).
What a juxtaposition with 9/11, when again, the entire city -- and then the world -- was staring straight up at the twin towers. The author doesn't mention 9/11, however. And I personally don't think he needs to -- it's there, you know the book was written post-2001, you know what world he's coming from -- and so you feel that joint moment the entire time.
The event of the tightrope walker brought the entire city together for one crazy morning -- and made the WTC famous! -- and then it happened again 30 years later. I think it's O.K. that Jaslyn's fortune is so optimistic. Yes, she's luckier than most people would have been in that situation. But without that kind of hope -- that good things CAN come out of horrible stories -- the world wouldn't seem so great.
DAVIDK, LES, NY
It is an extremely difficult task to mold a modern city like New York into the novelistic form. It is easy to set the story in the city, as the setting for the characters' actions, but almost impossible to write a book that tries to be ''about'' the city, that treats the staggering multiplicity of a place like NYC as the true subject matter of the narrative.
There are two basic strategies to cope with this daunting task.
The first is to choose a singular perspective, a single eye, through which a variety of disparate experiences can be accounted for. The other strategy is to weave many narratives together into a single story.
The perfect example of this approach is Tom Wolfe's ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' where all the characters live separate lives that intersect here and there with one another. McCann uses Wolfe's template in ''Let the Great World Spin,'' but his montage of persons, places, events and themes is quite limited and rather dull when compared to its obvious literary model.
In order to cover this shortcoming up, the book reverts to a third strategy: It uses the tightrope walker as a focal point, as the object toward which everything and everyone in the story must turn at a certain points. This creates the illusion of unity, which is the same illusion that 9/11 gave to some naive commentators.
LSC, NEW YORK, NY
I didn't think it was necessary to have chapters devoted to the wire walker (Petit's) perspective. It didn't add to the novel. I found that those chapters took away from the rhythm of the novel and didn't have the same level of character development as in the other chapters.
GB What's interesting about the introduction of Petit as a character is that he then matters (in character terms) by the end, not at all. The chapters detailing his prep work were valuable, I thought, for giving us a sense of all the surreptition that Petit had to pull off to execute his walk. It all added to the sense of a city that was largely happening behind the scrims of things.
SB, IRELAND
We don't get a full arc of some characters' lives, but I like the way the novel moves around the huge ballroom of the city, where characters find themselves mingling, then veering away, then sharing for moments the one beat, the one focus, as Petit takes to the wire.
The fragmentation works, I think. It leaves one wanting more in the same way as an incident on the street does -- ''What happened to those people in the end? Were they all right?''
It's a wonderful, brave book. It hasn't the resolution of Dickens's work -- novels with a capital ''N'' -- but I believe the wide canvas and the inclusion of so many different lives comes from the same spiritual home.
VIC CARSON, WINDHAM, CT
An earlier comment mentions Tennyson's poem ''Locksley Hall'' as the source of the book title. Here's an excerpt from that poem, which includes the line we want:
Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range,
Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.

HEADLINE: Cell-Free Escape, Ruined

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
Steven Kurutz is a reporter for The New York Times.
I RECENTLY received a text message from my friend Chris. ''Dude,'' he wrote, ''I'm texting you from Memorial Park.'' Memorial Park is in Renovo, the central Pennsylvania town where we both grew up; we swam and fished there as children. Considering its origin, the text carried for us the landmark significance of the first trans-Atlantic phone call.
Saying I grew up in a small town has never seemed adequate to describe Renovo's splendid isolation. It's set deep in a river valley, surrounded by the Allegheny Mountains and vast state forest preserves. It's a 40-minute drive to the nearest movie theater. Renovo's unusual geographic remoteness, amid the densely populated East Coast, was confirmed last year in the book ''The Last Empty Places,'' a travelogue of America's hinterlands, which devoted several pages to the area. 
There were many wonderful things about growing up there, but communication with the wider world, even in the passive sense, wasn't one of them. FM radio signals were blunted by the mountains. The Internet as we know it didn't exist when I lived there in the 1980s and early '90s. Visitors to the town were infrequent and vaguely unwelcome; the men who drove in from the Eastern cities each winter to hunt were ''flatlanders,'' in the local parlance.
The kind of rural community I'm describing has difficulty retaining its young people, and Chris and I were no exception. We both moved to New York City, each working in the media, and became iPhone-wielding urbanites leading plugged-in lives.
Meanwhile, our hometown remained off the grid. Whenever I visited my parents there, I felt as if I'd checked into a super-relaxing nature retreat. There was clean mountain air and a clear night sky, but, of equal significance, no one yammering on a cellphone or obsessively checking a mobile device. Myself included. Over the last decade, a small pleasure has been to drive back for a long weekend, telling friends and employers, ''I'll be unreachable on my cell.'' I'm often met with a dubious look, as if ''unreachable'' were a word from a dead language.
But an estimated 500,000 rural Americans are without mobile wireless coverage, according to a report issued last year by the Federal Communications Commission, and Renovo's citizens were among them. Under deadline to finish a book, I holed up there to write. If I felt my brain short-circuiting, back I went to unplug. The things that frustrated me about the town when I lived there as a teenager -- the isolation and time-warp feel -- were its greatest assets when I became an adult fleeing the city.
The local business owners and many of the townspeople didn't share that view. They understandably wanted to join the 21st century and were concerned that the lack of wireless coverage would impede economic growth. In recent years, efforts have been made to attract a wireless provider to build a signal tower that would, in effect, bring the mountains to heel and deliver cell service to the area. Secretly, I hoped the tower would never be built. I recognize the hypocrisy in wanting my hometown to remain stuck in time, even as I've moved away to a modern city.
Still, in this age of digital distraction, isn't a wireless-free zone a precious resource, as endangered by development as streams and forests? I can imagine travel brochures trumpeting the absence of Wi-Fi: ''Escape to the Pennsylvania wilds. Leave your digital leash behind!''
But a coalition of local government officials and small business owners were finally able to attract a regional carrier, Immix Wireless, and this summer the people of Renovo joined most of the rest of Americans in being able to get real-time news and financial information on mobile devices, call for help when their cars break down, and, of course, talk on their cellphones about grocery shopping while grocery shopping.
In the end, I was the one stuck in the past, stubbornly wedded to my image of the town as an unplugged backwater. In response to Chris's text from Memorial Park, I tapped out: ''It's not right! It's not right!'' -- as if texting and making cellphone calls within Renovo's borders violated some natural order.
I'm sure many of the townspeople think it's both perfectly natural and long overdue.

HEADLINE: Heather Miles, David Lombino

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
Heather Elizabeth Miles and David Albert Lombino were married Friday at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Roman Catholic Church in Washington Depot, Conn. The Rev. Matthew Kappalumakkel officiated. On Saturday afternoon, the Rev. Edward J. Hanrahan, another Roman Catholic priest, performed a wedding mass at the home of Jill F. Lloyd and Michael A. Lloyd, who are friends of the bridegroom's family, also in Washington Depot.
The bride, 33, is a lawyer in private practice in New York. She specializes in emerging growth technology companies and venture capital. She graduated magna cum laude from Colby College in Waterville, Me., and received a law degree and a master of laws in international and comparative law from Cornell. She is a daughter of Theresa Belli Miles and James F. Miles of Lawrenceville, N.J. 
Mr. Lombino, 33, is the executive vice president of the external affairs division at the New York City Economic Development Corporation in New York. He oversees communications, marketing, and government and community relations. Until 2008, he was the city editor of The Sun, a New York newspaper. He graduated cum laude from Williams College and received a master's in international affairs from Columbia. He is the son of Joan Karron Foley of New York and Robert J. Lombino of Danbury, Conn. He is a stepson of Linda Lombino and the stepson of Frank M. Foley.
The couple met at a karaoke bar in Chinatown in August 2008. Mr. Lombino had just finished a hammed-up rendition of ''More Than Words,'' a ballad by the band Extreme.
''It's an old, cheesy song,'' said Ms. Miles, who was there for a friend's going-away party, while Mr. Lombino was with a group from The Sun. ''Any guy who has enough confidence to sing a cheesy kind of girlie song is definitely fun and must be a great guy.''
That was enough to compel her to walk over to Mr. Lombino.
''Hey, good job,'' she recalled telling him. ''He had a great personality and not a so great voice.''
Mr. Lombino said he could not believe she was actually talking to him, after being convinced after he noticed her that ''she was out of my league.''
But his confidence was bolstered by something that had happened shortly before; he had seen Mick Jagger outside on the street. ''This is not a popular neighborhood, not like SoHo,'' he said. ''He was walking down the street with two women on Bayard Street.'' That convinced Mr. Lombino that anything could happen.
He then stumbled through a conversation with Ms. Miles, and as they spoke on and off that night, they discovered that they had at least five friends in common.
''I was pretty moved by her beauty,'' said Mr. Lombino, who took her number.
Each then vetted the other.
''I learned what I had suspected,'' said Mr. Lombino, that many young men before him had been fascinated by her.
And Ms. Miles received a seal of approval from a college friend who had gone to high school with Mr. Lombino and who never cared for anyone she'd dated.
''He's a 10,'' she said her friend told her, before having second thoughts. ''He's an 11,'' the friend quickly added, ''and you're going to marry him.''

HEADLINE: How to Read the Minds of Other Investors?

BYLINE: ; .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Beauty Contest That's Shaking Wall St.'' (Economic View, Sept. 4), in which Robert J. Shiller said the stock market's recent volatility resulted from investors trying to decide what other investors are thinking: 
Indeed, it's not just individual investors who buy stocks this way. Some stock analysts do the same thing.
When I served in a Wall Street corporate finance department in the 1980's, I remember one analyst who explained how he made recommendations. In addition to his quantitative analysis, he explained that he took into account how his fellow analysts responded to a company's conferences and briefings. Whether they sounded receptive or cynical weighed heavily on whether he recommended a buy. Zsolt Harsanyi
McLean, Va., Sept. 7
The writer is a former vice president at E. F. Hutton.
To the Editor:
After reading the column, I must wonder how we as investors are supposed to read other investors' minds. It's hard enough for someone to make investment decisions based on the current economic and financial situation in the United States or globally. How, then, can John invest based on what Marie may think Joe is thinking?
Computerized trading by large institutional investors is what moves and shakes the markets. The trading by these big investors has nothing to do with a ''beauty contest'' but rather is driven solely by technical indicators, updated and acted upon every nanosecond.
Both individual investors and mutual fund managers have become powerless in the face of this high-frequency trading, some of which has nothing to do with the calculated or perceived value of a company or stock. Bernard Javelly

HEADLINE: How to Make Business Want to Invest Again

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He is advising Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
DURING the last week, the nation has witnessed much partisan wrangling over the economy. So it might be worth stepping back and assessing what we know and what we don't. Let's start with five propositions about which there is little doubt:
The economy is in bad shape. Technically, the recession ended in June 2009, and since then the economy has been recovering. But it doesn't feel that way to many Americans. Things have stopped getting worse, but they have not gotten much better. The recovery has been so meager that unemployment lingers at historically high levels. 
The disappointing news about job creation is closely linked to lackluster growth in G.D.P. Economists call the relationship between growth and unemployment ''Okun's Law,'' after Arthur Okun, who studied it in the 1960s. In essence, Okun's Law says that to reduce the unemployment rate, we need for gross domestic product to grow by more than its long-run average rate of about 3 percent. So far in 2011, the growth rate has been less than 1 percent.
The most volatile component of G.D.P. over the business cycle is spending on investment goods. This spending category includes equipment, software, inventory accumulation, and residential and nonresidential construction. And the recent economic downturn offers this case in point about the problem: From the economy's peak in the fourth quarter of 2007 to the recession's official end, G.D.P. fell by only 5.1 percent, while investment spending fell by a whopping 34 percent.
The subpar recovery has coincided with a historically weak investment recovery. Compare our recent experience with that of the early 1980s, when the nation last experienced a deep economic downturn in which unemployment topped 10 percent. That recession ended in the fourth quarter of 1982. In the subsequent two years, investment spending grew by a total of 54 percent. By contrast, in the first two years of this recovery, it grew by half that amount.
While the sluggish housing market can explain the slow pace of residential investment, it is not the whole story. Business investment has also been weak. Over the last two years, nonresidential fixed investment has grown by only 12 percent, whereas during the two years after the 1982 recession, it grew by 27 percent. Similarly, the narrow category of spending on business equipment and software fell more than twice as much in this recession as it did in the 1982 recession, and it has been slower to recover.
So much for what we know for sure. Now comes the hard part: what to make of these facts.
Advocates of traditional fiscal stimulus often view low levels of investment as a symptom, rather than a cause, of the weak recovery. Businesses are reluctant to invest, they argue, because they lack customers eager to spend. If the government can goose demand by handing out dollars to households short on cash, or by buying goods and services directly, businesses will respond by expanding their own spending as well.
Yet fluctuations in investment spending, rather than being only a passive response, are also one of the driving forces of the booms and busts of the business cycle. The great economist John Maynard Keynes suggested that investment spending is in part determined by the ''animal spirits'' of investors, which he described as ''a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction.'' Recessions occur when optimism turns to pessimism, and businesses are reluctant to place bets on a prosperous future. Recovery occurs when investor confidence returns.
To be sure, both points of view may well be true. The relationship between investment and the overall economy is what an engineer would call a positive feedback loop. Greater business investment would increase hiring, both by those who produce the investment goods and those who buy them. Greater employment would mean more workers taking home paychecks, which in turn would increase the overall demand for goods and services. When businesses saw more customers coming through their doors, they would then increase investment spending yet again.
WHAT can policy makers do to stoke animal spirits and encourage businesses to invest?
One obvious step would be a cut in the taxation of income from corporate capital. According to a 2008 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ''Corporate taxes are found to be most harmful for growth.'' Tax reform that reduced the burden on capital income and shifted it toward consumption would improve prospects for long-run growth and, in so doing, encourage greater investment today.
Yet it would be overly optimistic to think that any single public policy, by itself, could lead to the kind of robust investment spending seen in previous recoveries. Myriad government actions influence the expected future profitability of capital. These include not only policies concerning taxation but also those concerning trade and regulation.
For example, passing the free trade agreement with South Korea, which has languished in Congress more than four years after first being negotiated, would be a step in the right direction. So would reining in the National Labor Relations Board; its decision to block Boeing from opening a nonunion plant in South Carolina may have been hailed by organized labor, but it surely did not hearten investors.
Economists often rely on the convenient shortcut of separating long-run and short-run issues. Recessions are then viewed as short-run problems that require short-run solutions. That approach, however, may be simplistic. Lack of investment spending is a large part of the economy's current difficulties, but capital investments are always made with an eye toward the future.
The best fix for our short-run problems may be to focus on policies that will foster long-run growth as well.

HEADLINE: A Last Sweep of the Gown

BYLINE: By TATIANA BONCOMPAGNI

 BODY:
JANIE BRYANT donned a birdcage veil for her wedding last week in Los Angeles. It was a nod to the retro fashion Ms. Bryant has become known for as the Emmy-award winning costume designer for the television show ''Mad Men.'' Ms. Bryant also wore a strapless white silk chiffon gown she described as ''almost modern Grecian.'' But the dress's maker was a name also synonymous with a bygone era in American glamour -- Priscilla of Boston.
And bygone it now truly is. Last week, David's Bridal, the parent company of Priscilla of Boston, announced it would be shuttering 19 Priscilla of Boston salons and discontinuing all of its 8 higher-end labels, to focus on the growth of its core business. The stores will be closed after Dec. 31. 
''You didn't think of bridal in America without thinking of Priscilla of Boston,'' said Patricia Mears, deputy director of the museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. Ms. Mears noted that the amount of news coverage that Priscilla Kidder, a founder of the company, received for her part in dressing Grace Kelly's bridesmaids in 1956, and the White House brides Luci Baines Johnson, and Tricia Nixon (whose lace dress was scandalously sleeveless), was unusual for that time.
''She represented the high-society style, which she brought to the masses,'' said Vicki Howard, the author of ''Brides, Inc.: American Weddings and the Business of Tradition,'' who credits Ms. Kidder for helping institutionalize the white wedding gown after World War II and, in later years, defending the formal ceremony against anti-establishment, countercultural pressures.
''In the '70s she had a sign on her desk at the factory that said, 'Don't Elope,' '' said Ms. Howard, an associate professor of history at Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y. ''She was a voice of tradition.''
Alexandra Lebenthal wasn't thinking of tradition, or the Priscilla Kidder legacy, when she chose a blush-colored silk-taffeta gown from the design house on a shopping trip to Kleinfeld bridal salon before her 1991 nuptials at the Cosmopolitan Club in Manhattan. ''I didn't care who the designer was, but my mom had gone with me, and she knew exactly who the name was,'' said Ms. Lebenthal, an author and wealth manager. ''To her generation it was well known.''
In 2004, Tanya Boland wore a high-collared lace and crystal-embellished overcoat and strapless satin gown to her candlelit wedding reception at the Fairmont Le Chateau Frontenac in Quebec City. ''What grabbed me was the craftsmanship,'' said Ms. Boland, a mother of two in the Rowayton section of Norwalk, Conn., who first saw the ensemble in a bridal magazine. ''It wasn't your typical wedding dress with a veil.''
But without the force of Ms. Kidder's personality behind the company (she stepped down in 1994 and died in 2003), the label has struggled to maintain its cachet in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
''Celebrity weddings are a huge part of what drives young women to certain designers, and because Priscilla of Boston was more classic, and she wasn't one of the names that celebrities sought out, she doesn't have that status anymore,'' said Susan Allen, an event planner based in Boston.
The economy hasn't helped either. ''The recession has made brides much more focused on their wedding spend,'' said Brian Beitler, chief marketing officer for David's Bridal, who noted that the average wedding dress costs $1,000. (Priscilla of Boston gowns begin at $1,500, and go up to $10,000; samples are currently marked down 40 percent, Mr. Beitler said.)
''I can't believe I am wearing one of the last gowns,'' said Ms. Bryant, who married Peter Yozell, a tour manager who has worked with artists and rock musicians, including Morrissey. ''It makes the gown even more incredible and bittersweet.''
She also wore a lace blouse and multilayered silk miniskirt from the company's Reverie by Melissa Sweet line for the dinner the evening before her wedding. ''I love anything that is not as well known,'' she said.
Maria Iannucci, a legal secretary from Central Islip, N.Y., was ''blown away'' by the news of the brand's Manhasset store's closing via e-mail last week. Ms. Iannucci ordered a drop-waist dress and cathedral-length veil from the company's Jewel line as well as four fig-colored bridesmaid's dresses from the Melissa Sweet line.
''As soon as my fiance proposed, I knew I wasn't going anywhere else,'' she said. ''It makes me sad to think that it's over.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Field Notes column on Sept. 11, about the closing of the Priscilla of Boston bridal salons, described incorrectly the wedding of Julie Nixon Eisenhower, whose gown was by Priscilla. She was married in New York in December 1968, a month before her father, Richard M. Nixon, became president; therefore, she was not a White House bride. (As the column correctly noted, her sister, Tricia, married at the White House, in 1971.)

HEADLINE: This Time, the Downsizing Will Happen Under the Hood

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
WILL Americans buy a $50,000 BMW with 4 cylinders under its hood? We'll soon find out.
Facing tougher fuel economy rules, the German automaker will bring powerful, fuel-efficient 4-cylinder versions of its 5 Series sedan and Z4 roadster to American showrooms in October. At roughly the same time, Mercedes will offer a C250 sedan and coupe, followed by an SLK250 roadster next year, its first 4-cylinder models here since 2005.
For BMW, the 2012 528i sedan and Z4 sDrive 28i will become its first 4-cylinder models in the United States since the 318ti hatchback of 1999. 
To keep Americans from feeling shortchanged, the new 2-liter turbocharged TwinPower engine puts up big numbers: 240 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque, compared with a 255 and 220 respectively for the 3-liter in-line 6 it replaces in the Z4 28i. (The 2011 528i makes 240 horses and 220-pound feet with the same engine).
With that much power -- and smoothness assured by twin counterrotating balance shafts -- the engine is a natural for BMW's smaller, more-affordable models, including a redesigned 3 Series sedan that goes on sale next year.
BMW estimates the engine will deliver about 15 percent better fuel economy. Given the 2011 528i's E.P.A. rating of 32 m.p.g. on the highway, the 4-cylinder version could top 35 -- better than any member of today's class of midsize luxury sport sedans, including cars like the 32 m.p.g. Infiniti M Hybrid.
For American luxury buyers raised on brawny V-8s, the typically wimpy and noisy 4-cylinder engines have often seemed the equivalent of Soylent Green: fake and unappetizing, perhaps even part of a government plot. Expensive 4-cylinder cars have generally failed to impress American buyers.
But carmakers say that vastly improved engine designs and higher fuel prices are rewriting consumer expectations. Audi, especially, has shown that luxury buyers will happily accept a modern 4-cylinder if it performs like a 6. In its best-selling model, the A4 sedan, a 2-liter turbo 4 proved so popular that Audi dropped its optional V-6.
BMW says the new 4 -- despite 15 fewer peak horsepower than the Z4's 6 -- pumps out more horsepower and torque at all engine speeds up to 6,000 r.p.m. BMW estimates the new 2012 Z4, aided by the addition of an 8-speed automatic, will be 0.4 seconds quicker in the 0-60 m.p.h. run.
The new wave of 4-cylinder engines will also hasten the end of model names that indicate which engine is under the hood. For BMW, for example, a 330i historically described a 3 Series car with a 3-liter engine. But the 2012 5 Series with its 2-liter 4 will continue as the 528i, and not be renamed the 520i.
It's easy to conclude that the real reason is marketing: for decades, a higher number meant a bigger, more-powerful engine that could command a higher price and bestow greater prestige. But as engines downsize, BMW fans might be put off by a car named 520i that costs more than a 528i.
In fact, both the 2012 528i and Z4 28i will cost about $2,200 more than 2011's 6-cylinder versions, at a respective $47,575 and $49,525. A BMW spokesman defended the prices, citing improved technology, performance and mileage.

HEADLINE: Robin Steinberg, David Feige

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Robin Gail Steinberg and David Lawrence Feige were married Saturday evening at the Bronx Borough Courthouse. Rabbi Marc Margolius officiated.
Ms. Steinberg, 54, is keeping her name. She is the executive director of the Bronx Defenders, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal representation and of which Mr. Feige was the trial chief until April 2005.
The bride graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and received a law degree from New York University. She is the daughter of Pat Allen of Santa Monica, Calif., and the late Richard Steinberg, who lived in Manhattan. The bride's mother retired as a human resources director in Santa Monica for Schwarzkopf & Henkel, a German maker of home care and personal care products. 
Mr. Feige, 45, is a writer and a consulting producer in Hollywood for ''The Firm,'' a dramatic television series that is to be broadcast later this year or in early 2012 on NBC. He was a creator of the television series ''Raising the Bar,'' which ran for two seasons on TNT.
He graduated from the University of Chicago and received a law degree with honors from the University of Wisconsin. He is the son of Ruth Neubauer of Denver and Edgar L. Feige of Madison, Wis. The bridegroom's mother is a social worker in private practice in Denver. His father is an emeritus professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
Ms. Steinberg and Mr. Feige met in September 1995, at the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, where she was the deputy director in charge of hiring and Mr. Feige, who had worked as a public defender in Brooklyn, went to interview for a job.
Their meeting didn't go very well.
''He was so big and brash, the committee didn't want to touch him at first,'' recalled Ms. Steinberg, who was married to someone else at the time. ''But he was also so smart and had such a deep commitment to social justice, I recognized immediately that this guy was the kind of warrior anyone would be lucky to have standing beside them in court.''
So, Mr. Feige got the job.
Soon after, they were working side by side until Ms. Steinberg left to found the Bronx Defenders. Mr. Feige was the first staff lawyer she hired.
''I remember we took a walk through Marcus Garvey Park back when it was still strewn with needles and crack vials, and Robin asked if I would join this new office in the Bronx,'' said Mr. Feige, who was single but dating at the time. ''The truth, though, is I would have followed her anywhere.''
Ms. Steinberg said, ''He would call me after dates, and ask me whether, based on what had happened, I thought the woman in question was girlfriend material.''
In April 2005, Mr. Feige left to write a book, ''Indefensible: One Lawyer's Journey Into the Inferno of American Justice.''
''I knew that leaving the office and my identity as a public defender was going to be hard,'' he said. ''What I wasn't prepared for was how much I missed being with Robin every day.''
As the book propelled Mr. Feige into a new career in Hollywood, Ms. Steinberg's marriage was falling apart.
They maintained their friendship, but their relationship took a serious turn in December 2006, when Mr. Feige asked her out after a night of dancing at a holiday party. By now, Ms. Steinberg was divorced.
''After so many years of being friends and colleagues, I wasn't really sure David would ever be 'relationship material,' and his spending so much time in L.A. didn't help,'' she said.
Mr. Feige offered this take on the situation: ''Truthfully, I think it only worked because I was away so much. It gave Robin the time she needed to adjust.''
In February, he proposed under a full moon in the Sahara Desert. VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

HEADLINE: Getting Here From There

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
On that day -- the Sept. 11 that requires no year -- the sun set on crushed buildings in a reimagined world. It set on a recontoured skyline and a haunted city. The equations of life no longer worked. That's the way it seemed.
A decade now since the tall towers fell in New York and the Pentagon was gashed open and a diverted plane dropped into a field near Shanksville, Pa., people know where they were when they heard the unheard-of.
They were a school bus driver grabbing a coffee and a doughnut at a Dunkin' Donuts in Biddeford, Me. They were driving to work in Pasadena, Md., sitting at a red light on Crain Highway, the radio humming. They were setting up for another busy lunch at a restaurant in Panama City, Fla.
They were on the way to teach music in Spring Park, Minn. They were getting a car loan in Butte, Mont., chewing over the rate. They were about to fill a lower-molar cavity in Kew Gardens, Queens. 
People repeated the same thing: My life will be changed forever.
It was called the saddest day in American history. It was called the worst day in American history.
The memories remain fresh and overwhelming. The trembling ground, the wall of smoke that shut off the sun, the choking dust, the ghastliness of the jumping people -- the grievous loss of life and the epic acts of heroism. Exhausted phone lines that wouldn't connect to those who might have answers. People listening to car radios, reports of more planes in the sky, fears of more killers to come.
Also, the aching days and weeks and months after.
In Lower Manhattan, cordoned off with sawhorses for blocks around the smoldering World Trade Center, the odious scent that persisted for months and wafted through the city. Was it burning tires? Unsettled souls?
Residents moving about in dust masks. The rats dislodged from their homes. The flatbed trucks and garbage trucks panting back and forth, loading the seemingly limitless detritus.
People buying parachutes and canoes, a way to get out the next time. Buying bulletproof vests and ammunition. The prolonged hunt for remains. Funeral after funeral.
And Gary Condit and Chandra Levy and the past tumble of news excised from the nation's front pages, because the news -- all the news -- was 9/11, everything twisting and turning out of that day.
The attacks unhinged the lives of families -- the fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, children of the nearly 3,000 people who did not return home. There was also more nuanced, distanced loss: A man lost two former Navy shipmates from back in the day. A man in England lost two online Scrabble partners.
Paul Simon said he didn't know if he could ever complete another album. A woman wrote on a remembrance site that she regretted that she had had children, that she had brought their innocence into a world no longer fathomable to her.
But there has been a chasm between expectations and reality. The prophecy of more attacks on the United States has not been the case, not yet at least. Bumbling attempts got close -- involving underwear and a shoe and a 1993 Nissan Pathfinder -- but the actuality has been that terrorist acts on American soil in the succeeding years have been, as always, largely homegrown.
So many things were expected to be different that have not been. Time passes, and passes some more. Exigencies of living hammer away impatiently. People -- most of them, at least -- began to become themselves. New York, which by its nature accommodates so much, was willing to absorb 9/11 and keep moving.
Already we have fifth graders not yet born on that day. The people known as ''Wall Street,'' celebrated as martyrs and heroes in the days after the attacks, have been vilified for boundless greed. We are back as a nation of ideological divides and uncivilized political intransigence. Bridges fall, roads crack.
What has stuck? Shedding shoes and getting patted down at the airport. Navigating barriers to enter big buildings -- smile for the camera. Every so often, the police rummaging through selected bags at the subway station. All this information being collected on who we are and what we do, snooping that is more accepted than objected to. A nagging suspicion of Muslims. A pair of distant wars that refuse easy endings, with a price tag of $1.3 trillion and climbing. The certainty that any full reckoning must include the cost of shortchanging the country's future.
An underlying sense of the sinister out there somewhere. See something, say something.
The killing of Osama bin Laden has not closed the book. Nor has 10 years.
Yet a lot crowds into 3,600 days in a speeded-up, interwoven world. For most people, the influence of 9/11 on day-to-day life is felt much less intensely than the arrival of Facebook and Twitter. Or the eruption of nagging, pontificating voices on cable TV. Or the suffocating recession.
Ultimately, each person attaches an individual meaning to 9/11, if possible. Outside of the families of the victims, most people's lives may not present themselves as remarkably different. But there is residue, lingering wisps of Sept. 11.
A Birthday to Hate
Angela Landon, sitting in her house in Bangor, Me., that day, feeding a bottle to her 10-month-old. Pregnant with the third of what would be four children, all girls, and her mother calling. The terrible news. On her birthday.
''My mother used to call me every year and say, 'What a beautiful day to be born,' '' she said. ''After 9/11, what was I supposed to say? 'It's a beautiful day to die'?''
She hated her birthday for a while. A tiny price in the scheme of a wicked day, but a price paid.
The year after, Ms. Landon had no appetite for celebration, but her family insisted, even dressed up as the Wiggles, the Australian children's entertainers. ''They tried to make me feel good,'' she said. ''But I didn't feel good.''
She doesn't hate her birthday anymore. Last year, on her 40th, it was everyone out to Chuck E. Cheese's, and a merry time. But she gets emotional. ''Ten years later, it's really hard,'' she said. ''My little ones don't understand yet. They know my birthday is 9/11, and they know something happened on 9/11 and I've explained it, but they don't get it.''
For the first couple of years, whenever she had to display her ID to cash a check or give her birth date over the phone to the bank, people would suck in their breath. That doesn't happen now. ''It's kind of out of sight, out of mind,'' she said. ''And that bothers me.''
Her oldest daughter, Erika, 17, got on the phone, and she said it was a hard story to tell and a hard story to hear. What did Sept. 11 mean to her?
''I grew up in a proud-to-be-American household,'' she said. ''So I love my country. It was scary. I remember getting off the bus and my mother running and hugging me. My friends don't talk about it now. It's not a big ordeal here. But it's always my mother's birthday, so it's always, always there.''
Civic Life Even Nastier
People shake their heads when they think back.
Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of education and history at New York University, said: ''I remember people saying, 'We're all going to be New Yorkers.' People said we're all going to be serious. That's hilarious to talk about. Reality TV was in its infancy. There was no 'Jersey Shore.' Imagine if it did spawn a new seriousness.''
He said what we all see: ''Civic life is even more frayed, even more polarized, even nastier.''
Dalton Conley, dean for the social sciences at N.Y.U., said, ''I think the ironic thing is, the area less affected in terms of daily life and fundamental change is actually New York City, the epicenter of the event. Our own university expected we would fall off the map.''
Did he know anyone who had taken the narrative of that day and done something really bold, gone the distance? He said he did. The father of a friend of his daughter, a Wall Street man who went to war.
Crossing the Line
Out of the shock and the ruin, Gerard Decatrel tried to imagine New York's tomorrow, the twists it might take, because there had to be something transformative. Imagination, in those days, could take you a lot of places.
He worked at Morgan Stanley in Times Square, a trader of foreign exchange options. He was 30. He lived in Manhattan, a family man.
As he constructed outcomes, he decided there were some he could accept and those he couldn't.
''I drew a line,'' he said. ''I could bear it if New York became like Jerusalem and there were conventional attacks going on all the time. But if there were any biological or chemical attacks, I said I would join the military.''
He couldn't entirely explain the impulse. He didn't know anyone who had perished in the towers. Taking up arms would mean entering an alternate space, leaving behind a wife, a 4-year-old daughter, a 1-year-old son.
''I don't know, but I took it personally,'' he said. ''I'd been a New Yorker all my life.''
That fall, the mysterious anthrax attacks visited the wrung-out and quaking city. There it was. His line had been crossed. He joined the Marines. Morgan Stanley said it understood; go, and his job would be waiting for his safe return. His wife said all right. He didn't know then that she was humoring him. She thought they would reject him because he was too old.
He had to commit to training and six years in the service, eight years of his life altogether. He moved to Virginia, Florida, California.
And then, indeed, Iraq for three seven-month deployments as a pilot of a Cobra attack helicopter. He flew more than 500 missions. He shot at the enemy and the enemy shot back, but ''they weren't very good shots,'' he said. ''And they didn't have the best weapons.''
The weather, he felt, was the biggest danger, the blinding sandstorms that could reduce visibility to zero and yet you flew, flew on hope. He felt old -- almost everyone else was so young. Two pilots in his squad were killed.
But he made the sort of permanent friends you made in no other context.
He was discharged from the Marines last September. He is back in his city. He works again for Morgan Stanley, trading options once more, battling the cranky markets.
He had done something. He had served. Everything adds up to something. He would say he was different.
''I feel I have more confidence and a different perspective,'' he said. ''Something goes wrong in the market and everyone's freaking out. Well, I'm not. No one's dying. The market can't freak me out.''
Reshaping History
George W. Bush understood 9/11 as a declaration of war. To others, it was an immense hate crime. Either way, it catapulted the country into what seems a permanent state of war.
David Blight, a history professor at Yale University, observed that an event's meaning is always made by the subsequent history. ''That's how memory works,'' he said. ''Memory is always about the present.''
He added: ''That innocence that we live above history, that we're not vulnerable, that we control our own fate, got a big, big hit. I think this still lingers. But I think we are pleasantly recycling that.''
Which is not to say the day didn't leave obligations, impose debts some people felt they had to pay.
Opening Tiny Doors
The sorrow needed to go somewhere. There were places to receive it, online receptacles, and the flutter of contributions arrived from all over. On Sept. 19, 2001, one came from Colleen Casey of Bolingbrook, Ill. She expressed the accepted condition that many people felt: ''I do not expect my life to ever be as it was before.''
She offered up a poem, ''I Needed the Quiet,'' that she had discovered when she was 14 and her father died of a heart attack. It helped her; maybe it could help others.
And she wrote, ''I will try to live my life better.''
Americans had died by going to work. She felt she had to earn their sacrifice.
Now Ms. Casey lives in Addison, Ill., a materials license reviewer for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Same job, new home. She is 54 and single.
Had she lived her life ''better?''
You don't remold yourself easily. She knew that. But there were tiny doors that she could open. She was shy. But she began to do more, not be moony about her own troubles, go to places she hadn't gone, feed the fires.
She mentioned participating in a diabetes walk, another for a homeless shelter, one for suicide prevention.
She started doing water aerobics, wanting to improve her health.
''I've tried to spend more time listening, really listening to people I come across in daily life,'' she said. ''People need to be validated and heard.''
She has had her scrapes with adversity -- two bad car crashes, her Subarus totaled. She bought a third Subaru. One had been white, one blue and now she was on red, completing the colors of her country's flag.
She tries to be a little kinder. Now she gives money to those professing need, like men she spots at roadway intersections. The ones squatting there with the hand-scribbled signs: ''Homeless'' or ''Help.'' It was just something she got in her head to do. She always has a spare $20 and bottled water in the car to hand over.
''Although some of my friends think I'm nuts for doing this,'' she said, ''I've never, ever had any kind of adverse outcome. Just gratitude.''
She said: ''We're all trying to slog through life together. I'm trying to do a little more. That's all I can do.''
'We're Wired to Cope'
The day burrowed into the mind, and who knew how deep and how long it would stay. But deep and long. That's what so many accepted. People slack on couches, struggling to push the ache out of them.
But the lasting psychological toll, studies suggested, was nowhere as bad as many experts predicted. The preponderance of people, they got on.
''I think we are innately resilient,'' said George A. Bonanno, professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University, who studies grief and trauma. ''The norm is to be resilient.''
In part, this is because we get so much practice, from less singular but still powerful traumas like divorce or disease. ''We're wired to cope with traumatic events,'' he said.
So 33 Chilean miners buried deep in the ground can come out of it with their sanity. People can watch a mudslide scoop up their home. They can see tall towers fall and keep going.
''Human history is full of tragedy, and within these tragedies there is room for growth,'' said Grady Bray, a disaster psychologist based in Texas. ''There is no growth in human beings without struggle. I'm convinced of that.''
A 5-Year-Old's Premonition
Sasha Vaccaro finished cooking camp -- shish kebab today, lots of fun -- and was free for the afternoon. He slid into a seat at the Starbucks across the street from his Upper East Side home, sipped Passion Tea Lemonade. He was dressed cool, in a T-shirt and shorts. He is 15.
Sasha has a complicated life. He suffers from depression that can be crippling. He has been given diagnoses of aspects of Asperger syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. His younger brother is autistic. His parents are divorced.
He explained some things he copes with. ''If I touch my body on one side, I have to touch it on the other,'' he said. ''If I have an itch, I have to scratch on the other side too. But I've gotten better at it. I try to ride out the wave.''
He overreacts to criticism. When he hears sad things, he gets very sad.
His Sept. 11 was this. He was in kindergarten four blocks from the trade center, playing the tambourine in music class. His father clutched him in his arms, carrying him away as the second plane of the suicidal fanatics sliced into the flank of the tower. He watched both buildings aflame. His father cried; so did he.
''Before, I thought the world was perfect and everyone was nice,'' he said. ''It's when I stopped believing in God.''
The World Trade towers had been of outsize importance to the family. They used to go down there and lie flat on their backs, their feet grazing the base of a tower, and look up at the majestic presence.
What does 9/11 do to someone a decade later? Everyone has complications, and how do you filter them out and assign one cause to one effect? How would you ever do it in a boy with so much going on?
Year after year, Sasha didn't talk about 9/11.
Then in March, he wrote a graphic novel to satisfy a school assignment to relate a pivotal moment. It was his 9/11 day, from morning pancakes to music class to calamity and tears. And also his sixth-sense moment: At school he had a premonition that something awful was imminent in the towers. He looked toward them and said to his father, ''Daddy, twin tower alert! Twin tower alert!''
In getting it out, he thought, maybe he was finally confronting what no child should have to see. The graphic novel got a good grade. The class was absorbed.
On all fronts, he has been doing better of late. Therapy has helped his mass of issues. His medications are being cut back. His last school year was his best. He wants to be a neurosurgeon or a veterinarian. He had a gecko once.
He has not been back to ground zero. Maybe when it's done, he'll go see how it came out.
Down at the site, things were happening, 3,000 workers a day -- the equal of the dead -- belatedly putting together the replacements for the vanished buildings. A sandwich-board peddler promoted $22-per-ounce cash for unwanted sterling silver. The tourists jostled past, peering through the fence, watching steel sprout on a land of ghosts.
That day was 10 years ago, and one day it will be 20 years ago and 50 and 100, sinking further into history.
What does 9/11 mean?
Sasha wanted to think on that for a moment. His face tightened into deep thought. ''I honestly don't know,'' he said. ''I can't understand why people would do that. I don't know what to say. It's just sadness. That's all it will ever be. Lots and lots and lots of sadness.''

HEADLINE: Rich Tax Breaks Bolster Makers Of Video Games

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
The United States government offers tax incentives to companies pursuing medical breakthroughs, urban redevelopment and alternatives to fossil fuels.
It also provides tax breaks for a company whose hit video game this year was the gory Dead Space 2, which challenges players to advance through an apocalyptic battlefield by killing space zombies.
Those tax incentives -- a collection of deductions, write-offs and credits mostly devised for other industries in other eras -- now make video game production one of the most highly subsidized businesses in the United States, says Calvin H. Johnson, who has worked at the Treasury Department and is now a tax professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
Because video game makers straddle the lines between software development, the entertainment industry and online retailing, they can combine tax breaks in ways that companies like Netflix and Adobe cannot. Video game developers receive such a rich assortment of incentives that even oil companies have questioned why the government should subsidize such a mature and profitable industry whose main contribution is to create amusing and sometimes antisocial entertainment. 
For example, Electronic Arts of Redwood City, Calif., shipped more than two million copies of Dead Space 2 in the game's first week on the market this year. It shows a total of $1.2 billion in global profits the last five years using an accounting method that management says captures its operating profits.
But largely because of deferred revenue, deductions for executive stock options and a variety of accounting requirements, the company officially reports a net loss for the period. And the company reports that it paid out $98 million in cash for taxes worldwide in those years.
Neither corporations nor the government make tax returns public, and the information most companies disclose in their regulatory filings is insufficient to determine how much they pay in federal taxes and how that compares to the official United States corporate rate of 35 percent.
All told, the federal government gave $123 billion in tax incentives to corporations in 2010, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, with breaks for groups and people as diverse as Nascar track owners, mohair producers, hedge fund managers, chicken farmers, automakers and oil companies.
Many tax policy analysts say the breaks for the video game industry -- whose domestic sales of $15 billion a year now exceed those of the music business -- are a vivid example of a tax system that defies common sense. Most times, subsidies begin as a way to nurture a fledgling industry that will not be profitable for years or to encourage a business activity deemed to have a broad benefit to society, like reducing pollution or improving public health.
But it's a lot easier to create a tax break than to eliminate it. That leaves a generous assortment of tax incentives available to all types of companies, like Electronic Arts, with skilled accounting departments.
Electronic Arts has also lobbied successfully for more tax assistance. The architect of the company's strategies in recent years was Glen A. Kohl, a tax lawyer colorful enough to publicly compare himself to Bruce Springsteen and to joke in the pages of The Wall Street Journal that his dog, Rubin, shared the name of the Treasury secretary under whom he served (Robert E. Rubin).
After working in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration, Mr. Kohl entered the private sector and became head of E.A.'s tax department in 2004, leading the company as it aggressively lobbied for a federal tax break on domestic production and set up a matrix of offshore subsidiaries, many in low-tax countries.
As a result, the company with the defiant sales slogan, ''Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2,'' in effect gets financial help from moms and other United States taxpayers to reduce its federal tax bill.
Company officials say they have no qualms about taking all the tax breaks legally available to them. To do otherwise would be like a consumer ''insisting on paying full price during a store sale,'' wrote Jeff Brown, a company spokesman. Even E.A.'s competitors acknowledge that its tax strategies aren't particularly aggressive compared with others in the industry.
Furthermore, Electronic Arts officials say that in recent years the company has paid a substantial portion of its profits in taxes, but declined to discuss details of its financial reports.
Several tax experts noted that one of the company's biggest tax advantages is a tool available to all companies, a deduction related to the stock gains on options exercised by its executives. (Tax practitioners also said that the company's losses, under generally accepted accounting principles, provided the most meaningful picture and reflected the standard approach used by other companies.)
Industry advocates say that without these incentives the United States would forfeit its technological edge -- and the 32,000 direct jobs in the gaming industry -- to countries like Canada, which offers video game developers even greater tax subsidies.
''Software and high-tech industries are the brain trust of the U.S.,'' said Shane T. Frank, chief operating officer of Alliantgroup, a consulting firm that helps video game companies and other businesses take advantage of the tax credit for research and development. ''We can't afford to lose that knowledge and those high-paying jobs to India or anywhere else.''
Trying to Lure Jobs
One reason Electronic Arts and other video game companies have a bounty of tax incentives that other industries envy is that elected officials from across the political spectrum find it hard to resist offering incentives to encourage technological research -- and jobs.
When the tax code was rewritten in 1954 -- nearly 20 years before the first commercially successful video game was released -- Congress included a new break allowing companies to deduct all laboratory-based research and experimentation costs immediately. Part of the intention was to simplify the tax code. But with the cold war and nuclear arms race making Americans fearful that the country's technological edge was eroding, Daniel Reed, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, also promised the tax break would indirectly bolster national security by stimulating ''the search for new products and new inventions upon which the future economic and military strength of our nation depends.''
In 1969, the I.R.S. expanded that tax break to allow companies to deduct the cost of software development, which was a small part of a business that was then dominated by bulky mainframe computers. When the video game industry sprouted in the early 1970s, game developers reaped substantial tax savings because most of their costs were for software development.
Electronic Arts, founded in 1982, has since become one of the world's dominant video game companies -- producing popular titles like SimCity, FIFA soccer, Harry Potter and Madden NFL -- and has benefited mightily from that tax incentive.
The company's software development costs -- including salaries for the designers -- have totaled nearly $6 billion over the last five years, and the company says it deducted all but a small amount of those expenses immediately. Companies that produce movies or compact discs, by contrast, face tighter restrictions which often require them to spread out the deduction on most production costs over a number of years. While video game makers have often compared themselves to movie companies when seeking tax incentives, the game developers' ability to write off the vast majority of their development costs immediately gives them a substantial financial advantage over other entertainment companies in taxes and cash flow.
Video game companies also get other research-related breaks. In 1981, as Americans worried that Japan's growing dominance in the auto business would be followed by a decline of the high-tech industry in the United States, Congress added another research and development credit, this time specifically for companies that increased their R.& D. spending from the previous year. The hope was that by encouraging companies to invest more in research, the private sector might create the next Bell Laboratories and inspire the kind of technological breakthroughs that benefit society as a whole.
Within a few years, the credit was being claimed by businesses with little technological background -- fast-food restaurants, hair stylists and fashion designers. So Congress tried to restrict what research would qualify. The credit was denied for social science research and marketing. The narrowest definition, proposed by the Clinton administration, was to allow the credit only for research that produced an actual innovation, but that measure met determined opposition from business lobbyists. By the time the Treasury Department ruled in 2002, an appointee of President George W. Bush decided to drop it.
''It seemed as though it would be impossible to enforce,'' said Pamela F. Olson, then the assistant secretary for tax policy, and now a tax lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. ''Because you couldn't be certain that someone wouldn't come back later and challenge things, by saying that what seemed like an innovation at the time had actually been discovered before.''
The failed attempts to restrict the R.& D. credit to basic research have been a boon for video game companies. Even when companies are merely creating new versions of existing games -- conducting research that would have little value to anyone but themselves -- their development processes usually involve enough experimental uncertainty to qualify for the tax break.
During the last five years, Electronic Arts has claimed tens of millions in tax savings from research and development credits for its various games, according to the company's regulatory filings. (Company officials declined to specify how much of that total came from the federal government.)
At the same time, the I.R.S. and the United States Tax Court have denied the credit for some projects that would have benefited the community as well as the companies receiving it. In 2009, for instance, the federal tax court denied Union Carbide's attempt to claim a research and development credit for its project to reduce the pollutants released from the smokestacks of a refinery in Louisiana. Union Carbide failed to meet the experimental threshold for the credit, though video game makers often seem to have little trouble meeting the requirement.
Video game industry officials say that by improving technology, they are indirectly helping society at large.
Dean Zerbe, national managing director at Alliantgroup, said that the military had used some video game technology to train soldiers and pilots. Electronic Arts said it donated some games to the military, schools and charities.
Even those who support subsidies for technological research complain that the current research and development credit is woefully designed -- favoring big companies over start-ups and often subsidizing businesses for research they would have done anyway.
Michael D. Rashkin, author of ''Practical Guide to Research and Development Tax Incentives,'' said that the video game industry had failed to name a technological breakthrough that had helped anyone beyond its shareholders, employees or customers.
''The research credit benefits the wrong companies and encourages the wrong kind of research,'' said Mr. Rashkin, a tax expert and executive at Marvell Technology, a company based in Santa Clara, Calif. ''By diverting funding and attention from where it could be most useful, the credit is hobbling American innovation.''
Yet, given the sharp decline in American manufacturing jobs over the last half century, subsidies for research and development still have wide support. The Obama administration has proposed making the research and development tax credit permanent (it has been renewed every two years since 1981), and expanding it, at a cost of more than $100 billion over the next decade.
Looking for More
Electronic Arts has not been content to merely collect the many benefits from existing tax breaks. Mr. Kohl, who had an extensive background in mergers and acquisitions law, arrived at the company in 2004, the same year Congress passed a domestic production deduction that was intended to cut taxes on companies that export. When President George W. Bush signed the law in October, it listed an assortment of industries eligible for the break, including sound recordings and computer software, but did not specify video games.
Electronic Arts paid $60,000 early the next year to hire a prominent Washington tax lobbying firm. Soon after the law was signed, its lobbyist, Jonathan Talisman of Capitol Tax Partners, was granted a meeting with the Treasury Department's deputy assistant secretary of tax policy -- the same office Mr. Kohl once held -- to ask that the deduction be extended to video game companies and the revenues they earned from online subscriptions. When the I.R.S. issued its final regulations, video games and their online revenues were specifically cited as qualifying for the deduction. That deduction last year equaled 9 percent of its production costs, offering E.A. significant tax savings.
Company officials point out that the deduction is available to a wide range of industries. ''The credit is not specific to video games,'' said Mr. Brown, the spokesman. ''It's designed to encourage any domestic manufacturing in the United States -- from soft drinks to steel, to movies, music and newspapers.'' During Mr. Kohl's seven years at the company, Electronic Arts also became more aggressive about assigning its intellectual property offshore, a move that often reduces a company's tax bill. Mr. Kohl, who declined to be interviewed, is now running the tax department at Amazon, which is leading the legal battle by Internet retailers who want to avoid collecting state sales taxes from customers.
In 2003, before joining Electronic Arts, Mr. Kohl co-authored a widely-cited proposal urging the federal government to crack down on corporate tax avoidance, warning that ''the tax shelter problem is simply too detrimental to the tax system not to act.'' As head of tax at Electronic Arts, he became a noted expert in using foreign subsidiaries to legally, and sharply, cut a corporation's United States tax bill. As a co-chairman of the Silicon Valley Tax Directors Group, he also moderated a seminar in 2010 that showed technology companies how to use offshore subsidiaries to reassign the licensing of their intellectual property and, in some cases, reduce their effective federal tax rate substantially from 35 percent.
Electronic Arts has more than 50 overseas subsidiaries, according to its recent regulatory filings, many in low-tax countries like Bermuda, Singapore and Mauritius. The company has also accumulated more than $1.3 billion in profits offshore, where it will not be taxed by the United States unless it is brought back into the country.
Company officials say its overseas activities are not an attempt to avoid United States taxes and instead reflect how much of its business takes place in other countries. ''E.A. is a global company with a majority of our customers and roughly 50 percent of our revenue generated outside of the United States,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Naturally we hire, build facilities, copyright our trademarks, invest and pay taxes in countries outside of the U.S.''
Jockeying for Developers
As Congress and the Obama administration wrestle with the next round of budget cuts this fall, and a possible overhaul of the tax code, they will determine whether the types of subsidies offered to E.A. and other corporations are worth the billions in forgone revenue annually to the Treasury. While Britain and some nations in the European Union have been paring back their tax subsidies for game developers, Canada has been trying to lure them and their jobs from below the border. In 2008, Ontario paid one game company a subsidy of more than $321,000 for each job to relocate from the United States. More recently, Montreal persuaded the game company THQ to relocate 800 production jobs there, closing studios in New York and Phoenix, with a rich package of incentives.
E.A. has 750 employees in Montreal, where all video game companies receive a tax credit equal to 37.5 percent of their payroll, and has announced plans to hire more there. Over all, 4,500 of Electronic Arts' 7,600 employees are in the United States.
There are signs that more tax breaks may be in store for game manufacturers. States have been offering an escalating collection of incentives to try to attract the companies -- more than 20 states now offer video game developers tax breaks to cover their wages, development and manufacturing costs.
Several recent studies have raised doubts about the effectiveness of subsidies offered by state and local governments, and Michigan this year reduced its breaks for game developers. But Texas officials say its tax breaks for game developers are more beneficial than those given other businesses, in part because the average salaries in the industry exceed $80,000 a year.
Game developers are pushing for more. John S. Riccitiello, the chief executive of Electronic Arts, was among the business leaders who successfully lobbied the City of San Francisco to drop its payroll tax last year to help retain social media companies like Zynga, maker of FarmVille and other games. The video game industry's trade group, the Entertainment Software Association, this year recruited 39 members of Congress to form the E-caucus, which will advocate for legislation to benefit game developers. Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas who sits on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said that the caucus has not asked for tax breaks.
But industry officials say they eventually hope to persuade Congress to make video game companies eligible for the federal tax breaks now available to film and television producers. Michael D. Gallagher, chief executive of the software group, said that the industry would not push for the breaks now, given the nation's budget problems, but might do so later.
''It certainly is a worthwhile policy goal,'' Mr. Gallagher said.

HEADLINE: Tunnel Edges Forward, Tribute to Stimulus Bill

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
On Thursday morning, miners deep in the fourth bore of the Caldecott Tunnel spent 10 grueling hours drilling six feet farther into the bedrock.
''The rock's hard as hell,'' Bill Monahan, the general superintendent, yelled over the rumbling machinery. ''It's dusty, too, but hey, it's a miner's life.''
Still, as Mr. Monahan and everyone else on the job site likes to say with a laugh, ''we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.'' Crews now have less than 600 feet to go before they can see the light of day. 
The $391 million project, financed in part with $179.6 million from the Recovery Act, has also offered a ray of hope to Democrats under attack for the failures of the 2009 stimulus package. One such failure was the high-profile bankruptcy filing by Solyndra, a solar company in Fremont that had received federal loan guarantees. President Obama did not use the word ''stimulus'' once on Thursday in his speech promoting his new $447 billion jobs plan.
''It's like 'stimulus' has become a dirty word,'' said Bruce Cain, director of the University of California Washington Center. ''People have glommed onto the Solyndra story, and Republicans have glommed onto the unemployment rate.''
Top Democrats like Senator Barbara Boxer make it a point to visit the gaping maw of the fourth bore. The project is being built to ease congestion on Highway 24 at the Caldecott Tunnel, between Oakland and Orinda, where some 160,000 cars pass every day. It will add two lanes to the existing six that cut through the Berkeley Hills and is expected to be completed in late 2013.
Mrs. Boxer was there last month promoting the tunnel, which was projected to create 4,500 jobs. Last quarter, the dig created 106 construction jobs on the actual site, according to Recovery.gov, but a CalTrans spokeswoman, Ivy Morrison, said that did not tell the whole story.
''There is a ripple effect,'' said Ms. Morrison, who declined to offer a jobs figure for the project. ''There's truckers and equipment builders, and the deli in Orinda has never been as busy before.''
The work in the tunnel, which began in earnest just over a year ago, is more dangerous than work in the average tunnel. Safety regulators declared it ''gassy'' from the start because of the naturally occurring methane gas in the guts of the Berkeley Hills. Anything that could spark an explosion, from cellphones to lighters, is banned from the inside of the tunnel.
Because of sections of precariously weak rock, miners must use what is called the New Austrian Tunneling Method, meaning that crews dig just short distances before taking measures to reinforce the tunnel.
On Thursday, CalTrans gave a rare tour of the tunnel for members of the news media.
Inside the cavernous project, it was cool and dark, lighted only by overhead lamps and the miners' headlamps. Green laser beams shot through the darkness along the walls to guide the diggers. The ground was covered in wet gray muck. The concrete combined with the rock dust and diesel gave the tunnel a distinct smell that you could taste.
The digging machine is called a roadheader, a 130-ton instrument that looks like a metal brontosaurus with a spiked metal rotating head for grinding rock. It had just finished work as the tour began.
Next, a remote-controlled robot on wheels sprayed a special quick-drying concrete over the newly bored section. With another machine, the miners then drive long steel dowels into the tunnel walls to reinforce them before proceeding.
Now 70 years old, Mr. Monahan, a construction manager for the lead contractor, Tutor-Saliba, has been working on tunnels since he helped dig a Detroit sewer in 1965.
He said he traveled around the country to work on big tunnel projects, taking loyal workers and his family with him. And he had to say it loudly to be heard above the rumble of the machines, the humming of the ventilation system and the continual clanging of pumps that whisk water out of the tunnel.
Even with the potential dangers of the dig, workers have remained relatively safe, with only a few minor injuries. Gas levels are continually monitored, and all the subterranean machinery was specially retrofitted so it would not give off sparks.
But Mr. Cain, the political scientist, said that even though the Caldecott Tunnel appeared to be a positive effect of the federal stimulus package, it would not do much to help President Obama.
''Because of where it is, it's probably not going to be as valuable a project,'' Mr. Cain said. ''He needs the Caldecott equivalent in Pennsylvania or Ohio or Indiana or any of those swing states.''

HEADLINE: We're Rich! (In Nature.)

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
AT a time when Americans fret about terrorism and war and are afflicted by the worst economic downturn in 70 years, let's embrace a remarkable treasure possessed by every citizen of our country.
It doesn't count in our net worth, but its value is incalculable: our national parks, national forests and other public lands. I spent a chunk of the summer doing some ultralight backpacking along the Pacific Crest Trail out West -- my ambition when I grow up is to hike the full length of the trail, from Mexico to Canada -- and the trip allowed my family to relish some of America's finest real estate, without spending a dime.
America's most valuable assets aren't controlled by hedge funds; they're shared by us all. Gaps between rich and poor have been growing, but our national lands are a rare space of utter democracy: the poorest citizen gets resplendent views that even a billionaire is not allowed to buy. 
Roll out a ground sheet, lay down your sleeping bag and the vistas are yours. Particularly in a grim post-9/11 era -- an age shaped by anxiety and suspicion -- there is something profoundly therapeutic about reconnecting with simplicity and nature.
After one 20-mile day in August of trudging mostly upward, sometimes struggling over huge snowfields, we arrived exhausted at Thielsen Creek in central Oregon. The majesty of the scene -- snow-clad Mount Thielsen soaring overhead, the creek burbling below us, no one within miles -- took our breath away.
Yet if these national lands are one of America's greatest triumphs, two additional points must be noted.
First, they are under threat. Republicans have proposed opening more than 50 million acres of federal lands to logging, grazing and other uses. They argue that this would allow responsible ''multiple use'' of lands now locked up as wilderness. Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary under President Bill Clinton, has described the Republican bill as ''the most radical, overreaching attempt to dismantle the architecture of our public land laws that has been proposed in my lifetime.'' He said it would be ''nothing more than a giveaway of our great outdoors.''
It's painful to see the G.O.P. take this stance because it was a great Republican -- Theodore Roosevelt -- who helped preserve America's natural treasures. The writer Wallace Stegner called our parks America's ''best idea,'' and it's a legacy that Republicans should embrace, not undermine.
The second challenge is more complicated. It is that Americans love their national parks, but they sometimes love video games more.
The National Park Service reports that the number of recreational visits to our national parks was lower in 2010 than a decade earlier -- lower even than in 1987 and 1988. There were 35 percent more backcountry campers in the national parks in 1979 than in 2010.
''Fewer and fewer youth are heading outdoors each year,'' the Outdoor Foundation concluded in a ''special report on youth.'' It added that ''the American childhood has rapidly moved indoors, leading to epidemic levels of childhood obesity and inactivity.''
It's tougher to make the argument for wilderness when Americans show less relish for it. Hunting and fishing were once the gateway to outdoor activities, but they're declining, and backpackers, cross-country skiers and rock climbers haven't been able to pick up the slack.
Conservationists need to expand their focus from preserving nature to encouraging the public to experience it. The only way to protect wilderness in the long run is to build a constituency for it, to grow the number of people who revel in camping under the stars (I'm not a fan of tents!), Americans who accept mosquito bites as a cheap price for some of the world's freshest air.
A few years ago, a writer named Richard Louv coined the term ''nature deficit disorder'' to describe the way children grow up deprived of wading in muddy creeks. He has followed that up with a new book, ''The Nature Principle,'' arguing that adults need nature as well -- as a tonic, as a balancing force, as therapy.
I'm convinced of that. Our family backpacking trips leave us exhausted, blistered, filthy and sweaty, and drinking from creeks and ponds that make my wife shudder. Yet we also gain perspective.
On one segment of the Pacific Crest Trail near Crater Lake this year, we faced 26 miles without a creek or other water source -- a reminder that in the backcountry, nature does not exist for our convenience. On other days, we struggled and slipped as we crossed steep snowfields covered with an icy glaze.
The wilderness trims our bravado and puts us in our place. Particularly in traumatic times like these, nature challenges us, revitalizes us, humbles us, exhilarates us and restores our souls. It reminds us that we are part of a larger universe, stewards rather than masters of our world. That's the lesson you learn as you snuggle exhausted in your sleeping bag and fall asleep outside to the magical sight of owls flitting against shooting stars.

THE MISSING MARTYRS
Why There Are So Few Muslim Terrorists
By Charles Kurzman
248 pp. Oxford University Press. $24.95.
In ''The Missing Martyrs,'' Charles Kurzman suggests that even before Osama bin Laden was killed, his movement had failed utterly. Al Qaeda's ideological trademark is to exhort ordinary Muslims to engage in individual acts of violence against those deemed enemies of Islam, specifically Americans, Jews and the infidel rulers of Muslim-/majority states. And yet very few such attacks have occurred in the United States since Sept. 11, and certainly none comparable to the devastating events of that day. To emphasize just how surprising this is, Kurzman cites a 2006 online manual for aspiring jihadists that lists 14 ''simple tools'' that ''are easy to use and available for anyone who wants to fight the occupying enemy'' -- they include ''running over someone with a car'' and ''setting fire to homes or rooms at sleep time.'' Kurzman, a sociologist who has written widely about Islamic reform movements, asks: ''If terrorist methods are as widely available as automobiles, why are there so few Islamist terrorists? 
 In light of the death and devastation that terrorists have wrought, the question may seem absurd. But if there are more than a billion Muslims in the world, many of whom supposedly hate the West and desire martyrdom, why don't we see terrorist attacks everywhere, every day?''
Kurzman's answer is that Al Qaeda and its violent kin have failed so dismally simply because they have been unable to attract large numbers of recruits to their cause. He acknowledges the disturbing polls showing that large percentages of Muslims (outside the United States) have approved of Bin Laden. In his view, however, such sentiments should be understood not as actual identification with Al Qaeda's tactics and methods, but rather as evidence that Bin Laden and his group were a form of ''radical sheik.'' By this, Kurzman means that Al Qaeda became a symbol of anti-imperialism, Islamic authenticity and a general thumbing of one's nose at the brutal political order in which so many Arabs and Muslims live. Indeed, many of those who express approval of Bin Laden in polls also demonstrate enthusiasm for pop music or political democracy -- both anathema to Al Qaeda.
Over time Al Qaeda has alienated most Muslims, for a number of reasons. Perhaps the most important is the killing of large numbers of fellow Muslims in its terror campaigns. Such killings are taboo under Islamic law, and Al Qaeda's efforts to legitimate them have had little success. Most Muslims reject Al Qaeda's theology, a virulent form of Salafism, or a strictly literalist approach to revealed texts, that brands fellow Muslims unbelievers if they are not sufficiently pure in their beliefs and practices. This theology gives Al /Qaeda a cultish quality that precludes it from becoming a mass movement, though it is not clear that it ever aspired to become one: a professed vanguard, Al Qaeda describes its members as the ''Strangers,'' an allusion to the few Muslims who will remain true to the religion at the end of time.
Kurzman also notes that Al Qaeda has had to contend with competition from other Islamic groups and ideologies, including localized movements that do not have a global agenda. Hamas and the Taliban may espouse violence and radical Islamism, but they have little interest in attacking the West, and their interpretations of Islam often come into conflict with Al Qaeda's. (In contrast to the media-/savvy Bin Laden, the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar has not allowed himself to be photographed.) Equally important, Al Qaeda faces competition from liberal Islamic groups that combine at least a measure of support for political democracy with culturally conservative views on the role of women and the scope of Islamic law.
While Kurzman's book is a contribution to the study of Al Qaeda and Islamism, it is a highly selective one. His provocative view that there are so many ''missing martyrs'' -- that there are, indeed, ''so few Muslim terrorists'' -- makes sense only if one concentrates narrowly on the United States and not, for example, on Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan. The people of these countries have suffered daily terror attacks in the name of Al Qaeda's ideology for at least a decade, many of them conducted by suicide bombers, who have been plentiful. For Iraqis, the statistics Kurzman provides -- ''Global Islamist terrorists have managed to recruit fewer than one in 15,000 Muslims over the past quarter-century and fewer than one in 100,000 Muslims since 9/11'' -- offer little comfort. By this calculus we are talking of more than 10,000 individuals. No other terrorist phenomenon compares to it in scale.
In accounting for terrorism's success and failures, Kurzman ultimately attaches too much importance to the influence of ideas. If Al Qaeda has failed, this is only partly because it has lost a war of ideas to liberal Muslim groups, many of which may not be as liberal or as popular as Kurzman supposes. It surely has much to do with the war that the militaries and security and intelligence services around the world have waged against terrorism. In the Arab world, for instance, security agencies hunted down Qaeda members with ruthless vengeance and tortured countless individuals, and family members, in the process. Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria were particularly skilled at this and by many accounts received the Bush administration's blessing and support. The American war machine, with its controversial drone attacks, has severely damaged Al Qaeda's leadership. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars have also attracted Al /Qaeda's recruits to those theaters of operation rather than to the United States, which has become much more difficult to access.
Security measures at airports, and local police efforts like those of the New York Police Department's counterterrorism unit, have made it a lot harder for Al /Qaeda to wage attacks on American soil. In addition, the Justice Department's campaign in the courts against terror suspects and those who allegedly provide material support to terrorist groups has instilled fear among many Muslims in the United States. Thus far, at least, these trials do not appear to have produced domestic recruits to Al Qaeda's cause, but rather have had a self-/disciplining and -policing effect within the community.
Most important, however, are certain features of American Islam that render it largely immune to Al Qaeda's appeal. It is a heterogeneous and vibrant community -- over a third are of African-/American descent -- and many of its members enjoy economic success and partake in the American dream. Unlike in Britain, France and Germany, Muslims in America do not live in what amount to ghettos and are not socially ostracized or economically marginalized. These achievements make Al Qaeda's siren call fall on deaf ears in the United States. But Al Qaeda's defeat will be complete only if the Arab Spring uprisings bring more accountable governments, personal dignity and greater economic opportunity to the peoples of the Arab world. If these revolutions fail to do so, Al Qaeda will find receptive ears and resurrect itself, regardless of whether it succeeds in attacking the United States again or not.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD PROJECT
Using Evolution to Improve My City, One Block at a Time
By David Sloan Wilson
432 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $25.99.
My undergraduate students, especially those bound for medical school, often ask why they have to study evolution. It won't cure disease, and really, how useful is evolution to the average person? My response is that while evolutionary biology can explain, for example, the origin of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, we shouldn't see evolution as a cure for human woes. Its value is explanatory: to tell us how, when and why we got here (by ''we,'' I mean ''every organism'') and to show us how all species are related. In the end, evolution is the greatest tale of all, for it's true. 
David Sloan Wilson, on the other hand, sees evolutionary biology as a panacea for the world's ills. By understanding ''human nature'' -- that is, the behaviors and attitudes instilled in our ancestors by natural selection -- we will, he claims, finally be able to solve problems like poor education, dysfunctional cities, bad economics, mental illness and ethnic cleansing. ''Evolutionary science,'' Wilson argues, ''will eventually prove so useful on a daily basis that we will wonder how we survived without it. I'm here to make that day come sooner rather than later, starting with my own city of Binghamton.'' ''The Neighborhood Project'' describes Wilson's ambitious proposal for using evolutionary biology to raise up Binghamton, a down-at-the heels town of about 50,000 in upstate New York. An evolutionary biologist at the State University of New York there, Wilson formerly worked on toads and mites, but has now adopted his own town as a study organism.
Wilson is well known for his controversial work on evolution via ''group selection.'' While modern evolutionary theory emphasizes natural selection acting on genes and individuals, Wilson sees an important role for selection acting on entire social groups, particularly in the evolution of ''prosociality'': that complex of behaviors, including altruism and compassion, that underlies human cooperation.
Such helping behavior seems hard to evolve by conventional selection, since it's easily subverted by cheaters who accept help but don't reciprocate. That's where group selection comes in. If our ancestors lived in small bands containing different proportions of helpers and cheaters, those bands with more helpers could thrive and spawn similar groups. It's this differential proliferation of groups, Wilson claims, that has made humans so cooperative.
Group selection isn't widely accepted by evolutionists for several reasons. First, it's not an efficient way to select for traits, like altruistic behavior, that are supposed to be detrimental to the individual but good for the group. Groups divide to form other groups much less often than organisms reproduce to form other organisms, so group selection for altruism would be unlikely to override the tendency of each group to quickly lose its altruists through natural selection favoring cheaters. Further, we simply have little evidence that selection on groups has promoted the evolution of any trait. Finally, other, more plausible evolutionary forces, like direct selection on individuals for reciprocal support, could have made us prosocial.
These reasons explain why only a few biologists, like Wilson and E. O. Wilson (no relation), advocate group selection as the evolutionary source of cooperation. Nevertheless, David Sloan Wilson is convinced that organizing Binghamton's citizens into amiably competing groups can turn it into the proverbial City on a Hill. His passion sometimes verges on obsession, as if (to paraphrase the Blues Brothers) he's on a mission from Darwin.
The backbone of Wilson's plan is a psychological survey of Binghamton schoolchildren, measuring their prosociality and mapping it onto their neighborhoods. Prosociality is determined by the level of agreement with statements like ''I am trying to help solve social problems.'' At the same time, support from their environment is measured by students' agreement with questions like ''I have a family that gives love and support'' or ''I have good neighbors that help me succeed.'' While Wilson makes much of the correlation between prosociality and a supportive environment, arguing that prosocial nature comes from prosocial nurture, both statistics derive in fact from self-report, so there is no independent evaluation of students' environments.
After using the survey to identify neighborhoods with higher or lower degrees of prosociality, Wilson's strategy is to improve the city by having them compete. This involves neighborhood contests to design city parks, studies of churches to determine why some are better able to recruit and retain members, as well as projects less obviously connected with prosociality, like collecting DNA from older citizens to tie their genes to their life experiences.
Oddly, most of the book has nothing to do with the Binghamton Neighborhood Project, but rather with Wilson's vision of how evolutionary biology can change the world. Education, for instance, will be transformed by going back to the ways of our distant ancestors, who gave their children no formal instruction but let them learn from unstructured play and interaction with older kids. (Wilson's modern example is the Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts.) Economic theory will be revolutionized by realizing that humans aren't selfish agents, but have been imbued by group selection with feelings of fairness and altruism. Juvenile delinquency will be eradicated by keeping high-risk children apart, avoiding the negative reinforcement that inhibits prosociality.
I applaud Wilson's aspiration to improve his town and his world, but the evolution-centered approach is rife with problems. How much of ''human nature'' comes from evolution, and how much from culture? For many behaviors, like religion and criminality, we simply have no idea. Nor does it matter when it comes to solving most problems. Maybe we long for green spaces because our ancestors evolved in those environments, or maybe not, but all we need to know is that we like them. We might have learned hunting and speech from free-form ''education'' on the savanna, but it's hard to see how reading, engineering and mathematics can be acquired in the same way. Our world is no longer the one in which we evolved.
Wilson further undermines his case by repeatedly counting as ''evolutionary'' any human activity involving ''variation and selection,'' including committees that have to decide between alternative plans and children who learn to discard those behaviors that don't bring them rewards. But these issues have nothing to do with biological evolution; they are superficial and meaningless parallels with natural selection's winnowing of genetic variation.
By far the best parts of the book are the short chapters, called ''parables,'' that Wilson interpolates as lessons we should learn from other species (wasps, for example, teach us about conflict versus cooperation, crows about culture in other species). These show his superb ability to communicate a deep love of biology. But these parables have little to do with the Neighborhood Project. And Wilson's enthusiasm has a way of shading into hubris, as when he proclaims: ''Now that my intellectual life and my everyday life have been thrown together, I can almost feel the connections taking place inside my head. Like a Shakespearean play, the length and breadth of human nature are being enacted in front of me on a local stage.''
Five years into the Neighborhood Project, it has apparently yielded only one published paper, which gives the results of the prosociality survey. The Binghamton parks contest went belly-up, as people weren't interested in competing according to Wilson's schedule. Other plans, like the big DNA survey, seem too ambitious to reach fruition. Wilson clearly means well, and his efforts exemplify the prosociality he so admires. But this ungainly farrago of a book rests on the shaky pillars of a questionable premise and Wilson's need to connect his vocation with his altruism. The best that can be said of ''The Neighborhood Project'' is that it's premature.

A Regulated Tenant Can't Find the Lease
QI've lived in a rent-controlled apartment for 40-plus years. I'm having trouble locating my original lease. The state Division of Housing and Community Renewal does not have copies of leases. Where can I get a copy?
A Jamie Heiberger, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, says there is probably no place to get a copy of the lease except from the landlord. In fact, Ms. Heiberger said, it is not at all uncommon for a rent-controlled tenant never to have had a lease. All those subject to rent control are considered ''statutory month-to-month'' tenants, and cannot be evicted except for cause, like not paying rent. If there was a lease, and the landlord can produce it, the tenant may have fewer rights than he would have if there hadn't been one. For example, Ms. Heiberger said, most leases state that a tenant cannot make alterations without the owner's previous written consent. If there is no lease available, it is very difficult for the owner to make a case that a tenant has violated his tenancy by making alterations. Rent increases for rent-controlled tenants, with or without a lease, are determined by the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. 
The Aftermath of a Tropical Storm
QWe had leaks around several of our windows after the recent tropical storm, causing warping in the wood and bubbling in the drywall. The management company attributed the leaks to a lack of weather-proofing on the building's exterior. Who is responsible for repairing interior damages caused by the leak?
A Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that although a precise answer would depend on the proprietary lease, a co-op is typically required to restore only the ''structural'' aspects of the apartment -- like Sheetrock, plaster walls and ceilings and, in this case, the window trim if it is damaged. ''The shareholder is responsible for all decorative aspects, like repainting and wallpaper,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said. One general exception applies if the damage to the shareholder's apartment was the result of negligence or willful misconduct of the co-op. ''So if this shareholder can prove that the co-op or its management company knew for a while that the building's exterior was inadequately weatherproofed, and failed to remedy the situation,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said, ''the co-op could conceivably be held liable.''
Is There a Super in the House?
QDoes New York City law require a co-op building of 100 apartments to have a full-time live-in superintendent? My co-op wants to rent out the apartment set aside for the super.
A Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that under the city's administrative code, the owner of a building with nine or more apartments must provide janitorial services. He can perform the services himself -- if he is a resident owner -- or he can provide either a 24-hour janitorial service or a superintendent. ''The superintendent need not live in the building,'' Mr. Greenstein said, ''but must live within 200 feet of the building, or within one block, whichever is greater.'' If the co-op meets the requirements for an ''off-premises'' superintendent or janitor, he added, it should be able to rent out the super's apartment.

HEADLINE: Is Manufacturing Falling Off the Radar?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
PELLA, Iowa
JUST outside this prairie town, seven vast buildings, each painted brick red, are lined up along a highway bordered by grain fields. These single-story structures have no smokestacks or any other indication that they are, in fact, very busy factories.
Three shifts of workers produce machines that bale hay, dig trenches, reduce tree branches to wood chips, grind stumps into sawdust, and drill tunnels to run electric wires and pipes underground. Most were the creations of Gary Vermeer, a farmer, tinkerer and inventor who died two years ago, at the age of 91.
The company he founded bears his name, but for all its American roots, the Vermeer Corporation put its newest factory -- and the wealth that goes with it -- not here but in the capital of China. And Mr. Vermeer's daughter, Mary Vermeer Andringa, the chief executive, presides over a manufacturing operation that relies increasingly on government support.
As President Obama urges Congress to enact a package of tax cuts and new government spending intended to revive growth and create jobs, one crucial corner of the American economy -- manufacturing -- has largely fallen off Washington's radar screen. 
Vermeer earns nearly one-third of its annual revenue from exports -- counting on the United States government for trade agreements, favorable currency arrangements and even white-knuckle diplomacy to make exports happen. In China, that wasn't enough. For several years, it had been running into competition from Chinese manufacturers of horizontal drills, supported by their government in the form of free land, tax breaks, cheap credit and other subsidies. With its share of the market falling precipitously, Vermeer in 2008 opened a plant in Beijing, taking a Chinese partner and drawing help for the venture from the Chinese. ''I am a very big proponent of making the United States a great place from which to export,'' said Ms. Andringa, 61, who is also chairwoman of the National Association of Manufacturers. But she added: ''If we wanted to stay in the Chinese market, we needed to be there. That was the reality.''
Manufacturing is not simply a market activity, especially not in the 21st century: manufacturers rely increasingly on governments, here and abroad, to prosper and expand. Vermeer, family owned, thrives with such help, as do big multinationals like Dow Chemical. In each region of the world, multinationals produce much of what they sell locally. European and Asian governments support this strategy, and the American government is cautiously getting into this game. The president, in his speech on Thursday, nodded in this direction.
''We're going to make sure the next generation of manufacturing takes root not in China or Europe, but right here, in the United States of America,'' he told a joint session of Congress.
Vermeer tries to march to that edict, employing 140 engineers, 7 percent of its staff, in a constant effort to upgrade the various machines it exports. But it runs into an obstacle. For all the desire to make things in America, manufacturers increasingly rely on imported components, diluting the label ''Made in America,'' and Vermeer is no exception.
''We would prefer to buy everything in the United States, but some of our transmissions come from Europe,'' Ms. Andringa says. ''They are not made here in the sizes and capacities that we need.''
In Dow Chemical's case, thanks to a $141 million state grant, roof shingles that generate solar power are rolling out of a pilot plant near Dow's headquarters in Midland, Mich., and a full-scale factory is under construction nearby. The federal government is also paying nearly half the cost of building a $362 million Dow plant in the Midland area, whose ''clean'' rooms will soon produce batteries for electric cars.
''An advanced manufacturing policy is what this country must have,'' says Andrew N. Liveris, the chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, arguing, in effect, that manufacturing needs government support to expand its dwindling share of the nation's economy. That is particularly so when demand for new products like solar shingles and batteries is not yet enough to justify the investment. (Three solar companies recently filed for bankruptcy.)
Mr. Liveris, 57, himself a chemical engineer and co-chairman of President Obama's newly formed Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, a group of outside advisers, would even ''pick winners'' -- that is, select some manufacturers for continuing support. ''I would not let free markets rule without also addressing what I want manufacturing to be 20 or 30 years from now,'' he says.
The Obama administration hasn't tried to formulate policy that far into the future. But, last year, the president called for a doubling of exports by 2015 -- which would require total factory output in America to rise several times faster than it has in recent years. One way to accomplish that would be to have multinationals repatriate some of their overseas production -- which Mr. Liveris, for one, is not planning to do.
Despite its goals for manufacturing, the administration lacks an explicit plan for achieving them. ''The United States today is alone among industrial powers in not having a strategy or even a procedure for thinking through what must be done when it comes to manufacturing,'' says Thomas A. Kochan, an industrial economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
MANUFACTURING'S muscle helped make the United States a world power, but its contribution to national income is dwindling. And while corporate leaders like Mr. Liveris and Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric -- who is chairman of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness -- are beginning to express concern over manufacturing's relative decline, the multinationals they command have contributed to the problem by gradually shifting production abroad. About half of Dow Chemical's $58 billion in revenue last year came from overseas operations.
A tipping point may already have been reached. Manufacturing's contribution to gross domestic product -- roughly equivalent to national income -- has declined to just 11.7 percent last year from as much as 28 percent in the 1950s, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In this century, the 20-percent-or-more club draws its members mainly from Asia and Europe.
It isn't that fewer autos or plastics or steel products or electronics are coming out of American factories. Quite the contrary: output continues to rise, reaching $1.95 trillion last year. But other sectors of the economy have grown faster in recent decades, and that dynamic has reduced manufacturing's share.
In particular, the finance, insurance and real estate sectors -- driven especially by investment banking and home sales -- rose from less than 12 percent of G.D.P. in the mid-1950s to more than 20 percent before the onset of the financial crisis, and even now remain nearly that high. In China, in sharp contrast, manufacturing's share of national output is more than 25 percent. While the United States has a far larger economy -- $14 trillion in G.D.P. versus China's $6 trillion -- it has less factory production.
Exactly when China took the lead, ousting the United States from a position held for more than a century, isn't easy to pin down. The bureau says it may have come in 2009, when Chinese manufacturers generated $1.7 trillion of ''value added,'' versus America's $1.6 trillion. (When a $100 sheet of steel, for example, is shaped into a $125 auto fender, the value added is $25.)
Relying on World Bank figures, some economists suggest that China moved into first place in manufacturing last year. Others say that based on measurements of actual purchasing power, the moment has not yet arrived but will come soon.
It may seem remarkable that America's fall -- or impending fall -- from first place in manufacturing isn't generating all that many headlines, certainly not when compared with the controversies over the national debt or persistent unemployment. One reason may be that the nation's political leaders don't see manufacturing as a problem. Put another way, they don't necessarily regard making an engine, a computer or even a pair of scissors as having as much value as investment banking or retailing or a useful Web site.
''You have a culture within the elites of both political parties that says manufacturing does not matter, and industrial policy will do more harm than good,'' says Ronil Hira, an assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
But the stark reality of manufacturing's shrinking share of national output is beginning to force these questions: Does manufacturing matter? And is the financial sector, which rose as manufacturing declined, an adequate substitute? The financial crisis may have answered that last question with an emphatic no. Certainly, many experts maintain that manufacturing's contribution to the national health is significantly underappreciated.
Recovery from the recession, they say, would not be so sluggish if there were still enough manufacturers to jump-start an upturn by revving up production and rehiring en masse at the first signs of better times. What's more, each new manufacturing job generates five others in the economy. Shrinking the relative size of manufacturing has undermined that multiplier effect.
The damage doesn't end there. The intractable trade deficit is attributable in part to manufacturing's shaken status. And in many areas, craftsmanship in America has been eroding. Forty percent of the nation's engineers work in manufacturing, for example, and that profession's numbers have been declining. That is a particular problem because innovation often originates in manufacturing, frequently in research centers near factories, which aid in the creation of products and the tweaking of them on assembly lines.
As multinationals place factories abroad, they are putting research centers near them, with as-yet-undetermined consequences. At the very least, this trend challenges the view that the United States has the best scientists and research centers and is thus the research-and-development pacesetter.
''If you let manufacturing go, over time that will have a negative gravitational pull on innovation,'' says Ron Bloom, who served as the administration's senior counselor for manufacturing. He resigned in August and has not yet been replaced.
In fact, as American multinationals become ever more global, they are placing sophisticated research centers near their overseas factories, partly to keep R.& D. close to assembly lines and partly because of enticing government incentives.
From China, Dow Chemical now exports products invented at its research center near Shanghai. ''Overseas,'' Mr. Liveris said, ''I get tax incentives, and I get incentives to go to certain locations where they offer us utilities, infrastructure and land. I get access to human capital. I get all sorts of support to help train that human capital.''
Against that backdrop, he and a few other top executives of multinationals exhort the Obama administration and Congress to grant incentives and subsidies intended to halt the 60-year decline in manufacturing's contribution to national income. Mr. Liveris recently published a book on the subject.
He says vigorous government support, like the subsidies that Dow receives for its solar roof shingle operation and the electric battery factory, might eventually halt manufacturing's slide. But he adds that his company and others will not embark on a reverse migration, a significant ''in-shoring'' of what has already moved abroad. Too many consumers are concentrated today in Asia and Europe.
''We put things overseas,'' Mr. Liveris says, ''because markets were growing there and we wanted to be close to them, and that will never change.''
THE skyline at the Dow Chemical complex in Midland is made up of smokestacks, giant pipes and multistory factory buildings. The site where Herbert Dow first extracted brine from underground wells to make bleach is organized now as 32 production units employing 3,600 people and spread over three square miles. Out of this complex come products like brake fluid, plastic tubing, paint, battery components and solar roof shingles.
Much of what is made at these factories is sold in the United States, and more could come off the assembly lines if domestic demand rose or exports grew, says Earl Shipp, a Dow Chemical vice president, during a tour of the sprawling complex. Dow is now a significant exporter from the United States, but it is also a significant exporter from its factories overseas.
Consider China. ''We have launched several products sold around the world that were designed and invented in China and are now made in China,'' Mr. Liveris says. He cites as examples a protective coating with properties that neutralize the corrosive effects of formaldehyde and an epoxy-based laminate used in printed circuit boards.
The solar roof shingles being produced in Midland, by contrast, are intended only for America. That is partly because roofs on single-family homes in this country slope differently from those elsewhere, according to Jane M. Palmieri, general manager of Dow Solar Solutions.
Still, Dow's research in Midland led to the invention of a layered roof shingle that converts sunlight into enough electricity to heat water for a home. If there were enough demand in, say, Europe, Dow might initially export a European version from the United States.
''At some point, as demand rose, we would go overseas,'' Ms. Palmieri says. ''We would want to keep the production facility in good proximity to our end-use market.''
The battery factory nearing completion a few streets away is a different tale. It is to produce enough batteries each year to operate 30,000 fully electric cars. But the batteries aren't likely to be exported immediately. The reason is that Dow is manufacturing them in Midland in a joint venture with other companies, licensing the technology from the Kokam Company in South Korea. Elsewhere in the world, Korean, European, Chinese and Japanese companies are already making and selling similar batteries, using different technologies.
''Battery production went overseas when electronics did, and we are only now bringing it back,'' says David Pankratz, the Dow vice president of operations for the joint venture, adding that the government pushed for this to happen.
That sally into industrial policy, some economists say, is like closing the barn door after the horse has escaped -- the horse in this case being America's possession of the world's biggest mass market. That ended in the late 20th century with the rise of millions of consumers in Asia and Europe with ample disposable income or access to credit.
The upshot is that governments in these markets pile on subsidies to gain or keep as much production as possible. Whirlpool, for example, makes most of its microwave ovens in southeastern China, with help from local subsidies.
When companies engaged in this kind of strategy in the 1980s, there was often much more criticism than today.
''The reason you no longer get much of an outcry over this exodus has to do mainly with jobs,'' says Heather Boushey, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress. ''Less than 12 percent of the American work force is in manufacturing today, down from 30 percent in the 1970s. So there isn't the same level of public concern.''
Correction: September 18, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the absence of a long-term national policy on manufacturing misstated the source of a $141 million grant to Dow Chemical for a roof shingle plant. It was the state of Michigan, not the federal government.

HEADLINE: From Wall Street to a Bakery

BYLINE: By JULIA LAWLOR

 BODY:
After working for three years as a credit underwriter on Wall Street, Tracy Silverman left the world of finance behind in 2008 and threw herself into her second career and true love: baking. She graduated in 2009 from the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan, apprenticed at Brownie Points Bakery in Summit, then opened her own shop, Sweet Lucy's, in March in a former bank. 
Sweet Lucy's, a pink jewel box of a bakery in Morristown with exposed brick walls and a tin ceiling, is named after Ms. Silverman's yellow lab, Lucy. There are dog posters on the walls, a jar of house-made dog treats on the counter (50 cents each) and a glass wall looking into the kitchen. There is also one very happy baker with an aptitude for math at the register.
''I realized I wasn't cut out for sitting behind a desk all day,'' Ms. Silverman, 28, said.
Whoopie pies ($3.50, or $1.75 for miniatures) are a customer favorite, with flavors including s'mores, cookie dough, cookies and cream and banana/strawberry. Cupcakes ($2.25 or $2.75) include basic vanilla, chocolate, red velvet, banana Nutella, maple bacon, Snicker's, Mounds and chocolate peanut butter cookie dough.
There are also muffins, bars, cookies, custom cakes, quiches and savory scones. Ms. Silverman uses high-quality ingredients like Valrhona chocolate and European butter, and she says she does not bake with shortening. She has introduced vegan cupcakes and is planning to offer gluten-free options soon.
Despite the challenging economic climate, Sweet Lucy's has been so busy that there are now three full-time and four part-time employees. Ms. Silverman has not regretted her career move for a moment. ''I left and never looked back,'' she said. JULIA LAWLOR

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Homework

BYLINE: By ANNIE MURPHY PAUL

 BODY:
Annie Murphy Paul is the author of ''Origins,'' who is at work on a new book about the science of learning.
WHEN you think of America's students, do you picture overworked, stressed-out children bent under backpacks stuffed with textbooks and worksheets? Or do you call to mind glassy-eyed, empty-headed teenagers sitting before computer screens, consumed by video games and social networking sites, even as their counterparts in China prepare to ace yet another round of academic exams? The first view dominates a series of recent books and movies, including the much-discussed film ''Race to Nowhere.'' The second image has been put forth by other books, with titles like ''The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future.''
Divergent though they are, these characterizations share a common emphasis: homework. The studying that middle school and high school students do after the dismissal bell rings is either an unreasonable burden or a crucial activity that needs beefing up. Which is it? Do American students have too much homework or too little? Neither, I'd say. We ought to be asking a different question altogether. What should matter to parents and educators is this: How effectively do children's after-school assignments advance learning? 
The quantity of students' homework is a lot less important than its quality. And evidence suggests that as of now, homework isn't making the grade. Although surveys show that the amount of time our children spend on homework has risen over the last three decades, American students are mired in the middle of international academic rankings: 17th in reading, 23rd in science and 31st in math, according to results from the Program for International Student Assessment released last December.
In a 2008 survey, one-third of parents polled rated the quality of their children's homework assignments as fair or poor, and 4 in 10 said they believed that some or a great deal of homework was busywork. A new study, coming in the Economics of Education Review, reports that homework in science, English and history has ''little to no impact'' on student test scores. (The authors did note a positive effect for math homework.) Enriching children's classroom learning requires making homework not shorter or longer, but smarter.
Fortunately, research is available to help parents, teachers and school administrators do just that. In recent years, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists and educational psychologists have made a series of remarkable discoveries about how the human brain learns. They have founded a new discipline, known as Mind, Brain and Education, that is devoted to understanding and improving the ways in which children absorb, retain and apply knowledge.
Educators have begun to implement these methods in classrooms around the country and have enjoyed measured success. A collaboration between psychologists at Washington University in St. Louis and teachers at nearby Columbia Middle School, for example, lifted seventh- and eighth-grade students' science and social studies test scores by 13 to 25 percent.
But the innovations have not yet been applied to homework. Mind, Brain and Education methods may seem unfamiliar and even counterintuitive, but they are simple to understand and easy to carry out. And after-school assignments are ripe for the kind of improvements the new science offers.
''Spaced repetition'' is one example of the kind of evidence-based techniques that researchers have found have a positive impact on learning. Here's how it works: instead of concentrating the study of information in single blocks, as many homework assignments currently do -- reading about, say, the Civil War one evening and Reconstruction the next -- learners encounter the same material in briefer sessions spread over a longer period of time. With this approach, students are re-exposed to information about the Civil War and Reconstruction throughout the semester.
It sounds unassuming, but spaced repetition produces impressive results. Eighth-grade history students who relied on a spaced approach to learning had nearly double the retention rate of students who studied the same material in a consolidated unit, reported researchers from the University of California-San Diego in 2007. The reason the method works so well goes back to the brain: when we first acquire memories, they are volatile, subject to change or likely to disappear. Exposing ourselves to information repeatedly over time fixes it more permanently in our minds, by strengthening the representation of the information that is embedded in our neural networks.
A second learning technique, known as ''retrieval practice,'' employs a familiar tool -- the test -- in a new way: not to assess what students know, but to reinforce it. We often conceive of memory as something like a storage tank and a test as a kind of dipstick that measures how much information we've put in there. But that's not actually how the brain works. Every time we pull up a memory, we make it stronger and more lasting, so that testing doesn't just measure, it changes learning. Simply reading over material to be learned, or even taking notes and making outlines, as many homework assignments require, doesn't have this effect.
According to one experiment, language learners who employed the retrieval practice strategy to study vocabulary words remembered 80 percent of the words they studied, while learners who used conventional study methods remembered only about a third of them. Students who used retrieval practice to learn science retained about 50 percent more of the material than students who studied in traditional ways, reported researchers from Purdue University earlier this year. Students -- and parents -- may groan at the prospect of more tests, but the self-quizzing involved in retrieval practice need not provoke any anxiety. It's simply an effective way to focus less on the input of knowledge (passively reading over textbooks and notes) and more on its output (calling up that same information from one's own brain).
Another common misconception about how we learn holds that if information feels easy to absorb, we've learned it well. In fact, the opposite is true. When we work hard to understand information, we recall it better; the extra effort signals the brain that this knowledge is worth keeping. This phenomenon, known as cognitive disfluency, promotes learning so effectively that psychologists have devised all manner of ''desirable difficulties'' to introduce into the learning process: for example, sprinkling a passage with punctuation mistakes, deliberately leaving out letters, shrinking font size until it's tiny or wiggling a document while it's being copied so that words come out blurry.
Teachers are unlikely to start sending students home with smudged or error-filled worksheets, but there is another kind of desirable difficulty -- called interleaving -- that can readily be applied to homework. An interleaved assignment mixes up different kinds of situations or problems to be practiced, instead of grouping them by type. When students can't tell in advance what kind of knowledge or problem-solving strategy will be required to answer a question, their brains have to work harder to come up with the solution, and the result is that students learn the material more thoroughly.
Researchers at California Polytechnic State University conducted a study of interleaving in sports that illustrates why the tactic is so effective. When baseball players practiced hitting, interleaving different kinds of pitches improved their performance on a later test in which the batters did not know the type of pitch in advance (as would be the case, of course, in a real game).
Interleaving produces the same sort of improvement in academic learning. A study published last year in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology asked fourth-graders to work on solving four types of math problems and then to take a test evaluating how well they had learned. The scores of those whose practice problems were mixed up were more than double the scores of those students who had practiced one kind of problem at a time.
The application of such research-based strategies to homework is a yet-untapped opportunity to raise student achievement. Science has shown us how to turn homework into a potent catalyst for learning. Our assignment now is to make it happen.

HEADLINE: German Nominated to Central Bank Post

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and LIZ ALDERMAN; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Liz Alderman from Marseille, France.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Germany moved swiftly to install a guardian of its interests in the European Central Bank Saturday, nominating a top technocrat to replace a senior bank official whose unexpected resignation Friday hinted at divisions over the conduct of monetary policy. 
The selection of Jorg Asmussen, 44, a deputy finance minister and career bureaucrat, announced at the meeting of Group of 7 countries in Marseille, France, appeared intended to reassure a German public increasingly concerned about the extraordinary lengths that the central bank has gone to support ailing countries like Greece and Spain.
Internal divisions at the European Central Bank spilled into the open Friday after Jurgen Stark, the bank's de facto chief economist, said he would resign his seat on the six-member executive board, which manages bank operations and plays a leading role in setting monetary policy.
In a measure of the acute doubts about Europe's ability to contain the sovereign debt crisis, Mr. Stark's resignation was enough to set off stock declines in Europe and the United States. Mr. Stark's resignation also threatened to further strain European unity and undermine German support for measures to keep Greece from defaulting.
Mr. Stark is an opponent of the bank's purchases of bonds from ailing countries to hold down their borrowing costs, and many Germans share his concerns. His resignation ''makes the European bailout scheme more unpopular among German voters, which lowers the long-term credibility of the bailout policy among investors,'' Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a research note Saturday.
Mr. Asmussen's background suggests he will carry on the German economics tradition, with its focus on price stability. Mr. Asmussen studied economics at the University of Bonn, where he was a protege of Axel Weber, who later became president of the Bundesbank before resigning earlier this year -- like Mr. Stark, in protest over the European Central Bank's intervention in bond markets.
Mr. Asmussen and Jens Weidmann, who succeeded Mr. Weber as president of the Bundesbank, are likely to form a united front on the central bank's governing council. But, along with two or three other council members who opposed the bond purchases, Mr. Asmussen will represent a minority view.
Mr. Asmussen's appointment must be ratified by other European leaders, but is a foregone conclusion.

 BODY:
Days after the attacks, researchers at the Columbia Center for Oral History began asking New Yorkers to describe their experience of the most harrowing day in the city's history. The following account, the fall of the trade center told moment by moment and person by person, is drawn from the more than 600 interviews collected in the September 11, 2001 Oral History Project.
Samuel G. Delaney, union delegate and former maintenance worker at the World Trade Center
Woke up about 4 o'clock in the morning to get into work because we had to start at 6 o'clock -- well, I think it was 5 o'clock, 5:30. It was really early in the morning. Came from Rockaway and passed the World Trade Center and just looking at it, saying, ''I miss working there and hanging out with the guys and everything,'' and then went to work. 
Ralph Dickerson Jr., president of United Way of New York City
I was a little concerned about whether I was going to be able to spin for the entire time, so I remember cutting the class a little short, because I needed to shower, I need to get downtown, and so I really only spent -- spun 30 minutes that day, got off the bike -- nothing unusual about that morning at all for me -- I was in the shower about 10 to 7.
Vernon Joseph,junior office assistant for the Port Authority, 68th floor, north tower
My goal was to get up very early in the morning to do my citizenship rights as a voter. So I got up very early in the morning. I left the house about 7 o'clock a.m., and I finished voting by 7:15.
Francis A. Keating,national salesman at Bank of New York, in New York City for a meeting
I was invited by the bank to attend a seminar on money laundering at our main operations center at 101 Barclay Street in downtown New York. Instead of driving that day, I got on the Long Island Rail Road, 7:37 train, saw a few people that I knew from the days that I was commuting, but other than that I just grabbed my Wall Street Journal, and they did theirs, and started reading away.
7:59 a.m. American Airlines Flight 11 takes off from Logan International Airport in Boston with 76 passengers, 11 crew members and 5 hijackers.
Ivy Barsky, deputy director for programs at the Museum of Jewish Heritage
I thought to myself, ''Gee, I'm running late; maybe I should forgo my reading the paper or getting work done and just take the E.'' And I would have done one of two things had I taken the E: I either would have taken it to 53rd and Lex and then switched to a 6 and to a 4, 5; or I would have taken it straight to the World Trade Center and walked.
And I remember feeling slightly guilty about it, but saying, ''You know what, I don't have a meeting until 11; I'm going to take my time'' -- not that I would get in at 11, but, ''I'm going to take my plain, old R train.'' And the doors on the E shut, and I waited for my R train.
It was quite a while after that that I thought to myself -- I mean, days and days, if not weeks, after that, that I remembered that whole thought process and thought, ''Now, what would have happened if I were on that E train?'' Because I realized that E train probably would have gotten to the World Trade Center, based on -- because I was probably getting on the subway a little before 8 -- at probably 10 to 9, or something like that.
8:14 a.m. United Airlines Flight 175 takes off from Logan with 51 passengers, 9 crew members and 5 hijackers.
8:19 a.m. Two flight attendants on Flight 11, Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney, tell American Airlines of the hijacking; the airline calls the F.B.I.
8:20 a.m. American Airlines Flight 77 takes off from Dulles International Airport near Washington carrying 53 passengers, 6 crew members and 5 hijackers.
8:42 a.m. United Airlines Flight 93 takes off from Newark International Airport, carrying 33 passengers, 7 crew members and 4 hijackers.
8:46 a.m. Flight 11 hits the north tower of the World Trade Center.
Barbara Friedman, lived two blocks from the World Trade Center
Everybody on the street was kind of -- had stopped because of the noise, and was looking up, either at the plane or for the plane, one or the other. Then, like a minute or so -- I don't know what the time span was, but suddenly there was this amazing explosion, and it was completely and totally surreal.
Keith C. Meerholz, vice president of property claims at Marsh & McLennan, 100th floor, north tower
I continued to read my paper and just followed the feet of people in front of me, and everyone -- and it had to be five or six of us -- went in a line over to our set of elevator banks and continuing from 78 to, the floors were 94 to a hundred, and the far right elevator was open at the time, and everyone continued to walk without stopping to get on the elevator, and I was the last person and still reading my newspaper.
I looked down and saw that the elevator was about a little more than half full, and only the space in front of the door was open, and I said, ''You know, I'm going to wait for the next elevator, because I don't want to squeeze on in front of all these people in going to the hundredth floor.''
And like most people do, you learn that you don't push the button for the up elevator again until that door closes. Otherwise, it keeps opening. So I waited until the door closed. The button was right next to it. I pushed the button, and I remember it turning red and heard the elevator to my left open, and as I turned my head, that's when the explosion went off.
Lucio Caputo, 78th floor, north tower
At a certain point, around a quarter to 9, there was this big explosion, and the tower was swinging to the left and to the right, and there was a lot of dust all over the place, and the sirens started ringing and the lights went off. I thought there was a big explosion next door, because it was so strong and so close.
So I went out of my office to look what was going on, and I could not see anything, because there was all this dust. There was, like, a very thick fog. But I heard some people crying or screaming, but I could not see them, and I thought that they were on the other side of the floor, where must have been an explosion. I didn't know what kind of explosion. So I went back to my office, and then decided I should go downstairs. So I took some towels, I took a bottle of mineral water, I took my cellular phone, I took a flashlight and I went down. And on my way out there was a phone call, and it was a friend of mine who was a journalist, who saw the event on CNN and called me and say, ''A plane hit the World Trade Center, get out as soon as possible. Run, run.''
So I ran the first 30 floors. There were not too many people, until I arrived at the 50th floor, and there were a lot of people, because there were all these people coming from all the different floors. At the same time there were people, coming down from the top floors, that were terribly hurt. There was one woman who was without any skin. It was like a boiled potato that loses all the skin. She was all raw meat.
Marin Alexandrov, business owner, 88 Fulton Street
We heard this big noise, ''boom.'' I thought that the crane right here on the next block fell down. So I ran outside, and I saw that the building was on fire. People were panicking, ''What's going on? What's going on?'' I was asking the same question, ''What happened?''
A friend of mine here, the barbershop, he told me the plane went and crashed into the building. So I went to the grocery store and I bought a camera. So I started taking pictures. I was looking at the people. It was pretty -- everybody thought there was an accident. So nobody was paying attention, not seriously. People were still walking, like, ''Wow, wow. What fools, they crashed into the building.''
John Guilfoy, employee at American Express, 40 Wall Street
That's when a colleague of mine was -- around 8:50 he stopped -- he sits next to me, and he said, ''Take a look out the window,'' and that's when we saw, you know, what looked like confetti, kind of a ticker-tape parade, which was very strange at the time.
8:50 a.m. President George W. Bush, who is about to read to second graders at Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Fla., is told that the World Trade Center has been hit by a plane.
Barbara Pickell, Blue Cross sales representative, north tower
Everybody started screaming, because they could see people jumping out of the building. I actually couldn't see anybody leaving a window, because it's too high up, you know, it's a quarter mile up, but as they came down you would start to see -- you would see that something dark was coming down, and then you'd suddenly realize it was a person. One person, in particular, fell more toward our side, and you know, I just have a really vivid memory of this person, this man, very tall and thin, with a three-piece dark -- dark three-piece suit on, and seemed to be clearly awake.
AnnMari Shannahan, Viant consultant working with Lehman Brothers, north tower
I heard strange echoing sounds, and then I looked up and actually saw somebody jump from the building. I was completely confused. I was thinking, if that's really a person jumping, then the Fire Department must already have nets at the base of the building. This was completely surreal. I thought there's no way that someone could or would jump from that high up into the plaza. I continued to think that this can't be happening, because no fire trucks have even pulled up yet, there are no police yet. The crowd was just gasping, and then it continued, one person after another. In the span of 15 minutes, one person after another was jumping out of the building.
Then I finally put together the sounds that I was hearing. It was actually the bodies hitting the ground that was making the terrible sound. The sound was echoing through the plaza. The impact of someone falling from that height was actually creating the most horrific sound.
9:03 a.m. Flight 175 hits the south tower.
Audrey J. Marcus, public programs coordinator at the Museum of Jewish Heritage
What is amazing is that in that moment, there was a moment before -- that we saw that plane, that second plane -- and there was a moment after, and it's like two different worlds, those two moments. I mean, literally, I can feel like I can remember the exact second when the whole world changed and my life changed forever. Because one minute, it was a building on fire and the next minute, none of us were safe. That's what it felt like. There was no sense of where to go, what to do, how to protect ourselves, what was going to happen next.
Amanda A. McGowan, investment banker at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, south tower, 89th floor
We waited for the elevator to go and it didn't go, and it was probably 9:01, and nothing's happening. And sometimes the doors were slow to close in those elevators, but not this slow, and we waited and it didn't close. Nobody at that moment said, ''Well, maybe we shouldn't get in this elevator.'' You know, we all kind of -- and suddenly the doors started to close, and you know, I was right near the doors, so they started to close, and they were about a foot and a half apart from being fully closed and suddenly they just -- bam! It was as if somebody had just taken a huge hand and just -- bam! -- the entire box we were in. I mean, you felt, like, Lilliputian. And everybody fell down.
Jerry Gombo, assistant chief of Emergency Medical Services
This is a sound that we heard while we were in the lobby as well -- thud, thud, thud -- and we couldn't even imagine why people would be jumping. I mean, we knew firefighters were going up to rescue them. You know, at the time we were getting reports that it was a commercial airline that hit the building. We didn't know the amount of people onboard, but we knew that it was, you know, a commercial airline, so we knew that there had to be a significant number of people.
No sooner did we get across the street, the second plane came in and hit the south tower, and although it hit the tower on the upper floors of the tower, we were able to actually feel the heat across the street from the explosion and the impact. As soon as that happened, we all knew that this was no longer an accident, and that, you know, we had something much bigger to contend with.
9:05 a.m. Mr. Bush is told that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center.
9:31 a.m. President Bush announces on television, ''Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country.''
9:36 a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney is evacuated to a bunker under the White House.
9:37 a.m. Flight 77 crashes into the Pentagon.
9:42 a.m. The Federal Aviation Administration grounds all the flights over and to the continental United States.
9:45 a.m. Evacuations begin in the White House and the Capitol.
9:57 a.m. Mr. Bush leaves Sarasota for Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.
Gamil M. Tawfik, founder of the Arabic Channel, looking at Manhattan from Brooklyn
By the time I arrived to Atlantic Avenue where I park my car, I saw the first tower -- the second tower fell first. And I was shocked. I thought this building would never fall, and I was so mad and upset, because I used to love this building. I used to eat in the Windows Around the World. I used to bank over there at Citibank. And any visitor coming from overseas, the first thing I take them to is the World Trade Center, actually, to impress them with the World Trade Center.
9:59 a.m. South tower collapses.
Louis Garcia, paramedic
I had six people in the ambulance and Steve in the back trying to rinse people off and cool them down. It was really terrible. He kept yelling at me to stay, to stay. I'll never forget the poor lady in the back of the ambulance, saying, ''Please get me out of here. Please get me out of here,'' screaming. So I looked at the supervisor and said, ''Listen, I'm going.'' I said, ''My unit number is Six-King.'' I said, ''I'll be at St. Vincent's, and I'll come right back. You're going to get a million ambulances here any second.'' And that's what I did.
10:03 a.m. After passengers on Flight 93 try to regain control, hijackers crash the plane in a field in Shanksville, Pa.
Zaheer Jaffery, worked on the 65th floor of the north tower
Most of the people that started out with me actually were able to leave quicker, because there were two or three times when we had to change the staircases. I mean, these staircases don't run from top to bottom. They are broken for structural reasons. I was walking very, very slow by now because I could barely walk. In the concourse level I was going so slow that two or three times people offered to carry me, and I said, ''No, no, maybe somebody else needs help.'' You know, the water was this much, up to my ankles, and it was slimy and slippery. My shoes were new and they were slipping. And by that time I knew that it was very serious because people were actually now beginning to run and you could hear the volunteers saying, ''Get out of the building before it falls. Get out of the building before it falls.'' I still didn't believe that the building could fall, but when I exited the building and I looked up, I said, ''This building will not last.''
I just put my head down and I was walking very, very slow. It was like 10:15 already in the morning. And I had gone maybe 200 yards away from the terrace area when the building came down.
10:28 a.m. North tower collapses.
Jane Stern, program director at New York Community Trust
I looked down -- it was a very, very clear day, and I looked down Sixth Avenue, I believe it was, and -- yes, I'm quite sure I was near 42nd Street. Looked down and I saw the second tower go down. You know, I could hardly take in what was happening, and I remember having this -- I understood that the tower was going on -- going down. I did not understand, really, that there were still people in it. I mean, it wasn't like I thought about it: ''Oh, well everybody's out.'' It's just that I kind of didn't take it in emotionally that there were people in it. It looked to me like it was just melting down.
Keith Murphy, firefighter, Engine 47, in north tower during south tower collapse
Then I thought it was kind of strange that I kind of heard the other guys, heard them coming to or we were calling each other's names out or something. I thought that we were all dead, but together, and I thought that was really strange that we were all -- you die with the people you're with. You're still with them. But then it started to come to me that it was more than that, that I was actually alive.
Robert Snyder, teacher at Rutgers Newark, commuted from the World Trade Center
And then I look over my shoulder and now Lower Manhattan is covered in apocalyptic smoke and flames. The second tower had just gone down; that was the rumble we felt. And I just looked back and saw this scene of horror to me: smoke, strange lights from flame, utterly, impossibly beautiful blue sky ultimately above it all.
It reminded me of a propaganda poster that was produced in World War I, which showed the Statue of Liberty as the victim of an attack, and a U-boat surfacing in New York Harbor, and it says, ''Don't Let It Happen Here.'' And my thought was, ''Holy (expletive), like it's happening here.''
Eric R. Mendelsohn, teacher at Columbia University School of the Arts, on Hudson Street
I remember people said, ''We'd better give blood. We'd better give blood.'' So everyone was going to go to St. Vincent's and give blood. This older, kind of typical, unflappable New Yorker lady, maybe 60-something years old, said, ''I used to give blood at the World Trade Center when I gave blood. Now they don't exist.'' It was only about 19 minutes, I think I wrote it down exactly, it was only about 19 minutes after they had collapsed, and I thought it was an odd thing to say. She was already talking about them not existing anymore. It was quite a feat to have incorporated that into her thinking already. I certainly wasn't thinking that way.
George W. Rutler, priest at the Roman Catholic Church of Our Savior, Park Avenue and 38th Street
The firemen were being lined up in front of the City Hall. And then they began coming asking me for blessing and for absolution. There were so many, I couldn't hear individual confessions, so I was giving absolution to the men. I remember saying to one that I'm sure he'd be safe but when he got home to go to -- I was giving him absolution -- when he got back home, to go to his parish and make a regular confession. These men knew what they were getting involved in. Otherwise, they wouldn't be going to confession.
10:57 a.m. From a firehouse on Houston Street, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani calls NY1 and tells people to evacuate Lower Manhattan. The city asks for help from the National Guard.
Rem de Lange, journalist in Brooklyn
What I saw when I biked back was people coming from the bridge, and those were the people who were covered with dust. The first people were somehow somewhere not too close to the buildings and had run over the bridge very fast, but this must have been around 11 o'clock, I think. These were the people who had been covered with dust and been evacuated by the police to just leave Manhattan over the bridges. And it was just such a strange sight, all those people in white or gray dust, and they lost their shoes. They were walking on their bare feet or socks, and they looked like zombies, not real people. They were in such a strange shape, and I was very reluctant to talk to them.
Howard Sage, teacher at New York City College of Technology in Downtown Brooklyn
When I came off of the Manhattan Bridge, I was at the entrance of Chinatown, and that was a very important moment for me, because I knew what had happened, and I said to myself, ''I'm going to walk down Canal Street, and I'm going to go toward the center of this and try to help somebody.''
I don't know why I didn't. I instead turned right on Bowery, and I regretted that ever since that moment.
11:40 a.m. Mr. Bush arrives at Barksdale Air Force Base; he leaves at 1:15 p.m.
Marilyn L. Cohen, banker at JPMorgan Chase, on a flight from London
Our plane was diverted to St. John's, Newfoundland. There was an announcement. We knew nothing. And in fact, when we left London it was a beautiful clear day. And in fact, when we were in the air initially, the pilot announced what fabulous flying weather it was. Consequently, when there was an announcement made at -- we landed at 1:30 Newfoundland time, which is 12 noon this time in the States.
John Dear, priest and volunteer at St. Vincent's Hospital
So I waited there for an hour, and then they said they were inundated with volunteers, even now, by 2 o'clock, by chaplains, doctors and nurses. But slowly they began to realize that nobody was coming. ''Where is everybody?'' they were asking. ''Where are the injured?'' Fear was setting in, or the realization that there weren't going to be a lot of bodies or injured people coming forth.
Judith S. Kaye, chief judge of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, the chief executive of the state court system
Our instinctive reaction, both the Court of Appeals judges and Administrative Judge Lippman, our instinctive reaction was: ''We will not close the courts. We will not capitulate to terrorists. It's important that we keep the courts open.'' It was very hard, at 2 o'clock, to go down into the courtroom, and we didn't. I don't think any lawyers were there. I don't remember. I doubt that any lawyers came to argue cases that day.
2:39 p.m. At a news conference, Mr. Giuliani says, ''The number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear ultimately.''
George Handzo, director of clinical services and institutional relations for the HealthCare Chaplaincy
I had no real appreciation for how many people got out, how many were in, but clearly there were, you know, there were people, a lot of people who were dead. So by midafternoon I went home, kind of realizing that there was, you know, there was going to be plenty of work to do after that. And I was able to make my way over to the C train, wherever that is on the West Side, which was running by then, 2, 3 in the afternoon.
I live in Connecticut, so I, I had been told, wrongly, that the Amtrak, that Metro-North was only running from 125th Street. As it turned out, it was already running from Grand Central. But, you know, be that as it may, I got the C train up to 125th Street, thought I would catch a bus across 125th Street, but because of the federal office building, I guess, they had closed 125th Street. So I walked, which was fine. I was happy to get out and walk across 125th Street to the Metro-North station, and went home.
3:07 p.m. Mr. Bush arrives at United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska; he leaves 90 minutes later.
Richard Westfal, head of emergency services at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan
Well, this one man, about 4 or 5 o'clock, was on a stretcher, a man in his 60s, and I just noticed that. Well, lo and behold, about an hour later, he's still there, and I went over to the nurse, not near him, but close to him, and I said, ''What is that man still doing here? What are you people doing?'' She kind of waved me over to the side, and I said, ''What's the matter here?''
She said that's, you know -- a man, he was in his, I'd say, early 60s -- and she said, ''Well, he's a fire chief for a fire company,'' and she said, ''You know, he led his group of 26 men into the second building, and he came out to coordinate with the Fire Department, and the building went down. They were all gone, and he's alive.''
Scott P. Strauss, police officer with the Emergency Service Unit
I took a deep breath of dusty, smoke-filled, soot-filled air, and then I heard myself say, ''I love you,'' to my wife and my kids, and I started to crawl into the hole. I didn't think I was ever coming out of there.
We had to crawl down on an angle about 20 feet, maybe a little further, over twisted steel, around concrete slabs, and over just piles of rubble. I hit a wall, turned to the left, went about 10 feet to the left, again around stuff, over stuff, and there was what was left of an elevator shaft that went down -- how many levels, I don't know. The doors were twisted open, the elevator wasn't there, but the opening was there. The rubble pile that we were on, that we were in, was on fire. When we turned left and crawled that 10 feet past the elevator shaft, there was a police officer buried from the waist down. He was dead. His gun was empty. It looked like he was shooting warning shots to try to draw attention. To my left and a little further up was another police officer who was buried in the rubble. He was alive.
5:20 p.m. 7 World Trade Center collapses.
Mark Eichler, student and volunteer E.M.T., as 7 World Trade Center collapsed
I think it actually came down at 5:20; I was literally a half block away and I hear these tremendous jet engines whirring. And I said, ''That's odd because all the planes have been grounded for the day.'' And it wasn't a jet engine, it was a 40-something-story building coming down. And I saw about 200, 300 people running in my direction, yelling, ''It's coming down, it's coming down.'' And the visibility was nil because, again, at that point, the smoke had really picked up.
Ernest M. Ehlberg Jr., firefighter with Engine 38 and Ladder 51
No. 7 had come down. Everybody ran away. We tried to get away from all the dust, and it just caught right up to you. So we actually got into a vestibule of where there were some guys, doormen. They let us in and let us wash up, because our eyes were burning, and we were just white as ghosts.
6:54 p.m. Mr. Bush arrives at the White House.
Zette Emmons, staff member at the Newark Museum
There was a bus that was going down Second Avenue, so I got on that. It didn't follow the normal route. It dumped me off somewhere on Avenue A. So then I walked through the housing projects. I just snaked my way through the projects, like a horse with blinders, with only one thought: to get back to the barn, to get back home.
So I came around that corner down there at Dover and Water Streets, at about 7 o'clock, at about dusk, and everything was covered, it was just completely -- no one, no one, absolutely deserted.
Mary Baez, resident at Gov. Alfred E. Smith Houses near 1 Police Plaza
My first instinct was to notify my family members that I was O.K. My brother had called me, so I didn't need to call anyone. He told me everyone was O.K., but I let him know that mainly we were O.K. We had a fair amount, supply of food, so for the next six months we would have been safe.
Then I just really became bored, just listening to it over and over, because it kind of bothered me a lot that people are that evil. But it was nothing I could do, not even to go and help. I did not think of that. You know, I just figured I would be in the way, so I didn't do anything. Then that night, about 8:20, my telephone went out. That's when reality set in. I went crazy.
8:30 p.m. Mr. Bush addresses the nation, calling America ''the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world.'' He vows to direct full resources to finding and bringing to justice those behind the ''evil acts'' of Sept. 11.
Art Spiegelman, comic artist
By the end of that day -- I could actually find out by looking on the dates on my computer sketches -- I was working on the machine, trying to understand what I might be drawing of all this, and it was really more of, like, knitting, like some kind of busy work. Like when you say, what was my work prior to that, on Sept. 10 I had been working on a cover that actually came out on TheNew Yorker a few months later, which was for a special money and culture issue, or art and commerce issue, or something, of TheNew Yorker, in which I was working on a bunch of Greek muses all chained together, being led by the muse of money. That was Sept. 10, so that was on my table, and it was like, ''O.K., that's not due anymore.''
The attractiveness of the day was somehow the central thing for me, so I began trying to, like, make this sketch of this blue sky and very sunny Lower Manhattan, with a kind of shrouded, a funeral shroud over these towers that were kind of a ghostly hovering above the skyline, like looking up into the sky. I kept trying to work at that, and realized I didn't quite remember what Lower Manhattan's buildings looked like below the trade center, below that point.
Brian Conley, TriBeCa resident
We finally arrived upstate at 10 at night, 13 hours from when we began. When we got into the house I called my mother immediately to tell her that we were O.K. While I was telling her about what had happened, she kept dismissing everything I was saying. I said, ''Hmm, this is very strange.'' She didn't seem very concerned that we were safe. She eventually says, ''Did you hear about Karleton?'' I said, ''No. What are you talking about?'' This whole time, we were worried about getting ourselves out of this situation and thinking about New York City and how we're going to get back to the city and maybe deal with the situation there and help people, and it never occurred to me that there could be someone in my family that would be involved in this. She said that Karleton, my daughter's husband, just happened to be on the first plane.
Michele Fitzsimmons, firefighter
We did a lot of wandering around, walking around in an apocalyptic world. There were crushed cars, cars on fire, gutted cars that had been on fire and burnt themselves out, or had been put out. Finally -- I guess it must have been about 11 at night -- we finally made it over to the West Side Highway. We came out about four or five blocks above where the towers had been. I think that was the first time it hit me that they were really, completely gone. There was really nothing but a big, big, big pile of nothing.
Oral Histories of 9/11: Voices for the Future
In the first hours after two planes hit the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001, many New Yorkers were concerned with the present -- getting home, reaching loved ones, trying to make sense of what had happened. But at the Center for Oral History at Columbia University, the focus had already shifted to the future and what the attacks would mean for historians in 50 years.
Three days after the attacks, the September 11, 2001 Oral History Narrative and Memory Project -- founded by Mary Marshall Clark, director of Columbia's Oral History Research Office, and Peter Bearman, a Columbia sociologist who led the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy -- started gathering stories from New Yorkers in an effort to record personal reactions before they were completely shaped by the news media.
The project received a $50,000 start-up grant from the National Science Foundation, and in the first year, more than 440 people gave interviews to more than 60 volunteers. The study later received financing from the Rockefeller Foundation, The New York Times Company Foundation and Columbia. Now, the project contains more than 22,000 pages of archived transcripts and 900 hours of recordings, including 23 hours of video.
''I was thinking of not so much telling the story in the present,'' Ms. Clark said, ''but gathering the stories in the present for the future.''
By the time the project ended in 2005, 202 people had agreed to be interviewed again, allowing historians to study how narratives changed with time. In related projects, the center also interviewed government officials and response workers. Many of the interviewers were trained on the spot, instructed to focus on listening and to place the emotional response to the attacks within the context of life events. Ms. Clark said they were told to see the speakers not as victims, but as ''agents of telling.''
Since the attacks, other archives of oral histories have been built, including interviews with responders collected by the city, a video collection called ''Voices of 9.11'' and audio clips gathered by StoryCorps for the National September 11 Memorial and Museum and published online by a Web site in Brooklyn, Broadcastr.
But Dr. Bearman said the Columbia project, with its quick response and research focus, became a model for similar studies, like those begun after Hurricane Katrina.
''We made something for some unknown future,'' he said. Nineteen of the oral histories will be published this month in a book, ''After the Fall: New Yorkers Remember September 2001 and the Years That Followed.''
Though many other oral history studies, including those related to 9/11, sent out broad requests for people who were interested in telling their stories, the Narrative and Memory Project actively solicited a wide range of New York voices. People who often hesitated to speak, including Muslims, Arab Americans, Latinos and Sikhs, were asked to give their accounts. The project conducted interviews with teachers, taxi drivers, psychologists, firefighters, police officers, paramedics and recovery workers.
And yet, after analyzing the transcripts and the follow-up interviews, what Dr. Bearman and Ms. Clark discovered was that the trauma of 9/11 may not have changed the lives of individuals as much as people expected at the time. Though the project does verify the importance of 9/11 as a historical event, it also helps clarify the conception that the attacks were irreversibly cataclysmic for New Yorkers. For the most part, Dr. Bearman said, ''life goes on.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The 8:50 a.m. entry in an earlier version of this article erroneously stated that President Bush was reading to second graders at that time. In fact, he was about to read to them.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A chronology of events last Sunday with an article about oral histories of the Sept. 11 attacks misstated President George W. Bush's whereabouts at 8:50 a.m. when he was told that a plane had hit the north tower of the World Trade Center. He was about to enter Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Fla., to visit a second-grade class; he was not reading to the students at that time. (At 9:05 a.m., he was listening to the students read when he was told that the south tower had been hit by a plane.)

HEADLINE: As Auto Show Opens, an Industry's Balance Shifts

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
WHEN the 64th Frankfurt Motor Show opens on Tuesday for two days of press previews, some 50 automakers and specialty builders will begin unwrapping upwards of 100 new models for journalists.
The numbers are not only impressive -- they are significant.
Why? Well, if the sheer volume of vehicles introduced at various auto shows around the world in recent years is a telling indicator, it would seem that the axis of the industry has shifted. 
Until about 2008, when the worldwide economy started to sour, the North American International Auto Show in Detroit was asserting its role as the must-see of all industry salons. But the retreat in domestic car sales changed the stature of Detroit's show -- and the enthusiasm of the automakers that support it financially.
''I don't know that the momentum or power has shifted from Detroit to Europe as much as it's just shifted all over the world,'' said Rebecca Lindland, director for automotive research at IHS Global Insight.
She noted that when the schedules of the New York and Shanghai shows conflicted earlier this year, many senior executives skipped the American event and headed to China instead.
''That spoke volumes,'' she added.
The Detroit show's stature was unavoidably damaged by the bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Motors, of course. Ford and G.M. had already scaled back operations, shedding their international brands -- Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, Saab and Volvo -- and domestic nameplates like Hummer, Mercury, Pontiac and Saturn also disappeared.
As the number of new models introduced in Detroit dwindled to a few dozen, 80 to 100 debutantes seemed to become the norm at shows in Geneva, Paris and Frankfurt. The China auto show, which alternates between Beijing and Shanghai, is also increasing in size and significance.
The Americans, with the possible exception of Ford, would appear to have less to show the motoring world.
While Ford has an important design study, the Evos, to introduce, Chrysler has only a high-horsepower Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 to promote in Frankfurt. G.M. will show a European version of the Chevrolet Malibu, and its German subsidiary, Opel, will offer an electric design study.
That is in stark contrast to European automakers, particularly the Germans, who have so much to show this year that they outgrew the sprawling Messe Frankfurt convention center and its 3.6 million square feet of exhibition space.
Audi felt compelled to build a new exhibition area -- complete with its own oblong test track -- in an open area outside the existing halls. The company, which is on a sales-record streak, is introducing seven new models at Frankfurt, including electrics like the A2 hatchback and city runabouts called the ''urban concept'' and ''urban concept spyder.''
Audi is but one of the Volkswagen Group brands -- including Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, SEAT and Skoda -- that will be introducing new models or showing concepts at Frankfurt. VW itself is hoping to reclaim the magic of the original Beetle by introducing a new family of small cars called Up. VW will also suggest new directions in personal mobility with the NILS concept, a single-seat, outboard-wheel city E.V.
BMW is giving an coming-out party for an entire new i-line of premium electric mobility solutions. These include the i3 compact and i8 sports cars, both previewed at press functions in July.
Mercedes-Benz, which has done well with its high-powered AMG models, is planning to introduce more of them in Frankfurt: a roadster version of the hot-selling SLS and an SLK55. Also promised is a fuel-cell concept and a new B-Class compact.
If it seems as though German manufacturers are on the leading edge of new, gas-free urban transportation solutions, it is due in no small part to the European Union's strict pollution controls.
''Today, all the innovation in the auto industry is coming from the German manufacturers,'' said Vianney Rabhi, head of strategy for MCE-5, a French engine development company. ''A little from Japan. None from the U.S.''
A look at what the automakers of other countries are presenting -- or not presenting -- in Frankfurt is instructive.
Japanese automakers seem to be in a bit of a retreat in Europe, and to some degree, they may be holding back vehicles for the Tokyo auto show in December. Nissan, Mitsubishi and Suzuki are not officially introducing vehicles here, though a souped-up Suzuki Swift Sport will be on display. Toyota is presenting new Prius variations, Lexus a new GS hybrid and F Sport model, and Mazda its new CX-5 compact crossover.
The Koreans, on the other hand, are ascendant. Kia is showing a four-door coupe concept, expected to be named the Veredus; Hyundai will take the wraps off the new i30, roughly equivalent to the Elantra, and two other models.
China is represented only by Chang-an, which hopes to spark European interest in a small sedan called the C201. Europe has proved to be an especially resistant market for the Chinese.
Volvo, the Swedish automaker that is now Chinese-owned, is bringing a luxury sedan, the Concept Universe, that was -- take note here -- first shown in China last April. Sweden's other carmaker, Saab, withdrew from the Frankfurt show in recent weeks and seems to be headed for bankruptcy.
Italy is well represented by the Fiat Group, which is introducing new models from several of its brands. Among French automakers, Citroen will display the Tubik design for a vanlike creation, Renault has the Frendzy futuristic family mover and Peugeot will have its HX1 concept.
Britain-based carmakers will have a surprisingly strong showing in Frankfurt with the new Aston Martin V12 Zagato, Bentley GTC, Jaguar C-X16, Land Rover Defender concept, Lotus Elise, Mini Coupe and other new models.
The show opens to the public on Saturday and runs through Sunday, Sept. 25.

Time magazine called it a day of infamy, evoking Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Pearl Harbor. But Americans did not flock to military recruiting stations after 9/11 the way they did in 1941.
Enlistments rose in the months after the attacks, but only modestly. Over the next year, and over the next decade, the work of war fell to a relative few, with less than 1 percent of the nation deploying in Iraq or Afghanistan between 2001 and 2011.
Who, then, were those volunteers -- the first to enlist, the first to taste battle, the first to die?
Studies show that starting in 2002, Army recruits scored higher on qualification tests, had high school diplomas more often and came from higher-income areas than in previous years -- indications that military service was attracting a broader cross-section of Americans, experts say. 
But that wave of interest -- spurred by a weak economy in 2002 as well as patriotism -- did not last, said Beth Asch, an economist with the RAND Corporation who has studied military recruitment.
In 2005, when civil war raged in Iraq and American casualty rates were hitting new highs, the Army, the largest armed service, missed its recruiting goal by nearly 7,000 soldiers. The quality of recruits fell as well. It took the collapse of the stock and housing markets in 2008 to fuel a new tide of enlistments.
Today, the data points of war continue to rise, like grim statistics from an endless sports season that no one seems to follow anymore. More than two million sent to Iraq or Afghanistan. More than 6,000 killed. About 44,000 wounded in action. One in five returning with post-traumatic stress, major depression or traumatic brain injury. More than 1,000 missing a limb.
But in those numbers are also stories of people who learned to cope with, and sometimes overcome, the heartbreak and wounds of war.
Janina Bitz Vasquez lost a husband, one of the first to die in Iraq, but found solace in her children and religion. Christian Bengtson saw his twin brother, Ivan, injured in Afghanistan and lost his faith in the mission there, yet emerged devoted to his fellow soldiers. Bonnie Velez joined for the benefits but became part of a wartime Navy. Evan Bozajian volunteered for combat in Iraq and came home with injuries from his head to the bottoms of his feet.
But he is getting better.
The Twins
It was Christian Bengtson's idea. He and his identical twin, Ivan, had been inseparable since birth, as infants sharing a bedroom, as doubles partners in tennis, as musicians in the school orchestra. From astronomy to Chuck Norris films, the Bengtson twins indulged each other's shifting passions. They were best friends.
They were born and raised in Puerto Rico, the only children of a Swedish father and a Guatemalan mother. In high school, their parents moved to the Gulf Coast town of Seminole, Fla., where they were in class together senior year when the twin towers fell.
And then Christian heard about a new fast-track program to train Special Forces soldiers, the legendary Green Berets. Intrigued by the idea of military service, attracted to the elite nature of Special Forces and hankering for adventure, he began talking with Army recruiters. By March 2002, he had decided to enlist. All that remained was to convince Ivan.
They were planning to attend different colleges in the fall. Why not stick together for a bit longer? Ivan considered for a moment that his brother had gone insane, then said yes. Their parents grudgingly agreed. They were 17.
And stay together they did, from boot camp through the grueling Special Forces qualification course. Instructors pitted them against each other in daily competitions intended to weed out the weak. But the brothers had a plan: Christian wins today, Ivan tomorrow. Out of a class of 300 soldiers, only 20 graduated two years later, the Bengtson boys among them.
Impatient to join their unit, the Seventh Special Forces Group, the brothers agreed to go to southern Afghanistan in 2004. Ivan's job, on a large base in Kandahar, was supposed to be safer, while Christian was doing patrols in the hinterland. But on April 5, 2005, it was Christian who was summoned to the radio room because his brother's team had had an accident in which a soldier was pinned under a Humvee. Then he heard his brother's call sign.
''I was so hurt and worried, I just sat in bed crying and worrying and hoping he would make it,'' Christian recalled.
It took 10 operations to fix the right side of Ivan's face, which had been crushed by the rolling Humvee. He left the Army in 2007, went to college and expects to graduate in December with a degree in accounting and finance.
Today, Ivan still has pain in his shoulder, hip and neck, herniated discs in his back and double vision in his right eye. Yet he is surprisingly upbeat, convinced that his brush with death taught him to appreciate ''every meal you get, every day you have.''
He tells his brother he does not blame him for talking him into enlisting.
Christian did one more short deployment to Afghanistan, then left the Army and earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry. The two tours made him wonder why America was still there. ''Let's stop focusing on rebuilding a nation,'' he said. ''We need to come back and start rebuilding our own.''
But he also learned, partly through his brother's injuries, that he was fascinated by medicine. Now 27, he is applying to medical school, and says he may sign up again for the Army -- not to fight, but to help wounded soldiers.
''It's not for me to support our wars,'' he said. ''It's more like: Hey, this guy has sacrificed everything. Let's give this guy a chance to come back home.''
The New Yorker
Bonnie Velez grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of immigrants and poverty. She was struggling to pay community college tuition when a cousin made a suggestion: Join the Navy; the benefits are great. She did.
Under the delayed entry program, she was to begin boot camp in the fall of 2001, at the age of 19. On the blue-sky morning of Sept. 11, she was heading to her recruiter's office in Lower Manhattan when she emerged from the subway station and was enveloped by an angry cloud of debris and ash. The World Trade Center was in flames. Suddenly being in the military meant possibly going to war.
She was not much interested in fighting but could not bring herself to break her commitment to the Navy.
''I have my family and my cousin relying on me; I don't want to let them down,'' she recalled thinking.
She wound up on an aircraft carrier, the John C. Stennis, helping launch and retrieve aircraft on the flight deck. It was man's work, they told her, but she liked it. Then she got pregnant and returned to a desk job in San Diego before leaving the Navy in 2007.
She eventually returned to New York with her son, jobless and homeless. A service organization found her a furnished apartment.
''I think 9/11 gave me courage,'' she said. ''To know that if something is not right, eventually it will work itself out.''
The Officer
He had graduated from West Point, served eight years as a Black Hawk pilot and wanted to try his hand in business. It was June 2001, and Joel Allmandinger was leaving the Army.
He was in California for a wedding when the attacks occurred. The groom, a firefighter, held a vigil at his wedding and introduced Mr. Allmandinger as a soldier, though he no longer was one. And that troubled him.
''I didn't feel part of that brotherhood of the uniform anymore,'' he recalled. ''These guys could immediately identify with what happened in 9/11.''
So back home in eastern Pennsylvania, he signed up for the National Guard. On his first day of duty, he wore his uniform into a store and someone thanked him for his service.
''It was odd and uncomfortable,'' he recalled. ''But when I got into the car and started driving to the armory, I thought, 'That was neat.' ''
His unit deployed twice: first in Kosovo in 2004, to fill in for an active-duty unit being sent to Iraq; and then in Iraq in 2009, where he flew dozens of missions.
A one-year commitment turned into a decade. Today he is a lieutenant colonel and battalion commander. He is also the director of sales for a national food company and a father of two.
''I think I have a much, much better appreciation for the civilian soldier,'' he said. ''In some ways, I see it is an even bigger commitment, the sacrifices people have. There is a duality to it that is tough.''
The Widow
Their marriage was falling apart. Janina Bitz was a stripper who had cheated on her husband, a Marine, while he was deployed in the summer of 2001. Her husband, Staff Sgt. Michael Bitz, returned that October to discover her infidelity, and then confess his own.
As the rest of the nation was trying to pick itself up after 9/11, they tried to salvage their marriage. He approached her with an ultimatum: join him in Christianity or get a divorce. She got baptized.
They joined a tiny church near Camp Lejeune, N.C., and renewed their vows. She became pregnant with twins. As war with Iraq loomed ever closer, their marriage was reborn. ''Nothing short of a miracle,'' Janina said.
Then on New Year's Day 2003, he got the call. ''I just seen the look on his face, and that was enough,'' she recalled. ''He said, 'We're deploying in 12 days.' And he said, 'Please, don't be mad at me if I don't come home.' ''
He had seen that day coming and tried his best to avoid it. But his request to stay home with his pregnant wife and 2-year-old son was rejected. So was a petition to transfer to an aviation unit. ''At the end of the day, that was his order and he was going to fulfill that commitment,'' she said.
The twins, a boy and a girl, were born on Feb. 21, 2003, while he was in Kuwait. He called by satellite phone, one of their last conversations. A month later, he died when his convoy came under ambush in Nasiriyah, making Sergeant Bitz one of the first Americans killed in action in Iraq.
''The death of my husband definitely shook my faith,'' she said. But over time, she resumed her conversations with God, and they gave her peace. ''Nothing made sense but him,'' she said.
A native of Tasmania, she had applied for permanent residency with her husband as sponsor, but it took an act of Congress to secure it after his death. She fell in love with another Marine, Capt. Michael Vasquez, and they married and had a child. Over the coming years, he deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving her ''an emotional mess'' each time.
This June he left the Marine Corps, and they now plan to move with their four children to Tasmania and start a farm near her parents' home.
Sergeant Bitz was posthumously awarded a Silver Star, and Camp Lejeune named one of its schools for him. Ms. Vasquez, 33, likes to remind her children of those things.
''Michael Bitz is still a part of this family,'' she said. ''He's in each one of the children. We talk about him, we discuss him, we honor him.''
The Guardsman
He was a recent graduate of a military high school, living with his parents in Southern California and enjoying an aimless, booze-laced respite from the world.
But on the morning of 9/11, Evan Bozajian saw his mother crying as images of the World Trade Center attack played on the television. ''The first emotion is anger,'' he recalled. And soon came another: Time to enlist.
''I'm like: What am I doing?'' he said. ''Nothing.''
He took a few months to rebuild the muscle of his football days. Then he failed a drug test, which set him back a few months more. But by December 2002, he was in.
He chose the California National Guard, thinking he might need the escape hatch of part-time duty. But he decided that what he really wanted was to go to war. He raised his hand and was sent to Iraq in early 2004, just as the insurgency was gaining steam.
He was attached to the Third Infantry Division in and around Baghdad, where his unit found roadside bombs a near-daily routine. ''We wished for a firefight,'' he said. ''You can't shoot at a bomb.''
Then on Aug. 20, 2005, he was sitting in the turret of a Humvee when a bomb exploded beneath the engine. Hot shrapnel it ripped into his shoulder and hands.
In the helicopter to the hospital, another soldier, who had been wounded later, called his name, and Evan turned to see a high school classmate. The soldier died while Evan was holding his hand.
Despite injuries that included broken legs, an injured back, a concussion and shrapnel in his upper body, Evan persuaded his superiors to let him stay. But just a few weeks later, he heard radio chatter that a soldier had been killed by a roadside bomb. It was Mike Sonoda Jr., Evan's best friend in the Army.
''After that,'' he said, ''every day was hard.'' The Army sent him home.
At an Army hospital in Texas, Evan was put on painkillers, antidepressants and sleeping pills. He added liquor to the pharmaceutical bouillabaisse. He kept thinking that he should have died instead of those other men.
''No matter how many times my parents say that I survived for a reason,'' he said, ''none of that matters to me.''
Today, he is 28, out of the Army and attending auto mechanic classes at a community college. He struggles with anger, lost memory, back pain and a constant tingling in his right leg. He still cannot bring himself to visit Mike Sonoda's grave nearby.
Yet for all his injuries, he says he is glad he served. He worries that American troops will leave Iraq and Afghanistan before real stability arrives. And he wonders whether typical Americans ever think about the wars.
He struggles to express his feelings. He wants people to worry less about ''Escalades and big-screen TVs,'' and appreciate more of what they already have. To think about the world now and then. To be, ''I don't know, not the way too many people here are already. Maybe more informed.''

HEADLINE: The Biographer's New Best Friend

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MIHM

 BODY:
Stephen Mihm is an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia and the co-author of ''Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance.''
LEGEND has it that the newspaper mogul Joseph Pulitzer stumbled into success, buying The New York World on a lark in 1883. But this didn't seem right to James McGrath Morris, who began working on a biography of Pulitzer a decade ago. Pulitzer was a deliberate, calculating man; impulse purchases weren't part of his modus operandi.
Mr. Morris suspected that one place to look for countervailing evidence was the arrival notices that 19th-century newspapers would print whenever someone significant checked into a local hotel -- a forerunner to the tweet, enabling friends to know someone was in town and where to find them. If Pulitzer visited New York City to check out takeover targets prior to 1883, he might surface in these mundane social announcements. The problem was, The New York Times and other papers didn't index such quotidian matters. So scanning tens of thousands of announcements for a single name wasn't feasible. 
As luck would have it, Mr. Morris was wrestling with this question just as several ambitious efforts got under way to digitize thousands of historical newspapers. These new databases enable researchers to perform keyword searches in some of the thousands of newspapers printed in the United States since the colonial era; what would have taken lifetimes of relentless reading could suddenly be completed in seconds.
Mr. Morris searched for Pulitzer and immediately turned up evidence that he had been staying in New York City hotels a year before his famous acquisition, scouting out possible deals; the persistent myth of Pulitzer's precipitate purchase had been demolished.
''That's when I realized that these databases would change the work we do,'' Mr. Morris said.
For generations, biographers have used the same methods to conduct research: they waded through the paper trail left by their subject, piecing together a life from epistolary fragments. Based on what they found, they might troll through newspapers from specific dates in the hope of finding coverage of their subject. There were no new-fangled technologies that promised to transform their research, no way of harnessing machines to reveal new layers of historical truth.
That's all starting to change. Several campaigns to digitize newspapers -- Readex's ''American Historical Newspapers'' available by subscription at research universities, or the free ''Chronicling America'' collection available at the Library of Congress -- have the potential to revolutionize biographical research. Newspapers are often described as the ''first draft of history,'' and thanks to these new tools, biographers can tap them in ways that an earlier generation of scholars could only have dreamed of.
Mr. Morris isn't alone. Other biographers have found that digital newspapers not only shed new light on well-known lives, but they can also help circumvent the archival gate-keeping that is common with famous figures.
When these famous people (or their children) gather their papers, they usually leave out or even destroy anything embarrassing or incriminating. But the staggering volume of printed material contained in historical newspapers means that evidence of illicit trysts, business deals gone bad and scandals forgotten will likely surface somewhere, somehow. It may not have made the national papers, but if some peccadillo was mentioned in a small-town paper in Arizona in 1872, it can now be rediscovered with minimal effort.
It's also possible for biographers to find writings that previous biographers have missed. Joshua Kendall, who recently completed a biography of Noah Webster, used the Readex database to dig up numerous articles by Webster that weren't part of the carefully curated collection bequeathed by his descendants. He ran searches on some of Webster's newspaper pseudonyms -- it was common in the late 18th and early 19th centuries for public figures to sign articles with a pen name; Webster liked to use ''Rusticus.'' Mr. Kendall hit further pay dirt when he noticed that Webster was fond of certain turns of phrase: entering those into databases yielded more writings probably penned by him.
MR. KENDALL even found articles by Webster in which he contemplated the pitfalls of compiling his famous American dictionary -- Webster, it turns out, was a bit obsessed with the possibility that he would die before the project was completed, an understandable concern given that he took the time to learn 26 languages along the way.
Perhaps the biggest dividend of digging in digitized newspapers was the light it could shed on figures whose papers weren't considered important enough to preserve: African-Americans, for example, or women.
Graham Hodges, a professor of history at Colgate, found this out while writing a biography of David Ruggles, an important but largely neglected African-American antislavery activist in 19th-century New York City. Using digital newspaper archives, Professor Hodges reconstructed the elaborate networks that linked Ruggles with other, better known activists.
The result is a much more nuanced insight into antislavery activism than was ever thought possible. ''I suspect that that the history of reform movements such as the Underground Railroad will be rewritten once historians appreciate how famous and little-known activists communicated through the newspapers,'' Professor Hodges said.
These new tools aren't perfect; many newspapers have yet to be digitized, and many researchers quickly find that the optical-character-recognition technology used to ''read'' the millions of pages can sometimes misread, and skip, key words: ''Pulitzer'' might look like ''Pulltzen,'' for example.
And woe to the biographer whose subject has an ordinary name. ''There were only three or four people with the name of Pulitzer,'' Mr. Morris said. ''If your subject's name is John Smith, these sources will be of limited use to you.''
Above all, without a clear understanding of the sources you're searching in the first place, it's hard to harness the power of digital archives. Simply typing in a name is akin to using Google: you may turn up material, but unless you know how to fit it all together, it's next to worthless.
Still, Mr. Morris is optimistic. ''Until recently, the newspapers that we were using were like the cliche of the tip of the iceberg: we could only see what was above water. Now we can see things beneath the water.''
And they can be seen almost instantaneously. With a few keystrokes, the aspiring biographer can resurrect the dead with far greater ease and speed than an army of research assistants. In the process, the fusty, antiquated art of researching and writing biographies may come to seem, of all things, cutting-edge.

HEADLINE: In Case You Wondered, A Real Human Being Wrote This Column

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
''WISCONSIN appears to be in the driver's seat en route to a win, as it leads 51-10 after the third quarter. Wisconsin added to its lead when Russell Wilson found Jacob Pedersen for an eight-yard touchdown to make the score 44-3 ... . ''
Those words began a news brief written within 60 seconds of the end of the third quarter of the Wisconsin-U.N.L.V. football game earlier this month. They may not seem like much -- but they were written by a computer.
The clever code is the handiwork of Narrative Science, a start-up in Evanston, Ill., that offers proof of the progress of artificial intelligence -- the ability of computers to mimic human reasoning. 
The company's software takes data, like that from sports statistics, company financial reports and housing starts and sales, and turns it into articles. For years, programmers have experimented with software that wrote such articles, typically for sports events, but these efforts had a formulaic, fill-in-the-blank style. They read as if a machine wrote them.
But Narrative Science is based on more than a decade of research, led by two of the company's founders, Kris Hammond and Larry Birnbaum, co-directors of the Intelligent Information Laboratory at Northwestern University, which holds a stake in the company. And the articles produced by Narrative Science are different.
''I thought it was magic,'' says Roger Lee, a general partner of Battery Ventures, which led a $6 million investment in the company earlier this year. ''It's as if a human wrote it.''
Experts in artificial intelligence and language are also impressed, if less enthralled. Oren Etzioni, a computer scientist at the University of Washington, says, ''The quality of the narrative produced was quite good,'' as if written by a human, if not an accomplished wordsmith. Narrative Science, Mr. Etzioni says, points to a larger trend in computing of ''the increasing sophistication in automatic language understanding and, now, language generation.''
The innovative work at Narrative Science raises the broader issue of whether such applications of artificial intelligence will mainly assist human workers or replace them. Technology is already undermining the economics of traditional journalism. Online advertising, while on the rise, has not offset the decline in print advertising. But will ''robot journalists'' replace flesh-and-blood journalists in newsrooms?
The leaders of Narrative Science emphasized that their technology would be primarily a low-cost tool for publications to expand and enrich coverage when editorial budgets are under pressure. The company, founded last year, has 20 customers so far. Several are still experimenting with the technology, and Stuart Frankel, the chief executive of Narrative Science, wouldn't name them. They include newspaper chains seeking to offer automated summary articles for more extensive coverage of local youth sports and to generate articles about the quarterly financial results of local public companies.
''Mostly, we're doing things that are not being done otherwise,'' Mr. Frankel says.
The Narrative Science customers that are willing to talk do fit that model. The Big Ten Network, a joint venture of the Big Ten Conference and Fox Networks, began using the technology in the spring of 2010 for short recaps of baseball and softball games. They were posted on the network's Web site within a minute or two of the end of each game; box scores and play-by-play data were used to generate the brief articles. (Previously, the network relied on online summaries provided by university sports offices.)
As the spring sports season progressed, the computer-generated articles improved, helped by suggestions from editors on the network's staff, says Michael Calderon, vice president for digital and interactive media at the Big Ten Network.
The Narrative Science software can make inferences based on the historical data it collects and the sequence and outcomes of past games. To generate story ''angles,'' explains Mr. Hammond of Narrative Science, the software learns concepts for articles like ''individual effort,'' ''team effort,'' ''come from behind,'' ''back and forth,'' ''season high,'' ''player's streak'' and ''rankings for team.'' Then the software decides what element is most important for that game, and it becomes the lead of the article, he said. The data also determines vocabulary selection. A lopsided score may well be termed a ''rout'' rather than a ''win.''
''Composition is the key concept,'' Mr. Hammond says. ''This is not just taking data and spilling it over into text.''
Last fall, the Big Ten Network began using Narrative Science for updates of football and basketball games. Those reports helped drive a surge in referrals to the Web site from Google's search algorithm, which highly ranks new content on popular subjects, Mr. Calderon says. The network's Web traffic for football games last season was 40 percent higher than in 2009.
Hanley Wood, a trade publisher for the construction industry, began using the program in August to provide monthly reports on more than 350 local housing markets, posted on its site, builderonline.com. The company had long collected the data, but hiring people to write trend articles would have been too costly, says Andrew Reid, president of Hanley Wood's digital media and market intelligence unit.
Mr. Reid says Hanley Wood worked with Narrative Science for months to fine-tune the software for construction. A former executive at Thomson Reuters, he says he was struck by the high quality of the articles.
''They got over a big linguistic hurdle,'' he observes. ''The stories are not duplicates by any means.''
He was also impressed by the cost. Hanley Wood pays Narrative Science less than $10 for each article of about 500 words -- and the price will very likely decline over time. Even at $10, the cost is far less, by industry estimates, than the average cost per article of local online news ventures like AOL's Patch or answer sites, like those run by Demand Media.
NARRATIVE SCIENCE'S ambitions include moving further up the ladder of quality. Both Mr. Birnbaum and Mr. Hammond are professors of journalism as well as computer science. The company itself is an outgrowth of collaboration between the two schools.
''This kind of technology can deepen journalism,'' says John Lavine, dean of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern.
Mr. Hammond says the combination of advances in its writing engine and data mining can open new horizons for computer journalism, exploring ''correlations that you did not expect'' -- conceptually similar to ''Freakonomics,'' by two humans, the economist Steven D. Levitt and the author Stephen J. Dubner.
Mr. Hammond cited a media maven's prediction that a computer program might win a Pulitzer Prize in journalism in 20 years -- and he begged to differ.
''In five years,'' he says, ''a computer program will win a Pulitzer Prize -- and I'll be damned if it's not our technology.''
Should it happen, the prize, of course, would not be awarded to abstract code, but to its human creators.

HEADLINE: Mr. Rodgers's Neighborhood

BYLINE: By NILE RODGERS

 BODY:
It took me a long time to realize that the things my parents did were not exactly normal. I was about 7 years old, and it was the tail end of the 1950s, when it started to dawn on me that they were . . . well, let's just say they were different. For instance: my friends and I got shots when we went to the doctor and we hated them. But my parents stabbed themselves with needles almost every day, and seemed to enjoy it. Weird.
Most of my friends' parents sounded like the adults in school or on TV when they talked. People understood them. My parents, on the other hand, had their own language, laced with a flowery slang that I picked up the same way the Puerto Rican kids could speak English at school and Spanish at home with their abuelas. 
And then there was the matter of how they talked. My parents and their friends spoke this exotic language very slowly. There were other odd things. For instance, they often slept standing up, and this group narcolepsy could strike right in the middle of the most dynamic conversation. Someone would start a sentence: ''Those ofay cats bopping out on the stoop are blowin' like Birrr . . . '' and suddenly the words would begin to come out slower. And. Slower. Soon they wouldn't be speaking at all. Eventually our living room would be filled with black and white hipsters suspended in time and space, while I ran through the petrified forest of their legs. My favorite game was waiting to see if the ashes from their cigarettes would ever drop. Somehow they almost never did.
I can still remember the day when I finally realized that there was a name for this unusual lifestyle. My parents were junkies! And their slow-motion thing was called nodding out.
Oh well - it was nice to be able to name the thing. This was my life, and as far as I was concerned, there was nothing uncommon or uncomfortable about it at all. In fact, for a while, at least, it was a carefree Shangri-La.
My mother, Beverly, was a beautiful, brilliant black girl whose family descended from southern sharecroppers. She got pregnant with me when she was 13, the very first time she had sex. Bobby, my stepfather, was white, Jewish and central-casting handsome. They were an unusual progressive pair: they smoked pipes, dressed impeccably and read Playboy for the articles. Even in beat-generation Greenwich Village, New York City, circa 1959, interracial couples weren't exactly commonplace.
Mom's maiden name was Goodman. Technically, it was Gooden, but her father, Fredrick, appropriated the name from a huge Goodman's Egg Noodles billboard that hung outside of the Lincoln Tunnel on the New Jersey side. The family story is that Fredrick had been forced to flee the cotton fields of Georgia after he used a tree branch to beat a white man he'd caught raping his sister. Grandpa Fredrick (never one to let a good story go to waste) told me that he saw the sign just after his car exited the tunnel. He thought the name would help people up north think of him as a ''good'' man. In the end, I guess it sort of worked. Twenty long years later, after the Woolworth C.E.O. he chauffeured passed away, Grandpa got the Cadillac as thanks for his service.
By the time Beverly Goodman was 12, she was already what they used to call a fast girl. She was also hip. She knew things that most civilians didn't. She listened to Nina (Simone) and Monk (Thelonious) and TB (Tony Bennett) and Ahmad Jamal on a regular basis, and was so down she called them by a single name (except Jamal, maybe out of respect for the fact that he'd gone through the trouble of changing his name from Freddy Jones). She spoke with confidence, just a peg down from arrogance, which only big-city intellectuals could get away with, even if they were only 12. She had art, literature and music all around her.
I always called her Beverly instead of Mommy. She never asked me to do otherwise. Even as a very young kid I was utterly convinced that my mother was the most beautiful woman in the world. Her looks were a combination of African-American, Native American and Irish. This was no accident, starting with my great-great-grandmother Mary Ellen, who was the child of a partially African mother and an Irish doctor and slave owner who was, um, intimate with his property. As the daughter of a white man, Mary Ellen was more privileged than the average ex-slave's child, a fact not lost on her. Later, when her own daughters came of age, she passed along some interesting advice: ''Protect your children and the benefits you have from my being half white,'' she told them. ''Marry the fairest man you can, so your children will have good hair.'' Today, those genes are very apparent in my family. Most of us resemble, to varying degrees, Lena Horne, Halle Berry, Cab Calloway or Lenny Kravitz.
Except for me.
I inherited my biological father's genes: I'm dark-skinned, ''the only spot in the lot'' is what my family called me. As screwed up as it is, my great-great-grandmother knew what she was talking about when advising her daughter to ''marry light.'' It's hard to describe how horribly ugly I felt as a dark-skinned kid in the '50s. Thank God for the '60s, when black was suddenly beautiful, no matter the shade.
Which brings me to my stepdad: Bobby Glanzrock. It's not fair to call Bobby a black man in a white man's body because his style was genuinely his alone. Bobby was a beatnik Ph.D. His observations had angles and perspectives that would make Miles Davis contemplate his own sense of cool. Bobby spoke with a slow, deliberate syncopation that was constantly modulating through the musical scale. This was the preferred style of speaking amongst the hipster class. Think Mitch Hedberg or Jimi Hendrix.
Some of his black friends called him ''White Bobby,'' but my stepdad acted more like the black jazz musicians he idolized than the haberdashers in his lineage. He only dated soul sisters, most of whom could have doubled for Cleopatra Jones, all Afro and attitude. That included my mom, who sported the latest Carnaby Street duds and a towering nimbus of kinky hair. Bobby's uncle Lew, who had no sons, groomed his nephew to take over his clothing business. But Lew disowned him for marrying a black woman, even one with a nice Jewish-sounding name. Bobby threw away the glory of the schmatte business for Beverly. And in return, he became the love of her life. Me, I was their little groupie. I loved them both like crazy.
And crazy may be the operative word. Beverly and Bobby may not have been model parents, but they were a really good fit for each other; art, literature and especially their love of music bonded them together. But as they spiraled deeper and deeper into addiction, they were also increasingly self-centered, not infrequently criminal and less and less interested in the responsibilities of raising a kid. On some level, it was great to be treated like a peer, to be on a first-name basis with my parents, but it wasn't exactly a substitute for the usual parental cocktail of nurturing and discipline. Respect? Yes, there was plenty of that. If I had a problem, we'd ''rap on it.'' Then they'd ask me something like: ''Are we copacetic?'' If I said, ''Yeah, I guess so,'' the matter would be settled with a five slap or some other affirming gesture.
Bobby always affectionately called me by my nickname, ''Pud,'' short for pudding pie. Once, after I'd accidentally set fire to the apartment while playing with matches, he sat me down. More disappointed than angry, he stared woefully into my eyes for about five minutes or so, then finally broke the uncomfortable silence.
''Pud, dig yourself,'' he said.
This was the harshest discipline Bobby ever doled out. My mother then asked me if I wouldn't mind walking over to her and lying down on her lap. She gave me a few whacks on the behind and asked me if I understood why.
''Yes.''
She looked me in the eyes, and said, ''Pud, you really have to start digging yourself.''
''O.K., Beverly.'' I cried more from shock than pain, because she'd never hit me before. Then again, I'd never set the house on fire before, either.
Most of the people in my life back then may have been constantly high, but they were pretty stylish. Coming home from school, it wasn't unusual for me to see berets or tams, jackets with elbow patches, ascots, dickeys, turtlenecks, groovy ''slacks,'' high design cigarette holders and cases, rolling paper from all over the world, shoebox lids to clean pot seeds, magazines of all types, books, albums, various sets of works to wrap around your arms to make the veins pop up. This was the paraphernalia of a junkie pad at the twilight of the '50s. Some visitors were famous, all were friends. Once, Thelonious Monk himself came over to buy my mom's fur coat for his girlfriend. Heroin often turns addicts into gifted salesmen. Some families go to Disneyland for fun; we went to the pawnshop. Most junkies' wallets, where you'd expect to find family photos or business cards, are crammed instead with pawn tickets.
We moved around a lot - Chinatown, the Bronx, Alphabet City - but our lives first started to change when we lived in a two-bedroom apartment on the corner of Greenwich and Bethune Streets, sometime in the summer of 1959. This was the last moment in my parents' lives before junk began dictating everything about how and where they lived. Ironically, this part of New York is now the high-rent West Village, but I still associate it with the sewage-brine of the Hudson River. This was before America learned how to monetize geography by simply renaming it, as my grandfather Goodman would surely applaud.
I can still picture life on Greenwich Street. Our brand-new French Petrol Blue Simca was parked curbside. It looked like a frowning flat-faced barracuda, its body chopped off at its upper dorsal fin. It was the most unusual car in town. Standing in the lobby of my building looking across narrow, Victorian-size Greenwich Street, I'd see slaughtered livestock being moved onto loading docks, the meat swinging from large hooks. Anyone who's seen ''Rocky'' knows what these huge dangling headless bodies look like, but on celluloid they have no scent. In the winter it wasn't so bad, but during the summer months, the stench was unbelievable - tons of flesh in a race against rot. Today it's still called the meatpacking district, but back then it wasn't an ironic name for an upscale neighborhood, it was a literal description of the foul and bloody business going on. I was 7 years old and almost always alone. I would sing as I explored the streets, adding an appropriate underscore to my solitary wandering.
I was exceptionally weird looking back then. Super-skinny. Thick glasses. And my mother dressed me like my dapper stepfather, which meant I dressed like a blue-blooded, old money, prep-school WASP.
I desperately tried to find friends, but there were no other kids my age in our building. Other than the doorman, who was actually a cool guy, my only friend was a schoolmate named David. David's mom was white and his father was black, an interracial combination that was a little more common than my parents but still stopped traffic in 1959. David lived on the border of Little Italy, which was less than a mile from my place but seemed as far away as Big Italy. Maybe because I looked so silly, with my Jerry Lewis glasses and Tom Wolfe getups, the Italian kids near David's place always wanted to beat the crap out of me. Asthma or not, I was a fast runner.
It was a spring day in 1960, almost summer. I was 7-and-a-half. As I walked west down Bleecker Street, I noticed a large crowd gathered around the Hotel Greenwich, right by the Village Gate. The hotel had recently been converted into a single-room occupancy filled with mental patients who had nowhere else to go once the state hospitals started closing. The S.R.O.'s gave the Village an edge. I remember feeling comfortable around their eccentric tenants. I was used to irrational behavior. As I drew close, I realized everyone was looking up: ''Is he going to jump?'' cried one man. ''Think so,'' answered another. I craned my head and immediately recognized the naked man raving incoherently on the fire escape: Nile Rodgers Sr.
If destiny is biology, then I was born to be a musician. Nile Rodgers Sr. was a brilliant percussionist who came of age during the Latin music boom of the late '40s. Dances like the mambo and the rumba had a huge influence on the big bands. My father specialized in Afro-Cuban beats and was considered a virtuoso by the time he was a young man.
Paul Whiteman, ''The King of Jazz'' and a popular big-band leader, was the host of an ABC show called ''TV Teen Club'' that later became ''American Bandstand.''
A gig with him was a huge break for my dad because Paul's orchestra was, true to his name, all white. Unfortunately, Paul couldn't hire him full time, and Dad had to supplement his income with a day job in the garment district, where most of my mother's family also worked (as well as Bobby, my stepfather-to-be).
Nile charmed everyone who crossed his path. If he didn't have an instrument with him, he could turn any object into one. He loved music: He lived it, walked it, talked it and played it all the time. He loved music more than anything - except maybe getting high.
By the time he was 16, my father was more or less a daily drinker and pot smoker. Because of his relatively well-paying job running racks in the garment district - ''flying Jewish airplanes,'' they called it - he had extra spending money, just enough cash to develop a taste for heroin.
Nile worked with a guy named Freddy Boy, who had a brainy and very beautiful kid sister named Beverly who Nile took a liking to. He was 16, and she was 13 - and very soon she was pregnant.
For a while, Nile loved Beverly even more than music and drugs, so much so that he was nearly killed defending her honor. A gang member called her a whore, and when Nile spoke up he was knifed in the chest. Beverly, on the other hand, liked Nile, a lot, but was absolutely not in love with him. But once she was pregnant with me, Beverly's father, whom she was deathly afraid of, convinced her she had to get married. And so the wedding was set for June, just three months before I was born. Nile was ecstatic.
But when they reached City Hall, my mother decided she just couldn't do it and caused a big scene. Crushed, Nile slapped my mother across the face. According to her, that was the only time in his life that he'd ever struck another person. But once was all it took to cancel a wedding. And so it was that Nile Sr.'s 14-year-old fiancee humiliated him on what was supposed to be the happiest day of his life. That night he did so much dope he almost died. I would hear about the wedding-day binge that he blamed on Beverly every time I saw him for the rest of his life.
Now on this hot spring day, eight years since he'd last played with Paul Whiteman, my father had a flophouse ledge as his stage. He'd already jumped out of the fourth-story window and fallen onto the landing. A small brigade of cops and firemen were trying to bring him in. I frantically ran into the hotel and told the desk clerk, ''The man on the fire escape is my father. I don't think he'll jump if he sees me.'' I added, ''He is a very nice man.'' The clerk brought me over to the police, who escorted me up to the fourth floor and the window closest to my father.
''Hey, Nile, hey, Nile, it's Little Splash,'' I said to him.
Splash was my dad's nickname on the street, because he drank a lot of cheap bathtub gin. He needed to. He was always high and it was a simple matter of economics. Over the past few years, he'd become a full-fledged alcoholic and drug addict, lost his job in the garment district and ended up on welfare in an S.R.O. He was on the city's methadone program and made extra money by selling ''spit back'' to addicts. ''Spit back'' is resold methadone that junkies literally spit into a hidden receptacle after they swallow just enough to get straight. He liked it when his friends called me Little Splash, and I thought this would get through to him. It did. He recognized me instantly.
I hadn't realized that he lived so close to us. I hadn't seen him for about six months. Beverly didn't allow it because she felt embarrassed for him. But she didn't understand how much I loved him, and that he and I got along great. On our last get-together, we'd gone shopping and seen the sci-fi film ''The Blob'' in the Bronx. He'd always give me a present, a record or a cool ethnic percussion instrument. But now he looked at me with a sorrowful, nearly empty stare: ''Pud, why did she do that to me? I loved her so much.''
''I know, Pops, come inside now.''
''Hey, son, are you alright? You alright, Pud?''
''Yeah, Pops, I'm fine, but I think you should come inside.''
After a little coaxing, my dad climbed back inside. Other than the fact that he was totally naked, we acted like nothing happened. Since his tiny room reeked of piss, I waited in the hall, which also stunk, but not as bad. While he washed and dressed, a female resident tried to make a quick buck for a fix by propositioning me. When I didn't react, she lifted her skirt and repeated the offer.
I'm sure if I were just a few years older, her voice would've reverberated in that stairwell as sexily as Donna Summer's ''Love to Love You Baby.'' But to Little Splash it just sounded funny. All I could do was laugh. Suddenly my father appeared in slightly tattered beatnik clothes, bathed in Zizanie cologne, and we left the building - through the front door. He took his spit-back money and bought me a slice of pizza and a large Orange Julius on Eighth Street. I was happy. We spent the rest of the day browsing through every record store in the Village.
He may have been crazy as hell but my father's gift to me was his kindness, open-mindedness and music. Every chance he got, he'd patiently teach me to read rhythm patterns. Because of robust music programs in the public schools, by the time I was 14 I could play at least a ''tune'' on almost any instrument. When I was 19, I got my first professional job, but he never saw me turn pro. He died a few days before. After I die, his bloodline will end with me. He is buried anonymously in potter's field.
My father left no manuscripts, compositions or unfinished works. I used to think that was tragic, but not anymore. When I got older, I traced his DNA back to the Benin tribe of what is now the Edo State in Nigeria. The Benins have a rich artistic heritage. I like to believe that the success I've had is a result of my dad - or maybe it's just those Benin genes?

HEADLINE: Bears Won't Pull City Out of Sports Slump

BYLINE: By DAN McGRATH. 
dmcgrath@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Dan McGrath writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
A lost summer of baseball in Chicago has raised the stakes on the Bears' season, although it's not like our sports-minded citizenry needed another Carlos Zambrano meltdown or the disaster that is Adam Dunn to get all tingly over Jay Cutler and his associates.
Oprah has come and gone, as have M.J., two Mayors Daley and the Sears Tower. The Bears endure. They are Chicago's true passion, fueled by indelible memories of 1985 and its ringmaster, the mustachioed restaurateur whose high profile around town serves as a grumpy reminder of how things ought to be. 
Has it really been 26 years since Super Bowl XX, when the Bears ruled the world? Will it ever happen again?
A neutral observer would like to be more encouraging to those legions of true believers whose emotional well-being swings with the Bears' fortunes each Sunday. But he can't. The record keeps coming up 8-8 with every parsing of the schedule.
There has never been an 8-8 team in the Super Bowl, but the hard-liners in the Soldier Field crowd believe that's the logical destination for a squad that fell one game short last year. They don't want to hear that the 2010 Bears were a flawed team that took advantage of uncommonly good health, a favorable schedule and uncommonly good luck in the form of several overmatched opposing quarterbacks.
As Bill Parcells, the N.F.L. sage, put it, you are what your record says you are, and last year's Bears were 11-5. It's possible they could field a better team and not do as well against a stronger division and a tougher overall schedule, but unlikely.
The ''fielding a stronger team'' piece presumes they've addressed the flaws they managed either to conceal or overcome last year -- most notably a porous offensive line that had pass rushers flying at Cutler like left-lane leadfoots on the Dan Ryan.
The new line features a rookie at right tackle, a seventh-round draft choice at left tackle and a converted guard at center. Scary.
But first, Lance Briggs. What is he thinking?
Briggs wants more money -- who among us doesn't? But there's this matter of a six-year contract that has three years remaining. Briggs signed it as an unrestricted free agent in 2008, and he hit the jackpot: $36 million. But the deal was structured so that roughly $22 million paid out over the first three years. Briggs looks at what he still has coming, considers his status as a six-time Pro Bowl performer and decides it's tantamount to taking a pay cut, playing for $3.65 million in 2011.
Linebackers rely on instincts, not logic.
Sympathy is hard to find in a region where unemployment hovers near 10 percent. Even for a Bear, and a high-performing one. For their part, the Bears are more likely to unveil a shrine to Brett Favre on the Soldier Field concourse than redo a deal they considered perfectly fair to both sides at the time it was struck.
Briggs insists his discontent won't become the proverbial ''distraction,'' but it did when he went public. He has also indicated he will seek a trade if the Bears don't satisfy him, and that would be about as wise a move as drafting Curtis Enis.
Briggs is a very good player, no question. He thrives in a defense that was practically designed for him. He works alongside a future Hall of Famer whose presence as a disrupter makes things easier for him. And he landed in a city that loves him enough to forget his wee-hours misadventure with a Lamborghini in 2007 or his tawdry paternity entanglements one year later, including one with a naive coed.
If he were to leave, Briggs would find the grass on the other side of the fence to be in worse shape than Soldier Field's.
The Bears do have some salary-cap flexibility. If they were to take an eraser to any of their existing contracts, Matt Forte's is the place to start. He's not Marshall Faulk as a multipurpose threat, much to Mike Martz's chagrin, but he has been a consistent, durable performer over his first three years, averaging 270 carries, 1,079 rushing yards, 57 receptions and nearly 9 touchdowns.
Year 4, though, is the danger zone for N.F.L. running backs -- the pounding they take begins to wear on them. Forte is scheduled to earn $550,000 in the final year of his rookie contract. A bump for services rendered would be appropriate.
The Bears, see, need all the help they can get in a division they rolled through last season. Green Bay won it all with half its team on injured reserve, and even though there's a seven-year moratorium on repeat N.F.L. champions, the Packers like their chances with Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback-in-full, fronting a stronger, deeper roster.
Detroit has been quietly repairing a monumentally bad defense and could be a breakthrough team if quarterback Matthew Stafford can stay upright. Donovan McNabb would love to prove there's something left in the tank after a humiliating year in Washington, but unsettled Minnesota isn't the best place to try.
The Bears? Their lone home-run hitter, Devin Hester, plays best on special teams. They just keep coming up 8-8. But they're the Bears, so you know it will be high drama. And you know we'll all be watching.

BYLINE: By SCOTT MALCOMSON

 BODY:
The American reaction to being attacked on Sept. 11 was in many ways an intellectual one. President George W. Bush tended to frame it that way: the attack was on our ''values,'' and the ''war against terror'' was a war of ideas meant to advance the idea of freedom. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was the administration's epistemologist, worrying over the question of knowability; Bernard Lewis was its historian, Paul Wolfowitz its moralist in arms. That America's actions (as opposed to precautions) after 9/11 almost all took place far from home, with a professional army, strengthened this sense of abstraction. The possibility of anything like victory over our enemies was discounted early on (by Rumsfeld). Little wonder that, unlike in earlier wars, we have talked so much about what this conflict means, rather than simply working to end it as soon as possible. 
This magazine participated from the beginning in debates on the meaning of 9/11 and its aftermath. For this 10th anniversary, we brought together some of the actors to discuss what has been learned and where our conclusions might take us. Michael Ignatieff wrote frequently for the magazine on terrorism and war before entering Canadian politics as a member of Parliament and then Liberal Party leader; he is now at the University of Toronto. David Rieff was a frequent contributor of essays short and long on American policy. James Traub anchored our foreign-policy reporting across this period while producing two books on the subject, ''The Best Intentions'' and ''The Freedom Agenda.'' Paul Berman's March 2003 cover story on Sayyid Qutb, ''The Philosopher of Islamic Terror,'' was a seminal attempt to frame the conflict in terms of competing ideologies. Ian Buruma's magazine articles focused more on contemporary Muslims, most notably Tariq Ramadan (in February 2007). We met virtually, on two separate occasions, with Ignatieff entering the fray late and Rieff exiting early. SCOTT MALCOMSON
SCOTT MALCOMSON: I was looking over George Packer's 2002 New York Times Magazine piece on war and liberalism and it occurred to me that the liberal-engagement debate really didn't start until some months after 9/11. The Afghan action received relatively little higher thought, so to speak. It seemed a different sort of war than Iraq. Ten years later the differences seem much less great. We're still tucked into both -- and more so into Afghanistan. Does this imply that the debate should have begun on 9/12?
PAUL BERMAN: For me the debate did begin on 9/11. I wrote a little essay on 9/12, expanded it over the next few days, turned it in to the American Prospect on Sept. 16, and it ran in the next issue under the title ''Terror and Liberalism.'' The essay laid out an argument for interpreting al Qaeda as a kind of totalitarianism, that is, as a modern phenomenon, which ought to be opposed in a modern way and with modern hopes. I think that was the debate, and has remained the debate -- at least, for me.
JAMES TRAUB: I think Paul's point raises the question of what a ''modern'' or at least substantive response to terrorism would be. Many of us -- all of us at this roundtable -- criticized President Bush for his refusal to recognize the immense difficulty of bringing ''modernity,'' or something like democracy, to backward places like Afghanistan and Iraq. That was the argument then. But I think after 10 years the argument has much more to do with the capacity of outsiders -- America above all -- to shape meaningfully better outcomes in these places. That is, had we taken more seriously the difficulties of nation-building in Afghanistan or Iraq, would it have made a difference? Or have we run up against the limits of the possible?
DAVID RIEFF: I suppose my question would be why we ever thought we could do these things in the first place. Even empires, with all the means at their disposal (think of the British, or for that matter, the Soviets in Central Asia), failed at this. Yes, it could be argued we were successful in Germany and Japan, but that was because there was a different context (total victory on our side, parliamentary history on theirs).
MALCOMSON: David, do you recall now your own thinking on 9/12?
RIEFF: Well, my position then was that we had every right to go after those who had attacked us. (I never took seriously Mullah Omar's so-called offer). But that such an expedition, to use the old imperial term, would have nothing to do with trying to bring a better future to the Afghan people.
MALCOMSON: Ian?
IAN BURUMA: Like David, I saw nothing wrong in striking back, but don't think the Bush administration was ever remotely interested in building a nation in Afghanistan. Before going on, I think it would help the clarity of our discussion if we dispensed with the words ''terror'' and ''terrorism,'' as though they have an ideological meaning. Islamist extremism is one thing. Terrorism is a method. I did think something had to be done about Islamist extremism. The modernity of the response eludes me a little. If I read Paul Berman's article right, he argued that liberals had to find a response that was as 'deep', as much to do with matters of life and death, with religion even, as Osama's thought. This strikes me as neither very liberal, nor terribly modern.
MALCOMSON: I think we might go all right without too much reference to ''terrorism'' though I suspect it will come up. But what strikes me, Ian, in what you've said is the more complicated business of ''ideological depth'' -- whether one's assessment of Al Qaeda's ideology as ''profound'' then requires some similarly ''deep'' response that, given AQ's thinking, would almost have to be illiberal.
TRAUB: I will jump in for one moment. The deep response had to come from whom? Us? I think not. We gave much agonized thought to this question, as well as to the question, How can we provoke such a response from the Islamic world? And we couldn't really -- until it happened on its own. There was no meaningful response to the ideological threat until the Arab Spring -- and now there is. That is why this remains the most hopeful event of at least the last 20 years, notwithstanding all the concerns.
MALCOMSON: Paul?
BERMAN: I think that, during the last 80 or 90 years, we have seen a series of totalitarian ideologies spring up -- communist, fascist in different versions, together with doctrines like Baathism and Islamism. I do not think these are anthropological developments, which could only be addressed by, say, Russians, or Germans, or people who consider themselves part of a Muslim ummah. The ideas are modern, and everyone is free to engage with them -- obliged to engage with them, I would think. It was crucial, generations ago, to argue with the fascists, and some people did. Crucial to argue with the communists. And more recently crucial to argue with the Baathists (whose own doctrine has died, thankfully) and the Islamists. The Islamists do not come out of primitive caves; they come out of modern intellectual settings, out of universities and libraries. And everyone can argue with them. Even successfully!
I think the Arab Spring is a confirmation of this notion. The original notion was that, in a large part of the Arab world and some parts of the rest of the Muslim world, the pathologies of totalitarian movements had set in, and had to be opposed -- by argument, above all. And the arguments have gone on. And guess what? A great many people in the Arab world -- and in Iran, too -- agree with the liberal and anti-dictatorial and anti-totalitarian arguments. This is indeed grand. And this is indeed the only way that a true solution of these various problems was ever going to be found.
MALCOMSON: I remember there were several surveys featured in the Arab Human Development Reports showing more enthusiasm for liberal democracy in Arab and other Muslim countries than in most developed countries, including the U.S. This was pretty consistent. It does seem as though the wars that sought to bring democracy to some of those countries were, at least as a form of liberalizing or modernizing argument, entirely ineffective and arguably counterproductive. Would you agree with that Paul? Or anyone?
BURUMA: I don't think one can accurately describe the Arab Spring as an intellectual argument with Al Qaeda, or extreme Islamism. You cannot use ''fascism'', ''Islamism'', or ''Communism'' as abstractions, without historical context. Arguing, in libraries or universities, or even on Tahrir Square, with Al Qaeda believers seems pointless. They are in the business of violent revolution, not argument. So the answer to that is political, and sometimes the use of force, not intellectual.
BERMAN: I think the wars have been counterproductive in some respects -- for a while they appeared to discredit the notion of liberal democracy altogether, which was dreadful. This, apart from the deaths and suffering. In other respects, the wars have accomplished a number of things. There is, in fact, a need for force in dealing with people like the Al Qaeda militants. This kind of war has gone on in Afghanistan, and likewise in Iraq, once Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia had gotten a foothold. These were necessary wars, I'm afraid.
RIEFF: I find it extraordinary that Paul can say these wars were necessary! There was no Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia presence in Iraq when we overthrew Saddam Hussein -- -- this is pure Cheney, 1% solution stuff. They came AFTER we invaded. I have nothing against the use of force against Al Qaeda (say in the Sahel). But surely the costs of these wars vastly outweigh whatever benefits there are.
But the more important question is: Why we should be meddling in the first place? Is it our business to decide who rules in Afghanistan? Beyond that, if we are talking about the Arab Spring, I advise caution. It may well be that the Muslim Brotherhood is the principal beneficiary of Tahrir Square, not the democrats. In any case, there are real economic issues that nothing in the Arab Spring addresses or promises to resolve.
BERMAN: Unfortunately, al Qaeda in Mesopotamia did get established after a while, and it was necessary to fight them. This was the meaning of the ''surge.''
TRAUB: But I'm struck by the difference between ''responding to the threat of Al Qaeda'' and the vast enterprise we have been talking about here. What of our effort in Afghanistan today has to do with the original goal of stopping Al Qaeda? We are now fighting the Taliban. I agree that there was no al Qaeda threat in Iraq at first. In many ways, we have done a very effective job of fighting Al Qaeda. But that's very little of what we have, in fact, been doing.
BERMAN: I think the crucial thing was to establish that 1) there were and are extremist ideologies that, if identified, can be argued with and opposed. And 2) to support the people who, for many years, had already been calling for some sort of regional revolution along liberal lines. The call was made. There seemed to be successes. There were setbacks and disasters. And now, suddenly, there is a regional revolution.
The Arab spring is not the end of things -- it is the beginning. Now the real struggle begins. And of course it involves a struggle between Islamists and anti-Islamists, among other groups. In Tunisia people chanted, ''Tunisia is the solution!'' -- meaning, they were arguing against the Islamists. This is the great thing, the hopeful thing, the thing we have been hoping and calling for.
RIEFF: I don't know -- I would like to know -- who this all-encompassing ''we'' Paul speaks of is. But more importantly, these are anecdotes. Other people in Tunisia are saying different things. More to the point still, more Tunisians are voting with their feet, that is, trying to emigrate. The problem with posing the question as Paul does, in fundamentally ''clash of ideas'' terms, is that the economy and demography of the region gets lost. There is only democrat v. Islamist. The fact that, say, in both Pakistan and Yemen they have not yet STARTED the demographic transition gets totally lost on this analysis.
BURUMA: I would go further. It is a common habit of religious fanatics -- people who have heard ''the call'' -- to see every struggle in terms of good versus evil: Islamists versus anti-Islamists. This is not political. The Muslim Brothers in Egypt are certainly Islamists, but as long as they stick by democratic rules, they have a role to play. If we dismiss them as part of an evil totalitarian block that we must ''argue'' (how?) against, we could well impede the democratic progress we hope will come from the Arab Spring
TRAUB: I agree altogether with Ian.
MALCOMSON: As a number of you have shown in your work, the battles within Muslim countries between Islamists, anti-Islamists, part-time democrats and Friday believers all went on before 9/11, and they seem all to be going on now, perhaps for the better in these past few months. But 10 years of U.S. and NATO and some non-NATO involvement, at the usual costs we all know, seem to have affected this battle of ideas very little indeed, in the region itself.
TRAUB: But this is just my point. Whether or not we celebrate what is happening now in the Middle East, it is not we who caused it. I would say that we retarded it by providing an alternative narrative -- Crusaders seeking to dominate Islam -- which allowed autocrats to distract peoples' attention. But it happened anyway. So it tells us something about the limits of our own abilities, and something else about the resilience of people Over There.
BERMAN: Did we retard these events, or advance them? I don't know. We advanced the liberal cause for some people, certainly -- e.g., the Kurds of Iraq. We -- the United States and its allies- -- at least raised the issue of liberal democracy.
RIEFF: Raised the issue? At the price of how many dead, including our own? This is not a high table debate, for God's sake. Huge numbers of people have killed and been killed because of our decision to stay in Afghanistan after we had toppled the Taliban and our invasion of Iraq. All this to raise the issue of liberal democracy? My God, man!
BERMAN: As for the question of how does one argue, I think one argues in the usual way. The way that intellectuals do: by reading people, by writing criticisms, by writing essays. A lot of this has been going on. It is not restricted to the Arab world. It is a European debate. And it is an American debate. It is, if I may say so, the obligation of intellectuals to engage in these debates. And it is possible to win these debates.
A great deal of what was done militarily was catastrophic -- that is beyond dispute. But it is also the case that Kurds have rights, Shiites can practice their religious rites in Iraq, etc., so there is a mixed reality. And now we are faced with the question of what to do now -- which is, I think, to engage in the argument, above all, which is what we ought to have been doing all along. The Arab liberals need support -- they have received some support in the past, in spite of everything -- and there ought to be more. And there ought to be arguments on their behalf.
MALCOMSON: In terms of what should be done now, two questions: Do you (each) believe that the Western or American public, having financed and fought most of this since 9/11, is eager to engage in further advancement of liberal arguments? If not, does that matter? And relatedly, President Obama has to figure out what to do himself, pretty practically. (He makes little public reference to 9/11, interestingly.) Where do you see whatever lessons we might have learned in the past decade taking policies in the near future?
TRAUB: On the first question, this is what troubles me about David's response. There is a big difference between humility and despair. I think we have learned a lot about limits. But I don't think the lesson is: We can do nothing to shape better outcomes in the world; we only make things worse. I would say that the American people, far from being interventionist, as they were in the aftermath of 9/11, are now heavily isolationist. How does one find the language that justifies a significant and positive American role in the world? Obama is searching -- not so successfully, right now.
BURUMA: One way is to be concrete. I really don't know what ''advancing the liberal argument'' means, except that it is supposed to make us feel warm all over. Are we talking about U.S. government policies? Fine. Military intervention, to topple regimes, the Napoleonic enterprise of revolutionary war, is almost always a mistake. Humanitarian intervention is the way this is phrased these days, but in fact this is often not so different from the Napoleonic way. There are things a powerful government can do to help democrats and liberals in other countries short of military force. Sometimes it is better to do nothing much at all. I believe that Obama's relative passivity vis a vis the Green Revolution in Iran, for example, actually helped. It gave room for people in the Middle East to find their own way, without fear of being seen as America's boys.
BERMAN: I think that ''advancing the liberal argument'' has a simple meaning. We should try to demonstrate the falsity of horrendous ideas -- e.g., the false nature of Islamism. Islamism is not ''the solution,'' as it claims to be. It is a compilation of modern and ancient ideas, admixed with a great many horrendous European ideas. We should try to expose the nature of these doctrines. Very important, for instance, is to put up an argument against anti-Semitism, a key element in totalitarian doctrines, sooner or later. Women's rights: another big theme.
Do these arguments mean nothing? We know very well that, in Iran, the universities are a center of resistance. Do people in other parts of the world listen to our own arguments? They do. They argue back. Exchanges go on. This -- THIS -- is the actual solution: the advancing of lucidity. I wish Obama did a bit more of it, given that, unlike Bush, he has the talent to do so. But it is not ultimately for politicians to do. This is something that intellectuals, writers, artists, journalists can do -- something that quite a few NGO's have been doing, with success too, as we have lately learned.
BURUMA: If only everybody in the world would read The New Republic, the world would solve all its problems.
RIEFF: First, let me reply to James. I don't think the choice is between despair and hope or anything of the sort. There are things that governments can do, that, as Paul says, NGOs can do, and, though I am more skeptical about their importance, intellectuals can do. But I would far prefer that we despaired than that we went to war! After Iraq, it wasn't unreasonable to hope that we had learned NOT to do that, and that those who supported that war -- -- maybe not the war Bush fought but the ideal human rights war they called on him to fight -- -- would have lost their faith in military interventions in the name of human rights. That they have clearly not, as this conversation makes clear, seems to me ample cause for despair. Until that happens, I would prefer, yes, that we stand down! And where I do agree with James is that I think more and more formerly hawkish, or, at least interventionist, Americans agree -- -- a great thing in my view.
PART TWO
MICHAEL IGNATIEFF: Looking over the first discussion, which I missed, I thought I'd add my two cents worth before the next one starts. The first point to make is that there hasn't been a successful attack on the U.S. mainland since 9/11. This is a fact worth thinking about. The apocalypse did not happen. The dog did not bark. Remember that autumn of 2001? We feared attacks on nuclear installations would come next. We believed that the anthrax attacks belonged to a wider conspiracy. There was widespread anxiety that the Muslim minority in the US was infiltrated by terrorists or their sympathizers, and a commensurate anxiety that these minorities would be subject to revenge attacks. None of this occurred. The apocalypse has been deferred indefinitely.
One obvious reason has been the ferocious counter-attack by US special forces, CIA, and other secret agencies. The most obvious consequence of 9/11 to me has been the creation of a new national security state, to rival the one created at the start of the Cold War. It is an archipelago beneath democratic scrutiny, and it has done liberal democracies real damage: rendition, torture, detention without trial, Guantanamo, military tribunals. Its justification is that it has prevented an attack on the homeland. But this is a strange kind of justification: the absence of apocalypse is held to justify a permanent state of emergency, extending indefinitely into the future. So the first question might be, with Bin Laden dead, what dismantling of this apparatus becomes possible? What enhanced oversight becomes necessary if we are not to perpetuate a permanent emergency?
Another point to make is that apocalypse has been avoided in the homeland, but it has spread to Bali, Madrid, London and Mumbai. Anywhere is now a target and so it is not obvious who is the target and who is the perpetrator. Low level anxiety, in every airport, in every large public space, is now the norm, and since the perpetrators that have been caught don't fit any obvious demographic profile, it's not clear who were are supposed to watch with a beady eye and report to police. Here too, we have become used to a permanent emergency: the scans at every airport, the occasional sight of someone being removed from a plane, the security systems that scan our emails and data transfers, the sense that 9/11 has created a global security archipelago beyond oversight or control. And since it still makes mistakes -- Norway, for example -- its very mistakes justify further expansion of the apparatus.
I'd feel happier engaging in a strong liberal defense of democracy against Islamic fascism if I felt we had this archipelago under better control. It seems to me we have paid a price for defeating Bin Laden which Bin Laden himself might find ironic confirmation of his power.
A similar kind of thought occurs in relation to the fiscal cost of the US pursuit of terrorism world-wide: three wars and the imperial overstretch and fiscal crisis that have resulted. Who is the real beneficiary of 10 years of imperial overstretch? China and the other BRICs. It's impossible to look back over the last 10 years and not to wonder what long-term price the U.S. has paid for devoting itself so fully to counterterrorism and counterinsurgency while its economic rivals, chiefly China, were busy capturing cheap manufacturing and primary commodity production, together with influence in every developing economy. Who is buying up Portuguese, Greek, Hungarian bonds to keep these governments afloat? China. Who is investing in infrastructure throughout Africa? China. Nobody anticipated this, least of all the fanatics in their caves, but it is surely one of the consequences of 9/11 that might please them.
MALCOMSON: I'd suggest we start round two by addressing Michael's question of whether one effect of 9/11 is a permanent counterterror ''archipelago'' that, to state the obvious, is not a natural friend of liberal politics, democracy, or perhaps some other goals of the reaction to 9/11.
BURUMA: I think the problem is with the idea of ''terror''. Since this is a method -- propaganda by violent means -- there will never be a total end to it. There might be an end to a more clearly defined danger, extreme Islamism for example. But that is not the same as an all-out war ''against terror.''
TRAUB: Well, okay, but, to go to Michael's question, is it time for a kind of post-Osama ''peace dividend''? Do we need to spend well over $500 billion a year on defense when our own sense of the threat has diminished? Do we need to retain the same restraints on visas issued for the Islamic world?
MALCOMSON: Michael?
IGNATIEFF: The issue to me is oversight, not just spending: How a liberal democracy manages to guard the guards. And here I think we've lost ground since 9/11.
MALCOMSON: I also draw attention to the remarkable enthusiasm now in many quarters for a foreign policy that is significantly dependent on assassinations (simply put).
TRAUB: I think that the dependence on assassinations, to use Scott's term, is a sign of a wish to conduct foreign policy on the cheap. We've despaired of state-building, etc., as we discussed the other day. So instead we choose a kind of ''stand-off'' policy of killings from afar. Is there any way to remedy this policy without accepting the need for what Michael sometimes describes as the ''imperial burden''? My fear is that it's precisely the American public's unwillingness to do so that leads to policy-by-drone.
BURUMA: The solution to conflicts in the end has to be political. Both sides must see an advantage in politics instead of violence. This was shown very clearly in the conflict in Ireland. British conservatives advocated for a long time that only more military force (including torture) would force the Irish Republican Army to its knees. In the end only negotiation with an IRA that saw its own advantage in politics worked. This means one has to negotiate often with nasty people. It is interesting to read in today's NYT that the Taliban, or certain factions, are interested in negotiation.
MALCOMSON: My own sense is that policy-by-drone is also due to a lack of faith among those running states in state-based policies that can deal with non-state actors. After ten years of watching states like the U.S. try to deal with non-state disruptive forces, we've reached a point where shooting individuals from the sky looks very sensible. But it is also a change from the past. Michael, since you have the advantage among this group of actual governing experience, I'm wondering how you might see this shift from a state perspective?
IGNATIEFF: You flatter me. I have no experience whatever from a state perspective, and for what it's worth, I'd say the move toward risk-averse military action has been going on for some time. I called Kosovo a ''virtual war'' precisely because we tried to protect civilians from the air, to eliminate risk to ground troops, and more importantly, to maintain domestic political support for an operation in a faraway place that was always shallow. I think this is a key consideration: no one wants to die for the sake of someone else's real estate or security, if they can avoid it, and the new technologies -- drones etc. -- help to square the circle. They allow interventions on the cheap, which is all domestic political considerations will allow. The problem is if the risk to us is low, oversight will be similarly casual. We start killing lots of people rather casually, and lose whatever strategic purpose we were trying to achieve.
Which brings us back to oversight. Democratic consent has to be the key: if you can't explain something to the people, in this case the American people, I wouldn't try it overseas. The concern I have about the whole world opened up after 9/11 is this archipelago, not just of drones, but of communication intercepts, Internet monitoring, which preserves our security at the price of . . . what? We don't even know. I'm relatively trusting, far from paranoid, but we do have a new institutional problem: to subject special forces, cybercommand, the boys with the drones, to some form of democratic oversight and control, if we are to stay what we say we are.
BURUMA: I agree with Michael, but one reason Americans have allowed this to happen, I think, is that they bought into Dick Cheney's paranoid world view, initially at least, the idea that we are in an existentialist war with terror, that Islamofascism, or whatever one wishes to call it, is a deadly threat to our existence. This is why it is so important to be clear and honest about our reasons to wage war. My opposition to the war in Iraq was not because I have a moral objection to taking out a tyrant. But the government was shifty, not clear about its reasons, and often lying about them. This damages our democracy. The same is true in Libya, I fear. Humanitarian intervention has become a fig leaf for revolutionary war, to topple a regime.
MALCOMSON: From a governing perspective, the appeal of drones and the rest of the archipelago is precisely that you can keep fighting without having to be clear and honest about anything. And that is also why it is so dangerous.
TRAUB: Can we go back to this question of democratic oversight and democratic consent? One problem is that, as Ian said, the American people have proved quite willing to grant their consent to torture, to harsh immigration policies, to the militarization of our judiciary. I actually don't think that our worst fears over the throttling of domestic dissent have been realized -- far from it, in fact. But we have acquiesced in a series of serious transformations of our policy, or rather of the face we turn to the world. I wish Obama had fought harder to keep KSM's trial in civilian court, in New York. But once Mayor Bloomberg and Ray Kelly, the police commissioner, turned against him, he began to look like a liberal softie. Until we lose this overwhelming sense of fear, democratic consent for change will be hard to come by.
BURUMA: Perhaps this fear is part of the ethos of the United States. It was founded on a sense of fear, fear of the bad Old World, from which people found refuge. It has long been relatively easy for the U.S. government to talk the people into a sense of fear of the wicked outside world.
MALCOMSON: The best book I have read about intellectuals and 9/11 is George Fredrickson's ''The Inner Civil War,'' which is about Emerson, Whittier etc. reacting to the North-South crisis before and on into the Civil War. It is amazing how similar the debates and attitudes were. So I want to celebrate Ian's turn to the American past, although for my money American attitudes are much more formed by the Western expansion than by fear of the Old World. But in any event, Paul, you are being silent. Part of the discussion here is about intellectual responses to 9/11, and in the context of U.S. history you might have something to say...
BERMAN: Let me return for a moment to Michael's original point. I do think there is an enormous problem of oversight. It derives from a systematic mendacity, which got its start under Bush in regard to the Iraq War, but I'm afraid has not come to an end. So we find ourselves fighting in Libya, Yemen, in Pakistan, in Somalia -- fighting in various ways -- and there is very little public recognition or discussion of this. This is an immense problem: political and moral.
BURUMA: But surely intellectuals, including, if I may say so, Michael and yourself, are complicit in that government mendacity. You both took the view at the time that you disagreed with most of Bush's policies, but you were in favor of the war in Iraq, whatever Bush's reasons. This makes light of the government's stated reasons for war. If we accept war, just because we might like some of the possible results from it, we end up encouraging, or at least condoning, mendacity.
IGNATIEFF: This is a discussion about what has happened to us -- all of us -- since 9/11, and I am putting the issue of oversight into the frame, because we have all learned a great deal about our obligations to keep ourselves honest, to refuse to condone mendacity, as you put it. Oversight in my idea of it involves us all. Congressional committees, a free press, intellectuals, academics: we all have some stake in making sure we keep each other honest. The problem I see is that we have allowed a huge apparatus to be created in our name to defend us and this apparatus is under very imperfect control. This is a consequence of 9/11 that concerns me. Of course, we have been here before. Scott referred to the Civil War. Of course societies usually go too far in the first shock of an emergency. Lincoln is widely criticized for suspending habeas corpus. But over time, we learn. It would be good to learn from the last decade. We can settle scores forever.
MALCOMSON: The genius of Fredrickson's book is it shows intellectuals taking the Civil War as the content, so to speak, for their pre-existing ideas. Nathaniel Hawthorne was the one who resisted this; he reminds me rather of Rieff, which is a strange feeling.
But anyway, I would think another lesson from the past ten years is how hard it is to predict the results of our own violence. And I don't want to lose track of Michael's other point on BRICs and China, speaking of unintended consequences.
BERMAN: Mendacity was my own word, applied to Bush, back in 2003, and it was the right word. And his mendacity has had terrible consequences. But have we managed to avoid this now, to be more honest? I think we are in a situation where we have never had a proper public discussion of the whole problem. There are real things to fear, and false things to fear. I don't think a trial of KSM in Manhattan was a good idea: there was reason to be frightened. Not every fear is a bogeyman. But how can we tell? By discussing the political issues, I would think. I think Ian is right to label the problem as a political one: Islamist extremism. And right to say there must be a political solutions. This doesn't mean sharing the cake, though. There are movements that have to be transformed, or defeated. We should be open about this, but we are not.
Whether these issues should be traced into the American past- -- I don't know. I love Hawthorne. I am right now writing a book about him. But he was hugely wrong on the Civil War. He didn't understand the main issue, which was slavery. To identify the big problem: this is essential.
TRAUB: The relevance of these historical examples has to do with what we did to ourselves in the face of war. But I don't think the salient aspect of our reaction to 9/11 was a modern equivalent to the Alien and Sedition Acts, or the suspension of habeas corpus, or the Red Scare after WWI. It is not what we did to ourselves, but rather what we gave ourselves leave to do to others, that we now need to think about. To take a minor example: Americans now suffer a minor inconvenience getting on a plane, but non-Americans, and especially people from the Arab and Islamic world, can travel here at all only with great difficulty, and risk humiliating treatment once they arrive. Doesn't that have to change?
MALCOMSON: I agree with Jim. The biggest flaw of US intellectuals' response to the Civil War was that they always considered it as of importance only to white people (including when discussing slavery -- very much including that). And much of the post-9/11 discussion was about us, ultimately, and not about the countries and people who we were, by far, the most affected.
BERMAN: But Scott, isn't this what we continue to do, to our shame? We are discussing our sins, our bogeymen, etc., and meanwhile somehow or another the fact that right now, as we speak, people are rising in rebellion against tyrants in Libya and Syria and other places goes barely mentioned, or unmentioned. And yet the United States and even the scribbling intellectuals and journalists might be able to do something about this. No, it's not all about us. So, then, what about them? What are we doing for them? Or are we too self-absorbed, and too unwilling to pay taxes, and unwilling to take risks, to do anything for the people who are right now embodying a love of liberty?
MALCOMSON: I hate to demur but really want to hear Michael, Ian and Jim. I don't disagree with you Paul, at least not at that level of generality.
IGNATIEFF: Two reactions, one to an earlier remark by Jim Traub to the effect that it's not what we did to ourselves, it's what we did to others that we should reflect upon. That's true enough, and the humiliation of Muslims will have consequences that will be far-reaching both for our security and for the domestic peace of the country. But what we did to ourselves, or what liberal societies did to their domestic liberties after 9/11, is not negligible either. The new technologies of surveillance -- those vast computers that sit there somewhere in Washington and elsewhere, mining telecommunications -- the thousands of people in Washington and elsewhere with top-secret security clearance -- I'm not sure these are passing phenomena, and I'm not sure they are easily dismantled or easily invigilated. I do want someone to be looking at all that traffic, sorting the signal of danger from the noise. But we need to keep the whole scene under control.
As for Paul's remark about our congenital narcissism as intellectuals, 'twas ever thus, but I would say that it pays to be a little circumspect about other people's battles for liberty. It is their fight, not ours. We should let them know they are not alone, and we should do what we can to make sure they are not massacred, but I come away from all of this thinking it is a kind of respect to acknowledge how different their fight is, how specific it is to their situation, how little we are likely to understand their language of freedom, and how circumspect we should be about jumping in, especially with troops.
BURUMA: I'm with Michael. ''Doing something'', however well intentioned, can make things much worse for the people we are supposed to help. U.S. intervention against the Nazis, after Hitler declared war, was certainly a good thing. The problem with learning lessons from the past, however, is that we tend to learn the wrong lessons. It is a terrible form of narcissism of many U.S. presidents to imagine they are Churchill, and see Hitlers behind every tinpot tyrant.
TRAUB: We have now come full circle to our central topic of last time: Can the U.S. shape better outcomes in the world? I do think this is the great question going forward, and I do think we're all very much chastened, and I do think the American public is sick to death of the whole enterprise. But surely this is not a question with a yes or no answer. The real question is: Where, and how, can we matter? How can we do some good without being so blithe, and so self-righteous about it? I still find our role in Libya a positive example, though I recognize I may come to regret that view.
BURUMA: It helps in these matters to be an American client state. When South Koreans and Filipinos rebelled against their military dictators, the U.S. was able to put pressure on those governments, precisely they were dependent on the U.S. Alas, this was not the case with China, during Tiananmen Square. Indeed, it is rarely the case. When the U.S. cannot do anything much, it is often better for all concerned to acknowledge that and not either indulge in huffing and puffing, to no effect, or flail about like a well-meaning, but sometimes lethal, giant.
BERMAN: Can we do harm, or the wrong thing? U.S. history is full of examples. But the examples go both ways. At minimum we can speak up -- the intellectuals especially. Here we have gone through ten years -- since we are speaking on the occasion of an anniversary -- in which I do not think we have done a whole lot to speak up for the liberals in tyrannical places.
IGNATIEFF: We can certainly shine a light on people in trouble. Pointing the spotlight of our attention can sometimes keep them out of jail, and knowing that they have international support can help them with their own tyrants. But I would say we are in a different world than we were in 2001. A decade later, and our discussion now sounds Americanocentric. China, the BRICS, are increasingly determining what happens. I'm not a declinist, and I do think America and Americans will always have a special vocation for liberty, but the century ahead is not American. It's not anybody else's either. I see national communities becoming more salient than ever, as identities and languages take refuge from globalization and seek some way to protect economies and ways of life from the big economic forces. So freedom will be local, and that's why people will fight and die for it. Those of us with the enormous good fortune to live in societies that have some control of their internal and external destinies need to help other peoples have what we have: elementary forms of self-determination so they can protect themselves. If self-determination is what we and they are after, then the rule is: stay out until they ask, and do what they ask us to do, and stay with it till it gets done.
BURUMA: The problem with helping liberals and dissidents in authoritarian countries is that they often end up as pawns in diplomatic games. Take China, for example. The only place where dissidents can make a difference is in China itself, at great personal risk. What the US and Western countries can do is put pressure on the Chinese government to release them from prison, sometimes, when it suits the Chinese. This means the Chinese government wins on two fronts: they get concessions from the US, and they are rid of a nuisance. Also, the state department is happy, because they can show that they ''have done something.''
BERMAN: Michael says that freedom is local, and it is; but it is also global. If you are a small country, it is good to know that powerful organizations like NATO or the U.S. might come to your aid, and this is part of your freedom. If you are a lonely dissident, likewise. If you are a poor country in Africa, it is good (on balance) that the Chinese and other powerful economies are making investments.
MALCOMSON: Any final comments?
BURUMA: Just one, on Michael's point about the BRICs, which we haven't really addressed. I think this would have happened -- the rise of China, India, etc. -- with or without 9/11 or Bush's blunders. But the Bush administration has perhaps sped up the decline of U.S. clout in the world, by doing great damage to the country's good reputation. It is a terrible indictment of the Bush years that when people outside the US hear the word ''democracy'' in US foreign policy rhetoric, they won't believe a word of it.
BERMAN: Maybe so, and yet, when the American ambassador arrived in Hama, Syria, to show his solidarity, people were heartened and they cheered. So maybe people do want our support. Maybe we do have something to offer. Whole crowds in the Middle East are right now asking for it.
BURUMA: Yes, and a fat lot of good it did for those crowds in Hama, once the tanks began to roll.

HEADLINE: Getting Back to a Grand Bargain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
THIS is not an easy time to be president or minority leader. Our cupboard is bare, and the only thing we have in surplus is political venom. Indeed, if political venom could be turned into a transportation fuel, we'd be energy independent today.
Alas, it's just venom, and it's weakening us -- along with everything else we've done to sap our national vitality. We have underinvested in the sources of our strength -- infrastructure, government-funded scientific research, education and immigration -- over the last two decades, opting to consume rather than save and invest. To make up the difference, we chose to stimulate our economy with massive borrowing that all went bad in 2008, leaving us with a huge deleveraging challenge, millions of mortgages under water and the economy nearly at a standstill. Finally, our political system has become paralyzed by partisanship to a degree that has many citizens, and investors, depressed and wondering whether we are capable anymore of collective action. (And, if we're not, why risk investing now?) 
I've been arguing that the only antidote to this debilitating situation is a Grand Bargain between the two parties -- one that cuts long-term entitlement spending and raises additional tax revenues to get our fiscal house in order, while making short-term investments in the sources of our strength (particularly new schools and community colleges, scientific research and roads, bandwidth, mass transit and airports) that can also cushion this recession. While President Obama has talked generally about such a Grand Bargain, he has never put a detailed offer before the American people and his own party faithful. It was a failure of leadership.
Thursday night in his speech before Congress, President Obama finally rose to that challenge in a thoughtful, credible and substantive fashion.
Although I still want to see the spending cuts, tax reforms and tax revenues that he is proposing to pay for his $447 billion plan -- which he has promised to unveil on Sept. 19 -- the president is now clearly laying down his version of the Grand Bargain the country needs. He did so using many ideas -- like payroll tax cuts -- that Republicans should embrace. The president's proposal to generate some new jobs with targeted investments in infrastructure and education -- like modernizing 35,000 schools -- can produce short- and long-term returns.
''After a painful and, for many, inexplicable delay, the administration is finally shifting from an ineffectual series of ad-hoc measures to a comprehensive program that targets key impediments to job creation,'' commented Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of the world's biggest bond manager, Pimco. ''The emphasis is rightly on employment incentives, labor market reforms, infrastructure, and improving the functioning of the mortgage market.''
Assuming that the president follows through with spending cuts and revenue increases that ensure our long-term fiscal health -- something that will challenge his own party's base -- his plan demands a serious response from Republicans, their version of a Grand Bargain and one that also challenges their party's base.
Will the G.O.P. meet the president halfway -- will it compromise -- accepting some of his ideas and insisting on some of its own for a Grand Bargain or will it stick to no tax increases ever under any circumstances?
If the G.O.P. thinks it can just obstruct Obama and hope that the economy tanks -- so Republicans will benefit in the 2012 election -- it will be a mistake for the country and the party. I believe most Americans want a Grand Bargain both in substance and in style. They want to see our politicians working together, acting collectively. We underestimate how much the toxic political rancor in Washington today casts a pall over the whole economy and makes everyone want to just hold fast to what they have.
Republicans or Democrats who doubt this might want to give a call to Howard Schultz, the C.E.O. of Starbucks, who got so fed up with Washington politics that he bought a full-page ad in this newspaper urging Americans not to give political donations to incumbents of either political party until they show a real willingness to compromise and fix our mess.
In response, Schultz told me, ''I've been inundated with messages from people I've never met. They are all sharing their stories that have one common theme: 'We don't feel represented, and we don't recognize the country.' The extremes on both sides have completely overwhelmed the silent majority of the country. I am not afraid to say to both extremes: the ideology that you represent is not the country. A person at Starbucks sent me an e-mail the other day with the Pledge of Allegiance and underlined was one word: 'indivisible.' The people in Washington should reread the Pledge of Allegiance and look up 'indivisible.' ''
President Obama has now offered a legitimate, constructive proposal to reignite efforts to forge a Grand Bargain with Republicans. Several G.O.P. leaders indicated that they intend to look at it seriously. I sure hope so. With Europe heading into a tailspin, the world needs America's economy on solid footing more than ever.

HEADLINE: And Hate Begat Hate

BYLINE: By AHMED RASHID

 BODY:
Ahmed Rashid is a journalist and the author of ''Taliban'' and ''Descent into Chaos.''
LAHORE, Pakistan
IN their shock after Sept. 11, 2001, Americans frequently asked, ''Why do they hate us so much?'' It wasn't clear just who ''they'' were -- Muslims, Arabs or simply anyone who was not American. The easy answer that many Americans found comforting was equally vague: that ''they'' were jealous of America's wealth, opportunities, democracy and what have you.
But in this part of the world -- in Pakistan, where I live, and in Afghanistan next door, from which the Sept. 11 attacks were directed -- those who detested America were much more identifiable, and so were their reasons. They were a small group of Islamic extremists who supported Al Qaeda; a larger group of students studying at madrasas, which had expanded rapidly since the 1980s; and young militants who had been empowered by years of support from Pakistan's military intelligence services to fight against India in Kashmir. They were a tiny minority of Pakistan's 150 million people at the time. In their eyes, America was an imperial, oppressive, heathen power just like the Soviet Union, which they had defeated in Afghanistan. 
Now, with the United States about to enter the 11th year of the longest war it has ever fought, far more of my neighbors in Pakistan have joined the list of America's detractors. The wave of anti-Americanism is rising in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, even among many who once admired the United States, and the short reason for that is plain: the common resentment is that American plans to bring peace and development to Afghanistan have failed, the killing is still going on, and to excuse their failures Americans have now expanded the war into Pakistan, evoking what they did in the 1960s when the Vietnam war moved into Laos and Cambodia. Moreover, while Pakistanis die for an American war, Washington has given favored deals to Pakistan's archenemy, India. So goes the argument.
The more belligerent detractors of America will tell you that Americans are imperialists who hate Islam, and that Americans' so-called civilizing instincts have nothing to do with democracy or human rights. A more politically attuned attitude is that the detractor doesn't hate Americans, just the policies that American leaders pursue.
But both groups feel trapped: Afghanistan is still caught up in war, and my country is on the brink of meltdown. And so now there is something beyond just disliking America. We have begun to ask the question of 9/11 in reverse: why do Americans hate us so much ?
Ten years is a long time to be at war, and to be faced with a daily threat of terrorist attacks. It is a long time spent in an unequal alliance in which the battle gets only more arduous and divisive, especially for the weaker partner on whose soil the battle is playing out. Under such long strain, resentments about intrusions, miscalculations and feckless performance make a leap to an assumption: that Americans must hate Pakistanis because they would otherwise never treat them so carelessly, speak so badly of them, or distrust them so much.
Americans should not be particularly surprised by this. War diminishes everyone and all states, even the victors, and that is especially true if the war is characterized by broken promises and dashed hopes, perceptions of betrayal, and disappointment in an ally. For the people living in this theater of war, the litany of such disappointments is long.
PERHAPS the greatest promise made after Sept. 11 by President George W. Bush and the British prime minister, Tony Blair, was that the West would no longer tolerate failed and failing states or extremism. Today there are more failed states than ever; Al Qaeda's message has spread to Europe, Africa and the American mainland; and every religion and culture is producing its own extremists, whether in sympathy with Islamism or in reaction to it (witness the recent massacre in Norway).
Famine, hunger, poverty and economic failure have increased beyond measure, at least in this corner of the world, where the Sept. 11 plans were hatched, while climate change has set off enormous floods and drought brings untold misery to millions in unexpected places. The latter is not the fault of Sept. 11, but in the minds of many the catastrophes we face stem from America's wars and the diversion of America's attention from truly universal problems. In this, America, too, is a victim of its wars and the global changes it has not addressed.
Of the two invasions -- Iraq and Afghanistan -- and the one state-salvaging operation, in Pakistan, that Americans embarked on in the past decade, America's most glaring failure has been its inability to help rebuild the states and the nations where it has gone to war. State-building is about setting up institutions and governance that may not have existed before, as in Afghanistan, or that have been in the hands of ruthless dictators, as in Iraq. Nation-building is all about helping countries develop national cohesion, as Iraq still struggles to do and as Pakistan has failed to do since its creation. That is done not by blunt force, but by developing the economy, civil society, education and skills.
Both state- and nation-building were dirty words in the Bush administration. They are less so in the Obama administration, but they are also no longer used to describe the Obama strategy in Afghanistan or Pakistan. Still, the much vaunted counterinsurgency strategy framed by Gen. David H. Petraeus for defeating Al Qaeda depends enormously on improving governance, rebuilding institutions like the local army and police force, and empowering people with a future -- in other words, state- and nation-building.
Yet despite the billions of dollars spent on this strategy, America's social agenda has been pared down and the overall policy left in the hands of the United States military and the C.I.A., for which counterinsurgency is essentially a military tool. In Afghanistan, night raids and targeted killings by American Special Operations forces and drone attacks by the C.I.A. have replaced the B-52 bombers of post-Sept. 11 as the favored tools to deplete the Taliban. The targeting is more precise, but the cost in civilian deaths is still too high for the local population to bear.
Afghans now demonstrate in the streets every time a civilian is killed. In Pakistan, drone attacks have infuriated the entire population because nobody can quantify how successful they are in eliminating Al Qaeda or the Taliban. John O. Brennan, President Obama's counterterrorism adviser, said in June that for a year ''there hasn't been a single collateral death'' as a result of drone attacks. So the C.I.A. may claim that the drones have killed 600 militants and not a single civilian, but what Afghan or Pakistani can possibly believe that? Pakistan has asked for all drone strikes to cease, and the Afghans have asked for an end to night raids. But so far the Americans have not obliged. And anti-Americanism flourishes.
The United States invaded both Afghanistan and Iraq without even a plan as to how it would govern these countries. In both countries, policy was made on the hoof, and much of it was initially implemented in secret -- a sure way to forsake civilian empowerment. The former Afghan warlords, whom the Taliban got rid of in the 1990s, were re-employed by the C.I.A. They underwent metamorphoses, like caterpillars to butterflies, from warlords into businessmen, drug dealers, transport contractors, property magnates. But underneath the new Armani suit was the same warlord hated by the people. So Afghans blame the Americans for reviving their dormant tormentors.
Corruption is rampant, but not just because the rulers are kleptomaniacs. The United States must share a major part of the blame in giving huge contracts to the wrong people, forsaking accountability and transparency, and enriching only a few rather than building an economy. All of these failings -- warlords, corruption, civilian casualties -- have helped breed the new and vicious strain of anti-Americanism.
Meanwhile, American aid and economic development in Pakistan and Afghanistan have aimed at ''quick impact projects,'' which are intended to win hearts and minds, but which, like instant oatmeal, dissolve quickly. The real business of helping these states build an indigenous economy and creating jobs to replace opium growing and smuggling in the rural lands, where government authority is weakest, was left to chance. Yes, the American military became an employer, but Afghanistan is about to enter an acute economic downturn when 100,000 American troops leave and tens of thousands of Afghans who work for them become jobless.
A recent Congressional report says the United States has wasted at least $31 billion in the awarding of contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. And in Pakistan, people see no lasting economic benefit from the $20 billion Washington has spent there since 2001. It has bought a lot of military equipment, but no dam or university or electric power plant.
The Pakistani military benefited from those purchases, but it thought it was never consulted sufficiently by the United States and was not considered a true ally. Acting on those assumptions, it created its own safeguards by backing both President Bush and the resurgent Taliban insurgency, and it continued in that vein after President Obama took over. Throughout the war, it has feared that the United States was treating India as the real ally, so it maintained the extremists it had trained in the 1990s to fight its larger neighbor. But nothing stands still, and the military lost control as the extremists morphed into the Pakistani Taliban and began focusing on the state itself.
Pakistan, which is now the fourth largest nuclear armed state in the world, has been gravely destabilized by its involvement in wars in Afghanistan. This, at least, did not begin 10 years ago. It has spanned three decades. The 1980s war against the Soviet Union was fueled by C.I.A. operatives, Saudi money and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence. Kalashnikovs, drugs, madrasas and sectarian divisions proliferated then, while Pakistan was ruled by an American-backed military dictatorship. Since Sept. 11, Pakistan has again been destabilized by the insurgency in Afghanistan, and for most of that time it was again being ruled by an American-backed military dictatorship.
There is a flip side to this coin of anti-Americanism, of course. The leaders of both Afghanistan and Pakistan have found it convenient to play it for political survival or to explain away their own lapses. Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, has become a master at spilling tears to describe the latest American perfidy, while failing to fight corruption or provide a modicum of good governance. Similarly, Pakistan's army and intelligence directorate regularly brief the media and politicians on the long sequences of American betrayals, Washington's love for India and how Pakistan was trapped in this relationship. These are false narratives -- dry tinder for the question ''Why do Americans hate us?'' -- but they have now seeped into the national psyche, the media and the political debate, and countering them is not easy.
That is because the army's national security objectives, which many Pakistanis still accept as a matter of national identity, are rooted in the last century, rather than in what is needed today. They decree that the army must maintain a permanent state of enmity with India; a controlling influence in Afghanistan and the deployment of Islamic extremists or non-state actors as a tool of foreign policy in the region; and that it must command a lion's share of the national budget alongside its control of Pakistan's nuclear weapons.
AMERICAN attempts to change this course with either carrots or sticks are rebuffed, while the civilian government cowers in the background, not wanting to get trampled by the two bull elephants of American and Pakistani military will. Meanwhile the voices of extremism translate anti-Americanism into denunciations of Americans' own treasured ideals: democracy, liberalism, tolerance and women's rights. These days, all are pronounced Western or American concepts, and dismissed.
Pakistanis desperately need a new narrative -- one that is honest about the mistakes their leaders have made and continue to make. But where is the leadership to tell this story as it should be told? The military gets away with its antiquated thinking because nobody is offering an alternative. And without one, nothing will improve for a long time, because the American and Pakistani governments are in a sense mirror images of each other. The Americans have allowed their military and C.I.A. to dominate Washington's policy-making on Afghanistan and Pakistan, just as the Pakistani military and ISI dominate decision making in Islamabad.
Since the death last year of Richard C. Holbrooke, who was devoted to creating a political strategy to underpin American policy-making, but whom President Obama seemed to ignore, there has been no American political strategy for Pakistan or Afghanistan. After 10 years, it should be clear that the wars in this region cannot be won purely by military force, nor should policy making be left to the generals. The questions about who hates whom will become only more difficult to resolve until the warfare ends and national healing begins.

HEADLINE: From the Men, A Few Highlights After the Deluge

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In this year of the deluge, the symbol of the United States Open remains the water oozing in the surface of Louis Armstrong Stadium, alongside the soggy estuary of Flushing Bay.
What's next? Airborne frogs? Swarms of locusts?
One thing remains constant on this final weekend -- well, we think it is the final weekend -- and that is that the men's side of the Open resembled twin champeenship matches, as the boxing announcers pronounce it, as the top four seeds slugged it out in the main ring. The two women's semifinals were held in different stadiums, never a good move, and felt disjointed. 
The action was held on two separate tickets; the day tickets got about nine hours, including a rain delay -- what else? -- while the night people got barely an hour of Serena Williams's 6-2, 6-4 victory over Caroline Wozniacki after a long wait.
The bargain day session began with top-seeded Novak Djokovic falling behind by two sets to third-seeded Roger Federer, but Djokovic rallied to win, 6-7 (9), 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5, to advance to the final, now scheduled for Monday, to give the bruisers a day of rest.
It was a horrible way to end for Federer, who won five straight Opens from 2004 through 2008. He did not seem amused by Djokovic's posturing when he escaped with the victory.
After that, second-seeded Rafael Nadal took the court against fourth-seeded Andy Murray, in what was still the day session, although evening was rapidly falling. Nadal took 3 hours 24 minutes to beat Murray, 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2, as the fans rooted for the match to go to five sets. The session had opened at noon, but they wanted more for their money.
Meanwhile, the fans with night tickets milled around the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, helping the economy along by patronizing the expensive refreshment stands as the hours ticked by.
The women, through no fault of their own, were back in the mode of second-class citizens. Once upon a time, the two female finalists had to sit around the locker room and play their champeenship match when the first pair of men decided to finish. The Open got rid of that system, giving the women their own championship on Saturday night -- late Sunday afternoon in this year of the rain.
Arthur Ashe Stadium was overbooked after two days of rainouts earlier in the week, and Open officials were doing their best to play catch-up. The women's semifinals, usually a delightful separate event on Friday afternoon, had to be shunted into the evening, with -- let's face it -- the more desirable match between Williams and Wozniacki put in the main arena.
Samantha Stosur of Australia and Angelique Kerber of Germany, the two other semifinalists -- as athletic-looking as they are -- would probably not be noticed in the crowds surging across the tennis center's grounds. Just two more vibrant twenty-somethings in expensive-looking tennis gear.
Stosur, 27, ranked ninth in this Open, and Kerber, 23, unseeded here, were relegated to the venerable Grandstand, with its capacity of 6,000. Fans began to fill the seats as Stosur outlasted Kerber, 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, but the two women deserved the magic dust that comes from playing in the main arena.
History says that memorable moments can come even from relatively unheralded players, the way it was on the evening of Sept. 11, 2004, when two Russian players, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Dementieva, provided a memorable moment of grace after their final match.
Both players, and their homeland, were still reeling from news and images of the terrorist attack on Middle School No. 1 in distant Beslan that ultimately killed 331 hostages. In the final, the powerful Kuznetsova overpowered her junk-balling countrywoman, 6-3, 7-5. Afterward, Kuznetsova said her tennis victory ''seems so little'' compared with the awful events of 9/11 in the United States and the attack at Beslan, and she dedicated her triumph to the people of both countries.
''Stay together and battle terrorism,'' Dementieva told the crowd.
This year's women's final is scheduled for Sunday afternoon. Stacey Allaster, the chief executive of the Women's Tennis Association, used to run the Canadian Open and said she understood the scheduling problems the Open officials faced. She also said the four women should all have played their semifinals on the same main court.
To be fair, this is not the first time a women's semifinal has been moved to a secondary court. Two years ago, with rain in the forecast, the Open authorities prudently placed the obviously lesser semifinal on the adjacent Armstrong court at the same time as the other semifinal. Only 300 fans trekked next door to see Wozniacki, then on the ascent, beat Yanina Wickmayer.
The no-brainer main attraction was Serena Williams against Kim Clijsters, which came down to match point, when Williams menaced a line official and was penalized a point, ending the match.
This unpleasant outburst has stayed with Williams as she bounced back from injury to become a favorite in this tournament. Her match with Wozniacki never caught fire, but the men's semifinals had the rumble of a champeenship fight.

THAT USED TO BE US
How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back
By Thomas L. Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum
380 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28.
Failure after failure after failure. Bubbles that end in busts. Wars that aren't won. Stimuli that don't stimulate. All together plunging the United States into the worst economic slump since the 1930s. Meanwhile, across the Pacific, America faces a geopolitical rival that is also an effective economic competitor -- a combination not seen since the kaiser's Germany.
Into this grim situation, Thomas L. Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum step forward to offer hope. Or do they?
For there is an unnerving tension at the core of ''That Used to Be Us,'' a discordant emotional counterpoint. I don't think it's a disagreement between the authors so much as a disagreement within each of them. 
Friedman and Mandelbaum repeatedly describe themselves as ''optimists,'' albeit ''frustrated'' optimists. Yet the stories they tell repeatedly suggest very different and less reassuring conclusions.
The main line of the book's argument will arrive with congenial familiarity. Friedman is one of America's most famous commentators, Mandelbaum one of its most distinguished academic experts on foreign policy. Their views -- and their point of view -- are well known. They speak from just slightly to the left of the battered American political center: for free trade, open immigration, balanced budgets, green energy, consumption taxes, health care reform, investments in education and infrastructure.
There is a lot to like and admire in this approach. It is progressive and liberal in the best senses of both those words. It has resulted in a book that is at once enlightened and enlightening. Friedman -- not that you need me to tell you this -- is a very good reporter. He takes us with him to visit a high school for disadvantaged youths that triumphantly sends 100 percent of its graduates to college, then to view a new fighter jet that runs on fuel 50 percent of which is derived from the oil of pressed mustard seeds. The partnership with Mandelbaum has been fruitful, curbing Friedman's notorious verbal excesses and stiffening the book with extra analytic rigor: a chart detailing the collapse of federal support for research and development is especially disturbing.
Together they offer a range of examples of how America can do better than it has done in the recent past. Despite its slightly misleading subtitle, ''That Used to Be Us'' is not really a ''how to'' book, not really a policy book. Friedman and Mandelbaum go very light on the programmatic details. Instead, they emphasize the power of good examples: instance after instance of forward-looking C.E.O.'s, effective military commanders, tough educational administrators, responsible politicians who have made things work. The book is more a demonstration than an argument: The situation isn't hopeless! Success is possible! See here and here and here and here.
And yet . . . Friedman and Mandelbaum also point out things like this: New military recruits arrive much less physically fit than previous generations because of a lack of exercise, and they come in with what Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, calls ''a mixed bag of values.'' Dempsey goes on: ''I am not suggesting they have bad values, but among all the values that define our profession, first and most important is trust. If we could do only one thing with new soldiers, it would be to instill in them trust for one another, for the chain of command and for the nation.'' O.K., so that's alarming.
And so is this point from Arne Duncan, the secretary of education: ''Currently about one-fourth of ninth graders fail to graduate high school within four years. Among the O.E.C.D. countries, only Mexico, Spain, Turkey and New Zealand have higher dropout rates than the United States.''
How about this statistic from Friedman and Mandelbaum: ''Thirty years ago, 10 percent of California's general revenue fund went to higher education and 3 percent to prisons. Today nearly 11 percent goes to prisons and 8 percent to higher education.''
Or this, which comes from the Nobelist Joseph Stiglitz: ''The top 1 percent of Americans now take in roughly one-fourth of America's total income every year. In terms of wealth rather than income, . . . the top 1 percent now controls 40 percent of the total. This is new. Twenty-five years ago, the corresponding figures were 12 percent and 33 percent.''
Or this, from the Pentagon via Arne Duncan: ''Seventy-five percent of young Americans, between the ages of 17 to 24, are unable to enlist in the military today because they have failed to graduate from high school, have a criminal record or are physically unfit.''
The ''frustrated optimists'' describe a country whose people are falling behind, a political system increasingly paralyzed and institutions that seem ever more inadequate to meet ever more intractable challenges. They remark that China led the world until it bumped into a series of ''bad centuries'' after 1644. That fate could overtake America too.
Prophetic warnings usually culminate with an ''unless'' clause. The casual reader will flip through the book searching in some frustration for the Friedman-/Mandelbaum ''unless.'' Their main recommendations tend to stop a block short of the destination: the solutions are unspecific, when they are not outright fanciful, like their yearning for a third-party presidential campaign.
Yet there is an ''unless'' looming implicitly in these pages. Through the weltering confusion of their four points of this and five pillars of that, Friedman and Mandelbaum again and again return to one inspiring theme: the leader ''too dumb to quit,'' who insists on battling a problem again and again until a solution is found.
''That Used to Be Us'' is a morality play, in which responsible and irresponsible leaders contend against one another: the senator willing to make compromises against the senator who cravenly signs a no-tax pledge; the C.E.O. rebuilding a manufacturing plant against the banker engaged in paper manipulations; the governor who persuades teachers to rewrite their contract to end tenure for the incompetent against the politicians who dismiss today's deficits as tomorrow's problem.
Friedman and Mandelbaum at one point praise the beauty of solutions that rise from the bottom up as opposed to the top down. This praise is not consciously insincere, but pretty plainly it does not accurately represent their operational plan. Friedman and Mandelbaum are men of the American elite, and they write to salute those members of the American elite who behave public-spiritedly and to scourge those who do not. They are winners, writing to urge other winners to have more of a care for their fellow citizens who are not winners.
And you know what? There's nothing wrong with that! Societies inescapably generate elites. Those elites can be /public-spirited and responsible or they can be selfish and shortsighted. An elite can have concern and care for the less advantaged or it can callously disregard them. Maybe not surprisingly, the language of anti-/elitism has often been a useful tool of the most rapacious and merciless among the elite.
American society has had a big serving of that ugly anti-elitist spirit in the recent past. It could use more of the generous responsible spirit Friedman and Mandelbaum recommend. They say less than might be wished about what a more /public-spirited American elite might do. But they have eloquently described what such an elite should want to do.

HEADLINE: The Price of Lost Chances

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
GRAPHIC: One 9/11 Tally: $3.3 Trillion <check>
In 2004, when he was arguably still capable of initiating another devastating attack on the United States, Osama bin Ladenreleased a video gloating about his plan of ''bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy.''
As usual, Bin Laden's vow was overblown -- but, as it turned out, not entirely crazed. A survey by The New York Times, detailed in the accompanying chart, puts a stark price tag on the cost of reacting -- and overreacting -- to the defining event of the past decade. America's bill for fighting a 21st-century ''asymmetric war'' comes to at least $3.3 trillion. Put another way, for every dollar Al Qaeda spent to pull off the Sept. 11 attacks, the cost to the United States was an astonishing $6.6 million.
Today, Al Qaeda in Pakistan is crippled and Bin Laden is dead. But the $3.3 trillion figure suggests that the unanticipated costs of how we managed a grim decade -- money already spent or committed in the future -- amount to a little more than one-fifth of America's current national debt. 
Some of those were unavoidable, direct costs of responding to the attack. Some, like the Iraq war, were expenditures of choice. But there is also the more difficult, less quantifiable question of what we paid in ''opportunity costs.''
Less than a trillion dollars of the $3.3 trillion was for direct responses -- including toppling the Taliban. But what if at least some of the remaining $2 trillion plus had been spent on other, longer-range threats to American national security? Rebuilding a broken education system? Finding more imaginative ways to compete with China? Reducing the national debt? Or delivering on promises, by President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton alike, for ''Marshall plans'' to rebuild societies at risk of letting the next Al Qaeda flourish?
''We're Americans,'' Adm. Dennis C. Blair, who served briefly as President Obama's director of national intelligence, said recently when asked how the costs rose, then spiraled out of control. ''If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing.'' The nation never really debated these priorities: ''What justifies this level of spending?'' he asked. That debate has begun, but only recently, after a huge federal deficit and a national weariness with a decade of war created a reaction so powerful that some fear the nation will retreat into isolationism.
''From today's perspective, we suffered a trauma and then a post-traumatic stress disorder that we tried to cure by throwing endless money at the problem,'' said David Rothkopf, who wrote a history of the National Security Council, where many of the decisions were made. ''There are expenditures of necessity and expenditures of choice, and it has taken us a full decade to recognize that some of the choices were fundamentally wrong. Only now have we hit the pivot point.''
The trade-offs -- not guns versus butter but short-term security versus long-term -- were not apparent in the early days when Sept. 11 seemed like the new Pearl Harbor. They were the furthest thing from anyone's mind on that sunny, horrifying day. I was covering President Bush's visit to a Sarasota, Fla., schoolhouse that morning, and when the second plane hit the south tower in New York, it became instantly evident to both the president's aides and the traveling press that this was the work of Bin Laden, and that a presidency was transforming before our eyes. A forceful response was inevitable.
It was more than a year before anyone talked about whether America's whatever-it-takes approach risked granting Bin Laden his obvious wish of wreaking huge economic havoc, and by then the United States was headed to Iraq.
As the immediate response turned into the broader, ill-defined ''Global War on Terror'' -- the Pentagon even issued a GWOT medal for service outside the main theaters of battle -- that debate over opportunity costs was labeled almost unpatriotic. The director of the National Economic Council, Lawrence Lindsey, was forced to resign after suggesting in 2002 that a war with Iraq could cost $100 billion to $200 billion. Mitch Daniels, then head of the Office of Management and Budget, was sent to offer a counterestimate of $50 billion to $60 billion, a rounding error in modern federal budgeting. (The Democrats' estimate was $93 billion.) The actual number, according to the Congressional Research Service, is $800 billion and climbing.
Afghanistan, by contrast, has been a bargain, at about half the cost -- less than the long-term price tag, $589 billion by one estimate, of caring for the veterans of both wars.
No president enters a war with the faintest idea of what it will cost, of course. But at least two-thirds of the 9/11 response can be traced to a few lines in the 2002 National Security Strategy of the United States, which declared the United States had to pre-empt any credible, emerging threat. For years, there was no talk of a ''minimal deterrent,'' proportionate response or balancing defense against other priorities. As one White House official asked me scoldingly, who applies cost-benefit calculations to national security?
Today, it seems unimaginable not to. Indeed, perhaps the biggest single change in the national security strategy of the United States since Mr. Obama came to office is the constant whir of that calculation. When Mr. Obama announced the ''surge'' in Afghanistan -- modeled after the largely successful surge in Iraq -- he slipped a few paragraphs into his speech to make clear that the days of open-ended war were over. ''Over the past several years, we have lost that balance'' between investing at home and investing in national security, he said. ''Competition within the global economy has grown more fierce. So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of these wars.''
At the time, Mr. Obama's caution was dismissed as political posturing. ''What everyone missed -- even his own generals -- is that he believes this to his core, and that's what differentiates his strategy from Bush's,'' one senior administration official said. Mr. Obama has set a deadline for the surge troops to be pulled back by September 2012, two months before the election.
But the real model for a new approach -- one that avoids $3.3 trillion price tags -- was evident in Libya. To Mr. Obama, this was the test of the thesis that there is an alternative approach to bringing about regime change. Like Saddam Hussein, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was a vicious dictator with a history of terrorism and nuclear ambitions. While Mr. Obama decided to intervene in Libya -- over the objections of his defense secretary -- he insisted that there be no ground troops, that NATO allies take the lead and that the United States offer only ''unique capabilities.'' Even with those restrictions, American operations cost more than a billion dollars, and critics like Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, charged that the ''halfway in'' approach prolonged the conflict and cost untold Libyan lives.
Whether he is right or wrong, Libya was an example of what countries with real restraints -- fiscal, political and strategic -- have to do. Because even a hyperpower, as the French called the United States just before 9/11, cannot absorb more than one bill for $3.3 trillion.

HEADLINE: GreenTech Plans to Build E.V.'s in Mississippi

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
The MyCar is a Smart-sized, two-seat electric vehicle with an international pedigree to match its manufacturer's outsize ambitions. Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, one of the auto industry's most famous stylists, the MyCar was originally intended for a manufacturer based in Hong Kong. But the diminutive E.V. is now scheduled to be produced by GreenTech Automotive, based in Mississippi, and shipped to Denmark for European distribution later this year.
The MyCar project grew yet another wrinkle this month. Terry McAuliffe, GreenTech's chairman and the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the car's hybrid and electric drivetrains would be built not at the brand's Chinese joint-venture plant - currently under construction in Inner Mongolia - but in Mississippi, a distinct reversal of the usual flow of manufactured goods. 
Mr. McAuliffe, who also headed the presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton and mounted an unsuccessful bid for Virginia governor in 2009, was described in 2000 by Vice President Al Gore as ''the greatest fund-raiser in the history of the universe.''
In recent media appearances, Mr. McAuliffe has presented GreenTech as a catalyst of American job creation. ''I am sick and tired of seeing our jobs go to China,'' Mr. McAuliffe recently told MSNBC. ''I am sick and tired of seeing big cargo ships coming in from China.''
GreenTech's plans have engendered some skepticism. According to Automotive News, Mr. McAuliffe's ambitious scheme faces ''overwhelming obstacles'' and is ''dead on arrival.''
The Truth About Cars, an automotive news and commentary Web site, recently recounted GreenTech's history as an offshoot of Hybrid Kinetic Motors, founded by Yang Rong - also known as Benjamin Yeung - the former chief executive of Brilliance, another Chinese automaker. In 2009, Hybrid Kinetic outlined a plan to build green cars in northern Mississippi with the involvement of Charles Wang, currently the chief executive of GreenTech. But Mr. Wang and Mr. Yang parted ways before any cars were built. Brilliance's plans to enter the European passenger-car market also were dealt a blow when one of its products received a zero-star safety rating in a crash test.
Despite the skepticism, Mr. Wang said in a telephone interview that crews were moving at ''warp speed'' to build the Inner Mongolia plant, which he said would be completed by the end of 2012 and have the capacity to produce 300,000 cars annually for the domestic market.
Wheels reported last year that Hybrid Kinetic planned to ''heavily rely'' on the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as EB-5, which would grant green cards and permanent residency to foreign citizens and their families who invested at least $500,000 in successful businesses in rural locations, or in areas of high unemployment. The Commercial Appeal of Memphis reported in 2009 that GreenTech would also be financed through EB-5. Mr. Wang confirmed the report in an e-mailed statement to Wheels, saying that GreenTech Auto ''has been utilizing the EB-5 program as part of our funding sources.''
American customers must wait to sample the MyCar because GreenTech intends to ship ''a sizable percentage'' of production through 2014 to its European venture, Mr. Wang said, adding that neighborhood electric vehicles, or N.E.V.'s, are more widely usable in Europe, where they are not limited to speeds of 25 or 35 miles per hour as they often are in the United States. The MyCar has a top speed of approximately 50 m.p.h.
Phil Gott, an automotive analyst at IHS Global Insight, said that inexpensive N.E.V.'s like the MyCar might find a market, in Europe and elsewhere, as limited-range urban vehicles.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Democrats Fret Aloud Over Obama's Chances

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO, JEFF ZELENY and MONICA DAVEY; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.. 
This article is by Michael Barbaro, Jeff Zeleny and Monica Davey.

 BODY:
Democrats are expressing growing alarm about President Obama's re-election prospects and, in interviews, are openly acknowledging anxiety about the White House's ability to strengthen the president's standing over the next 14 months.
Elected officials and party leaders at all levels said their worries have intensified as the economy has displayed new signs of weakness. They said the likelihood of a highly competitive 2012 race is increasing as the Republican field, once dismissed by many Democrats as too inexperienced and conservative to pose a serious threat, has started narrowing to two leading candidates, Mitt Romney and Rick Perry, who have executive experience and messages built around job creation.
And in a campaign cycle in which Democrats had entertained hopes of reversing losses from last year's midterm elections, some in the party fear that Mr. Obama's troubles could reverberate down the ballot into Congressional, state and local races.
''In my district, the enthusiasm for him has mostly evaporated,'' said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. ''There is tremendous discontent with his direction.'' 
The president's economic address last week offered a measure of solace to discouraged Democrats by employing an assertive and scrappy style that many supporters complain has been absent for the last year as he has struggled to rise above Washington gridlock. Several Democrats suggested that he watch a tape of the jobs speech over and over and use it as a guide until the election.
But a survey of two dozen Democratic officials found a palpable sense of concern that transcended a single week of ups and downs. The conversations signaled a change in mood from only a few months ago, when Democrats widely believed that Mr. Obama's path to re-election, while challenging, was secure.
''The frustrations are real,'' said Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who was the state chairman of Mr. Obama's campaign four years ago. ''I think we know that there is a Barack Obama that's deep in there, but he's got to synchronize it with passion and principles.''
There is little cause for immediate optimism, with polls showing Mr. Obama at one of the lowest points of his presidency.
His own economic advisers concede that the unemployment rate, currently 9.1 percent, is unlikely to drop substantially over the next year, creating a daunting obstacle to re-election.
Liberals have grown frustrated by some of his actions, like the decision this month to drop tougher air-quality standards.
And polling suggests that the president's yearlong effort to reclaim the political center has so far yielded little in the way of additional support from the moderates and independents who tend to decide presidential elections.
''The alarms have already gone off in the Democratic grass roots,'' said Robert Zimmerman, a member of the Democratic National Committee from New York, who hopes the president's jobs plan can be a turning point. ''If the Obama administration hasn't heard them, they should check the wiring of their alarm system.''
At a gathering of the Democratic National Committee in Chicago this weekend, some party leaders sounded upbeat after they toured the Obama campaign headquarters. But others expressed anxiety that Mr. Obama's accomplishments were not being conveyed loudly enough to ordinary people, that Republican lawmakers were making it impossible for him to get more done, and that Mr. Obama's conciliatory approach might be translating to some voters as weakness.
''Now that they're slapping him in the side of the face, he's coming back,'' said William George, a committee member from Pennsylvania. ''He needs to start stomping his foot and pounding the desk.'' At the White House and at Mr. Obama's campaign headquarters in Chicago, officials bristled at the critiques, which they dismissed as familiar intraparty carping and second-guessing that would give way to unity and enthusiasm once the nation is facing a clear choice between the president and the Republican nominee.
Jim Messina, the campaign manager for the president's re-election, said the criticism was largely a ''Washington conversation'' that did not match up with the on-the-ground enthusiasm for Mr. Obama among his network of supporters. Yet even without a primary challenger, the campaign purposefully started its effort early to allow concerns from supporters to be aired.
To reassure nervous Democrats, the president's campaign aides are traveling the country with PowerPoint presentations that spell out Mr. Obama's path to re-election. Their pitch is that Mr. Obama's appeal has grown in traditionally Republican states like Arizona, where there are fast-growing Hispanic populations, and that Republicans have alienated independent voters with ''extreme'' positions on popular programs like Medicare.
''We always knew 2011 was, in part, a conversation with our supporters and a time to tell the story to our base to make sure they understand what he has gotten done,'' Mr. Messina said. ''Our supporters are reasonable and need to be reminded about the things we've done.''
He added: ''No one is calling me up and yelling. They are people saying: 'How can we get the word out? How do we better talk about it?' ''
For Mr. Obama's strongest supporters, his jobs speech on Thursday night to a joint session of Congress seemed to affirm their belief that after a rough patch, the White House had seized the upper hand, however temporarily, in both substantive and political terms.
After ceding much of the debate over the economy to Republicans, they said, Mr. Obama had framed next year's election as a struggle between a president with a plan for creating jobs and reducing the deficit and a Republican Party that would rather score political points and adhere slavishly to ideological positions than address the needs of Americans.
Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, who attended the speech, described a changed president, no longer so reluctant to be outwardly aggressive. ''He seemed liberated for the fight and very confident in his own skin,'' Mr. O'Malley said.
But given the risk of voters' locking in judgments that Mr. Obama's presidency has failed to address the economy adequately or to deliver on its promise of changing Washington, many Democrats said that both the speech and Mr. Obama's change in tone had been long overdue.
''He should have given it earlier,'' said Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan.
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said, ''He's got to engage, make the contrast and occasionally be combative.''
The president is already embracing the suggestion that he spend more time outside Washington, which emerged as a recurring theme in the interviews with Democrats. He promoted his economic plan in Virginia on Friday and has trips to North Carolina and Ohio on tap this week.
At the Democratic National Committee meeting in Chicago, Mannie Rodriguez, a committee member from Colorado, said Democrats needed to find a new blast of energy -- something to remind them of what they felt in 2008 when Mr. Obama was elected on a slogan of hope and change.
''We need to work more on the message,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, adding that much of Mr. Obama's challenge stems from a group of Republicans who ''simply say no'' to all of his advances. ''We have to re-energize people and get them back to the party.''
In many parts of the country, Democrats are still reeling from the punishing defeat in the 2010 elections, which gave Republicans control of a majority of governor's seats and legislative chambers. State Democratic leaders are criticizing the White House with candor, fretting aloud about the president's electoral vulnerability.
''If the election were held today, it would be extremely close here in Florida,'' said Jon M. Ausman, a member of the Democratic National Committee from Florida.
Problems for Mr. Obama in Florida, Mr. Ausman said, could trickle down into next year's Senate race there, where Bill Nelson, a Democrat, faces re-election. ''Too many people here have lost their jobs,'' Mr. Ausman said.
For all the hand-wringing among Democrats, some party leaders say Mr. Obama has time to reverse his slipping fortunes -- but not much.
''I think there's an uneasy feeling, but it's a little early for an ulcer to develop,'' said Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia. ''Obviously, the dark cloud over everything is the economic performance.''
Mr. DeFazio recalled attending a dozen or so town-hall-style meetings recently in his district, a slice of western Oregon that Mr. Obama carried in 2008 by 11 percentage points. Mr. DeFazio said party loyalists had bluntly said they were reconsidering their support.
''I have one heck of a lot of Democrats saying, 'I voted for him before, don't know if I can do it again,' '' he said.

HEADLINE: If Obama Is a One-Term President

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. ZELIZER. 
A professor of history and public affairs at Princeton, and the author of '', Jimmy Carter'' and the coming book ''Governing America.''

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
''I'D rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president,'' President Obama confessed to ABC News' Diane Sawyer last year. Other than the ''really good'' part, Republicans would be happy to see this wish fulfilled.
With waning approval ratings and a stagnant economy, the possibility that Mr. Obama will not be re-elected has entered the political bloodstream. Suddenly, the opposition party envisions a scenario in which its presidential candidate could defeat Mr. Obama in a referendum on his job performance. Mr. Obama needs to think hard about his own statement and consider what it takes to be a successful one-term president, in the light of history.
One-term presidents usually leave office with their parties divided, the economy in crisis, wars unresolved, approval ratings in the tank and a sullen public rejecting them. Becoming a one-term president means joining a gallery of dashed hopes and crushed ambitions. Among those who were elected for just one term were men who, like Mr. Obama, came to the White House with enormous promise. 
Nevertheless, accomplishments with lasting significance have resulted from some one-term presidencies. We live in a competitive culture that is so obsessed with measuring presidential leadership solely based on re-election that we often miss the ability of the losers, so to speak, to shape the direction of American politics.
Some one-term presidents pushed huge legislative agendas through Congress that remade public policy and survived for decades after their presidencies. They burned all of their political capital to produce changes that were not easily undone, because they created strong constituencies.
James K. Polk, who said at the outset that he wanted only one term, pledged to promote free trade and to re-establish an independent Treasury. Most important, Polk wanted to significantly expand the territorial scope of the United States. When he left office, he could rightly claim to have succeeded in accomplishing almost everything he set out to do; the size of the nation almost doubled on his watch.
Lyndon B. Johnson served slightly more than one term; he stepped up from the vice presidency on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, who had a little over a year left in his term. Although Johnson never got the nomination for a second term, he achieved enormous legislative and social change. Determined to outshine his model, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected an unprecedented four times, Johnson pushed through a domestic policy agenda of civil and voting rights, Medicare and Medicaid, federal education assistance, anti-poverty legislation and more.
Johnson, a vastly experienced and canny politician, always knew the political costs that might come from his policy successes. He understood that his civil rights advocacy divided the traditional Democratic coalition and offered fodder to a Republican Party eager to regain control of the White House by rejecting its Lincoln legacy and absorbing the followers of the segregationist demagogue George C. Wallace of Alabama.
On the night L.B.J. signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, his speechwriter and adviser Bill Moyers walked into his bedroom, unexpectedly finding him looking forlorn. ''I think,'' Johnson explained, ''we just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come.''
In March 1968, faced with the turmoil over the Vietnam War and challenges for the nomination from Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, who had stung him in the New Hampshire primary, Johnson announced that he was withdrawing from the race. His justification was that he had higher goals, like trying to negotiate peace in Vietnam and obtaining a tax surcharge from Congress, that would require his complete attention. For years afterward, Johnson was a tainted figure in American politics, condemned by the left and the right. Yet the groundbreaking programs he put on the books remain.
At the height of the conservative revolution in 1985, the spokesman for President Ronald Reagan's budget bureau, Edwin L. Dale Jr. stated, ''I wouldn't quarrel that Medicare's been a success. In fact, much of the social safety net was accomplished during the Great Society, and whatever gets trimmed, the safety net will remain intact.''
Other one-term presidents left records that were not as sweeping as Polk's or Johnson's, but they still persuaded Congress to enact policies with lasting significance. President George Bush was responsible for a sea change with passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, legislation that created a huge regulatory structure to protect and assist those who were physically disabled.
Herbert C. Hoover created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which helped temporarily stabilize the credit system by lending money to banks and businesses, a precedent that F.D.R. built on. The one-termer William Howard Taft, overshadowed by the presidents who bookended him -- Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson -- helped strengthen regulations on big business.
Sometimes one-term presidents have been able to influence public debate for years to come. Jimmy Carter was one such president. Faced with economic stagflation and an energy crisis, Mr. Carter lobbied Congress to pass energy conservation legislation. In a televised address early in his presidency in 1977, Mr. Carter explained that good policy would require ''painful'' sacrifices. He implored Americans to change their consumption patterns and called for insulating homes and using solar energy. Although some advisers warned that this would be unpopular, he did not desist. Congress passed only a watered-down version of what he wanted.
Mr. Carter continued to tell Americans exactly what they didn't want to hear. But on many issues, he was right, and his vision continues to resonate. He was similarly influential with human rights, a foreign policy that initially earned him considerable criticism from Republicans, though in later decades many of them embraced his rhetoric.
Other one-term presidents have made difficult policy choices with harsh political consequences. In 1990, after the supply-side tax cuts ran up an astronomical deficit, the first President Bush reluctantly agreed to a deficit-reduction package that included tax increases. With this act, he broke his campaign promise: ''Read my lips: No new taxes.'' But he was willing to take the political heat. Newt Gingrich never forgave him. And Patrick J. Buchanan ran against him from the right in the primaries.
Political consequences for difficult choices were also paid by yet another one-term president, John Adams, who backed off from a war with France. He rejected jingoism for prudence. Opponents inside his own party used his preference for peace against him.
IF 2012 is really the end of the road for President Obama, it is possible to see how historians might look favorably on his term. The president has already accomplished a great deal. His health care reform legislation promises to expand health insurance to millions of people and correct a number of flaws in our current system. His economic stimulus helped to stave off a second Depression and preserve the auto industry, while his financial regulations are meant to curb some of the abuses that led to the financial collapse of 2008. He has used executive power to strengthen some environmental regulations, while on foreign policy the killing of Osama bin Laden constituted an important step in the war on terrorism. Most recently, the role of the United States in the collapse of the rule of Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya marks another victory in the struggle against dictatorships.
But passing a lot of bills and achieving military victories is not enough. Making them stick is the trick. As the political scientist Eric M. Patashnik of the University of Virginia has shown in his revealing book, ''Reforms at Risk,'' the fate of policy reforms is heavily dependent on what happens after laws pass. This is especially true for one-term presidents, who usually fail to build political coalitions that can survive longer than they can. President Obama must amass some political capital to protect these programs, or he risks losing everything for himself and for his party. He can't govern based on the assumption that he will have more time to repair things.
Since the 2010 midterm elections, Mr. Obama has governed from such a defensive position that he risks undercutting those gains. The president has to make sure that his embrace of deficit reduction through spending cuts does not jeopardize his health care reform. He must also make politically difficult choices, like following through on his promise to push for an end to the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, even if his close advisers fear that such a stand will blow up in their faces come Election Day. The president's speech on jobs was a start, but the follow-through is critical.
In the coming debates over spending cuts, President Obama has to find the fortitude to outline the terms of the debate. He needs to keep his eye on what he did in 2009 and 2010, and not just what will happen in 2012. Otherwise, he risks ending up with the worst of both worlds: a weak one-term record and a loss in 2012.

HEADLINE: Let's Twist Again, Like We Did in '61

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
''COME on baby, let's do the Twist.''
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, hasn't actually put it that way. But in his search for ways to improve the lamentable state of the economy, he seems to be contemplating the revival of an old dance that was once all the rage at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.
What's the Fed considering, exactly? It might embark on some arcane financial engineering, shifting the bonds within its own portfolio to bring down longer-term interest rates even further than they have already dropped. That's been tried before, notably in 1961, in a once-obscure episode of Fed history known as ''Operation Twist.'' Some of the techniques used then may be coming back into vogue because the economy needs help and it's not clear where it will come from. 
Europe is awash in financial and fiscal problems of its own, Japan is struggling, and China's economy is slowing, noted Robbert Van Batenburg, head of research at Louis Capital Markets. And while President Obama on Thursday proposed a $447 billion program to spur growth and job creation, the Republican leadership in Congress was initially unenthusiastic about much if not all of it.
''The surprise here was that the president's program was about $100 billion more than the markets had anticipated,'' he said. ''That's good. But problem No. 1 is, it isn't clear how much, if any of it, Congress is likely to pass.''
The Fed, meanwhile, has already used some of its most powerful weapons -- like holding short-term interest rates near zero at least through mid-2013, and buying more than $1.8 trillion of fixed-income securities as part of a bid to bring down longer-term rates.
So in a series of speeches, including one on Thursday in Minneapolis, Mr. Bernanke has been saying that the Fed is reconsidering the entire ''range of tools'' at its disposal to stimulate the economy. It may be time to try something a little different.
How about the Twist?
Cue the summer of 1960. Chubby Checker's version of ''The Twist'' soared to the top of the charts. America was swiveling its hips. Fast-forward to Feb. 2, 1961. The glamorous new president, John F. Kennedy, elected on a pledge to ''get the country moving again,'' made his first major official speech on the economy, which was then formally in recession. He announced his own program to stimulate the economy and to fight unemployment, then an unpalatable 6.8 percent. (Today it's much worse, at 9.1 percent.)
Embedded in that speech was an unorthodox monetary policy that the Fed and Treasury were to conduct jointly. It was known within the Fed as ''Operation Nudge,'' because it involved nudging interest rates by altering the composition of the Fed's portfolio. That name, though, didn't catch on. (As far as we know, nobody was dancing the Nudge.)
Wall Street gave the new program another name. ''In a kind of homage to the dance craze, traders started calling it, 'Operation Twist,' '' says Eric Swanson, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco who has done extensive research on the operation's effects. ''Somewhere along the way, that name stuck,'' he says.
Twist is a more apt description of what the Fed was actually doing -- swinging longer-term rates in one direction (down), while moving short-term rates the other way. Raising short-term rates made sense at the time because the world was still on a gold standard, and President Kennedy wanted to stimulate the economy without exacerbating a balance-of-payments deficit that was draining American gold supplies. He wanted to bolster the dollar -- by raising short-term rates -- while giving the economy a lift by bringing down longer-term rates.
Here the steps in the monetary dance get a bit technical. They include selling some of the Fed's short-term securities and buying longer-term ones, effectively extending the average duration of the Fed's own portfolio. Because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, increased purchases of longer-term securities could be expected to drive up prices and drive down interest rates, and vice versa. Today, presumably, the Fed would manipulate its portfolio to lower longer-term rates, but in contrast to 1961, it would hold short-term rates near zero.
A number of scholars -- including Mr. Bernanke, when he was a professor at Princeton and a member of the Fed's board of governors -- have concluded that the first Operation Twist was only modestly successful. But Mr. Swanson's recent research, using contemporary high-frequency techniques to measure the bond market's short-term response to Fed and Treasury operations, suggests that it actually had a significant effect on long-term Treasury yields.
The yields fell by an average of 0.14 percent (14 basis points), Mr. Swanson says, a shift roughly equivalent to the effect of cutting short-term rates -- which can't be cut now because they're near zero -- by a full percentage point.
''In normal times,'' he said, ''a drop like that might boost output by a percentage point over the next couple of quarters.''
WHATEVER else they may be, however, these are not normal times. It's not clear how much effect a shift in the Fed's portfolio might have right now, he said, but ''it might help and it might be worth trying.''
With financial markets weighed down by myriad problems across the globe, Fed policy makers can be counted on to be inventive, said Kathy Jones, fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. Long-term bond yields have already started to drop as the markets anticipate some new variation on Operation Twist, she said.
At the Fed, Ms. Jones said, ''they are making it clear that they will do whatever they need to do, or whatever they can dream up, to help the economy.''

HEADLINE: The Cult of Physicality

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
SALT LAKE CITY
INSIDE an unmarked warehouse here, not far from a depressing stretch of fast-food joints and the Southern X-Posure strip club, Robert MacDonald -- nickname: Maximus -- is torturing a group of people.
Or at least that's how it looks. One man, howling in agony a second ago, has collapsed in a pool of sweat. A woman wipes away tears. A few of the rest are limping.
Maximus is not sympathetic. After all, they had been warned. It's right there on the Web site: ''You were free to choose and you did. Now lie in it.''
This is Gym Jones, a no-frills private club that caters to extreme fitness buffs, professional athletes, the military's special operations and -- on the opposite end of the pampered scale but only slightly less secretive -- movie stars. (Jude Law didn't get those contoured pectorals in ''Repo Men'' by accident.) 
Yes, the name is an overt nod to Jim Jones, the sect leader who steered more than 900 people to suicide in 1978. No, the couple that owns the gym, Lisa and Mark Twight, don't see anything obnoxious about that. ''We knew some people would call us a cult,'' Ms. Twight said, ''so we decided to own the joke.''
The zealous devotion clients have toward the gym and its fitness philosophy, which turns as much on psychology as it does on physicality, can indeed be a little frightening. Picture Scientologists, except with really big biceps.
One prominent fan is Zack Snyder, the Warner Brothers director whose testosterone-turbocharged ''300'' became a global smash in 2007. It was Gym Jones, using a mix of power lifting and military-style calisthenics, that whipped Gerard Butler, the star of that film, into loincloth shape.
Superman himself has recently been training here. Henry Cavill, hired to play the title character in Mr. Snyder's coming ''Man of Steel,'' arrived with eight-pack abs, or close to it, from training for another film. But Warner brought on Mr. Twight to mold the British actor into a true superhero; the two have been working together since April. ''It's not just about muscles,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''In fact, that's the least of it. They have a way of making you find things in yourself, and it's fantastic.''
That's easy for him to say. Mr. Snyder's days don't include a 5,000-calorie diet and more than three hours of pumping iron, like Mr. Cavill's. ''Mark gave me, or perhaps I could say allowed me, to discover my love of pushing myself beyond my notions of limits,'' Mr. Cavill wrote in an e-mail. ''He also gave me not an arrogance but a humble and healthy belief in my physical abilities, which I never before possessed.''
Trainers of this elite caliber tend to dismiss celebrities as dabblers who want results without the work. And don't get the serious fitness crowd started on the use of steroids in some corners of moviedom.
Gym Jones is no exception. But the Twights and Mr. MacDonald, the gym's manager, have also learned to open their minds. ''Take Jude Law,'' Mr. MacDonald said. ''At first I wasn't interested in Jude Law at all. He smoked, drank and was out of shape. But he surprised me and worked really hard. He proved me wrong.'' (Mr. Law declined comment.)
A willingness to take on famous clients has actually been problematic for Gym Jones. The studio cash is nice, and the ''300'' notoriety was rewarding; a version of a 300-rep workout designed for the cast as a graduation test has gone viral and was even plugged by Men's Health. But the Twights prefer privacy. They aren't angling for their own line of protein powders or a reality show, and accept only 30 to 40 clients at a time. If you are hearing about them through their work with stars, a tiny part of the gym, your chances of getting in are pretty much zero.
The Twights generally require an interview or a referral from a current Gym Jones client, the completion of a written application that's more of a fitness SAT than anything and, if you pass that step, a workout with Mr. MacDonald, a world champion mixed-martial-arts fighter. ''If I'm surrounded by substandard people, I'm not going to work that hard myself,'' Mr. MacDonald said. Again, it's right there on that full-of-itself Web site: ''We choose clients. Clients don't choose us.''
Gym Jones has another reason to guard its privacy: its military customers like it that way. Although the Twights refuse to talk much about this side of their business, which occurs inside the gym and in the nearby mountains, it appears to be considerable and to involve people who are supposed to be invisible. Six of Mr. Twight's former students, for instance, were among the 30 Americans -- most of them Navy Seals, including members of the team that killed Osama bin Laden -- who died in Afghanistan in August when their helicopter was shot down.
But don't push for more details: '' 'No' is a complete sentence,'' Ms. Twight said. ''I don't need to give a reason.''
GYM JONES, of course, is not the only fitness business thriving on tough love. From the boot camp programs that have become trendy in big cities to the screeching trainers on ''The Biggest Loser'' to CrossFit, a chain that has gained attention for promoting risky exercise, Americans seem to want their workouts served with hiss and spit.
Theories abound as to why. Fads tend to oscillate: the karate- and steroid-fueled bodybuilding of the 1970s (which notably accompanied the rise of women in the workplace) gave way to Jane Fonda's aerobics in the '80s and spinning and cardio hell in the '90s. Next came yoga and Pilates. More recently, economic and political upheaval, not to mention two grinding wars, have tipped people toward strength training and militaristic exercise.
Superbods have also returned as a Hollywood staple. Since April, studios have served up a mega-pumped Dwayne Johnson in ''Fast Five,'' a hulking Chris Hemsworth in ''Thor,'' a bare-chested Chris Evans as ''Captain America'' and a ripped Jason Momoa in ''Conan the Barbarian.'' Taylor Lautner's beefcake werewolf returns soon in ''The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1.''
Theater is a big part of Gym Jones, which the Twights founded in 2003 in a garage with no air-conditioning and no heat. (The couple moved to Utah from Colorado in 2001 to operate a climbing-equipment company and later started Gym Jones as a side project. Eventually, the Twights decided to go full time with Gym Jones.)
Everything about the gym's current configuration screams hard core, from the Web site (''Don't complain if the work is too hard, or if you pass out, drop a barbell on your head, a kettle bell on your toes'') to cold decor: cinderblock walls, black rubber floor mats, fluorescent lights, no mirrors or windows. Outside magazine described the gym as ''part martial-arts dojo, part smash lab, part medieval dungeon.''
Gym Jones calls clients ''disciples'' and prominently displays a quote from ''Fight Club,'' the 1999 film starring Brad Pitt. It reads in part: ''Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive.''
But once you're past all that, the mood at the gym is surprisingly warm. Mr. MacDonald, 33, has a daunting physical presence (at 6-foot-3, he can dead-lift 550 pounds) and blunt speaking style, but he also once taught kindergarten. The pixie-ish Ms. Twight, a 50-year-old jujitsu practitioner, has a quick, infectious laugh. A celebrated mountain climber, Mr. Twight, 50, is direct and aggressive but also quite polite and generous with his time.
And despite his stoic manner, Mr. Twight was clearly emotional over the deaths of his former students in Afghanistan. ''Different from the many fatalities that occurred throughout my climbing career, but the impact is still quite strong,'' he wrote in an e-mail.
The Gym Jones Way notably does not involve a bodybuilding-centered program of progressive overload and over-feeding. Pushing people so hard that they risk rhabdomyolysis -- a condition brought on when severely damaged muscle tissue releases toxins into the bloodstream --''is a tremendous failure,'' Ms. Twight said. She added that the gym encourages its trainers to get to know their subjects personally, whether than means going shopping at the grocery store after a workout or lending a sympathetic ear.
''It's like sex,'' she said. ''You can't just get up and leave afterwards. This is a relationship.''
It's possible that a reporter's visit has prompted this convivial tone, but Mr. Snyder and other clients -- sorry, ''disciples'' -- insist otherwise. ''They don't belittle you,'' said Mr. Snyder, who has trained with Mr. Twight over the years. Carolyn Parker, a climbing guide who lives in Albuquerque, where she goes by the nickname Blitzkrieg Barbie, also emphasized the lack of drill sergeant behavior. ''They're more interested in training the mind than in physical fanaticism,'' she said of the Twights.
Working with Gym Jones involves completing excruciating tasks. They use some basic machines -- rowers, Airdyne stationary bikes -- but mostly rely on free weights, kettle bells and low-tech equipment like weighted sleds. The Jones Crawl involves three rounds of dead-lifting 115 percent of your body weight 10 times and then jumping on and off a box 25 times as fast as you can. ''Recovery'' at the end of a workout might involve a 30-minute run and an ice bath. But not at the gym; it has only one shower, which is for ''emergencies,'' Ms. Twight said.
At the end of the day, working out is just picking stuff up and putting it down. The complicated part, at least at Gym Jones, is the mental workout: constant awareness of what helps or hurts progress, including maintaining proper nutrition and executing recovery accurately. ''Breaking someone in a workout is pointless without post-training discussion and analysis,'' Mr. Twight said.
FITNESS companies inspired by Gym Jones are popping up around the country, mostly opened by people who have apprenticed with Mr. MacDonald and the Twights. Ms. Parker owns Athena Fit in Albuquerque; one in St. Louis is called Project Deliverance.
The Twights say they have no plans to expand beyond Utah, but they have increased the number of seminars they hold, which cost $1,500 to $2,000 a person and range from a two-day Fundamentals course to the five-day Advanced Program Design and Theory. Sessions with a trainer cost from $100 to $300 an hour; clients come either for a few days or on a regular basis.
The Twights now offer Web-based memberships starting at $500 a year; participants log into GymJones.com, which has more than 70 videos and 17 training plans, among other materials.
It was the advanced program that Mr. MacDonald, barefoot and in cargo shorts, was teaching in early August, the one that culminated in tears and sweat. But that was only a small part of the course. The eight participants spent much of their time in front of a white board at the back of the gym.
There, they sat in folding chairs and listened to Mr. MacDonald give a lecture. The class members, some of whom had traveled from as far as London and New York, took notes and followed along with a 135-page study guide.

He put the cap on the marker. ''And always -- always -- be prepared to go to a dark place,'' he said. ''Now, who's ready to work out?''

HEADLINE: Bicycle Visionary

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
SOMETHING lovely and all too rare happened to Janette Sadik-Khan, New York City's frequently demonized transportation commissioner, as she and I rode our bikes down Park Avenue South one morning last month: Sadik-Khan got unsolicited, unfettered praise.
It came from a young cyclist who happened to pull up beside us, glanced over at her and suddenly beamed.
''Oh, it's you!'' he stammered, then mentioned that he owned a bicycle shop and had recently placed a newspaper ad publicly thanking her for her cycling advocacy. ''You're going to leave a legacy, you know.''
He's right. Sadik-Khan and Mayor Bloomberg both. And it's past time that more than just a passer-by trumpeted it. 
Since the mayor appointed her in 2007 and she began to bring her agency's work more closely in line with his vision of a greener New York, the city has roughly doubled its miles of bike lanes, to about 500. If you did any biking at all in Manhattan or Brooklyn this summer, you may well have noticed the improvements, including protected bike lanes (ones that separate cyclists entirely from street traffic) on such major arteries as Columbus and First Avenues in Manhattan.
I know I did, and when I rode through the Upper West Side and the Lower East Side, Williamsburg and Boerum Hill, I felt something I hadn't before, a kind of full permission and robust encouragement, even if motorists continued to behave obtusely.
The city has also plotted a far-reaching and potentially game-changing public bike share program, whose details and timetable are expected to be announced this month. In a swift manner all the more impressive given government sclerosis these days, New York is truly transforming itself.
And for that it has received, from some of its citizens, an unwarranted degree of ill-considered grief. Biking, it seems, is an uphill ride, due largely to mathematics and a sort of Catch-22: with only a small percentage of Americans using bicycles as their primary method of transportation, there's no huge public outcry for -- or immediate political benefit to -- remaking city streets so that they're a little less friendly to cars and a lot more hospitable to bikes.
But without that hospitality, primarily in the form of better bike lanes and more bike racks, biking isn't convenient and attractive enough to win all that many converts and thus a political constituency.
So if a city believes that biking is part of a better future, it must sometimes muscle through a reluctant, rocky present. That's precisely what Bloomberg and Sadik-Khan have done, in a fine example of the way the mayor's frequent imperiousness and imperviousness to criticism can work to the city's long-term advantage. If anything, the two of them should move even faster and more boldly, but that's pure fantasy, given the opposition, bordering on hysteria, they've met so far.
''There are not only 8.4 million New Yorkers but at times 8.4 million traffic engineers,'' Sadik-Khan said in an interview a few weeks after our bike ride. ''And we're, you know, very opinionated.''
I'LL say. Her critics have brutalized her, even making inane schoolyard fun of her surname by calling her Chaka Khan, after the hefty black R&B singer. (Sadik-Khan is white and almost bony, and never belted a tune during any of our meetings.) Before Anthony Weiner's loins sundered his ambitions, he reportedly taunted Bloomberg with the promise that he would succeed him as mayor and promptly erase all the bike lanes. Additionally, a group of Brooklyn citizens with close ties to Iris Weinshall, the former transportation commissioner and wife of Chuck Schumer, filed a lawsuit against the city -- dismissed by a judge last month -- for its installation of a protected bike lane along Prospect Park West. And The New York Post was even more truculent, waging a constant, nasty war against Sadik-Khan, who was excoriated in one typical editorial for ''turning over vast swaths of city streets to delivery boys on bikes and the occasional cool dude pedaling along in his Day-Glo tights.''
Vast swaths? Day-Glo tights? Those of us on two wheels still get only a sliver of the roads, and my biking shorts are baggy and olive green, with an elastic waist.
By many credible accounts Sadik-Khan has brought some of this misery on herself, with a style that can be impatient, intolerant, moralizing. I've gotten to know her a bit, and she has a certainty that borders on righteousness and an intensity in the vicinity of mania. But that's to her credit -- and our benefit. New York needs visionaries who won't simply let things be.
In the end the resistance that she and the city have encountered has to do mostly with parochialism and selfishness. Some New Yorkers seem offended by the notion that we should be more like such biking havens as Copenhagen, Paris, or for that matter, Portland, Ore.: life here is too urgent and blunt and brutal for such crunchy-granola niceties. Besides which, no one wants to give an inch, literally: not the Prospect Park West gripers who lost parking spaces to the bike lane, not the drivers of delivery trucks whose jobs are sometimes complicated by such lanes, not the Manhattan traditionalists who feel that sharing just a few of Central Park's transverse paths with cyclists -- as the city decided in July they must do -- requires too much in the way of vigilance from people ambling among the trees. The complaints were loud and passionate.
And misleading. Several polls have shown that a majority of New Yorkers favor the creation of bike lanes, at least in the abstract. The problem is that it's a relatively soft, quiet support, reflecting the limited use of those lanes. According to Department of Transportation figures, about 15,500 cyclists daily entered Manhattan's central business district between Battery Park and 59th Street in 2009, the most recent year for which statistics are available. That's in contrast to 762,000 cars.
But ridership is definitely growing. A decade earlier, only 4,700 cyclists entered that part of Manhattan. And over the last 20 or so years, the percentage of New Yorkers who use cycling to commute has doubled, to 0.6 percent in 2009 from 0.3 percent in 1990, according to an analysis of census figures by John Pucher, a Rutgers University professor who studies bicycle trends worldwide. That still leaves New York behind Chicago, with 1.2 percent of commuters on bikes; Washington, D.C., with 2.2 percent; San Francisco, with 3 percent; and Portland, with 5.8 percent.
WHAT'S keeping more cyclists in New York from doing so? ''The indifference of the New York City Police Department is the biggest obstacle,'' said Charles Komanoff, a mathematical economist and past president of Transportation Alternatives. He and other cycling advocates said that police officers too seldom ticket drivers who ignore cyclists' rights, particularly by treating biking lanes as temporary parking spots and thus forcing bike riders to swerve into and out of traffic. As prevalent as such lane-obstruction is, I've noticed more news reports on cyclists blowing through red lights, and I've found myself envying, of all places, the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. Its mayor recently deployed a tank to crush a Mercedes-Benz illegally parked in a bike lane.
Without going quite that far, our city's police officers must do more. And the transportation department must expand markedly the number of bike racks citywide -- the official city count is about 12,800 -- so that riders can rest assured that they'll find a safe place to stow their bicycles. Pucher is the co-author of ''City Cycling,'' a forthcoming book, which notes that Paris has about 1,490 bike parking spaces -- slots in racks, for example -- per 100,000 people, London about 1,670 and Tokyo about 6,400. And New York? About 152. ''It's lousy, lousy, lousy,'' Pucher said.
TWO summers ago, a companion and I hunted so fruitlessly for a rack outside a movie theater that we locked our bikes -- illegally -- to a parking sign. The sign's mooring in the concrete must have been loose, because we came out of ''The Hurt Locker'' to find it lying on the sidewalk across the street, where it had apparently been deposited by a thief or thieves who'd pried it from the ground so they could liberate our bikes. This happened in full view of a busy grocery store and within feet of a Mister Softee truck. New York really is brutal.
The bike share program will help enormously, because for every bike, there will be a locked place at the stations where you will be able to pick it up and drop it off. In the transportation department's request for bids from private companies, it outlined a network of about 600 stations with at least 10,000 bikes, to be at least partly operational next year. Usage fees might be just a few dollars for short rides, making bikes a sensible alternative to, say, subways, which have suffered from service cutbacks and increased crowding.
The Chicago transportation commissioner, Gabe Klein, noted that biking pushed back against a range of modern ills. ''There's the congestion problem,'' he said. ''The pollution problem. The obesity problem. The gas problem.''
On top of all that, it makes an important statement about our priorities -- about our willingness to amend the reckless, impatient, gluttonous ways that have created not only smog and clog in our cities but also a staggering federal debt.
''Bikes are definitely a symbol of what your city stands for,'' said Klein.

HEADLINE: How to Really Save the Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. BARRO

 BODY:
Robert Barro is a professor of economics at Harvard University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Cambridge, Mass.
THE United States is in the third year of a grand experiment by the Obama administration to revive the economy through enormous borrowing and spending by the government, with the Federal Reserve playing a supporting role by keeping interest rates at record lows.
How is the experiment going? By the looks of it, not well.
The economy is growing much more slowly than in a typical recovery, housing prices remain depressed and the stock market has been in a slump -- all troubling indicators that another recession may be on the way. Most worrisome is the anemic state of the labor market, underscored by the zero growth in the latest jobs report. 
The poor results should not surprise us given the macroeconomic policies the government has pursued. I agree that the recession warranted fiscal deficits in 2008-10, but the vast increase of public debt since 2007 and the uncertainty about the country's long-run fiscal path mean that we no longer have the luxury of combating the weak economy with more deficits.
Today's priority has to be austerity, not stimulus, and it will not work to announce a new $450 billion jobs plan while promising vaguely to pay for it with fiscal restraint over the next 10 years, as Mr. Obama did in his address to Congress on Thursday. Given the low level of government credibility, fiscal discipline has to start now to be taken seriously. But we have to do even more: I propose a consumption tax, an idea that offends many conservatives, and elimination of the corporate income tax, a proposal that outrages many liberals.
These difficult steps would be far more effective than the president's failed experiment. The administration's $800 billion stimulus program raised government demand for goods and services and was also intended to stimulate consumer demand. These interventions are usually described as Keynesian, but as John Maynard Keynes understood in his 1936 masterwork, ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'' (the first economics book I read), the main driver of business cycles is investment. As is typical, the main decline in G.D.P. during the recession showed up in the form of reduced investment by businesses and households.
What drives investment? Stable expectations of a sound economic environment, including the long-run path of tax rates, regulations and so on. And employment is akin to investment in that hiring decisions take into account the long-run economic climate.
The lesson is that effective incentives for investment and employment require permanence and transparency. Measures that are transient or uncertain will be ineffective.
And yet these are precisely the kinds of policies the Obama administration has pursued: temporarily cutting the payroll tax rate, maintaining the marginal income-tax rates from the George W. Bush era while vowing to raise them in the future, holding off on clean-air regulations while promising to implement them later and enacting an ambitious overhaul of Wall Street regulations while leaving lots of rules undefined and ambiguous.
Is there a better way? I believe that a long-term fiscal plan for the country requires six big steps.
Three of them were identified by the Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction commission: reforming Social Security and Medicare by increasing ages of eligibility and shifting to an appropriate formula for indexing benefits to inflation; phasing out ''tax expenditures'' like the deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and employer-provided health care; and lowering the marginal income-tax rates for individuals.
I would add three more: reversing the vast and unwise increase in spending that occurred under Presidents Bush and Obama; introducing a tax on consumer spending, like the value-added tax (or VAT) common in other rich countries; and abolishing federal corporate taxes and estate taxes. All three measures would be enormously difficult -- many say impossible -- but crises are opportune times for these important, basic reforms.
A broad-based expenditure tax, like a VAT, amounts to a tax on consumption. If the base rate were 10 percent, the revenue would be roughly 5 percent of G.D.P. One benefit from a VAT is that it is more efficient than an income tax -- and in particular the current American income tax system.
I received vigorous criticism from conservatives after advocating a VAT in an essay in The Wall Street Journal last month. The main objection -- reminiscent of the complaints about income-tax withholding, which was introduced in the United States in 1943 -- is that a VAT would be a money machine, allowing the government to readily grow larger. For example, the availability of easy VAT revenue in Western Europe, where rates reach as high as 25 percent, has supported the vast increase in the welfare state there since World War II. I share these concerns and, therefore, favor a VAT only if it is part of a package that includes other sensible reforms. But given the likely path of government spending on health care and Social Security, I see no reasonable alternative.
Abolishing the corporate income tax is similarly controversial. Any tax on capital income distorts decisions on saving and investment. Moreover, the inefficiency is magnified here because of double taxation: the income is taxed when corporations make profits and again when owners receive dividends or capital gains. If we want to tax capital income, a preferred method treats corporate profits as accruing to owners when profits arise and then taxes this income only once -- whether it is paid out as dividends or retained by companies.
Liberals love the idea of a levy on evil corporations, but taxes on corporate profits in fact make up only a small part of federal revenue, compared to the two main sources: the individual income tax and payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare.
In 2009-10, taxes on corporate profits averaged 1.4 percent of G.D.P. and 8.6 percent of total federal receipts. Even from 2000 to 2008, when corporations were more profitable, these taxes averaged only 1.9 percent of G.D.P. and 10.3 percent of federal receipts. If we could get past the political fallout, we could get more revenue and improve economic efficiency by abolishing the corporate income tax and relying instead on a VAT.
I had a dream that Mr. Obama and Congress enacted this fiscal reform package -- triggering a surge in the stock market and a boom in investment and G.D.P. -- and that he was re-elected.
This dream could become reality if our leader were Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton -- the two presidential heroes of the American economy since World War II -- but Mr. Obama is another story. To become market-friendly, he would have to abandon most of his core economic and political principles.
More likely, his administration will continue with more of the same: an expansion of payroll-tax cuts, short-term tax credits, promises to raise future taxes on the rich, and added spending on infrastructure, job training and unemployment benefits. The economy will probably continue in its sluggish state, possibly slipping into another recession. In that case, our best hope is for a Republican president far more committed to the principles of free markets and limited government than Mr. Bush ever was.

HEADLINE: Returning Greece to the Drachma

BYLINE: By MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
The standard of living reached in Greece since it joined the European Union means austerity will be inadequate to rebalance the economy. Returning Greece's currency to the drachma, on the other hand, would allow market forces to set the country's wage levels, induce other indebted European Union members to reform without Continental prodding and thus solidify the euro.
Greece's gross domestic product per capita of $30,400 in 2008 was close to the European Union average. It was caused not by an exceptional surge in productivity, but mostly by huge subsidies and extensive borrowing. Greece's continuing current account deficit, estimated by The Economist at 8.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 despite a severe recession, indicates that it remains deeply uncompetitive. 
By comparison, 2008 G.D.P. per capita in Bulgaria was reported as $14,000 and in Macedonia, $10,700. Yet it has been 20 years since Communism fell and market forces are dominant in both economies. Even Portugal's G.D.P. per capita falls short of Greece's.
This suggests Greece may require living standards to decline by as much as 40 percent to become competitive. Such an adjustment is impossible through austerity alone. Civic unrest shows further belt-tightening could produce political reactions deeply damaging to Greece's future. Assuming further subsidies from European Union taxpayers are politically unlikely, a Greek replacement of the euro by a new drachma seems to be the only alternative.
This would be problematic, but not impossible. The two most relevant precedents are Argentina, which in 2001-2 abandoned a one-to-one link between the peso and dollar, and the new states created from the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, which introduced new currencies.
In Argentina, the government first imposed a limitation of around $250 a week on cash withdrawals from banks. Peso convertibility was abandoned in January 2002 and an official exchange rate of 1.4 pesos per dollar was created, at which all dollar bank accounts were required to convert. Since the free-market rate settled around 4 pesos per dollar, most capital losses were borne by savers, not banks.
Logistically, security printing of drachma banknotes would not initially be necessary. When Slovenia introduced the tolar in October 1991 as Yugoslavia was breaking up, it operated for more than a year with a paper currency without security printing. In Greece, cash transactions could alternatively be made in euros, available from the banks at a free-market rate once bank accounts were converted into drachmas.
The exchange would require some unpleasant temporary restrictions. As well as restricting cash withdrawals from banks, short-term exchange controls would be needed and the Schengen rights of free movement between Greece and other European Union countries might need to be suspended temporarily. With these restrictions, conversion could require a bank holiday no longer than the eight-day period the United States imposed in 1933.
Economically, the drachma's value would fall sharply. The price of a Mercedes would jump in Athens, but those of haircuts and moussaka would not immediately rise. The equilibrium drachma rate would make Greek workers internationally competitive, producing a decline in living standards between the 18 percent needed to match Portugal's and the 50 percent to reach Bulgarian levels.
Greece also could quickly achieve a trade surplus. Inexpensive tourist offerings would help push unemployment down rapidly from its current rate of more than 16 percent. A debt restructuring similar to Argentina's could then be undertaken, reducing the debt's present value by around the same percentage as the Greek reduction in living standards.
This process would be painful, although the increased economic vibrancy and decline in joblessness for many Greeks might make it preferable to several years of externally imposed austerity and political chaos. For the European Union and the euro, it would be highly beneficial, eliminating most of the moral hazard inherent in the euro zone's current fiscal and monetary arrangements.
The decline in Greek living standards imposed by such a switch back to the drachma might well encourage the euro zone's other weak economies to impose the austerity measures and reforms needed to make themselves competitive. The euro also would probably emerge stronger because Maastricht-type fiscal and economic discipline would appear to be the necessity of a cruel market, and not something bargained at a European summit meeting and chiseled by fudging figures.
Finally, such an outcome would make central control by the European Union of the Greek state's finances unnecessary. Good behavior would result from self-discipline alone. MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
FRISCO, Colo. -- The Sunday after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, several dozen friends climbed a mountain to make a declaration, and to do something to work off their awful, anxious energy.
It was partly a statement of brawn and youth: they carried a 10-by-16-foot American flag, along with 20 feet of steel pipe for a pole, up 10 miles of trail to a nearly 13,000-foot summit. There, they gathered thousands of pounds of rocks to anchor the flag against the ferocious winds that can scour the peaks here. And then it was done.
''It was like we were able to carry up the burden that was in our hearts,'' said T. J. Johnson, 42, a firefighter in nearby Breckenridge who was on the original trek.
On Sunday morning, many of the same group of friends, including Mr. Johnson -- older and definitely in a different spirit -- gathered at the trailhead to Peak 1 of the Ten Mile Range and headed up once more. 
They again carried a flag, but there would be no attempt this time to mount a grand declaration, visible for miles, about America and its determination, grit and resilience. Arriving at the summit after hiking for three hours, they unfurled a smaller, wind-tattered flag, held it aloft with trekking poles through a moment of silence and filed back down. Mr. Johnson played ''Amazing Grace'' on his harmonica.
''Whether we have a big pole and flag is irrelevant,'' said Dave Simmons, 40, a master brewer at a local beer hall who was on the first hike and came back on Sunday.
The saga of the flag bearers of Frisco -- their original plan scrawled on a cocktail napkin on the night of the attacks in 2001, to hike, raise money for the Red Cross, plant a flag -- created its own web of healing, loss and anger in this ski town 90 minutes west of Denver.
In 2003, after the group had climbed twice more to replace the flag for the season, it was found burned, the pole bent and trashed, with a note attached condemning the United States invasion of Iraq that year.
A criminal investigation went nowhere.
''I know all the usual suspects -- I talked to them, and they swore they didn't do it,'' said Gary Lindstrom, a former police officer, who was a Summit County commissioner at the time. Mr. Lindstrom said in an interview last week that he has puzzled over the flag attack, and the local political passions it stirred, ever since.
Things changed after the flag burning. The United States Forest Service, which had tolerated the presence of a technically illegal monument on public land, pulled back its support and threatened new flag-raisers with arrest.
Kurt Kizer, a landscaper and self-described ski bum who also was on the first hike -- it was his scrawl on the napkin that sketched out the plan -- was also back again on Sunday. He said the time for anger and retribution was over.
''They know what they did, and they have to live with it,'' he said.
Now a new generation has been drawn in. Chris Aden, 13, learned about the climb from his mother, Pat Aden, who heard about it at a happy hour last week.
''He insisted we come,'' Ms. Aden said. So a mother and a son who was only 3 years old when the towers fell, hiked together. Chris even brought his own small flag to wave from the top. KIRK JOHNSON
Sky-High Connections
UNION CITY, Calif. -- After more than two decades as a flight attendant, David Potvin knows all too well the fast but often fragile friendships that form among members of his perpetually transient profession.
''There's 2,000 people based in San Francisco alone,'' said Mr. Potvin, who had arrived at the city's airport earlier on Sunday. ''Sometimes you don't see each other for a year.''
Still, the bonds that form in the air can often be stronger than those on the ground, a connection in evidence on Sunday when about a dozen flight attendants gathered here at a small, handsome memorial dedicated to United Airlines Flight 93, which took off from Newark for San Francisco but crashed outside Shanksville, Pa., after being hijacked.
Some of those who came knew the crew. ''He was a funny guy,'' Mary Koch said of one of the pilots, Capt. Jason M. Dahl, ''always talking about his odd jobs at home.'' Others simply hoped to find comfort in their colleagues' company.
''Anybody who has flown has a connection,'' said Lesley Minkey, 51, who has been with United for 27 years. ''We're still wearing the same uniform they were today. And any of us could have been sitting in that seat that day.''
Ms. Minkey had come to Union City -- an East Bay commuter town of about 48,000 people, about 20 miles northeast of San Jose -- with her colleague Shaunna Bohan to ''be somewhere where other people we're feeling it as well,'' she said. Others had come alone, like Elton Martin, who works for American Airlines, and carried a bouquet of white roses. ''I'm here to honor their honor,'' Mr. Martin said.
He knew no one there, nor had he ever heard of the Union City memorial, a soft S-curve of rose-colored monoliths which was built in 2007 by a local military veteran, Michael Emerson, who wanted to honor the Bay Area's connection to Flight 93. But as Mr. Martin became acquainted with the memorial he also came to know the other attendants who had found themselves drawn there on Sunday.
Most wore wings pinned on their chests, some studded with diamonds -- one for each decade in the air -- and gravitated toward a section of the stones where the crew members' names were engraved. Some recalled the day of the attacks, while others chatted about recent trips: the hotels and layovers and various joys and aggravations of their daily, gravity-defying grind. Ms. Koch -- who had worked on Flight 93 several weeks before 9/11 -- said she not only knew the crew members, but what they probably were doing, and feeling, as the attacks unfolded.
''The thought that goes through my head is sitting on that jump seat, and just knowing. ...'' Her voice trailed off. ''I'm just so proud.''
Overhead, jets roared on final approach to Oakland's airport, just north of here. Leslie Duenas, a retired United flight attendant, comforted Ms. Koch. And though many of the attendants did not know each other well, they felt a kinship with one another, Ms. Duenas said, and with those who had died working in their strange trade, often finding a kind of family at 35,000 feet.
''Some of these people you'll see again,'' Ms. Duenas said. ''And some of them you won't.'' JESSE McKINLEY
A Daughter Remembers
DALLAS -- Christina Rancke's favorite picture of her father is the one of him relaxing at home, sitting on the couch one weekend morning with his feet up on the coffee table, reading a newspaper. He has a coffee mug on his right and his daughter on his left. She was just a toddler then, but already she wanted to be just like him: She holds a newspaper in her hands, too, and together on the couch they look like two grown-ups on a train, flipping through the day's papers.
On Sunday morning, as she sat inside Highland Park United Methodist Church, surrounded by so many fathers and their daughters, Ms. Rancke thought of these moments from her childhood. She was 11 years old on September 11, 2001, the oldest of three children -- her sister, Brittany, was 9 at the time and her brother, Todd Jr., was 7.
Her father, Alfred Todd Rancke, 42, died that morning in the World Trade Center. He was a managing director at Sandler O'Neill, an investment banking and brokerage firm, and he and his wife, Deborah, were raising their three children in Summit, N.J. His office was on the 104th floor of the south tower. Ms. Rancke knew it well: Take Your Daughter to Work Day had become their annual ritual.
''There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about him,'' she said.
In Dallas on Sunday, the distance of years and miles seemed inconsequential.
The church was packed because of the anniversary of the attacks, and Ms. Rancke and her cousin had to sit in an overflow section outside the sanctuary. In his sermon, the pastor spoke of the victims and of the continuing threat of evil, and he said that dogs had to sniff the building to make sure it was safe. At one moment, her cousin, Paige McInerney, who was Mr. Rancke's niece, grabbed her hand and held on tight -- Mrs. McInerney used to work at the World Trade Center, too, and was in the building during the attacks.
Ms. Rancke lives in a sorority house near the church. She is a 21-year-old junior at Southern Methodist University, with a double major in corporate communications and advertising. ''That's my goal, to honor him and to make him proud,'' she said.
A short walk from the church, rows of tiny American flags had been neatly arranged in the sections of grass outside a university museum. There were nearly 3,000 of them -- one for every victim of the attacks. Ms. Rancke helped plant them. MANNY FERNANDEZ
Downsized Dreams
PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. -- Like so much else in Florida these days, the ambitious and touching 9/11 memorial unveiled in this small town on a broiling Sunday was jolted hard by the recession.
It began small, with a request in 2004 for a chunk of steel from the remnants of the World Trade Center's twin towers and the idea of a small but fitting tribute. It grew large, with 11 tons of marble for one sculpture and sheets of steel for four others. Then it got even bigger, with requests for a $1 million glass building to house the sculptures.
But reality -- as well as the few choice words of a Pembroke Pines commissioner and the reluctance of taxpayers, who balked at the cost -- took hold. In the end, the memorial is a testament to tragedy, courage and perseverance. But also to compromise and common sense: the steel and marble sculptures stand outside under a gazebo at a cost of $167,000, which it is hoped will be repaid through donations.
''This was designed to be delivered to the residents of Pembroke Pines at no cost to them,'' said Angelo Castillo, a city commissioner here and a New York City transplant who asked Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for the piece of steel. ''And my original concept was much more modest.''
''Sometimes it was difficult, but what we have here, at the end of the day, is something spectacular,'' Mr. Castillo said.
The people in the crowd that pushed into the gazebo after the bagpipes grew quiet and the speeches ended could not have agreed more. To them, the cost and controversy are irrelevant.
''It's a moot point,'' said Elizabeth Ennis, 44, a physician's assistant. ''It's a statement from the community that we stand together.''
Four towering steel sculptures ring the gazebo. One depicts a larger-than-life New York City firefighter, his jacket flapping in the wind. He is straddled by jagged towers of steel, representing the trade center's north and south towers. A child stares resolutely from the top of a pile of steel.
The city could not afford bronze, so Felix Gonzalez, the sculptor and a retired Miami-Dade County firefighter, welded the steel. The materials were donated or were paid for with discretionary county funds. The artists, who spent years on the project, donated their time (Mr. Gonzalez receive a $20,000 stipend).
''People came out to watch me make these at an abandoned firehouse on the edge of the Everglades,'' he said. ''Firefighters from New York City stood there and cried and hugged me. It kept me going.''
In the center of the gazebo lies the four-sided marble sculpture, which represents shock, grief, acceptance and rebuilding. Faceless forms cower, pray, protect each other and then rise toward the sky. At the top, rests the chunk of steel from the twin towers.
''These people who died were bigger than life,'' said Benoit Menasche, the 74-year-old sculptor. ''How can I not give them something bigger than life.'' LIZETTE ALVAREZ
Search for Renewal
NATCHEZ, Miss. -- ''This date is a sign.''
So began the Rev. Jon Shonebarger, and so began the Faith Independent Baptist Church, which as of Sunday morning consisted of a Facebook page, a stack of Bibles and brochures and a dozen people in a meeting room at a Hampton Inn.
There was nothing of the solemn grandeur of ground zero in New York, nothing remotely evocative of the sepulchral concrete hollows, the towers that surround them and the sense of world-altering catastrophe that lingers over them. There was coffee and muffins and hotel carpeting, and mostly empty rows of chairs.
Pastor Shonebarger has no particular connection to the tragedy. He was at a church in Oakley, Kan., at the time of the terrorist attacks, moved to Colorado for a few years afterward and since January 2010 has been the chaplain at a correctional facility outside of town here, ministering to ''2,600 inmates from 71 nations of the world,'' he says with a little pride.
''I deal with people from third world nations,'' he said. And then, leading into his reasons for starting this church, he added, ''I'm seeing America turn into something it doesn't want to be.''
''I believe that there was something that happened in this country, a coming together,'' he said of those first few days after the attacks. ''There was, if I can say this, an awakening.''
Pastor Shonebarger was speaking not only, or even primarily, of the political and patriotic unity of that time. Churches were full, he said. Prayer groups were crowded.
But something went wrong. He spoke of poverty and unemployment, of natural disasters, and of spiritual drift. ''Ten years later, America is in bad shape,'' he said. ''Why did I choose this date? I chose this date for a reason.''
His prologue finished, Pastor Shonebarger announced the day's Scripture reading. The congregation turned to Philippians, and they set off on the reawakening. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON
Trying to Find the Words
FAYETTEVILLE, Tenn. -- The Lincoln County Fair will still have a miniature horse race, a demolition derby and enough cotton candy to give visitors a sugar high for days.
But on Sunday, the normally lighthearted weeklong festival -- one of the largest and oldest in the South -- took a somber and nostalgic turn, if only momentarily.
With the carnival rides twirling and kids screaming in the background, the crowd at the giant grandstand removed their cowboy hats, put down their ice cream cones and saluted as two young girls on horseback trotted past carrying American and Tennessee flags.
''I guess today is a good day to tell her about the attacks,'' said Jade Butcher, who was pregnant a decade ago with her daughter Taylor, one of the riders, and who has still not quite found the words to explain the day's significance.
The twin towers and the Pentagon were hit while the 2001 fair was in session. The local news media, which expected to cover the carnival rides and races, instead scrambled to report news of the falling buildings. Radio coverage of the attacks was broadcast over the fairground speakers, provided by a Grand Ole Opry announcer.
The organizers then decided to keep the fair open, said Jerry Mansfield, who was the county mayor. This year, he read a handwritten memorial statement while an acoustic version of the national anthem played.
''John Wayne once described courage as 'being scared to death but saddling up anyway,' '' he said. ''Ten years ago, courage was further defined.''
A Boy Scout troop saluted, the crowd cheered, a Baptist preacher offered a prayer, and country music was piped through the speakers.
''And now,'' Mr. Mansfield announced, ''the horse races!'' ROBBIE BROWN
A Focus on Family
MARSHFIELD, Mo. -- Balloons and banners hung from the rafters above a picnic table filled with gift-wrapped and chocolate-frosted temptations. The happy chatter of four generations broke the stillness of a typically quiet Sunday here in this small Ozark Mountains town.
It was a party, of course. Little Tristan Melton had turned 4 the day before. And his great-grandfather Greg Jackson would turn 55 the day after. So the family split the difference to celebrate. And, yes, they understood the significance of the date.
''It's hard to get everyone together,'' said Steve Holton, 43, who organized the party. ''Today kind of worked out for everybody.''
This was how Sept. 11, 2011, was lived in this agricultural community of about 6,600 people, where the reminders of tragedy infused a day otherwise notable for its normalcy.
Pastor Jack Dinwiddie asked for a moment of silence and prayer at morning services at Free Will Baptist Church. Daniel and Britteny Henslee labored on their porch to clean out an old refrigerator before driving it to their grandmother's house. And while his wife watched television coverage of the 9/11 anniversary, Derrick Young took advantage of the sunny skies and worked on his old pickup truck.
At the family reunion at the Marshfield Rotary Playground, Mr. Jackson, who remembered watching the attacks unfold on television, grilled hamburgers and bratwurst while Tristan, too young to understand the emotions imbued in the day, frolicked on his new red scooter. The rest of the family, about a dozen people, talked about the weather and jobs and one another. When asked, they said all the right things about using the day to look back and look forward. But, honestly, they would add, it was mostly about being here.
''We're just celebrating everyday things,'' said Jenny Jackson, 61, the family matriarch. ''We know what the day means. But we're focusing on the birthdays. We're trying to enjoy life.''
Moments later, Tristan abandoned the balloon he had been harassing. His new target was a cake, wrapped in a plastic bag. After his official pleas to look inside were rebuffed he decided to brave the consequences, ripping a hole to peek inside. And seeing the generous dose of sugar that the afternoon promised, he wrapped his arms around the cake in a beaming embrace. A. G. SULZBERGER

HEADLINE: Reports See Fiscal Woes Undermining Palestinians

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- With the Palestinian Authority seeking United Nations membership and statehood recognition this month, two new reports say Palestinian public institutions are gaining traction, but there is trouble on the economic front -- growth has slowed amid a fiscal crisis.
In a report to be delivered next week, the World Bank says that while Prime Minister Salam Fayyad has made substantial progress in building strong state institutions, ''the onset of an acute fiscal crisis, accompanied by declining economic growth,'' may undermine those achievements. 
The International Monetary Fund will report next week that economic growth in the West Bank, which had been positive for the past three years, slowed from 8 percent in 2010 to 4 percent in the first half of 2011.
Oussama Kanaan, who led a recent mission to the Palestinian areas for the I.M.F., said in an interview that unless foreign donors, especially Arab countries, met their commitments to the Palestinian Authority, and unless Israel further eased restrictions on Palestinian movement, the economic slowdown would continue.
But Mr. Kanaan, the I.M.F.'s mission chief for the West Bank and Gaza, said that the growing institutional maturity of the Palestinian Authority made it better able to handle its fiscal crisis.
''As we stated last April,'' he continued, ''we believe that given the Palestinian Authority's solid track record, it is able to conduct the sound economic policies expected of a future well-functioning Palestinian state.''
The World Bank study said that in areas where government effectiveness matters most -- security, justice, economic development and service delivery -- ''Palestinian public institutions compare favorably to other countries in the region and beyond.''
But, it added, as it has in earlier reports, that growth driven primarily by donor aid rather than a significant private sector creates momentum that is unsustainable. The private sector is ''stifled by Israeli restrictions on access to natural resources and markets,'' it said.
When less aid than expected flowed into the Palestinian Authority in the first half of this year, there was an immediate impact. In July, the Palestinian Authority could not pay full salaries to its employees, and while it did so in August, it fell further behind in its other transfers. Prime Minister Fayyad has expressed keen concern over meeting his budget obligations in the coming months.
The donors who have withheld promised aid are especially from the Arab world. Last year Arab states gave the Palestinian Authority $280 million, compared with about $110 million so far this year.
There is also growing concern that American aid to the Palestinian Authority, some $450 million a year, could end after the Palestinians go to the United Nations. Congressional Republicans have threatened to end the aid if the Palestinians choose the United Nations path over direct negotiations with Israel.
Both the World Bank report and one coming from the International Monetary Fund offer data on the West Bank, run by the Palestinian Authority, and Gaza, run by Hamas. Taken together, growth in the first half of 2011 was 7 percent.
The Gaza economy has improved markedly because it had been at an anemic level during the Israeli siege of the past few years. Growth in Gaza in the first half of 2011, the World Bank reports, was an exceptionally high 28 percent. Much of that came from the suddenly robust construction sector, which had been inactive for several years. Gross domestic product is still below what it was in 2005, before the Hamas takeover and Israeli siege.
Mr. Kanaan said that sustaining Gaza's recovery would require lifting the ban on exports to Israel and trade with the West Bank, imposed by Israel.
After Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, Israel imposed a siege to try to pressure Hamas, a militant group opposed to Israel's existence. Israel banned nearly all movement in and out of people and goods except those of a humanitarian nature.
Israel substantially eased the blockade last year after a storm of international criticism over the killing by Israeli commandos of nine activists who were trying to break the siege. Now nearly all consumer goods are allowed in and small amounts of exports are permitted.
In the West Bank, Israel imposed scores of checkpoints during the Palestinian uprising that began in late 2000, heavily restricting movement of goods and people. Those too have been eased significantly, but Israeli security considerations still severely hamper economic activity and foreign investment.
Unemployment in Gaza, high by any standards, has fallen to 25.6 percent from 39.3 percent, the World Bank found. It noted, however, that Gaza had very low labor force participation, meaning that many do not even look for work and are not counted in the data.
Unemployment in the West Bank stood unchanged at 15 percent in the first half of this year.
The International Monetary Fund projects that if Israeli restrictions in the West Bank and Gaza remain in place, real growth for both territories would hover at around 4 percent and unemployment at roughly 20 percent. It called on Israel to lift those restrictions.

HEADLINE: Louisiana Business Owners Sue Over New Wage Rules for Guest Workers

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
EUNICE, La. -- The workers have been in fine spirits this summer in the small plant where Dexter Guillory cuts up alligator meat to feed the growing demand from Southern restaurants for the swamp creatures' steaks.
Mr. Guillory runs his family business in this Cajun country town with a mix of local employees and guest workers from Mexico, who come up each year on legal visas through a federal program known as H-2B. All the workers are paid by the pound of meat they carve in the well-chilled plant, and this year there have been plenty of alligators, so earnings have been good.
''I love this work because I cut more alligator, I make more money, that's why,'' said Lorena Aguilar, 38, who has been coming from Sinaloa, Mexico, with half a dozen of her relatives, to work for Mr. Guillory for part of the year for nearly a decade.
But small-business owners in south Louisiana, like Mr. Guillory, who cut alligators, peel crawfish, shuck oysters, shell crabs and process shrimp say they are about to receive a shock from new Labor Department regulations that make broad changes to the H-2B program. The employers say the rules, including some issued in January and some still under consideration, could put many of them out of business. 
On Wednesday, several Louisiana food associations brought a federal lawsuit against the Labor Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which jointly administer the H-2B program, saying a new mandatory method for setting wages for foreign workers would cause ''catastrophic results.'' Starting Sept. 30, they would have to pay guest workers at crawfish and shrimp processors wage increases that range from 51 percent to 83 percent of current hourly rates, according to the suit.
The employers said these sudden increases would be crippling and would expose them to unwinnable competition from foreign imports and from other businesses that hire illegal immigrants. The suit was joined by other Louisiana businesses that use the guest-worker program, including forestry companies, hotel and amusement park owners and sugar growers.
The dispute is a microcosm of the nation's larger debate over job creation, which President Obama has made his priority. Louisiana employers say their businesses, which give work to thousands of Americans as well as foreign migrants, are being hamstrung by proliferating federal regulations. Administration officials argue that stronger rules are needed to protect Americans' jobs and wages in a time of high unemployment.
The Louisiana lawsuit puts the Labor Department back in the middle of a running feud between employers and labor advocates over one of the few programs that bring Mexican and other foreign low-wage workers legally to the United States.
Under the H-2B program, employers can bring in up to 66,000 nonagricultural foreign workers each year for temporary stints, after they have shown that American workers are not available and that Americans' wages will not be adversely affected.
After years of complaints from employers that the program was inefficient and cumbersome, the administration of President George W. Bush sought to streamline the application process, putting new regulations into effect in January 2009. Farmworker organizations sued the Labor Department to reverse them.
In August 2010, a federal court in Pennsylvania hearing one of those lawsuits ordered department officials to issue new rules on how employers should determine wages for H-2B workers. The new wage rules were issued in January, but department officials, acting under court order, announced only last month that they would go into effect Sept. 30.
In a parallel effort, the Obama administration's labor secretary, Hilda L. Solis, has undertaken a wider critical review of the Bush administration rules. In March, the department published a 77-page proposal.
The Labor Department has not yet issued the final broader rule.
Jane Oates, an assistant secretary of labor, said the department's proposals were intended to improve recruitment of American workers for jobs, while reinforcing protections for foreign migrants. ''More of these jobs could be filled by U.S. workers if they were aware of the opportunity and paid prevailing wages,'' Ms. Oates said.
All the proposed changes have drawn alarmed criticism from employers but were generally praised by labor organizations. The National Guestworker Alliance, a group based in New Orleans, said, ''Too often employers shopping for the most exploitable work force manipulate the program,'' leading to ''involuntary servitude'' of foreign workers.
Here in Eunice, home of the Cajun Music Hall of Fame, Mr. Guillory said he was baffled by the department's efforts to fix an immigration program he never knew was broken. Persistent high unemployment in other parts of the country has not made it easier for him to find local Americans to take his jobs, which ebb and flow with the seasons.
Mr. Guillory needs labor because demand for alligator meat for restaurant tables has been bolstered by a program on the History Channel, called ''Swamp People,'' whose heroes catch alligators in Louisiana bayous. Mr. Guillory actually gets his alligators less arduously, from nearby farms. He also peels crawfish, another seasonal crop.
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 had a lasting effect on the labor force in this region, he and other employers said, with many thousands of people leaving New Orleans for good. Once reconstruction started, workers headed to the city for well-paying jobs. The generous wages of the Louisiana oil industry also draw local workers away from Eunice.
Many here cannot afford to lose year-round government benefits if they take seasonal, piece-rate jobs with Mr. Guillory, he and several of his full-time American employees said.
But Mexican workers in the plant said they liked the work and the boss and were content with the rhythm of working for six months or so and then returning to Mexico.
''Mr. Dexter gets them through the immigration, and they're good workers,'' said Elizabeth Guillory, 72, a Eunice resident (no relation to her employer) who is the floor supervisor in the plant. ''I've been poor all my life, and I know what it is to have work.'' Between Mexicans and Americans in the plant, she said, ''We have good relationships.''
Ms. Aguilar said she and her family were grateful to be working legally in the United States. ''It feels good because not everybody has this chance,'' she said.
Mr. Guillory says he cannot understand why the Labor Department does not recognize his record as a fair employer. If he cannot hire guest workers, he said, the chain of lost jobs and income for local people would run back to the alligator and crawfish farmers whose crops he would not process and forward to the restaurants that serve his products.
That sequence is what Louisiana employers said they hope to avert with the lawsuit.
''This is a showstopper,'' said Frank Randol, who runs a crawfish business and a Cajun restaurant in Lafayette and represents the Crawfish Processors Alliance, one group in the suit. ''In 40 years I've been in this business, we've faced just about everything,'' he said, ''but now we are facing our own government trying to shut us down.''

HEADLINE: Closing a Nursing Home, and a Chapter of New York History

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Her 98-year-old father lies under white sheets, frail and incoherent, attached to a feeding tube and a catheter. But Rose Lauria visits him nearly every day, taking a 10-minute bus ride to the historic block where the Bialystoker Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation has towered over the Lower East Side's tenements for 80 years, then greeting her father with a ''Hey, cutie pie!''
''Every day is precious,'' she said. ''I love him and I want to see he's cared for properly.'' 
But she is worried about the future quality of that care because in recent months, she has watched the three other beds in his room lose their occupants, and her father, Thomas Lauria, may soon be required to surrender his bed.
The Bialystoker home, plagued by deep debt and what it regards as inadequate Medicaid reimbursements, is closing. It was opened in 1929 as a nursing home and communal center by Jewish immigrants from Bialystok -- the Polish city that lent its name to the bialy and the conniving impresario of Mel Brooks's ''The Producers.''
In authorizing the closing, the state's Department of Health has ordered the home, which is scheduled to shut in late October, to find new beds for all 95 residents. Meanwhile, its 10-story building at 228 East Broadway is on the market for an asking price of more than $10 million.
Ms. Lauria is upset, and not only because she will have a far longer commute from her East Village home to visit her father at his probable next stop, a nursing home in Brooklyn that has space for him. Her bigger worry is that her father, who has been at Bialystoker for 12 years and suffers from dementia and an ulcerated esophagus, will not acclimate himself to unfamiliar rooms and faces.
''These people live here,'' Ms. Lauria said. ''They get used to the workers, the atmosphere. It becomes like their family. There's no place like home, but this place is pretty good.''
Many people in the neighborhood are upset as well, because Bialystoker is one of the last major Jewish institutions still standing there. The 10-story building on the other side of East Broadway that long housed The Forward, a Yiddish newspaper, is now a condominium apartment building. Some neighborhood residents are seeking landmark status for the tan brick, Art Deco Bialystoker building, an application that the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission has begun evaluating.
The home also houses a synagogue on its second floor, where daily services are held, and it, too, will close, another loss in a revitalized neighborhood that once had 500 synagogues but is now down to about a dozen. The other day inside the synagogue, a solitary, white-bearded Hasid, Yesocher Wieder, 60, swayed over a page of the rabbinical commentary called Gemara, then rose and blew a shofar, a ram's horn.
The home's board has been accused by some critics of mismanagement, for accumulating a debt of over $8.5 million and losses of $100,000 monthly.
William Quintana, the Bialystoker home's director of recreation, accused the board and its chairman, Ira M. Meister, of conduct that was ''unethical and a conflict of interest'' for the sale last year of an adjoining two-story medical building to the chairman.
Mr. Meister said in an interview that the board had no choice because it needed the roughly $1.5 million netted from the sale to pay the nursing home's mounting bills, and a sale to his real estate firm -- he is president of a firm, Matthew Adam Properties, that manages 100 co-op and condo buildings -- made for a speedy transfer. He has leased that adjoining building to the Educational Alliance, a venerable cross between a Y.M.C.A. and a social services institution that taught generations of immigrants how to become good Americans. But Mr. Meister plans within two years to move his management business, now on East 59th Street, to the East Broadway building.
Mr. Meister, 54, who grew up on the Lower East Side, said he was hurt by accusations of self-dealing and conflicts of interest, particularly because he has already put $650,000 of his family's money into rescuing the home, money he said he may never recoup. Whatever financial moves he has made, he said, were intended to sustain a nursing home that was a last happy refuge for his ailing parents. His mother died in 2005, and his father in January.
''No board member has ever made a dime from this home,'' Mr. Meister said, his voice cracking with emotion. ''They've made me out to be a villain. I'm not a villain.''
He and the five other members of the board have concluded that the home is no longer viable because of its dependence on Medicaid reimbursements -- 58 percent of its revenue in 2009 came from Medicaid and 29 percent from Medicare. But the home's Medicaid rates are comparatively low because its facilities are outdated, and its small area per floor requires more costly staffing under state laws. While the home once subsisted on donations from families that traced their roots to Bialystok, those have withered away, Mr. Meister said.
Many of the 66 remaining residents express affection for the home and its staff and worry about their next destination. They include residents like Mildred Mondshein, a widow who is approaching 90.
''I'm getting dispossessed and I don't like that,'' she said as she sat with other residents in a corridor. ''But they can't move me until I decide what I want to do.''
After visitors pass through the home's front entrance, emblazoned with carved symbols of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, they see a sign near the lobby elevators with biblical words that offer a Jewish rationale for establishing nursing homes. ''Cast me not off in the time of old age,'' it says, quoting Psalm 71. Given the plans to close Bialystoker, some see these words as bitterly incongruous.
But Mr. Meister said that having to close the home and transfer its residents put him and the board in a sad predicament.
''That's why we kept it going so long,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Johnson and Roosevelt Legacies at Stake in Fiscal Fight

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - After helping President Lyndon B. Johnson pass his Great Society programs in the 1960s, Larry O'Brien gave his memoir a humble, and prescient, title: ''No Final Victories.''
Mr. O'Brien's observation has come sharply into focus, in Washington and on the presidential campaign trail. The accelerating debates over taxes, spending and economic policy amount to the most fundamental challenge yet to the achievements of Johnson and President Franklin D. Roosevelt a generation earlier.
President Obama's speech last week demanding that Congress pass his $447 billion American Jobs Act touched off a narrower discussion. The plan adopts both Democratic and Republican strategies for near-term job creation and economic growth using tax cuts or direct government spending or both. 
But in the presentation that Mr. Obama plans next week, the two parties will play for larger stakes. That is when the president will spell out his solution to America's long-term budget gap while, at the same time, trying to finance his jobs package.
The president and his fellow Democrats have one overriding reason for insisting that tax increases be included in deficit-reduction plans that a special Congressional committee will fashion this fall: that is how they aim to defend the essential character of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - the costly monuments of their New Deal coalition.
Republicans oppose tax increases for the opposite reason. That is how they aim to shrink those entitlements, and the federal government's role in American life.
Collision Course
The collision of those goals produced gridlock over the summer as the White House and Congress wrestled over the federal debt limit. The intractability of the struggle - which Washington delayed but did not resolve - led Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, to give United States debt a lower grade.
Now the confrontation has not only resumed but also expanded in ways that until recently were politically unimaginable.
The tax issue has thrown Democrats on the defensive going back to the Reagan era. Only a year ago, Mr. Obama acceded to Republican demands for an extension of all of President George W. Bush's tax cuts, including those for wealthy Americans.
The popularity of direct benefits to millions of elderly Americans has deterred Republican challenges to Social Security and Medicare for even longer. In their 2010 drive to recapture the House of Representatives, Republican candidates campaigned on cutting spending in general but not entitlement cuts in particular.
Yet rising alarm over America's long-term fiscal shortfall has emboldened both sides.
That became clear this spring when House Republicans, against the advice of political strategists, swung behind a plan drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, that would have cut Medicare outlays. It would convert Medicare from an open-ended fee-for-service program to one that gives beneficiaries a fixed amount for obtaining health coverage.
Democrats and the administration attacked, saying that Mr. Ryan's ''voucher'' plan would ''end Medicare as we know it'' and cut services by more than $6,000 per beneficiary. The exchange quickened the deficit debate and underscored the trade-off between benefits and tax levels.
Social Security, Again
For all his boldness, even Mr. Ryan avoided specific recommendations for changing Social Security. Now Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, by expressing open antipathy to the program, has placed that issue center stage, too.
Mr. Perry has questioned the constitutionality of Social Security, labeled it ''a failure,'' and called its financing a ''Ponzi scheme'' and a ''monstrous lie'' to young Americans. That makes Mr. Perry an ideological heir to the likes of Alf Landon, Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, who opposed Social Security and Medicare from the beginning.
His language was so bracing that Mitt Romney's campaign said Mr. Perry would be not be able to win the Republican nomination, much less the general election. In the 2008 Republican nominating contests, those 60 or older represented 38 percent of the participants in Iowa, 45 percent in Nevada, 35 percent in South Carolina, 44 percent in Florida and 37 percent in California.
Yet Mr. Perry's concerns about Social Security's financing are widely shared among Republicans, and by younger Americans over all. Those concerns drove Mr. Bush in 2005 to propose a partial privatization of the program.
Democrats opposed that as a fundamental shift in the nature of Social Security, just as they opposed Mr. Ryan's shift in the nature of Medicare this year. Congressional Republicans ducked Mr. Bush's fight - but in the era of the Tea Party they have not ducked Mr. Ryan's.
Republicans also hold an advantage in their bright line against tax increases. Mr. Obama has blurred the Democrats' position by embracing the need for some entitlement cuts while calling for tax increases to prevent benefits from being ''slashed.''
Whether this year, or after the 2012 elections, something has to give. And as Mr. O'Brien's admonition about political advantage suggests, there is nothing guaranteed, or permanent, about the outcome.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pressure Builds on Deficit Panel to 'Go Big,' Beyond Its Mandate, in Cuts

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Led by President Obama, pressure is building on the new Congressional committee on deficit reduction to ''go big'' -- beyond its mandate to shave as much as $1.5 trillion from budget shortfalls over 10 years -- even as doubts remain about the panel's ability to find enough bipartisan agreement to meet even the original goal.
A group of at least 57 prominent business executives and former government officials have signed a petition in support of a greater deficit reduction, which they are to release at a news conference on Monday. Among them are former treasury secretaries, budget directors and economic advisers to eight presidents from Richard M. Nixon to Mr. Obama; former Congressional leaders; and executives of top companies. 
Their letter reflects a broad sense of urgency in both parties, and among economists and businesses, that the nation must put in place long-range measures to shrink future deficits. At current spending levels, those deficits are expected to balloon over the next decade as the population ages and as health care costs rise.
The letter does not call for short-term job-creation measures like the tax cuts and infrastructure spending Mr. Obama proposed last week, which would add to deficits initially. Even so, many of the signers, liberals and conservatives, have called for such steps.
The petition does include what has fast become a catchphrase for those who believe Congress is thinking too small. ''We urge you to 'go big,' '' they wrote, ''and develop a large-scale debt-reduction package sufficient to stabilize the debt as a share of the economy.''
Generally that level is estimated at $4 trillion in deficit reductions over the decade, savings that would build in later years. Because Congress and Mr. Obama already agreed last month to nearly $1 trillion in reductions in so-called discretionary spending for social and military programs, the special committee would have to find more than $3 trillion more to meet that goal -- double its mandate for $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion, written into the August deficit-reduction deal.
Mr. Obama has called for a goal of at least $2 trillion, though the extra savings would mostly offset the up-front costs of his new $447 billion stimulus plan.
A higher deficit-reduction goal would increase pressure on both parties to address the two main drivers of projected high debt: the rapid growth of spending for the Medicare and Medicaid programs and an inefficient tax system unable to keep pace. That would test Republicans' opposition to raising any tax revenues from high-income individuals and corporations, and would challenge Congressional Democrats to agree to more savings from entitlement programs than they would like.
Yet it is the parties' differences on taxes and government health care benefits that have many in the White House, Congress and outside groups skeptical that the 12-member panel, which is split evenly between Republicans and Democrats and House and Senate members, can reach agreement even on the lesser goal.
Several signers of the letter said they had no illusions that their appeal alone would persuade many lawmakers, especially Republicans, to compromise. And while Congressional Democratic leaders have indicated that they would follow Mr. Obama in backing a compromise, many Democrats fear that doing so would undercut their ability to attack Republicans in 2012 for their proposals to remake and shrink Medicare and Medicaid.
The threshold of $4 trillion was first suggested in December by a majority of the fiscal panel that Mr. Obama established in 2010, led by Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader, and Erskine B. Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. Both men signed the letter.
''That is not a number that people just made up because the No. 4 bus just drove by,'' Mr. Bowles said in an interview. ''It's the minimum amount we need to do in order to stabilize the debt and put it on a downward path as a percent of G.D.P.''
The public debt amounted to 62 percent of the nation's gross domestic product last year and is projected to reach 77 percent of economic output by 2021.
Other signers include George P. Schultz, a former secretary of labor, treasury and state; Martin Feldstein and Murray L. Weidenbaum, top economic advisers to President Ronald Reagan; and the first chairman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, Christina D. Romer.
The businesspeople include David M. Cote, the chairman of Honeywell International and a Republican on the Bowles-Simpson commission, and Marne Obernauer Jr., chairman of the Beverage Distributors Company and an owner of the Colorado Rockies baseball team.
The letter writers did not recommend how to reduce deficits, acknowledging that they had ''differences of opinion.'' But their letter, which was organized by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget at the New America Foundation, a centrist research group, makes clear that the solution should include spending and tax changes.
''We believe that a go-big approach that goes well beyond the $1.5 trillion deficit reduction goal'' should include ''major reforms of entitlement programs and the tax code,'' they wrote.
Republican leaders have not joined Mr. Obama in seeking a higher goal. After a Rose Garden event on Monday, Mr. Obama will send Congress his jobs bill and long-term deficit cuts to offset its cost; next week he will propose another $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions to the committee.
''We're certainly open to hearing the president's ideas,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said last week: ''I'm not going to prejudge what the joint committee might do. It has a broad array of options. But its goal, obviously, is to do something significant about deficit reduction with a floor of between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion over 10 years.''
He added, ''We'll see whether they can even go beyond that.''
The committee is to report by Nov. 23, and Congress must hold an up-or-down vote by Dec. 23.
''Is it 50-50 that they'll do something big and bold? No,'' Mr. Bowles said. ''But I think there's a real chance. There are a lot of people on that committee, Republicans and Democrats, that I've talked to personally that want to do something big.''

HEADLINE: Investors Brace As Europe Crisis Flares Up Again

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Niki Kitsantonis and Ben Protess contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fears about Europe's deteriorating finances intensified on Sunday as new doubts about the health of French banks, as well as Germany's willingness to help Greece avert default, left investors bracing for another global stock market downturn this week.
In Greece, the epicenter of the Continent's financial disarray, government officials announced new austerity measures on Sunday, even as the country's finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, warned that the Greek economy was expected to shrink much more sharply this year than previously anticipated. In a revision, a contraction of 5.3 percent in 2011 was predicted, rather than the 3.8 percent forecast in May. 
Slower growth could make it harder for Greece to pay its debts, even as it tries to reduce them by cutting government spending and raising taxes.
While the Greek drama has been running for more than a year, only recently has it threatened French and German banks, unnerving investors around the world and sending stocks tumbling in Europe and the United States.
More than anything else, political and business leaders want to avoid the phenomenon of contagion, in which fears in one country spread to others, causing severe stress throughout the financial system, as happened in the fall of 2008. To be sure, Europe could still draw away from the precipice. That is especially true if policy makers come up with a plan to keep Greece afloat while also preventing anxiety from infecting other countries like Spain and Italy, whose huge debts and weak economies have fed worries that their borrowing has become unsustainable.
On Sunday, French government officials braced for possible ratings downgrades by Moody's Investors Service of France's three largest banks, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole, whose shares were among the biggest losers last week. The biggest banks in Europe, especially in France, hold billions of euros' worth of Greek bonds, and investors fear even a partial default by Greece would sharply diminish the value of those assets, eroding already weak capital positions.
American financial institutions, typically heavy lenders to their French counterparts, have begun to pull back on these loans, but United States banks' exposure to France remains substantial.
Still, if the French banks are indeed downgraded, it would underscore how European officials have been unable to contain the effect of the financial crisis in Greece, despite two bailout packages totaling more than 200 billion euros ($272 billion).
Frustration elsewhere in Europe has been mounting over whether Greece is sticking with the austerity goals it agreed to follow in order to qualify for the aid, and German voters in particular are wary of more handouts.
Despite repeated pledges by Chancellor Angela Merkel to keep Europe together, the cacophony of dissent within Germany has been rising. That is creating fresh doubt -- justified or not -- about the nation's commitment to the euro.
''The German electorate is not in the mind-set to undertake actions it sees as subsidizing less worthy nations,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ''As a result, the government is moving in a very isolationist way to try to establish a fortress Germany that's economically secure despite the risks in its European Union partners.''
On Friday, a stalwart German member of the European Central Bank, Jurgen Stark, abruptly resigned -- news that would have barely merited more than a few lines in the financial pages just a few years ago. Today, it is considered a sign of frustration within Germany about the extraordinary measures being pursued to maintain stability in the euro zone, adding to the volatility in global financial markets.
''Mr. Stark's departure could be seen by financial markets as another indication of growing disenchantment in Germany towards the euro,'' Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients.
Last week, Mrs. Merkel's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, warned that Greece's European Union partners would withhold new financial aid that is needed to help Athens pay its bills through Christmas unless the Greek government fulfilled the conditions of its first bailout.
All this has generated severe discomfort in Washington, which has watched the fallout from the European debt crisis with growing alarm.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has been in regular contact with his European counterparts, repeatedly advising them to speak with a single voice to help reduce confusion in financial markets. After a series of discussions on Friday at a meeting of the Group of 8 finance ministers in Marseille, he declared that ''European officials fully understand the gravity of the situation there.''
Athens is expecting to receive the next allotment of 8 billion euros of aid from the 110 billion euro rescue package that Greece was awarded last year. That aid is to be supplemented by a second bailout of 109 billion euros that European leaders agreed to in July. But the second package is threatened by demands from a handful of euro zone countries, including Finland and the Netherlands, that Greece provide collateral to secure further loans.
Mr. Venizelos said the government would do everything needed to close the budget shortfall. ''If we can prove wrong those who are betting on Greece to fail, we will see the crisis recede,'' he said.
Among the measures Mr. Venizelos announced on Sunday was a temporary property tax, ranging from 50 cents to 10 euros a square meter, depending on the value of the property, which would be collected for two years. The levy will be added to electricity bills to thwart tax evasion.
Mr. Venizelos also warned that the government would make further cuts to public spending. In a largely symbolic move, the government said it would withhold a month's pay from all elected officials.
''This is a battle for the country's survival,'' Prime Minister George A. Papandreou told a news conference in the northern port city of Salonika on Sunday. ''These measures are the supplies we need to fight.''

HEADLINE: Market Swings Are Becoming New Standard

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
The stock market just can't seem to make up its mind.
Day after day, stocks swing sharply by hundreds of points. Last week they tumbled 3 percent in the first 90 minutes of trading on Tuesday morning, then on Wednesday closed nearly 3 percent higher and dropped almost 3 percent on Friday. All of this on the heels of unusual back-to-back 4 percent leaps and dives in one week in August.
Now traders head into the week with fresh worries about the chances that Greece will default on its debt and the havoc that would wreak on European banks.
All of this anxiety has caused experts to ask whether there are new forces at work in the stock market that make trading permanently more erratic. 
In fact, big price moves are more common than they used to be.
It has become more likely for stock prices to make large swings -- on the order of 3 percent or 4 percent -- than it has been in any other time in recent stock market history, according to an analysis by The New York Times of price changes in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock market index since 1962.
Some experts see volatility as a problem because it can scare investors away from the markets, make companies reluctant to go public and undermine confidence in the economy, causing further drops in shares.
But another viewpoint is that stocks are rightly volatile now because there is so much uncertainty about where the economy is heading -- and canny investors could profit from the big swings, or simply sit them out until the market eventually finds equilibrium.
''It's neither good nor bad,'' said Michael Schmanske, head of United States index volatility trading at Barclays Capital. ''It is a measure of high opportunity but also peril.''
So what's causing the rise in the big bounces?
It's hard to know for sure, but market analysts point to new types of souped-up computerized trading and extraordinary global economic turmoil -- from protests over a second bailout for Greece to the downgrade of United States debt.
It is also possible that stocks simply move faster today because of the quicker pace of news and trading, and so drops and surges in prices that might have been spread over days in past times are now condensed within hours.
Some economists say they fear the volatility may feed upon itself. The violent ups and downs, said Robert Shiller, an economics professor at Yale, may in turn undermine confidence in the economy, and the weakness in the economy can lead to more strident politics -- all of which feeds the volatility loop.
''It is not well understood why we have these bursts of volatility,'' Mr. Shiller said. ''It seems that in these rare periods of bad economic performance and anxiety about the economy, we have volatility in the markets and high volatility in the political arena. Bad things can happen. This worries me.''
The Times looked at two sorts of historical data -- the closing prices of the S.& P. 500-stock index as well as the highest and lowest points the index reached during each trading day. Both measures, from 1962 through the end of this August, painted similar pictures of the market -- it rises and falls more now in greater size.
Since the start of this century, The Times found, price fluctuations of 4 percent or more during intraday sessions have occurred nearly six times more than they did on average in the four decades leading up to 2000. The price swings today may feel even more notable because the 1990s represented a relatively calm time for trading. In contrast, price fluctuations of 1 percent and more during intraday trading were more common in the 1970s and 1980s.
As for closing prices, the more-frequent jumps could also be clearly spotted. Thirty percent of trading days since the start of 2010 were up or down more than 1 percent at the time of the closing bell. That's far more than the 20 percent of such jumps in the 1990s. The trend toward greater volatility is more pronounced in larger price moves.
Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission have been looking at changes in the markets and automated trading strategies in connection with volatility. The market is no longer based on one single exchange but is fractured across four big exchanges and several smaller forums. High-frequency traders, using powerful computers to trade at exceptionally high speeds, now account for up to 60 percent of daily turnover.
And in the last decade, exchange-traded funds have become a large factor in trading, after hundreds of billions of dollars were poured into them. Those funds -- like mutual funds, but traded daily -- tie their values to indexes or bundles of stocks rather than individual companies.
But even as financial problems simmer in America and abroad, officials have yet to pinpoint exactly why stocks seem to move more quickly and to greater extremes.
Some financial historians question whether the markets are in a ''new normal'' of permanently heightened volatility.
''The last few years have been the most volatile for all of recorded history,'' said Andrew Lo, professor of finance at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. For evidence, he says that 10 of the biggest 20 daily upswings and 11 of the largest 20 daily drops since the beginning of 1980 to the end of last month have occurred in just the last three years.
Some analysts shrug off the big swings, saying all that matters is where prices land in the longer run, not each day. After all, the S.& P. 500 index is roughly where it was a year ago and, after the roller coaster of August, finished less than 6 percent down.
''The best thing people could have done last month is nothing,'' said Alec Young, an equity strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research. ''We don't think that it's a smart way to manage to be taking the temperature every day because you'll be trading your portfolio till the cows come home.''
And volatility may not herald dips in prices -- a study by Sam Stovall, a strategist at S.& P. Equity Research, found that markets since 1950 have typically been calm just before the highest consecutive price declines. But, he found, volatility goes up after prices start going down and the markets can remain nervous while prices recover.
Some longtime market observers attribute the skittishness to aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis.
''When there is uncertainty in the world, there is uncertainty in the market,'' said James J. Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University. ''After a big shock, it takes years for the markets to settle down.''

But as the speed of trading and information has increased, volatility has risen and swings of 4 percent are now more common. Closing prices are also more likely to be up or down by several percentage points. Even excluding the 2008-9 financial crisis, volatility was higher in the last decade than it was in previous decades.

HEADLINE: Veto a State, Lose an Ally

BYLINE: By TURKI AL-FAISAL. 
Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former director of Saudi Arabia's intelligence services and a former Saudi ambassador to the United States, is chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies.

 BODY:
Jidda, Saudi Arabia
The United States must support the Palestinian bid for statehood at the United Nations this month or risk losing the little credibility it has in the Arab world. If it does not, American influence will decline further, Israeli security will be undermined and Iran will be empowered, increasing the chances of another war in the region.
Moreover, Saudi Arabia would no longer be able to cooperate with America in the same way it historically has. With most of the Arab world in upheaval, the ''special relationship'' between Saudi Arabia and the United States would increasingly be seen as toxic by the vast majority of Arabs and Muslims, who demand justice for the Palestinian people. 
Saudi leaders would be forced by domestic and regional pressures to adopt a far more independent and assertive foreign policy. Like our recent military support for Bahrain's monarchy, which America opposed, Saudi Arabia would pursue other policies at odds with those of the United States, including opposing the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Iraq and refusing to open an embassy there despite American pressure to do so. The Saudi government might part ways with Washington in Afghanistan and Yemen as well.
The Palestinian people deserve statehood and all that it entails: official recognition, endorsement by international organizations, the ability to deal with Israel on more equal footing and the opportunity to live in peace and security.
Israel should see the Palestinian bid for statehood not as a threat, but as a chance to return to the negotiating table and prevent further conflict. Recent polls show that up to 70 percent of Palestinians say they believe there will be a new intifada if the deadlock is not broken shortly; this should encourage Israel to seek peace with the moderate Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.
The Obama administration has had ample opportunities to lead Israelis and Palestinians into bilateral peace talks, but American policy makers have unfortunately been more preoccupied with a deteriorating domestic economy and a paralyzed political scene than with finding a workable solution to this epic injustice. Because Washington has offered no viable new proposals, the least it can do is step aside and not hinder Saudi, European and moderate Arab efforts to advance Palestinian rights at the United Nations.
Even Israeli officials have recently admitted privately to their European counterparts that only Saudi Arabia will be able to give the Palestinians the required religious, political and financial legitimacy they need to complete a deal with Israel. Saudi Arabia had earmarked over $2.5 billion in aid to the Palestinian Authority since June 2009, making it by far the largest single supporter of the Palestinian cause. But this money will not do much good until Palestinians are granted their fundamental rights.
The 2002 Arab Peace Plan must be the starting point for negotiations; a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders is the only realistic foundation on which to restart talks, seeing as how the Oslo Peace Process has proved fruitless.
The Palestinian statehood initiative is a chance to replace Oslo with a new paradigm based on state-to-state negotiations -- a win-win proposition that makes the conflict more manageable and lays the groundwork for a lasting solution.
The only losers in this scenario would be Syria and Iran, pariah states that have worked tirelessly -- through their support of Hamas and Hezbollah -- to undermine the peace process. Saudi Arabia recently played a leading role in isolating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's brutal government by demanding an end to the killing of protesters and recalling the Saudi ambassador from Damascus. The impending fall of Mr. Assad's barbarous regime provides a rare strategic opportunity to weaken Iran. Without this vital ally, Tehran will find it more difficult to foment discord in the Arab world.
Today, there is a chance for the United States and Saudi Arabia to contain Iran and prevent it from destabilizing the region. But this opportunity will be squandered if the Obama administration's actions at the United Nations force a deepening split between our two countries.
Although Saudi Arabia is willing and able to chart a new and divergent course if America fails to act justly with regard to Palestine, the Middle East would be far better served by continuing cooperation and good will between these longstanding allies.
American support for Palestinian statehood is therefore crucial, and a veto will have profound negative consequences. In addition to causing substantial damage to American-Saudi relations and provoking uproar among Muslims worldwide, the United States would further undermine its relations with the Muslim world, empower Iran and threaten regional stability. Let us hope that the United States chooses the path of justice and peace.

HEADLINE: An Impeccable Disaster

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On Thursday Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank or E.C.B. -- Europe's equivalent to Ben Bernanke -- lost his sang-froid. In response to a question about whether the E.C.B. is becoming a ''bad bank'' thanks to its purchases of troubled nations' debt, Mr. Trichet, his voice rising, insisted that his institution has performed ''impeccably, impeccably!'' as a guardian of price stability.
Indeed it has. And that's why the euro is now at risk of collapse. 
Financial turmoil in Europe is no longer a problem of small, peripheral economies like Greece. What's under way right now is a full-scale market run on the much larger economies of Spain and Italy. At this point countries in crisis account for about a third of the euro area's G.D.P., so the common European currency itself is under existential threat.
And all indications are that European leaders are unwilling even to acknowledge the nature of that threat, let alone deal with it effectively.
I've complained a lot about the ''fiscalization'' of economic discourse here in America, the way in which a premature focus on budget deficits turned Washington's attention away from the ongoing jobs disaster. But we're not unique in that respect, and in fact the Europeans have been much, much worse.
Listen to many European leaders -- especially, but by no means only, the Germans -- and you'd think that their continent's troubles are a simple morality tale of debt and punishment: Governments borrowed too much, now they're paying the price, and fiscal austerity is the only answer.
Yet this story applies, if at all, to Greece and nobody else. Spain in particular had a budget surplus and low debt before the 2008 financial crisis; its fiscal record, one might say, was impeccable. And while it was hit hard by the collapse of its housing boom, it's still a relatively low-debt country, and it's hard to make the case that the underlying fiscal condition of Spain's government is worse than that of, say, Britain's government.
So why is Spain -- along with Italy, which has higher debt but smaller deficits -- in so much trouble? The answer is that these countries are facing something very much like a bank run, except that the run is on their governments rather than, or more accurately as well as, their financial institutions.
Here's how such a run works: Investors, for whatever reason, fear that a country will default on its debt. This makes them unwilling to buy the country's bonds, or at least not unless offered a very high interest rate. And the fact that the country must roll its debt over at high interest rates worsens its fiscal prospects, making default more likely, so that the crisis of confidence becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. And as it does, it becomes a banking crisis as well, since a country's banks are normally heavily invested in government debt.
Now, a country with its own currency, like Britain, can short-circuit this process: if necessary, the Bank of England can step in to buy government debt with newly created money. This might lead to inflation (although even that is doubtful when the economy is depressed), but inflation poses a much smaller threat to investors than outright default. Spain and Italy, however, have adopted the euro and no longer have their own currencies. As a result, the threat of a self-fulfilling crisis is very real -- and interest rates on Spanish and Italian debt are more than twice the rate on British debt.
Which brings us back to the impeccable E.C.B.
What Mr. Trichet and his colleagues should be doing right now is buying up Spanish and Italian debt -- that is, doing what these countries would be doing for themselves if they still had their own currencies. In fact, the E.C.B. started doing just that a few weeks ago, and produced a temporary respite for those nations. But the E.C.B. immediately found itself under severe pressure from the moralizers, who hate the idea of letting countries off the hook for their alleged fiscal sins. And the perception that the moralizers will block any further rescue actions has set off a renewed market panic.
Adding to the problem is the E.C.B.'s obsession with maintaining its ''impeccable'' record on price stability: at a time when Europe desperately needs a strong recovery, and modest inflation would actually be helpful, the bank has instead been tightening money, trying to head off inflation risks that exist only in its imagination.
And now it's all coming to a head. We're not talking about a crisis that will unfold over a year or two; this thing could come apart in a matter of days. And if it does, the whole world will suffer.
So will the E.C.B. do what needs to be done -- lend freely and cut rates? Or will European leaders remain too focused on punishing debtors to save themselves? The whole world is watching.

HEADLINE: After 10 Years, Names and Memories Echo

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN; Reporting was contributed by James Barron, Karen Crouse and Andy Newman from New York; Robbie Brown from Fayetteville, Tenn.; Elisabeth Bumiller from Washington; Manny Fernandez from Dallas; Campbell Robertson from Natchez, Miss.; and Katharine Q. Seelye from Shanksville, Pa.

 BODY:
They played the bagpipes again and recited the names of the dead like poetry. Bells tolled, and requiems by President Obama and other dignitaries filled the amphitheater of ground zero on Sunday as America looked back upon a contagion of terrorism and war and renewed its vows of remembrance.
On the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, as the nation reflected on its losses, thousands of families gathered at the new World Trade Center rising in Lower Manhattan, at the Pentagon and on a field of wildflowers in Pennsylvania to commemorate nearly 3,000 killed on that infamous morning when jetliners were turned into missiles and a new age of terrorism was born.
The day's centerpiece unfolded at ground zero, where more than 10,000 members of the victims' families, and some dignitaries and their wives, gathered in a parklike setting of swamp white oaks and emerald lawns -- a strangely futuristic plaza with precisely spaced trees rising from a five-acre granite floor, surrounded by a gouged wasteland of unfinished skyscrapers and silent construction cranes. 
In that panorama of resurrection, with the skyline in the background and the skirmishing harbor and the Statue of Liberty in the distance, the families choked back tears, sobbed and cast flowers into the spillways of sunken granite pools set in the footprints of the fallen towers, and crowded around the bronze parapets of the ''voids'' where the names of the dead are etched.
Amid the sounds of waterfalls, family members bent low to touch or kiss the names, and to weep. Many made paper tracings of the names, or inserted flowers or American flags into the crevices, and the parapets were soon thick with the colors and with red and yellow roses.
''It was real inspirational to come here after all these years and finally see his name,'' Dennis Baxter, 65, of King of Prussia, Pa., said of his brother, Jasper, who died in the south tower. ''I touched it. I didn't know what else to do.''
It seemed like only yesterday: the indelible images of the twin towers smoking and disintegrating, of people falling as if in a dream. Yet a decade had gone, thousands more had died in wars, America had endured economic hardships and natural disasters, had learned to live with terrorist threats and had at last killed Osama bin Laden.
''Yes, we are more vigilant against those who threaten us, and there are inconveniences that come with our common defense,'' Mr. Obama said Sunday night during a commemoration at the Kennedy Center in Washington. ''Debates about war and peace, about security and civil liberties, have often been fierce these last 10 years. But it is precisely the rigor of these debates, and our ability to resolve them in a way that honors our values and our democracy, that is a measure of our strength.''
For most Americans, the catastrophe of Sept. 11, though still vivid, has acquired the perspective of tragic history. But for the families and friends of those who died, the milestone anniversary meant only that the haunting memories of broken lives and shattered dreams had receded hardly at all.
''It's still unbelievable -- it still seems like a nightmare,'' said Trisha Scudder of Paoli, Pa., whose brother, Christopher R. Clarke, a bond salesman, was killed at the trade center. At ground zero ceremonies, she found small comfort in his name etched on the rolls of the victims.
The commemorations Sunday were the culmination of weeks of cultural and civic events that revisited 9/11 and its global consequences, a national outpouring of music, films, plays, visual arts, books, television documentaries and symposiums that reflected America's rich diversity and grew into an avalanche of introspection and analyses unrivaled since the turn of the millennium.
In cities and towns across America, the anniversary was marked with solemn and patriotic ceremonies, religious rites, tributes to the dead and even a political hiatus, as major Republican presidential candidates stepped off the campaign trail.
Giant flags were unfurled at football and baseball games, and in Queens at the United States Open tennis tournament, a clip shown on a giant scoreboard had Spike Lee, Mary Carillo, John McEnroe and Pete Hamill speaking of New Yorkers' resilience.
The attacks were recalled in concerts, vigils, public forums and millions of homes, where people watched televised memorial events and talked of the painful things they had witnessed.
Around the world, smaller commemorations were held in many capitals, with political and religious leaders voicing renewed commitments to democracy and the fight against terrorism. The global scope was a stark reminder that the victims of 9/11 had come from more than 90 countries.
On a resplendent morning in New York, with cool breezes and a blue sky brush-stroked by clouds that thickened into an overcast as the day wore on, many houses of worship, at the city's behest, tolled bells in an interfaith gesture of solidarity at 8:46 a.m., the time when the first plane struck the north tower.
In New Jersey, which lost more than 700 residents on Sept. 11, nearly every town, it seemed, had someone to mourn. Churches held special services, American flags flew on numerous homes and ceremonies were conducted in communities across the state.
On an elaborately choreographed morning, bells rang for silence six times: at 8:46 a.m., when American Airlines Flight 11 struck the north tower; at 9:03, when United Airlines Flight 175 hit the south tower; at 9:37, when American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon; at 9:59, when the south tower fell; at 10:03, when Flight 93 crashed in Pennsylvania; and at 10:28, when the north tower came down.
And in an emotional catharsis that continued for more than three hours, family members recited the names of the dead, this time including those killed in Virginia and Pennsylvania as well as in the attacks on the trade center in 1993 and 2001.
The names have become central to the ceremonies, read over the years by first responders, children, siblings, parents and others. This year any family member could participate, and many of the 3,000 children who lost a parent joined in.
The recitation of 2,983 names was no dry ritual. Indeed, it became an extraordinarily powerful drama, a kind of epic poem that forcefully and relentlessly conveyed vivid memories of the dead, and touched upon the implications of children growing up without a parent, of the emptiness of a home without a companion, of years of shared dreams and poignant hopes destroyed.
Stepping to microphones in pairs, carrying flowers and photos of the dead or wearing T-shirts bearing their likenesses, many added personal messages, speaking intimately to their loved ones, saying, in effect, we love you, we miss you, and renewing pledges of fidelity, telling of the births of grandchildren or other family events.
Voices quavered and faltered, rang with force and hope.
And when it was over, the silence was profound. You could hear only the wind sighing off the Hudson.
There were no religious services or formal prayers, not even a representative clerical contingent. On an occasion deemed too solemn for speeches, dignitaries led by President Obama and former President George W. Bush turned to poems and passages of literature to address the nation and the families whose sacrifices, they acknowledged, could hardly be assuaged with words.
Quoting from the 46th Psalm, Mr. Obama intoned: ''Come behold the works of the Lord, who's made desolations in the earth. He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in two; he burns the chariot in fire.''
Mr. Bush quoted an 1864 letter by Abraham Lincoln to a Massachusetts mother of two sons killed in the Civil War: ''I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.''
Other readings were given by former Govs. George E. Pataki of New York and Donald T. DiFrancesco of New Jersey and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who were in office at the time of the attacks; by Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey; and by relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who oversaw the arrangements, was master of ceremonies, and firefighters, police officers, first responders and members of the armed forces served as honor guards.
Musical selections captured the solemnity -- Yo-Yo Ma performing ''Sarabande'' from Bach's First Suite for Cello Solo, James Taylor singing ''Close Your Eyes,'' the flautist Emi Ferguson performing ''Amazing Grace,'' and Paul Simon intoning ''The Sounds of Silence.'' The Brooklyn Youth Chorus sang the national anthem and ''I Will Remember You,'' and 60 firefighters and police officers played the bagpipes.
The National September 11 Memorial Plaza was opened and dedicated on Sunday. It is to be open to the public starting Monday, though there is a long backlog of reservations.
While it has become a national shrine, like Pearl Harbor or Gettysburg, ground zero is still a 16-acre construction site. One World Trade Center has 82 of 104 stories built, and 4 World Trade Center has 50 of 64 stories up. More towers, a transportation hub and the National September 11 Museum are in various stages of construction.
In a whirlwind day, Mr. Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, flew to Shanksville, Pa., and to the Pentagon to lay wreaths and exchange words and hugs with the families of Sept. 11 victims, before his speech at the Kennedy Center in the evening. In Pennsylvania, thousands met in a field of goldenrod and Queen Anne's lace to honor the 40 passengers and crew members who are believed to have saved the White House or the Capitol from destruction by rising up against the hijackers.
The nation commemorated the day in myriad ways.
In Mississippi, the Rev. Jon Shonebarger, a chaplain at a prison near Natchez, chose the occasion to open a new church. Faith Independent Baptist Church was nothing fancy -- just a hotel meeting room, coffee, muffins and a stack of Bibles. But a dozen people attended, and the pastor called it a new beginning.
At the Lincoln County Fair in Fayetteville, Tenn., alongside mule races and carnival rides, crowds doffed cowboy hats and saluted as two girls rode horseback carrying the American and Tennessee flags in honor of the anniversary.
In Dallas, Christina Rancke, 21, a student at Southern Methodist University whose father, Alfred Todd Rancke, an investment banker, was killed in the south tower, attended church with Paige McInerney, a cousin who had been in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and escaped.
''There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about him,'' Ms. Rancke said.
The commemorations were hardly free of controversy. In New York-area firehouses and police stations, where the sense of loss ran deep for comrades lost on 9/11, anger over Mr. Bloomberg's refusal to invite a large contingent of first responders was palpable. His decision to de-emphasize religion at the ground zero events generated more discreet criticism.
Even as the anniversary unfolded, a nation that had not experienced a major terrorist attack in a decade had the jitters. Intelligence officials in recent days had rushed to assess a tip suggesting that two or three operatives of Al Qaeda had slipped into the country to set off a car bomb in New York or Washington to disrupt the ceremonies. Security at the trade center and other sites was heavy.
As peace prevailed, the ground zero proceedings closed in the early afternoon with trumpeters of the city and the Port Authority police, the Fire Department and the military services playing taps, the hauntingly beautiful refrain that closes the military day.
And as the sun went down and a rising full moon cast a silvery darkness over the city, two powerful searchlight beams shot skyward from near ground zero, creating likenesses of the fallen towers in a ''Tribute in Light.'' The illuminations, it was said, would be seen for 50 miles until dawn.
Online Correction: September 11, 2011, Sunday

HEADLINE: Ad Spending Grows Again, Albeit More Slowly

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Advertising spending is still increasing, according to new report, but the rate of growth has slowed again.

 BODY:
Advertising spending is still increasing, according to a report to be released Monday morning, but the rate of growth has slowed again.
The report, by Kantar Media, part of WPP, found that ad spending in major media in the United States in the second quarter rose 2.8 percent from the same period a year ago.
The percentage gain was the sixth quarterly increase in a row since the end of 2009, according to Kantar Media data, but it is the smallest of the six.
Add the second quarter results to the data for the first quarter, when ad spending in this country rose 4.4 percent from the first quarter of 2010, and the figure for the first half of this year remains in the plus column, up 3.2 percent from the first half of last year.

But the slowdown in the growth rate is worrisome to media owners who have been counting on ad spending to keep growing and help them recover from the recession - and perhaps help avert another one.
The numbers for the second quarter "are painting a mixed picture," Jon Swallen, senior vice president for research at the Kantar Media North America unit of Kantar Media, said in a statement.
On the positive side of the ledger, "a majority of media types actually improved their performance" from the first quarter to the second quarter, Mr. Swallen said.
On the other side, spending growth among the 100 biggest advertisers "stalled" in the second quarter, he added, "and the ad market became more dependent on the comparatively smaller budgets of midsized advertisers as the main source of growth."
By comparison, in the first quarter, more than two-thirds of advertisers tracked by Kantar Media were increasing budgets compared with the same period of 2010.
Here is the track of percentage increases in ad spending since the end of 2009 compared with the year-ago quarters: up 5.1 percent in the first quarter of 2010, 5.4 percent in the second quarter, 8.7 percent in the third quarter, 7 percent in the fourth quarter, 4.4 percent in the first quarter of 2011 and now 2.8 percent in the second quarter.
After the first quarter of a year, Kantar Media typically reports the data cumulatively rather than quarter by quarter. So most of the data in the report to be released on Monday is for the first half of 2011 rather than for the second quarter separately from the first quarter.
However the data is reported, once again newspapers and newspaper-related media come out with the short end of the stick.
Of the seven categories of media tracked in the first half, only two were down from the first half of 2010: newspapers, down 0.3 percent, and free-standing inserts, mostly distributed through newspapers, down 6.4 percent.
In the newspaper category, two of the three components fell compared with the first half of last year. Ad spending in national newspapers declined 4.9 percent and ad spending in Spanish-language papers declined 5.9 percent.
The sole gain in the category was enjoyed by local newspapers, up 0.6 percent compared with the first six months of 2010.
Among the rest of the media, the largest percentage gain was in outdoor, up 11.8 percent, followed by Internet media, up 10.4 percent; magazines, up 2.9 percent; television, up 1.8 percent; and radio, up 1.4 percent.
(The Kantar Media data for the first time includes paid search online ad spending by marketers.)
Looking at ad spending in the first half by category, eight of the 10 had gains, just as was the case in the first quarter as well as the fourth quarter of 2010.
The largest gain was in local services, up 10 percent, followed by personal care products, up 9.9 percent, and automotive, up 9.3 percent.
Automotive ad spending, by manufacturers and dealers, was again the largest category by type of advertiser in the first half, but the percentage gains were smaller than in the first quarter.
Procter & Gamble led all advertisers in spending in the first half, according to the report, as it did in the first quarter.
The rest of the top 10 in the first two quarters, in descending order, were: AT&T, General Motors, Comcast, Verizon Communications, Pfizer, L'Oreal, the Chrysler Group, Time Warner and Johnson & Johnson.
The list was identical to the first quarter's for the marketers ranked numbers one through six. Among the differences in numbers seven through 10, L'Oreal rose, Chrysler fell and two automakers that made the top 10 in the first quarter, Toyota Motor and Ford Motor, did not make the top 10 in the first half.
Of the top 10 spenders in the first half, five cut their spending compared with the first half of 2010: Procter, AT&T, General Motors, Verizon and Johnson & Johnson. The declines ranged from 22.5 percent (Verizon) to 2.6 percent (AT&T).
Of the five spenders in the top 10 that spent more in the first half this year than last, the increases ranged from 6.7 percent (Time Warner) to 58.7 percent (Chrysler).

HIGHLIGHT: What once was known.

 BODY:
Another nice piece from Sylvia Nasar, this time about Irving Fisher and the foundations of macroeconomics. Fisher remains hugely relevant to this day, and in particular to my own thinking about the mess we're in.
Yet it's hard to read Sylvia's piece without thinking about the intellectual regression we've suffered. Here's how she puts it:
By the Panic of 1907, Fisher had concluded that most extreme fluctuations in economic activity resulted from monetary disturbances. He had identified too much money as the source of inflationary booms, too little as the source of deflationary depressions.
By tracing seemingly unrelated economic pathologies to a single variable, money, he had identified a potential cure: Stabilize the value of money -- that is, avoid inflation or deflation -- and so stabilize economic activity. This was a cure that government, which issues money and determines its value, could dispense. 
That's basically right, although issuing money isn't enough when you're at the zero lower bound.
But think about the state of debate in America right now, with leading Republicans denouncing "fiat money", and distinguished economists insisting that a slump that is obviously, obviously, a case of Fisherian debt deflation is instead the product of market fear of the socialist tendencies of a very centrist president.
Next up: resurrecting the phlogiston theory of fire.

HEADLINE: Where They Were: Using Maps Across the Curriculum

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Each Monday this school year, we'll feature a recent Times multimedia project and provide related prompts and interdisciplinary activities. This one uses the interactive 9/11 "Where I Was" map.

 BODY:
Because The New York Times features multimedia every day, and because we believe that being literate means being able to read images and graphics as well as text, each Monday this school year we'll present a short lesson plan using Times multimedia.
Some days, like on this one, we will feature a map, while on others we might use an interactive chart or a video, slide show, timeline or podcast; all will be followed by a short list of questions and activity ideas for using both the form and the content across the curriculum. And all will be accessible in our multimedia lesson plans category page.
Today we've chosen the interactive map created to honor the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Though it will become part of our teaching 9/11 collection, in the list below we've suggested uses for it that go far beyond that context.
Let us know how you might use maps like this one with your students.
Before Viewing
Ask students to write down on a slip of paper a sentence about where they were and what they were doing when they first remember hearing about the events of Sept. 11, 2001. (Depending on their ages, they may remember the day itself, or may remember hearing about it from parents, friends or teachers later. Those who cannot remember an exact moment can write down one memory about 9/11 they have from any time in their lives.)
Whip around the room inviting volunteers to simply read their sentences aloud with no further discussion. When all have read, ask them to reflect: What was it like to hear all these statements? Did they have anything in common?
Then, show them The Times's interactive world map, "Where I Was," to which thousands have appended notes describing their emotions about and memories of that day.
Questions

        
What are some things you notice about it at first glance, before scrolling over the dots on the map? What does filtering comments by the various choices of emotion show you? How does seeing information spatially like this affect how you understand it?

        
As you scroll over the dots, what contributions by readers interest you most? What contributions surprise you most? What patterns do you see in the comments?

        
Why do you think The New York Times created a map like this and invited readers to participate? Would you want to add your own contribution to this map? Why or why not?

        
Do you think it is important to memorialize tragedies like 9/11? What purposes do you think memorials serve?

        
For what other events of global, national or local significance can you imagine creating a map like this?
Activity Ideas
From here, you might use our extensive collection of resources to have students talk or write more about 9/11 and its aftermath.
One simple idea: have students read "On 9/11, Vows of Remembrance," an article published on Sept. 12, 2011, that looks at how the 10th anniversary was marked around the nation and the world. As they read, they might underline lines or phrases that seem especially important or meaningful to them. Finally, just as they did at the beginning of class when they read aloud their sentences about their own connections to 9/11, you might invite students to end class by taking turns reading aloud the lines they chose from the article.
Google maps like the one The Times used for "Where I Was" have many uses in the classroom, and Google has created a whole page for educators to explore them.
One use might be to have students plot a journey of their own, telling a story as they go. For instance, Sandy Scragg, a New York City public school teacher, looked back on her own 9/11 experience working at a downtown high school, and retold the story of that day by plotting points on a map of where she went, each annotated to tell what she did and felt there. Her story-as-map was made with the help of a site called CommunityWalk that students can use, too, to create a map to accompany a personal essay about a journey of their own, or to create a visual version of research (for example, a map tracing an immigration journey).
Adapt this map to create a version for events that are or were important in your own community, or to make studying an era in recent history concrete by finding out how it impacted people locally.
For instance, students might ask a range of local adults about an important national event they are studying ("Where were you when John F. Kennedy died?") and append their comments to a map. Or, if studying local history - or as a response to a recent important event in your community - students could interview people of all ages and create a local version of "Where I Was" around a watershed moment, or create their own maps depicting aspects of the event. "Mapping the Protests in Cairo, Day by Day," for instance, is a visual version of the protests in Cairo last February that uses Google Earth to show crucial information.
Another interesting use of maps for local historical sleuthing is one described on The Times's Lens blog in which the Brooklyn Museum and Historypin invited locals to geotag historical photographs of Brooklyn.
What's in the Netflix queues of people in various cities across the United States? What did Twitter chatter look like during the 2009 Super Bowl? As you can see, The Times has created maps that show the data on both of these questions as means of illustrating regional tastes and trends. Another graphic, "The Geography of a Recession," depicts the hardest-hit areas of the nation and shows what economic factors caused some areas to suffer more than others.
Student journalists might consider creating such a graphic for a student publication, showing anything from where their own students went on summer vacation to where students at different schools in the area like to eat for lunch or go for fun.
What places are important in a novel your class is reading? How might a character like David Copperfield or Huck Finn plot and comment on his physical and emotional journey on a map? Use the same tools we suggest above, but adapt them for works of literature. In 2005, The Book Review created a Literary Map of Manhattan, which we've suggested many times as a model for a student graphics.
Have students plot data about a topic they are studying or researching on a map to show, as these Times examples do, anything from bird migrations to the path of tornadoes to hypothetical disease outbreaks.
In a recent series called Humanities 2.0, The Times looked at how the digital revolution is changing the way scholars learn and teach about history and literature. In the graphic "Examples of Spatial Humanities Projects," three projects in historical "humanities mapping" are shown: General Lee's view of Gettysburg, how Auschwitz was constructed and how witchcraft charges spread so rapidly in Salem, Mass., and beyond.
Have students read the related article to discuss what "vanished landscapes" would be interesting to explore. What new questions about a historical event do you think seeing information spatially will allow you to ask?

HEADLINE: Smoking a Cigarette, Making a Film

BYLINE: DENNIS LIM


HIGHLIGHT: The filmmaker James Benning explains why he put 20 of his friends on camera and had them each smoke a cigarette.

 BODY:
TORONTO - "Don't be fooled by the smoke," James Benning told a sold-out audience at the Toronto International Film Festival screening of his latest film "Twenty Cigarettes." A collection of living portraits, in which 20 smokers, all friends of his, face the camera for the time it takes to consume a cigarette, it is both an homage to Andy Warhol's fabled screen tests and a quintessential film for Mr. Benning, 68, a giant of American experimental cinema whose conceptually minimalist works tend to open up vast spaces for reflection. 
Observation and duration are central to his method. The 2004 landscape films "Thirteen Lakes" and "Ten Skies," with their stark, self-explanatory titles, are composed entirely of 10-minute static shots, each the length of a 16-millimeter film reel. In his 2007 film "RR," a monumental study of railroads in America, each shot lasts as long as it takes for a passing train to cross the frame.
"Twenty Cigarettes" introduces a human dimension to Mr. Benning's temporal investigations. All 20 of his subjects were left alone with the camera after Mr. Benning had framed the shot, and asked simply to smoke a cigarette. Some go from lighting up to stubbing out in under three minutes; others take two or three times as long. And all of them, Mr. Benning said in an interview on Sunday, "release a feel of who they are" amid the drags and puffs of smoke. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.
Q.
 I understand you're a non-smoker. 
A.
 The first time I tried smoking I was 11 or 12. I tried to light a cigarette when nobody was home and burned my eyebrows on the stove. I don't know if that deterred me from smoking. I never was opposed to it. I never really thought about it being a health hazard because at the time the ads would say things like "4 out of 5 doctors smoke Camels." But my mother really didn't want me to smoke and offered me $200 if I wouldn't smoke until I was 18 and I took her up on it. I think it was a good investment. I've never smoked even one full cigarette. 
Q.
 What was the genesis of "Twenty Cigarettes"? Did you start our wanting to make a portrait film or a film about smoking?
A.
 I wanted to do a portrait film with extended takes. Smoking came into it later, as the ploy to get people to stand still and not be totally conscious of being filmed, although a big part of "Twenty Cigarettes" is that very self-consciousness of a person in front of a camera and how that changes over time. Cigarettes also have this built-in duration and people will smoke at a different rate, and they'll smoke the whole cigarette or part of the cigarette. Smoking has such a stigma now, especially in the U.S., so I thought it would be interesting to make a film where I won't have any value judgment at all on smoking.
Q.
 Could you say a bit about how you framed and positioned your subjects? 
A.
 It's kind of a funny set-up - they're not sitting at a table having a cup of coffee or reading a book or talking on the phone. People don't smoke like that, standing up and just staring forward - the only exception might be workers on a smoke break standing outside a building. I had them up against a wall, or a flat background, and the camera was maybe eight feet away from them, so it's defining a triangular space towards that wall. They know they can only move that much and they're very aware of the camera. I really wanted to record the relationship of camera to subject, and how the audience becomes a camera when they watch and you feel that self-consciousness closer because the audience becomes eight feet away from the person.
Q.
 Do you agree that portraiture is ultimately an attempt to capture an essence of a person? 
A.
When you know somebody well, you can't really describe them in words but you have a whole feel for who that person is. Because I know all the people in the film, for me there are moments where that feeling really comes out, and I think that's when they've really let go of acting or being nervous all of a sudden. It's kind of a romantic notion to think that one can capture somebody's essence. But maybe I am a romantic in that sense. 
Q.
 Even though it avoids overt commentary "RR" alludes to the economic and political history of railroads. Do you think there are equivalent layers, connected to the act of smoking, in "Twenty Cigarettes"?
A.
 As with the railroads, there's a connection to business corruption: how can you make profits without any consideration for morality? Both of them of course are connected to cinema: the history of trains is connected to the history of cinema from the very beginning, and smoking has been used earlier, especially in the '40s, as a symbol of sophistication or for the evil character who smokes a particular way using a cigarette holder. Both films somewhat recall film history, although I don't make those kinds of films - it was just inherent in the subject. 
Q.
 Of your 20 subjects, half are women and half are men. They also vary in age and race and come from all over the world. Were you consciously striving for diversity?
A.
 Not when I began but once I got halfway through I realized it was a diverse group, and so it became more selective and I thought about trying to map the world into a pack of cigarettes. I grew up in a highly prejudiced place [Milwaukee in the 1940s and '50s], where we had no contact with anybody but our own kind. And so many years later now I'm the antithesis of what I grew up with and have ended up with a diverse group of friends. The film is kind of a tribute, I think, to myself and to what's possible, that I was able to become a person that's a bit better than where I started from.
Q.
So you could say "Twenty Cigarettes" ends up being a kind of self-portrait. 
A.
 Yes, even though that wasn't the point at all. But I like projects that help define my place in the world and how I move through it.

HEADLINE: From Sikhs and Cheese to Patels and Motels

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: Stories about specific communities of Indians making a home in a distant part of the world seem to have an enduring appeal

 BODY:
That Indians have migrated far and wide for economic opportunities is well known. Yet, stories about specific communities of Indians making a home in a distant part of the world seem to have an enduring appeal.
Last week, for instance, Twitter and Facebook accounts among readers in India and across the diaspora were abuzz after The New York Times published this storyabout a community of Sikhs who have migrated to northern Italy to work in its dairies.
The story was only the latest in a series of such stories about the various ethnic Indian communities found in virtually all big, and many small, countries. The Times wrote about the Sikhs of Canada in this 2000 article. And let's not stop at Sikhs. Tunku Varadarajan, the American journalist who himself was born in India, wrote about the Gujaratis who dominate the motel business in much of the United States in this long 1999 article in The New York Times Sunday Magazine. 
Outside the Times, I found this Associated Press article from 2009 about the various Indian communities - among them Sikhs, Gujaratis and Tamils -- in Bangkok, Thailand, which is where I lived from age 6 to 17. That piece said that "an estimated 140,000 of the city's 10-plus million residents have roots in modern India."
It's not just journalists who are fascinated with Indian migrants. Writers like Amitav Ghosh -- "Sea of Poppies" -- have written many books on the subject and scholars have studied this migration extensively.
The Indian diaspora is large in absolute terms - the government estimates it at 25 million people - but is just a tiny fraction of the overall Indian population of 1.2 billion. So, why are we so fascinated with Indian immigrants?
One explanation is purely economic: India receives more money in remittances from its migrant population -- about $53 billion in the last fiscal year, or 3 percent of the gross domestic product - than any other country in the world, according tothe World Bank.
Immigrants have also become important cultural ambassadors and advocates for India, whether they have done so consciously or by their simple presence in foreign countries. Some have described this as India's "soft power." 
Another plausible explanation is that many writers and readers like feel-good -- or conversely, tear-jerking -- stories about migrants because many of us have been migrants ourselves or have a relative or close friend who is. We see ourselves in these stories. I know I do.
Perhaps, it is not surprising then that a new version of the old Indian immigrant story has caught the attention of reporters and editors: Indians are now returning to take advantage of the faster economic growth here, particularly in the information technology industry. 
The BBC did a piece on this phenomenon last year. The year before, my colleague Heather Timmons wrote a piece that looked at the challenges that returning Indians face here.
Over the weekend, I had tea with a 30-something Mumbaikar, who grew up in India and went to college in the United States, who told me that he and some of his friends were thinking about selling their south Mumbai flats and moving to Los Angeles. By doing so, he said, they would cash in on high home prices here and take advantage of the weak housing market in California.
I imagine that over the coming years, there will be various permutations of the Indian immigrant story. We, or at least some of us, seem to be a restless lot.

HEADLINE: Shark-Fin Vote Adds to Pressure on Hong Kong

BYLINE: BETTINA WASSENER


HIGHLIGHT: Hong Kong is believed to handle at least half the global trade in shark fins, so what happens there matters beyond its borders.

 BODY:
As Elisabeth Rosenthal reported in Sunday's Times, the battle to protect the world's endangered shark population has passed another major milestone with a California Senate vote that bans the possession, sale and distribution of shark fins. 
Last week's vote was greeted with much delight by environmental campaigners. The global shark population has been decimated over recent years, largely because of soaring demand for shark fin soup among the newly wealthy in China, Hong Kong and other Asian nations. Soup made from shark fins is considered a delicacy and a status symbol in Chinese culture and commands hefty prices that make finning highly lucrative. 
The California bill now awaits Gov. Jerry Brown's signature. If he follows through, California will become the largest economy in the world to take a strong stand against the shark fin trade so far, according to the New York-based group Shark Savers. Hawaii, Washington and Oregon have also banned imports of shark fins, which means that the measure could officially close down shark-fin traffic in all remaining ports on the West Coast. 
Elsewhere in the world, Chile and the Bahamas recently banned shark fishing in their waters, and Taiwan introduced legislation in July to regulate the trade by requiring that fins be landed with the full carcass attached. (Fins, the most lucrative part of the animal, are frequently cut off by fishermen while the shark is still alive, leaving it to die a painful death with no means of swimming.) 
The pressure is now on Hong Kong, where I live, to follow suit - if not with an outright ban, then at least with much clearer action to discourage the consumption of, and trade in, fins.
Hong Kong is believed to handle at least half the global trade in shark fins, making it the shark-fin capital of the world, so what happens here matters.
But to date, not much happening - at least not on the legislative front. 
Asked whether the California decision might prompt action here, the Hong Kong government simply referred me to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Yet that agreement protects just three shark species rather than the many more that environmentalists say are now endangered. 
The authorities seem out of step not just with many in the West but possibly with public opinion in Hong Kong itself: slowly but surely, awareness has risen, and the list of companies that have pledged not to buy or sell or buy shark fin soup as part of their corporate activities keeps growing.
The last time I queried the Hong Kong government on the issue, for a column back in April, it response was, "We do not think it is appropriate to lay down guidelines to regulate the kind of food to be consumed in official banquets and meals." 
Yet the California decision has galvanized campaigners here. Six environmental N.G.O.'s in Hong Kong issued a joint statement calling on the government to follow the state's lead. "All eyes are now on Hong Kong," it warned.

HEADLINE: Union Square Pedestrian Plaza Is Declared a Success

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Off the Rails: One of the newest pedestrian plazas, near Union Square Park, has been a hit with pedestrians, and it apparently has not caused many traffic problems.

 BODY:
A pedestrian plaza on the north side of Union Square, the fourth such major street revamping along Broadway to be installed by the city's Department of Transportation, has been an out-and-out success, according to the department, despite some early qualms from residents.
The redesign, implemented about a year ago, banned most cars from the block of Broadway north of Union Square, between 17th and 18th Streets, and closed a traffic lane on Union Square North. Tables and chairs were placed on the closed-off areas, and the neighborhood's green market was able to expand.
The idea was to simplify a particularly tricky intersection where a confusing jumble of traffic signals and two-directional car lanes had resulted in a string of pedestrian injuries. 
But the plan initially met stiff opposition from residents and businesses in the area, who complained about traffic jams on residential streets and problems for delivery trucks. A raucous community board meeting resulted in outcry and a mass walkout from protesters. 
One year later, the city's traffic engineers say that the improvements, for cars and pedestrians alike, have been palpable. (Here's a pdf link to the report.) And no businesses or store managers appear to have registered complaints with local officials.
Radar samples found that about 12 percent of cars on Broadway between 20th and 19th Streets were now exceeding the 30 mile-per-hour speed limit, down from 28 percent of cars before the changes. Pedestrians can navigate a shorter crosswalk at the north end of Union Square, and they are waiting a shorter time for a "walk" signal.
Bicycle riders, who benefited from an additional protected lane along East 17th Street, also appear to be enjoying the changes: the agency found a 16 percent jump in cyclists in the area on weekdays, and a 33 percent increase on weekends.
Still, automobile drivers now appear to be avoiding the stretch of Broadway south of Madison Square, where the street was reduced to a single lane of car traffic and the direct car connection through Union Square was severed. 
The number of cars traveling on that stretch has dropped by about half since the plaza was installed, the report said. Some of those drivers may be choosing to take Fifth Avenue or Park Avenue South for southbound trips through the area, slightly slowing those routes. The average speed of taxis along Fifth Avenue fell slightly after the plaza was installed, and southbound trips on Park Avenue South took longer. 
But the Transportation Department noted that average speed along West 18th Street, where residents were most fearful of jam-ups, rose by about 14 percent, to 7 m.p.h. from 6 m.p.h. And average speeds on Park Avenue South stayed relatively unchanged.
The Union Square Partnership, the neighborhood's economic development group, conducted a door-to-door survey of area businesses, and 60 percent of those who responded said they were happy with the new traffic configuration. About 35 percent had no opinion.
Still to be determined: some illegal left turns at the always-dangerous perpendicular intersection of Union Square West and 14th Street. (Initially, the agency had hoped to close off parts of Union Square West entirely, but some businesses objected.) The city said it was working on new street adjustments to tackle the problem.

In May, former President George W. BushdeclinedPresident Obama's invitation to join him at ground zero after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. On Sunday morning, they stood shoulder to shoulder at the memorial - commanders in chief whose terms in office are bookends for exploring how the United States has changed since Sept. 11, 2001, particularly in its response to terrorism, the Times's Mark Landler and Eric Schmitt report.

        
A letter signed by at least 57 prominent business executives and former government officials reflects a broad sense of urgency in both parties, and among economists and businesses, that the nation must put in place long-range measures to reduce future deficits. Pressure is now building on the new Congressional committee on deficit reduction to go beyond its mandate to cut as much as $1.5 trillion from the federal budget, even as doubts remain about the panel's ability to meet even the lower goal, the Times's Jackie Calmes reports.

        
With Representative Michele Bachmann's popularity dwindling, her campaign is hoping to recapture its early momentum by showcasing her strengths in a national debate on Monday night, similar to the performance that lit up the stage at a Republican debate in June, the Times's Trip Gabriel and Michael D.

HEADLINE: Statistics, M.L.S. and the Castrol Index

BYLINE: JACK BELL


HIGHLIGHT: Companies like Opta and the Castrol Index used by M.L.S. are bringing statistical analysis to soccer, which has traditionally paid it little mind.

 BODY:
Soccer will never make it in the United States, or so goes the conventional wisdom. It was once called the sport of the '80s. The '90s brought the World Cup and the start of Major League Soccer. A new century began with a run to the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
In some circles the missing ingredient is the currency that fuels endless discussions, at the bar and in front of big-screen TVs: statistics.
Baseball has them (oh, does baseball has them). Hockey. Basketball. American football. Tennis and golf. In the United States, statistics help make the sporting world go-round. But soccer? Up until recently, the notion of keeping a record for assists struck many purists as folly. Goals, shots, fouls and clean sheets (or shutouts, as they are known here) were about the extent of it all. When European soccer journalists came here they were quick to turn up their noses at the press box stat sheets. Piffle, they said.
Then along comes the computer and smartphone, sports executives like baseball's Billy Beane and Bill James; soccer savants like Arsene Wenger, who has a degree in economics. Numbers suddenly had meaning, but how do you wring numbers from a free-flowing game like soccer?
Enter Opta, a sports data company that has been collecting and disseminating performance data for soccer matches throughout Europe in recent years. The company this year signed an agreement with Major League Soccer to provide its analysis and statistics on the league's Web site.
Opta stats are also at the heart of several smartphone apps, one that links to data from matches in the European Champions League and another one, released only last month, that gives the same treatment to all matches in the English Premier League, called FourFourTwo Stats Zone .
This year in M.L.S., Opta (which has set up its headquarters at the league's digital hub in New York, where analysts sit in front of screens and track every move on the field, assessing whether it has a positive or negative impact on a team's ability to score or concede a goal) is at the heart of the new Castrol Index. The company that is known for making automobile motor oil has dialed in to the interest in quantifying action on the field.
"We did work with people involved in the game and with fans and saw the growth in statistics as being a real powerful source of social currency for fans in many other sports around the world," Des Johnson, Castrol's director of marketing, said. "In football, or soccer, it was really lacking. Most sportswriters will do their own evaluation, simple and subjective marks out of 10. It's fair to say that the inspiration comes from American sports. In addition, there are global rankings for golf and tennis. But there was nothing for football."
In the latestCastrol Index ranking of M.L.S. players (see graphic above) Real Salt Lake's Jamison Olave became the first defender to claim a top spot in a weekly ranking. For a defender like Olave, the key components of his ranking include his ability to intercept passes, especially within his own penalty area, and to get into the attack.
"No one was giving information of quality to fans," Johnson said. "We knew fans wanted to access this stuff. How do we package it so it's easy to communicate, and we came up with the idea of an index. At the end of the day, it reduces analysis of close to 2,000 player interactions over a match and through a little black box technology converts to marks out of 10 for match. We use the Opta stats, plus our performance analysts employ a proprietary algorithm."
The stat world in soccer continues to be populated by believers and nonbelievers. According to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal, the new owners of Liverpool, who also happen to own the Boston Red Sox, are credited with using various statistical models to complete several off-season acquisitions -- acquiring a player like Stewart Downing from Aston Villa because of his passing acumen and ability to create goals.
Simon Kuper, whose book "Soccernomics" seemed to spur an interest in statistical analysis, has started a company that markets data to interested teams. The intent, of course, is to find a diamond in the rough, a player who may be undervalued and whose value is overlooked. One of Kuper's prime examples: Chelsea defender Claude Makelele, who was basically off-loaded by Real Madrid in 2003 for a pittance but turned into a stalwart for Chelsea because of skills that were revealed only after deep statistical analysis. His ball-winning qualities were simply undervalued. Ditto Wenger's "discovery" of a little-known Dutch player who only seemed to make every player around him better: Dennis Bergkamp.
But for every Wenger, there are doubters. Kuper and his "Soccernomics" co-author, Stefan Szymanski, performed all sorts of statistical analysis. One finding was that the most effective type of corner kick was an inswinger to the near post. When informed of the findings, Red Bulls Coach Hans Backe said, "I don't believe it at all."
Castrol's Johnson said: "We've had incredible reaction from fans, and what's most encouraging is that people want to engage in debate. We get plenty of people who go, that's ridiculous, then a bunch who feel differently. We're not necessarily trying to set out absolute truth. We want to provide stimulus, provocation for more robust debate. A conversation above the ratings."
Johnson said Castrol and its ratings folks probably got more than they bargained for when they combed the archives of the past 12 World Cups and came up with their World Cup legends team. There was one problem in one word: Pele ... he was not among the Best XI.
"We must be lunatics," Johnson said. "We did an analysis of the World Cup and came up with the Best XI ever and Pele didn't make the cut. That's insane, how could he not be there. But if you do the analysis with cold, hard, objective eyes, and look at performance and contributions, incredible goals, work rate and other areas, he does not rate as high as other strikers."
To paraphrase an old adage: People use statistics the way a drunk uses a lamppost -- more for support than illumination!
When it comes to soccer and statistics, do you use them more for support than illumination? Are they superfluous? Do the new uses of statistics in soccer provide more understanding and insight, or are they merely a source of discussion over a few pints?

HEADLINE: 'Keys to the White House' Historian Responds

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Allan J. Lichtman, the presidential historian at American University whose "Keys to the White House" system we posted a critique of here last week, has kindly prepared a response. 

 BODY:
Allan J. Lichtman, the presidential historian at American University whose "Keys to the White House" system we posted a critique of here last week, has kindly prepared a response. (Mr. Lichtman's system forecasts that President Obama is a heavy favorite to be re-elected in 2012.)
Mr. Lichtman's response is reproduced below. My policy is to let authors have their own say in these cases, so any further response I have will be contained in a separate post, with the exception of a brief technical comment at the end.
The Keys Work: A Response to Nate Silver
Allan J. Lichtman
I read with great interest Nate Silver's analysis in the New York Times blog of my system for predicting presidential election results, The Keys to the White House. His work demonstrates the kind of lively debate that the keys can generate. However, his critique of the keys system cannot withstand scrutiny.
Mr. Silver has either failed to read or simply ignored the detailed discussion of the keys in my book "The Keys to the White House" (5th edition forthcoming from Rowman & Littlefield early next year) or in technical articles that I published in peer reviewed journals (for example, International Journal Of Forecasting (April-June 2008) and International Journal Of Information Systems & Social Change (January-March 2010).
Mr. Silver's neglect of the published work on the keys system has resulted in fundamental misconceptions about the development and application of the keys that fatally flaw his critique. Mr. Silver presumes that I took 38 elections from 1860 to 2008 with known outcomes, found 13 key factors out of innumerable combinations of factors and used the impermissible methods of "overfitting and data dredging" to force the calls on these keys to conform to the results of these elections. In fact, the book and articles make clear that I followed a very different and scientifically sound procedure designed precisely to avoid the fallacies of "overfitting and data dredging."
I developed the keys in 1981 in collaboration with Volodia Keilis-Borok, a world renowned authority on prediction methods. The keys are based on a retrospective analysis of elections from 1860 (the beginning of the modern Republican vs. Democratic era) to 1980 and using a theoretical model, not random data-mining. The theory behind the keys is that presidential elections are determined primarily by the performance of the party holding the White House. This is a very positive message: it suggests that the American electorate makes reasoned, pragmatic decisions in presidential elections and is not manipulated by the pollsters, the admen, and the consultants. It suggests that it is governing not campaigning that counts in presidential elections.
After developing the 13-key model, I then followed proper procedure by testing it repeatedly through advance prediction of seven future elections - 1984 to 2008 -- with unknown outcomes. The keys system correctly predicted in advance the popular-vote outcome of each of the seven elections that occurred since its inception in 1981. The probability of attaining this record of seven consecutive correct predictions by chance alone is well under one in 100, a standard measure of statistical significance in social science.
I could not possibly have manipulated and wrenched the calls on the keys to achieve this successful record, since I did not have foreknowledge of the winner of the popular vote, much less the percentages gained by the major party candidates. Moreover, these seven correct predictions were usually made many months or even years prior to the election and often in defiance of the polls and the pundits. In May of 1988, for example, I used to keys to predict the election of Republican George H. W. Bush, when he trailed Democrat Mike Dukakis by double-digits in the polls and the pundits had written off Bush as a hopeless candidate. The table below reports the timing of each advance prediction and the publication cite. Mr. Silver does not even acknowledge in his critique, much less discuss, these seven correct advance predictions.
Keys To The White House: Timing of Predictions


Election YearDate of PredictionSource	1984April 1982"How to Bet in '84," Washingtonian Magazine, April 1982, 147-49.	1988May 1988"How to Bet in November," Washingtonian Magazine, May 1988, 115-24.	1992Sept. 1992"The Keys to the White House," Montgomery Journal, Sept. 14, 1992, 12.	1996Oct. 1996"The Keys to the White House: Who Will Be the Next American President?"

Attention to the material in my book and articles would also have assuaged much of Mr. Silver's worries about the subjectivity of some keys. A degree of judgment is required to answer some of the key questions, because the real world cannot accurately be captured by so-called "objective" questions alone. However, the amount of subjectivity is far less than meets the eye, given the careful definition of each key in the published material, the record of how each key was turned in the 38 elections from 1860 to 2008, and the successful predictions from 1984 to 2008 - elasticity on calling the keys cannot explain the correct prediction of elections with unknown outcomes.
For example, Mr. Silver charges that my failure to count Republican candidate John McCain as charismatic was arbitrary and subjective because "Mr. McCain, with his service in the Navy, might have met Mr. Lichtman's description of a 'national hero.'" In fact, the published definition of the challenger charisma/hero key rules out counting McCain as a national hero since he did not lead the nation through war, however admirable his record in war may have been. In first edition of the Keys to the White House published many years before the 2008 election, I wrote that candidates attain heroic stature only "through vital leadership in war like Ulysses Grant and Dwight Eisenhower." I noted that "many other candidates like William McKinley, George McGovern, and George Bush have impressive military records but have fallen far short of the heroic status obtained by Grant and Eisenhower." Clearly, McCain falls into the former, not the latter category.
Mr. Silver also takes me to task for crediting President Obama with the policy change key, even though his "initiatives, especially the health care bill, are rather unpopular." However, the definition of the policy change key refers only to the magnitude of the change and the departure from prior policy. The definition of the key does not include the "popularity" of policy initiatives, which is extremely difficult to measure accurately. Thus, the call on the policy change key is fully consistent with the keys system. Mr. Silver may not like the definition of the key, but that is quite different from objecting to the call on the key.
Mr. Silver also claims that the keys are flawed because of inaccuracies in predicting the percentage of the vote received by the incumbent party. However, the keys were not designed to predict vote percentages. They were designed to forecast whether the incumbent or challenging party will prevail in the popular vote, regardless of the margin of victory. Mr. Silver's critique of the keys system is akin to critiquing a pregnancy test, not for its failure to detect pregnancies, but for its failure to determine the day of conception.
The keys are a purely binary system and do not include percentages of the vote share. The dependent variable is a vector of 0s and 1s, indicating whether the incumbent party won or lost the popular vote. The independent variables are vectors of 0s and 1s, indicating whether each of the 13 keys favored the incumbent or the challenging party. Thus the keys are not designed to estimate percentages, but only popular vote winners and losers. Obviously, if I had sought to estimate percentages, I would have included such measures in the dependent variable. To reason backwards from percentage estimates to the likelihood of correctly identifying winning candidates is a flawed approach to evaluating the keys system.
However, it is possible purely as a by-product of the system to use the number of keys falling against the party in power to estimate the percentage of the two-party vote achieved by the incumbent party candidate. I developed such a formula in the two recently published articles cited above and applied it to both the retrospective predictions from 1860 to 1980 and the advance predictions from 1984 to 2008.
The formula that I developed and published comes much closer to replicating actual results than the one used in Mr. Silver's analysis. (My formula predicts the two-party percentage for the incumbent party and Mr. Silver's predicts the margin of victory, however, the two can be made comparable by converting the two-party percentage into a victory margin). For example, Mr. Silver takes me to task for vastly underestimating Herbert Hoover's landslide defeat in the presidential election of 1932. In fact, the correct prediction using the published formula of V = 36.75 + 1.84L, where V = the percentage of the two-party split going to the incumbent and L = the number of Keys favoring the incumbent party, is 46 percent, just 5 percentage points higher than his actual percentage of 41 percent and a clear loss for the incumbent party. It is true that the predictions on the keys flatten at the extremes and the greatest numerical errors are for landslide victories like 1924, 1932 and 1972. However, such errors are of absolutely no consequence in recognizing the popular vote winner of elections. In every instance of a landslide election, the keys show a very substantial victory by the winning candidate. Indeed, all of Silver's examples of supposedly large errors in numerical predictions come from landslide elections.
The keys are extremely accurate when it matters for relatively close elections, including elections predicted in advance. For the seven elections with advance predictions, the mean absolute error is only 1.9 percent, despite predictions made months and years in advance. In 2008, the system predicted the actual incumbent party percentage with an error of 0.3 percent. (see the Table below) By the logic of Mr. Silver's critique, he somehow would have had more confidence in the system if it had produced one to two errors (20 percent) in these advance predictions as his flawed table of probabilities would suggest.
The Keys to the White House, Advance Predictions Only, 1984-2008


YearPredicted ResultActual ResultDifference	198459.257.0-2.2	198853.955.21.3	199246.649.63.0	199654.751.5-3.2	200050.351.51.2	200451.253.32.1	200846.346.00.3	Absolute Mean Diff1.9	Overall, for all 38 elections, including the landslides, the 95 percent confidence level for predicting the two-party percentage for the incumbent party is 6.3 percent (much of it generated by the landslide elections), much lower than Mr. Silver's calculations produced. Only two elections (6 percent of all elections), 1912, when the Republican Party split, and 1924, when the Democratic Party split fall outside this range. Although I reject Mr. Silver's method of assessing the keys through numerical predictions that it was not designed to generate, this much tighter error band (about 12.6 percent, not 16 percent when converted to margins of victory or defeat) would produce much higher probabilities of correct predictions than those in Mr. Silver's table of probabilities - President Obama's chance of victory, for example, based on the current assessment would be close to 95 percent (depending on the call on the election year recession key), not 79 percent as Mr. Silver's invalid table of probabilities would indicate.
Finally, Mr. Silver suggests that including only two economic keys in the 13 key system understates the importance of the economy in determining electoral outcomes. Again, this critique is covered in the book and articles, which note that the economic keys often have trigger effects on turning other keys. For example, in 1932 the sour economy led to losses in the midterm election, social unrest, and the emergence of a charismatic challenging candidate (FDR).
Mr. Silver suggests that his own research shows that economic factors account "for about half of a voters' decisions." I would ask only, based on this research, how many elections he has correctly forecast in advance of Election Day and how far in advance he published his predictions.
---
Thank you to Mr. Lichtman for his response.
The technical matter: there's some dispute here about the margin of error associated with Mr. Lichtman's formula when applied to predict the incumbent party's margin in the popular vote.
Some of this, as Mr. Lichtman alludes to, is because his formula is based on predicting the vote received by the incumbent party's candidate (disregarding votes for third-party candidates) whereas mine is based on the separating the Democratic and Republican candidates (but not removing third-party candidates from the denominator). Errors calculated using the margin rather than the vote share will generally appear to be about twice as high: if you predict the election to be a 50-50 tie and the Republican candidate wins by 4 points, 52-48, you will have missed the Republican's vote share by 2 points but his margin of victory by 4 points. But they're basically measuring the same thing.
Even after accounting for that, however, there is still a modest discrepancy in the margins of error that we respectively identify.
I've double-checked my data and can't find any errors, so I've simply re-produced it, per the table below, for others to peruse.
The margins of victory in my figures should match those as recorded in Dave Leip's . Note that there are a few ambiguous elections in the sample -- like 1868, 1872 and 1912 -- that scholars, can handle differently, so the assumptions I've made about each one are also described in the table.

HEADLINE: Outsiders' Ideas Help Bank of America Cut Jobs and Costs

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Bank of America relied on a team of consultants to come up with plans to eliminate 30,000 jobs and cut annual costs by $5 billion.

 BODY:
As Bank of America executives prepared last week to announce the first phase of their turnaround plan, a group of consultants hurried to complete their recommendations for the overhaul, called Project New BAC.
The 44 senior bank managers and roughly two dozen consultants assigned to the initiative worked through lunch, barely pausing to enjoy the pepperoni, sausage and vegetarian pies that had been ordered from a pizzeria.
On Monday, the bank's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, announced the broad strokes of their five-month effort, announcing plans to eliminate 30,000 jobs and cut annual costs by $5 billion over the next three years. 
"We don't have to be the biggest company out there. We have to be the best," Mr. Moynihan said.
The consulting firms enlisted to help with Project New BAC - EHS Partners and the Promontory Financial Group - are what are known in the industry as bank doctors. Financial firms often turn to these specialists in periods of crisis, seeking out their recommendations on deep and wide-ranging cuts to bolster revenue and eliminate unnecessary expenses.
The idea is that outsiders can find thousands of small savings and inefficient processes that insiders may miss.
Promontory and EHS both have long ties to Bank of America, and to each other.
Eric Holder, who is leading EHS's work on Project New BAC, and Neil Smith, Promontory's head consultant on the project, were both members of a team from Tandon Capital Associates that helped the Fleet Financial Group with a similar effort in 1994.
On that project, called Fleet Focus '94, Mr. Holder and Mr. Smith worked with a team of 50 internal managers known inside the bank as the "Nifty 50." One of those 50 managers was a budding young lawyer named Brian T. Moynihan.
 At Fleet, the consultants recommended cutting Styrofoam coffee cups that cost the company $48,000 a year. Name-brand toner for Fleet's laser printers was replaced with a generic toner to save $200,000 a year.
 In all, Fleet cut annual costs by $300 million and laid off 3,000 workers. The changes helped Fleet's bottom line and set the stage for an eventual takeover. In 2004, it was acquired by Bank of America for about $48 billion in stock, at the time one of the largest bank mergers in history.
 In 1999, Mr. Holder, Mr. Smith and another consultant, Jeremy D. Eden, started their own firm, EHS Partners. They worked on cost-cutting for institutions including Mellon Financial, the PNC Financial Services Group and the Union Bank of California. 
But in 2009, Mr. Smith left EHS to start a rival team at Promontory Financial, a large consulting firm that specializes in regulatory and legal work and that helped Morgan Stanley revamp itself as a bank holding company after the financial crisis.
A person with knowledge of the companies who spoke anonymously to avoid angering the firms described Mr. Smith's split from Mr. Holder as an acrimonious divorce that capped years of tension between the men, making their joint assignment on Bank of America all the more unlikely.
 "I can't even imagine how that works," the person said. "When you think about the importance of figuring out Bank of America's issues, that's hard enough. To add another level of complexity with the consultants working out their own issues is another thing."
 Promontory and EHS declined to comment on their relationship. Bank of America declined to comment on the two firms, and a spokesman said many of the changes made in Project New BAC had come from bank employees rather than from outside consultants.
 Since Project New BAC was announced last spring, Mr. Holder's team from EHS; Mr. Smith's team, Promontory Growth and Innovation; and another team from Promontory that is focusing on regulatory issues have been working four days a week from the bank's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., camping out in cubicles on the seventh floor.
The Bank of America managers assigned to work on the project full time have led small teams of bank managers in a division-by-division review of operations. In phase one, roughly 150,000 ideas were submitted by Bank of America employees, and the best were presented to Mr. Moynihan and his management team.
 Consultant-led reform programs are common in banking, especially in the case of a company that, like Bank of America, has grown rapidly through mergers and acquisitions. When done correctly, the recommendations can trim fat and make a bank more competitive. 
"For a larger bank with so many acquisitions in the past, it makes sense to have someone come look at the process and the overlaps," said Jefferson Harralson, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods.
 The process can be painful. One project led by EHS, a 1999 revamp of the Union Bank of California that was called "Mission Excel," saved the bank hundreds of millions of dollars and increased profits. But those savings included cutting 1,400 jobs, and the project was reportedly renamed "Mission Expel" by some employees. 
"Barnacles grow on a bank, and it's good to have an outsider come scrape them off," said Charles Wendel, president of Financial Institutions Consulting. "But one of the great cliches is that you can't shrink your way to greatness."
After submitting their final recommendations, the team of consultants and company employees shared drinks on Thursday on a terrace at Bank of America's headquarters. Mr. Moynihan thanked them for their hard work, which in some cases included relocating temporarily to Charlotte.
But their job is far from over. The first phase focused on Bank of America's retail side, where many of the most obvious cuts were made. In the next phase, which is expected to begin in late October, EHS and Promontory will look at the commercial banking and wealth management divisions.
 "They're pulling the lower hanging fruit first," said Mr. Harralson. "There's more to come."

HEADLINE: Ford Shows the Evos Concept and a Baby EcoBoost Engine

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: Having previewed the design study last month in Michigan, Ford formally unveiled the concept, as well as a new 1-liter EcoBoost engine, at Frankfurt Monday evening.

 BODY:
6:31 a.m. | Updated 
FRANKFURT, Germany - The Ford Evos design study, formally introduced here Monday on the eve of the 2011 Frankfurt auto show, is the "new face of Ford" and is expected to influence styling on all its coming cars, said J Mays, the company's chief designer.
"People look at this vehicle and ask, 'Are you trying to move Ford upscale in the marketplace?'" Mr. Mays said. "I tell them, 'We're going to be giving our vehicles a premium look, without the price premium.'"
Reprising his talking points from an earlier presentation in Michigan last month, Mr. Mays said the design was not difficult to adapt for a production-intent vehicle, the doors notwithstanding.
"Gull-wing doors are for show cars, so the interior can be more easily photographed," he said with a smile. "They're not coming to production cars anytime soon. You'd have some overhead clearance problems with them in your garage."
Aside from that, Mr. Mays said that "significant elements" of the Evos design would be evident in a new production-intent vehicle to be unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show.
"This is a design that has relevance in Ford's worldwide markets," he said. "It won't be limited to any geographical region. Our philosophy is still 'One Ford' with this vehicle. The same cars will be available worldwide."
Exactly what car might be first to be imbued with Evos DNA is open to considerable conjecture, but the next model in Ford's current lineup that is due for redesign might be its midsize sedan, which is sold as the Fusion in North America and the Mondeo in Europe. The Evos is similar in size to those vehicles.
When asked about what size engine might fit in the rather short nose of the Evos, Mr. Mays said, "One of our 4- or 6-cylinder engines."
"There's more room up front than it looks," Mr. Mays said. "There's a lot of space under the windshield. We pulled the windshield angle and the A pillar pretty far forward because the design team liked the look of certain old Ferraris with similar angles."
In his estimation, Mr. Mays said the signature feature of the Evos was its "laser-cut" headlamps, which he said would make the current generation of very large headlights soon obsolete. "It gives us better lighting, allows us to lower the nose for a more aerodynamic front, and allows to tie in more styling elements," he said.
Ford also unveiled a 1-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine, the smallest engine Ford has ever made. Stephen Odell, chairman and chief executive of Ford of Europe, said the engine would be available next year in certain Focus models sold in Europe. Mark Schirmer, a Ford spokesman, said in conversation that the engine would subsequently arrive in Asia and North America, though he did not offer a timeframe for its introduction in those markets. 
Mr. Odell said the engine, in turbocharged form, could produce about 118 horsepower and "significantly" improve fuel economy, although he did not supply specific fuel economy numbers.

HEADLINE: The Green Jobs Numbers

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Green jobs may be hard to measure precisely, but they are surely growing and would benefit greatly from a bipartisan acknowledgment of that, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Now, more than ever, prospects for "green jobs" are being treated as a red flag in partisan debate. 
Media Matters, a nonprofit watchdog group, has documented a Fox News report proclaiming that the costs of green jobs exceed the benefits. A recent New York Times article, pointing to lackluster programs in California, concluded that "public efforts to stimulate creation of green jobs have largely failed." A column by David Brooks in The New York Times was pointedly titled "Where the Jobs Aren't." 
In reaching for bipartisan support in his jobs speech on Thursday, President Obama avoided the word "green" altogether, though his proposed increase in infrastructure spending could involve investments in improved energy efficiency. 
But green jobs still hold considerable promise. While it's not hard to find examples of programs that haven't lived up to expectations, considerable evidence demonstrates the actual and potential employment impact of efforts to improve environmental sustainability.

Not that green jobs are easy to define. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently in the process of developing an official measure, but employment that either saves energy or increases use of energy generated from renewable sources clearly falls into the category. 
In February, the Economic Policy Institute and the Blue-Green Alliance released a comprehensive analysis of the employment impact of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act expenditures aimed in this direction, dominated by efforts to improve energy efficiency in buildings and to promote low-carbon transportation. 
The study estimates an increase in direct employment of about 367,000 jobs, while indirect employment effects came to about one million - not a cure-all for an economy with more than 14 million unemployed, but a significant contribution. 
The cost per job created varied considerably, and not all programs have moved forward as quickly as they should have. But as a report from Think Progress carefully documents, sensationalized assertions of a million dollars or more spent per job are misleading. Overall, the costs of green jobs creation, whether funded with public or private dollars, are lower than those in most other sectors of the economy, at an average of about $60,000 each. These jobs are likely to last for years, generating private cost-savings and important public benefits. 
Retrofits to improve the energy efficiency of our existing building stock offer a particularly high rate of return. 
A recent Brookings Institution report calls for broader attention to "clean jobs," defined as those in establishments that produce or add value to goods and services with an environmental benefit, such as reducing pollution or natural resource depletion. 
By this definition, the clean economy is a pretty small slice of the United States economy, accounting for only about 2 percent of all jobs. But it's now bigger than the dirtiest slice, related to production of fossil-fuel based energy. 
The analysis by Brookings of employment trends on the county level between 2003 and 2010 shows that jobs in wind energy and solar photovoltaics represent a small but rapidly expanding part of the larger clean economy. 
The report also points to a growing share of private venture capital moving in this direction: 16 percent in 2010, from 2 percent in 1995. 
So why not rely entirely on the private sector? The biggest gains from investments in new renewable-energy technologies are not easily captured in private transactions, because they produce environmental services that are largely unpriced. Companies can sell consumers with a conscience a "share" in global greenhouse gas reduction - that's what the growing business of carbon offsets is all about. But consumers who don't pay also get the benefits, creating a strong temptation to free ride. 
Companies can't market to the consumers likely to benefit most, because they haven't yet been born. Conventional fossil fuels are cost-effective now only because the environmental costs are dumped into a global commons that imposes costs on other people and future generations. 
Public policies could remedy this problem, by imposing a tax on carbon emissions so that their market price better approximates their social cost. Adopting clean-energy standards would also increase demand for clean and green production, giving private companies greater incentive to invest. 
The Brookings report explains that Germany, carrying out such policies, attracted investments from major American corporations including Google, First Solar and Good Energies. Between 2004 and 2009, German employment in renewable energy increased to more than 300,000 from 160,000. 
Globally, the green jobs numbers look pretty strong. Unfortunately, in the United States, the possibilities for bipartisan collaboration still look very weak. Flag-waving is so much easier.

HEADLINE: Johnson and Roosevelt Legacies at Stake in Fiscal Fight

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: The debates over taxes, spending and economic policy amount to the most fundamental challenge yet to the achievements of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - After helping President Lyndon B. Johnson pass his Great Society programs in the 1960s, Larry O'Brien gave his memoir a humble, and prescient, title: "No Final Victories."
Mr. O'Brien's observation has come sharply into focus, in Washington and on the presidential campaign trail. The accelerating debates over taxes, spending and economic policy amount to the most fundamental challenge yet to the achievements of Johnson and President Franklin D. Roosevelt a generation earlier.
President Obama's speech last week demanding that Congress pass his $447 billion American Jobs Act touched off a narrower discussion. The plan adopts both Democratic and Republican strategies for near-term job creation and economic growth using tax cuts or direct government spending or both.
But in the presentation that Mr. Obama plans next week, the two parties will play for larger stakes. That is when the president will spell out his solution to America's long-term budget gap while, at the same time, trying to finance his jobs package.
The president and his fellow Democrats have one overriding reason for insisting that tax increases be included in deficit-reduction plans that a special Congressional committee will fashion this fall: that is how they aim to defend the essential character of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - the costly monuments of their New Deal coalition.
Republicans oppose tax increases for the opposite reason. That is how they aim to shrink those entitlements, and the federal government's role in American life.
Collision Course
The collision of those goals produced gridlock over the summer as the White House and Congress wrestled over the federal debt limit. The intractability of the struggle - which Washington delayed but did not resolve - led Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, to give United States debt a lower grade.
Now the confrontation has not only resumed but also expanded in ways that until recently were politically unimaginable.
The tax issue has thrown Democrats on the defensive going back to the Reagan era. Only a year ago, Mr. Obama acceded to Republican demands for an extension of all of President George W. Bush's tax cuts, including those for wealthy Americans.
The popularity of direct benefits to millions of elderly Americans has deterred Republican challenges to Social Security and Medicare for even longer. In their 2010 drive to recapture the House of Representatives, Republican candidates campaigned on cutting spending in general but not entitlement cuts in particular.
Yet rising alarm over America's long-term fiscal shortfall has emboldened both sides.
That became clear this spring when House Republicans, against the advice of political strategists, swung behind a plan drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, that would have cut Medicare outlays. It would convert Medicare from an open-ended fee-for-service program to one that gives beneficiaries a fixed amount for obtaining health coverage.
Democrats and the administration attacked, saying that Mr. Ryan's "voucher" plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and cut services by more than $6,000 per beneficiary. The exchange quickened the deficit debate and underscored the trade-off between benefits and tax levels.
Social Security, Again
For all his boldness, even Mr. Ryan avoided specific recommendations for changing Social Security. Now Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, by expressing open antipathy to the program, has placed that issue center stage, too.
Mr. Perry has questioned the constitutionality of Social Security, labeled it "a failure," and called its financing a "Ponzi scheme" and a "monstrous lie" to young Americans. That makes Mr. Perry an ideological heir to the likes of Alf Landon, Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, who opposed Social Security and Medicare from the beginning.
His language was so bracing that Mitt Romney's campaign said Mr. Perry would be not be able to win the Republican nomination, much less the general election. In the 2008 Republican nominating contests, those 60 or older represented 38 percent of the participants in Iowa, 45 percent in Nevada, 35 percent in South Carolina, 44 percent in Florida and 37 percent in California.
Yet Mr. Perry's concerns about Social Security's financing are widely shared among Republicans, and by younger Americans over all. Those concerns drove Mr. Bush in 2005 to propose a partial privatization of the program.
Democrats opposed that as a fundamental shift in the nature of Social Security, just as they opposed Mr. Ryan's shift in the nature of Medicare this year. Congressional Republicans ducked Mr. Bush's fight - but in the era of the Tea Party they have not ducked Mr. Ryan's.
Republicans also hold an advantage in their bright line against tax increases. Mr. Obama has blurred the Democrats' position by embracing the need for some entitlement cuts while calling for tax increases to prevent benefits from being "slashed."
Whether this year, or after the 2012 elections, something has to give. And as Mr. O'Brien's admonition about political advantage suggests, there is nothing guaranteed, or permanent, about the outcome.

HEADLINE: British Bank Panel Calls for More Gradual Reform

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: The Independent Commission on Banking recommended on Monday that British banks be given more time to adapt to new rules intended to prevent another financial crisis.

 BODY:
A government-appointed commission recommended on Monday that British banks be given more time to adapt to new rules intended to prevent another financial crisis, even as banks across Europe came under renewed pressure.
In its final report, the Independent Commission on Banking proposed a radical makeover that could cost the industry as much as 7 billion ($11 billion).
 As expected, it proposed separating the banks' deposit-taking operations from investment banking services, but stopped short of a complete break-up of the banks. The two subsidiaries would be separately capitalized, have different boards, different cultures and report results as if they were two different companies, the commission report said.
The commission said, however, that an "extended implementation period would be appropriate," with a final deadline of 2019. That would be after the next general election, and later than some analysts had expected.
British banking stocks slumped in morning trading on Monday, with Barclays down more than 4 percent and Lloyds more than 3 percent, as markets were unnerved by the nagging prospect of a Greek default.
The proposals, which go beyond banking reforms in the United States and elsewhere, are expected to lead to extensive lobbying from the banks before any final decisions on new rules are made by the British government.
"Retail subsidiaries would be legally, economically and operationally separate from the rest of the banking groups to which they belonged," the commission said in its 360-page report. "The improved stability that structural reform would bring to the U.K. economy would be positive for investment both in financial services and the wider economy."
The proposals are the result of a 14-month review headed by a former Bank of England chief economist, John Vickers, who was asked by the government to recommend ways to improve the stability of Britain's financial sector.
The goal of the proposals is to avoid taxpayers having to bear the main burden should the riskier investment banking part of a bank run into trouble.
Banks with larger investment banking operations, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, are to be most affected by the changes, some analysts have said. The separation could drive up their funding costs, as investors and lenders could perceive them as riskier because they would be less likely to be bailed out by the government.
Any changes are highly political because of the banks' importance to the British economy. Banks hold about 6 trillion in assets, more than four times Britain's economic output, and have come under sustained pressure from the government to lend more to businesses to help revive the economy.
Britain's treasury welcomed the report on Monday, calling it "an important step towards a new banking system that supports lending to businesses and families, supports the economy and jobs, but doesn't cost the taxpayer billions of pounds when it goes wrong."
But Prime Minister David Cameron has grown increasingly nervous that implementing major changes now could harm an already weak economic recovery, two government officials said last week. They declined to be identified because no final decision had been made.
The British Bankers' Association said on Monday that any suggestions by the British banking commission that go beyond changes suggested by European or global authorities "need to be carefully analyzed."
Meanwhile, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, said the United States should consider pulling out of the so-called Basel group of global banking regulators. In an interview with The Financial Times published on Monday, he said moves to impose an additional charge on the largest global banks went too far and were "anti-American."
The separation being proposed for British banks would mean that one part of the banks' business would be taking deposits and lending to consumers and businesses, and the other would be investing in stocks, derivatives and equity and debt underwriting. Capital from the investment banking part could be injected into the retail bank if needed, and the two businesses could share customers and expertise, the commission said.
The commission admitted that the changes would come at a cost, but it argued that the moves would ultimately improve the stability of the British banking sector and thereby competitiveness.
"Operational costs might increase" and "cost of capital and for funding might increase," the commission said.
Banking industry representatives warned that anything that drove up bank financing costs would limit their ability to lend to British businesses and threaten to weaken the economy.

HEADLINE: The Week Ahead in Congress: Obama Brings Jobs Bill to Hill

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama has said he will bring legislative language to the Hill on Monday detailing the $447 billion package of tax cuts and spending program he described in a jobs speech to a joint session of Congress last Thursday.

 BODY:
Last week, President Obama and Congressional Republicans took some tenuous steps along the path of legislative peace, vowing to work together to try and tackle the country's stubborn unemployment problem. Some hints of whether or not they can pull that off will surface this week. 
Mr. Obama has said he will bring legislative language to the Hill on Monday, the underpinning of the $447 billion package of tax cuts and spending programs he described in a jobs speech to a joint session of Congress last Thursday. 
House Republicans, leery of their growing image problem, have said they will be more than happy to look at the president's ideas -- which include a payroll tax cut for employees and small businesses and a stimulus-like infrastructure program -- but they want the costs and savings evaluated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and an explanation of how some programs will be paid for. House Republicans would like all of his ideas to wind through the usual committee process, where their potential alternatives can also be pondered. 
In a further test of bipartisan potential, the Senate is set to vote early this week on a bill to provide at least $6 billion in disaster assistance for victims of this summer's hurricane and tornados, having removed that spending item from its usual vehicle, an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. 
A few weeks ago, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia indicated that any disaster relief would have to be offset by some other budget cuts; he seemed to back away slightly from that position at the end of last week, as the peace blossoms were blooming, but that bill could still be a target for controversy as it hits both chambers. 
Also this week look for the conclusion to two other knotty problems - the potential shutdown of federal highway and aviation programs. Republicans said late Friday night that they had crafted an agreement that cleared the way for a bill that would extend the operating authority for the Federal Aviation Administration through the end of the year, and a similar funding framework for highway and transit programs through the end of March.
The bills were held up in part because Republicans were insisting on spending cuts as provisions in the bills, which seem to have gone away, and because Senate Democrats were resisting short-term solutions and other potential provisions in both bills. Both which were set to expire soon, and result in the layoffs of thousands of federal employees. This summer, the FAA endured a partial shutdown over the partisan disputes concerning the potential spending cuts, funding for rural airports and labor issues. 
House Speaker John A. Boehner will offer a rejoinder of sorts to President Obama this Thursday in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Building in downtown Washington, before the city's Economic Club. Mr. Boehner is expected to take a dim view of many elements of Mr. Obama's plan in his speech, and address what he views as the growing crisis of confidence among American employers. Mr. Boehner is expected to discuss the role of the bipartisan Congressional committee charged with finding $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions - which has already shown some growing pains, as Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona indicated last week he would quit the committee before making cuts to the Pentagon - and will discuss the role of both parties in the months ahead and their further potential to work less contentiously.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Uncompetitive but Very Cool

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Does social media really work for your business?

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
Jobs: Everybody's Talking Small Business
Dean Wormer sums up August's job growth, and the president counters with his $447 billion jobs plan. Here are the key points. Paul Krugman says it's big and bold. Mark Zandi, who's no Obama guy, thinks it will create two million jobs. Megan McArdle says it's more of the same. The thoughts of other economists are summed up here. Mike Brownfield offers four ways that President Obama hasblocked job growth. Mike Mandel shows which occupations have grown since 2007 and 24/7 Wall St. predicts the 10 best paying jobs of the future. Barry Ritholtz offers a few great charts on historical unemployment. The health care sector adds 30,000 more jobs. A Pepperdine University study suggests that most small businesses would like to hire in the next six months (but are hindered by uncertainty, capital and regulations). Lawmakers in Utah scratched their four-day workweek experiment. July job openings are the highest in three years. This guy is the world's fastest cigarette roller.
The Data: Climbing the Walls
July capital goods orders are revisedupward. A nonmanufacturing indexindicates expansion in August. Weak housing numbers may be concealing higher inflation. Traffic through the Suez Canal points to a slowing global economy. Mortgage rates fall to a record low. The trade deficit decreased (pdf) in July. Weekly unemployment claims increased.

Starting Up: Justin Bieber?
Laura Petrecca says fewer people are choosing to be self-employed. The Baltic states hold a start-up competition. Justin Bieber becomes a start-up investor. Gerri Harrison offers video tipsfor starting a small business. Austin holds a start-up camp. Here are 20 international start-ups to keep an eye on.

Congress passes big changes to our patent reform laws, and Brad Plumer explains it all succinctly. The Tax Foundation reports that "a review of actual Internal Revenue Service corporate tax return data shows that while the largest corporations in America (those with assets larger than $2.5 billion) represent a tiny fraction of all corporations, they pay an overwhelming share of all federal corporate income taxes." Catherine Clifford's opinion on President Obama's 17 tax breaks for small business? "Big whoop!"
Marketing: Warning - Actual Humans
Marketers plan to increase their social media spend. Neal Rodriguez writes about small-business social media myths. Mobile search increases during the holidays.

The Week Ahead: Inflation, Sales, Manufacturing
Both consumer and producer price indexes will be released, showing us whether inflation has increased. We also get to see how retailers did last month. Near the end of the week, both the New York and Philadelphia Feds will report on manufacturing activity in the region and the University of Michigan will release its closely watched consumer sentiment index.
This Week's Bests
Way to Use Fear as Your Compass Jim Connolly has one simple idea to attract the attention and respect of your marketplace: "In my experience, those who express themselves honestly and those who are too fearful to express what they believe use fear as their compass. Where the difference comes, is in the way they navigate with that compass."
Reason to Not Use Social Media Megan Leap shares her three all-too-common social media marketing myths The one I like the best is "Myth: everyone needs social media marketing. It's sexy, it's fun, and everyone - from enterprise organizations to small businesses - thinks that they need to add it to their marketing mix. But you know what? That's not quite the case. Before you invest more resources into social media marketing, ask yourself these critical questions. Does my target audience use social media networks? Can I reach them there? Do I have competing, higher-R.O.I. priorities that can potentially drive better results more efficiently? Will it help me achieve my goals? Do I have enough time to invest to do a worthwhile job? (Good social media marketing is time-consuming!) If you answered 'no' or 'not sure' to any of the above questions, please take some time to reconsider your social media marketing investment."
Reason to Win an Inc. 500 Award Nathaniel Broughton shares the good and badof winning an Inc 500. award, including: "an invite to the conference in D.C. It's littered with top-notch speakers (I saw Jim Collins and Tony Hsieh, among others), and every other attendee is someone else who's making waves in the business world. You can strike up a conversation with any person in attendance and know it'll be worthwhile. It's truly hard to find that at most conferences."

HEADLINE: 9/11 Recalled - Islamabad

BYLINE: SALMAN MASOOD


HIGHLIGHT: After 10 years, Pakistanis aren't clear whether the "war on terrorism" is indeed their own war, or if their country has been fighting America's war.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Had 9/11 not happened, I would have had a different life, a different profession.
In 2001, I had been accepted to a college in New York for a master's degree in Social Sciences, and was waiting for my U.S. student visa. But on Sept.11, 2001, as I watched the news coverage of planes hitting the World Trade Center, I instantly had a premonition that my visa would be delayed.
Like thousands of other Pakistanis, my visa application was put on an indefinite hold. To bide my time, I started looking for a part-time job, and within a few weeks I was working in the Pakistan bureau of The New York Times.
I had never intended to be a journalist but was fascinated with the team of distinguished reporters, who had arrived in Islamabad to cover the American invasion of Afghanistan and its fallout in Pakistan. Soon, I started accompanying these American journalists on trips across the country - from the mountainous tribal badlands to the urban labyrinths - and met people from all strata of society: those who were powerful at the top and those who were helpless on the streets.
Before 9/11, I had a different perception and understanding of my own country. I led a comfortable and rather insulated life in Islamabad, the capital. But working with The Times exposed me to a different world and gave me the opportunity to look deeper and beyond the obvious. I put my plan of further studies on the back burner and decided to stay in Pakistan and continue with journalism. 
Ten years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a special report on the decade's costs and consequences, measured in thousands of lives, trillions of dollars and countless challenges to the human spirit.
Go to The Reckoning 
The cleavages and fissures within society were always apparent, and after 9/11 they became wider and starker. Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who was president and army chief at the time, had vowed to eradicate extremism and militancy from the country and appeared sincere at first. 
The progressives and liberals attached vaunted hopes to him. But his sincerity seemed a charade at best, and a failure at worst, and his crackdowns against militant and extremist groups were halfhearted and unsuccessful. 
And why would they not be? Pakistan's alliance with the United States was forced, forged under duress. The military, therefore, hedged its bets and kept supporting some factions of the Taliban, basing its policy on its worry that if U.S left the region, who would control the meltdown?
Back in 2002, when my friends and I naively used to think that Americans would totally rout the Taliban. I had always spurned their extremist ideology and was rather happy that American troops would crush them. I never wanted my country to be under the influence of an extremist, intolerant version of Islam.
But today, the Taliban have managed to rebuild their influence in Afghanistan and are waiting in the wings to do so here. In Pakistan, radicalization, religious intolerance and bigotry are even more firmly rooted now than they were 10 years ago. Pakistan has become a land of contradictions, conspiracies and tragedies. 
Dictatorships of the past ruined the country, and democracy seems like a sham. Politicians have failed to uphold civilian supremacy. The military and intelligence services, which went on a back-foot after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, continue to dominate the national political landscape. 
Meanwhile, the country continues to bleed.
Any thoughts of optimism, therefore, get eclipsed by worries of a dismal and bleak future. The tumult and chaos in the last decade have sent Pakistan sliding into a bloodbath. The unrelenting suicide bombings have exhausted everyone. Thousands of civilians and soldiers have died. Terrorist attacks are commonplace; their daily devastation now a common staple of life, and the state's response is inadequate and weak.
America, which was idealized as the land of opportunity, is now scorned by many as an enemy. U.S. drone attacks have riled ordinary Pakistanis. Even after a decade, Pakistanis aren't clear whether the "war on terrorism" is indeed their own war, or if their country has been fighting America's war.
Who really faltered? Could both America and Pakistan do better? It is perhaps pointless now to the thousands whose lives have been maimed and destroyed by violence. The scars won't heal easily. The mutual suspicions will not be easy to overcome.
This despair is shared by most people I meet or read about in the newspapers.
I asked Enver Baig, a former senator in Pakistan, what he thought about the last decade. "Ten years down the road, the progress in the war against terror has been next to nil," claimed Mr. Baig, a usually upbeat and optimistic politician.
"The main actors are now seeking ways and means for an honorable exit without loss of face, but in the process Pakistan has been damaged almost beyond repair."
Mr. Baig said that Pakistan is now overwhelmed by a deepening social crisis, divisions in society, a loss of national cohesion, a crumbling economy, massive poverty, evaporating internal legitimacy and rapidly declining external credibility.
No comforting words.
Still, Mr. Baig said he hopes Pakistan can come out of this morass if we can get our act together. I would also love to be optimistic. Hope is perhaps our only salvation.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Endorses Romney

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY and MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Tim Pawlenty, who dropped out of the race last month, endorses Mitt Romney's candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com
Tim Pawlenty endorsed Mitt Romney for president on Monday, making the announcement on Fox News hours before the Republican presidential candidates gather in Florida for another debate.
 Mr. Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota who ended his quest for the Republican nomination last month, chose Mr. Romney over Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whom he was close to from their years serving on the Republican Governors Association.
 Many of Mr. Pawlenty's contributors and supporters had been waiting for a signal from him in the escalating contest between Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry. And Mr. Pawlenty had been looking for help in retiring a campaign debt of at least $500,000.
In a statement announcing Mr. Pawlenty as a national co-chairman of his campaign, Mr. Romney said: "Tim will be a trusted adviser as I move forward with my campaign. Tim has always been an advocate for lower taxes, reduced spending and an environment where jobs can be created. It is an honor to have him serve as co-chair to my campaign for the presidency."
Mr. Pawlenty, in an interview Monday morning on "Fox and Friends," said of Mr. Romney, "I believe he's going to be our party's nominee."
 The endorsement, which was brokered in recent days, was released on Monday to help Mr. Romney contrast his message on Social Security with Mr. Perry's. The issue has become a defining difference between the two candidates and was expected to be discussed extensively at the debate Monday night in Tampa, Fla.
 Mr. Perry has criticized the original intent of Social Security, describing it as a "Ponzi scheme" and "a monstrous lie." 
 Mr. Pawlenty criticized those remarks on Monday.
 One leading donor to Mr. Pawlenty said Monday that he expected many of Mr. Pawlenty's former contributors to now support Mr. Romney. 
Mr. Pawlenty ended his bid for the presidency after a disappointing third-place finish in the Iowa straw poll last month. In an e-mail to supporters, Mr. Pawlenty wrote that "at his core, Mitt Romney is a man of great character."
That the endorsement came so quickly after Mr. Pawlenty's departure is a surprise. Mr. Pawlenty had said that he would most likely endorse one of his former rivals but did not give a timetable.
But his choice was not startling. Mr. Pawlenty had positioned himself as a candidate who could appeal to mainstream Republicans, much like Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has.
In picking Mr. Romney over Mr. Perry, Mr. Pawlenty was signaling his desire that the party avoid a more ideological candidate aligned with the Tea Party movement.
"Alone among the contenders, he possesses the unique qualifications to confront and master our severe economic predicament," Mr. Pawlenty said of Mr. Romney. "His abiding faith in our country's exceptional historical position as a beacon of freedom will make him the most important leader in a world that depends upon a strong America to stay at peace."
The endorsement comes as Mr. Romney's lead in the national polls -- which had been consistent for months -- has evaporated in the face of Mr. Perry's candidacy.
Mr. Pawlenty's campaign never gained much momentum despite his officially entering the race before any of his former rivals.
But Mr. Romney's aides are clearly hoping that the early endorsement will help convince some of Mr. Pawlenty's activist and donors that Mr. Romney remains the party's best shot at defeating President Obama.
"President Obama has failed to meet America's economic challenges," Mr. Pawlenty said in his e-mail, sent out by the Romney campaign. "His three years of spending, regulating and taxing have not restarted the economy. Unemployment remains at a shocking 9.1 percent. Economic growth is hovering on the edge of a renewed recession."
Mr. Pawlenty adds, "Fortunately, America may get a second chance: Mitt Romney is running for president, and I am proud to endorse him."
The endorsement puts Mr. Pawlenty in a different place than he was four years ago. In 2007, Mr. Pawlenty traveled extensively with Senator John McCain after endorsing him for the nomination over Mr. Romney and the others in the race.
Aides to Mr. Romney said that he and Mr. Pawlenty hit it off personally -- and so did their wives -- despite some rough moments between them on the campaign trail.
Mr. Pawlenty had coined the term "Obamneycare" as a way of criticizing Mr. Romney's health care reforms in Massachusetts. Mr. Pawlenty said they were similar to the federal plan Mr. Obama put in place.
But Mr. Pawlenty declined to press that attack during one of the debates, and Mr. Romney's advisers said he shrugged off the criticism as a typical campaign moment.

HEADLINE: White House Would Cut Deductions to Pay for Its Jobs Plan

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama again -- and again and again -- urges Congress to pass his jobs bill.

 BODY:
2:24 p.m. | Updated The White House said on Monday that it would cover most of the cost of his payroll tax cut and other job initiatives by limiting the deductions that can be claimed on the tax returns of wealthier taxpayers.
President Obama, repeating what is clearly going to be the mantra for his stump speeches this fall, called on lawmakers Monday to "pass this bill" -- his $447 billion jobs package.
At the White House, his budget director described how the administration would propose to pay for the plan, as the president has promised to do.
Jack Lew, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the bulk of the plan -- some $400 billion over ten years -- would be raised by limiting the itemized deductions, such as those for charitable contributions and other expenditures, that may be taken by individuals making more than $200,000 a year and families making over $250,000 a year. The rest would come from provisions affecting oil and gas companies, hedge funds, and the owners of corporate jets.
Mr. Lew said that the congressional panel charged with finding at least $1.2 trillion in savings this fall as part of the agreement to raise the debt ceiling will have the option of accepting the payment proposals submitted by Mr. Obama, or proposing new ones of their own.
Republicans were quick to signal their continuing opposition to the tax increases that Mr. Lew described, which have been suggested by the administration before.
Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, said the White House plan was not showing a "bipartisan spirit."
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said: "I sure hope that the president is not suggesting that we pay for his proposals with a massive tax increase at the end of 2012 on job creators." If Mr. Obama's bill resembled the 2009 stimulus plan, he said, "I don't believe that our members are going to be interested in pursuing that; I certainly am not."
Like that stimulus plan, Mr. Obama's jobs bill is made up largely of tax cuts, such as the expanded reductions of the payroll taxes that finance Social Security. The White House wants to cut both employee and employer contributions in half next year, putting more money in the pockets of all wage earners and on the bottom line of most smaller companies.
Mr. Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden, held up a copy of the American Jobs Act, which will be sent to Congress on Monday evening. Flanked by people from across the country who he said would be helped by the law if it passes, the president struck tones similar to those of his big jobs speech last Thursday.
"On Thursday I told Congress that I'll be sending them a bill called the American Jobs Act," Mr. Obama said, holding up a folder. "Well, here it is."
Mr. Obama said the jobs act was "based on ideas from both Democrats and Republicans." Americans, he said, cannot afford to wait 14 months until the next election for lawmakers to act, particularly given the dire economic straits and the high unemployment rate.
"We've got a world economy that's full of uncertainty right now," Mr. Obama said. "Some events are beyond our control." By contrast, he said, his jobs bill is "something we can control."
Mr. Obama is heading to Ohio and North Carolina this week to push his jobs plan. In Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday, in Speaker John A. Boehner's home state, he will argue once again that Congress should act; he will be making a similar pitch in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina on Wednesday. While the president won both states in 2008, they are expected to be highly competitive in next year's election.
An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified House Speaker John A. Boehner's home state. He is from Ohio, not Iowa.

HEADLINE: Live Blog: Republicans Meet in Florida for Tea Party Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Just days after a debate in California, the eight Republican presidential candidates will square off again tonight at a forum in Tampa.

 BODY:
Just days after a debate in California, the eight Republican presidential candidates will square off again Monday night at a forum in Tampa, Fla.
The debate is being jointly sponsored by CNN and the Tea Party Express. The moderator, CNN's Wolf Blitzer, will be asking some questions submitted by Tea Party members -- a move that could inject a different feel into the exchange.
Follow the action on our new live debate dashboard. We will bring you the highlights, quick analysis, fact checking and scenes from Tampa. And then come back to NYTimes.com for the best coverage of the 2012 campaign.

        
Live Debate Dashboard
10:18 P.M. | That's a Wrap
The Tea Party debate is over, but the conversation will clearly reverberate for days after what was the most spirited clash of the 2012 campaign so far.
From the exchanges over Social Security, the HPV vaccine and immigration to a back-and-forth over Afghanistan, viewers were treated to some memorable moments.
And Republican voters got a lot to chew on as they move toward deciding which candidate would be better to run against President Obama.
Stay with The Caucus and my colleagues here at The New York Times as we continue to cover this campaign and the other political activity in Washington. And come back here next week for another debate, this time from Orlando, Fla.
9:59 P.M. | Payment Advisory Board
 Romney says that Obama's health-care plan will "ultimately" create a panel that will tell people what kind of care they can get. True?
schltrlegal, Grand Terrace
Mr. Romney said the federal health care legislation championed by President Obama would ultimately lead to panels that dictate to people what kind of health care they can get.
While it is not clear precisely what panel Mr. Romney was referring to, the health care law did create the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is tasked with slowing the growth in Medicare costs, and the board has drawn criticism from many Republicans and some Democrats for taking too much power away from lawmakers.
The board will consist of 15 voting members drawn from among physicians, other health professionals and experts in health care finance and delivery, nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. 
But while the board does have the power, starting in 2015, to propose specific cuts to Medicare if spending appears likely to exceed projected levels in any given year, those proposals are not binding on Congress, though the law makes it relatively hard to overrule the recommendations. And the law spells out that the board's recommendations "shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums."
9:54 P.M. | Tea Party Crosscurrents
The political crosscurrents in the Tea Party can be rough and unforgiving. Mr. Perry discovered that tonight.
Mr. Perry has shot to the top of the polls in the Republican presidential campaign in part by embracing the Tea Party and conservative, evangelical voters in his party.
But, as measured by the reaction in the hall tonight, those voters will have some reasons to look at Mr. Perry skeptically.
When the conversation turned to Mr. Perry's executive order on the HPV vaccine, the audience was clearly not happy. Having applauded and cheered him earlier, the audience suddenly turned sour.
A few minutes later, Mr. Perry again found himself on the outs with the audience as he sought to explain his decision to support in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants.
There were plenty of boos from the audience, and cheers for Mr. Perry's rivals, who reject such help for people who are not legally in the country.
"Of course we do not give in-state tuition credits to people who have come here illegally," Mr. Romney said. Mrs. Bachmann added, "I think the American way is not to give taxpayer subsidies."
Mr. Perry's campaign has been animated by Tea Party members and their sense that he is the candidate who can best bring their philosophy to Washington. 
But that support is clearly still up for grabs, and - if tonight is any indication - the Tea Party movement still has questions for the governor of Texas.
9:52 P.M. | Huntsman Tries to Get Attention
Mr. Huntsman is trying really, really hard to inject himself into this debate, and, more to the point, into the campaign.
But so far, his attempts tonight seem to have fallen mostly flat, at least as measured by the audience in the hall.
His first attempt was a jab at Mr. Perry for suggesting that the entire border with Mexico would never be totally secured. That, Mr. Huntsman suggested, was "almost treasonous."
The second was a reference to Mr. Romney's reputation for having changed many of his positions over the years.
"We could spend all night talking about where Mitt's been on all the issues, and that would take forever," Mr. Huntsman said.
Both were clearly attempts to get off a good line that will get attention. But they seemed forced, and the audience hardly reacted.
He will have to do more than that to move the needle, it seems.
9:45. P.M. | E.P.A. Gone Wild? 
A viewer asked the candidates how they would achieve energy independence, but only Mr. Cain was allowed to answer. He said the United States had sufficient natural resources to eliminate all imports of oil, which is technically true, but it would require opening public lands and waters that are now off limits, including the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Arctic Ocean, a plan supported by most Republicans and oil companies but opposed by many other Americans.
Mr. Cain further said that he would create a commission to review regulations at all federal agencies, beginning with the Environmental Protection Agency, a proposal he has made before. He said the panel would be composed of "people who had been abused by the E.P.A." 
That would presumably include executives of businesses, including utilities and oil and gas companies, who have complained for years about the burden of meeting a variety of federal clean air and water laws.
9:43 P.M. | Hitting Perry on Immigration
Mr. Perry has a complicated relationship with immigration - he's had to balance securing the border with the cultural and emotional connection Texas has to Mexico, and to the state's Hispanics, who make up 38 percent of the population. But he got the first boos of the night for his decision in 2001 to allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public universities in Texas. Hit hard on this by Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Santorum, who joked that it might be Mr. Perry's effort to attract Latino voters, Mr. Perry quickly switched from his compassionate approach to the pragmatic one Tea Party voters want to hear: "This is a states' rights issue," Mr. Perry said. "In the state of Texas, where Mexico has a clear and a long relationship with this state, we decided it was in the best interest of those young people to give them the opportunity to go on to college."
Meanwhile, while his opponents suggested that Texas needed a border fence, Mr. Perry continued to demand that the federal government step up with Border Patrol agents on the ground. 
9:23 P.M. | More on the HPV Fight 
Mr. Perry's rivals pounced with a vicious fervor on his decision (later withdrawn) to require young girls in his state to receive inoculations against the virus that can cause cervical cancer.
Mr. Perry has said he made a mistake in issuing that executive order, and he repeated that apology tonight. He said he should have worked with the Legislature instead.
That was not nearly enough for his rivals.
Mrs. Bachmann accused Mr. Perry of having put forth a policy in which "innocent little 12-year-old girls have a government injection by an executive order."
She followed it up with a financial allegation as well, accusing Mr. Perry's former top aide - at the time a lobbyist for the vaccine maker, Merck - of benefiting from the executive order.
"There was a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this mandate," Mrs. Bachmann said. "The governor's former chief of staff was the chief lobbyist for this drug company."
(Her aides quickly followed it up with a fact sheet titled: "Rick Perry's Crony Capitalism: The 2007 Vaccination Executive Order Fiasco.")
And she was not the only one. Mr. Santorum piled on.
"I believe your policy is wrong," Mr. Santorum said. "There is no government purpose served by having little girls inoculated. This is big government run amok and it should not have been done."
In an e-mail to reporters, Mr. Perry's campaign wrote, "Governor Perry has always been a strong believer in protecting parental rights, which is why this executive order allowed parents to make the final decision about whether or not their daughter was vaccinated."
It will be interesting to see whether the issue catches fire, or whether the governor's repeated acknowledgment that he was wrong will be enough.
9:20 P.M. | Perry and the HPV Vaccine
Mrs. Bachmann had a turn in the spotlight after Wolf Blitzer asked her to respond to Mr. Perry's executive order mandating the human papillomavirus vaccine for adolescent girls. (Texas lawmakers overruled the mandate, which Mr. Perry has always said was designed to protect young girls from cervical cancer.) 
Mrs. Bachmann reminded the audience that Mr. Perry's former chief of staff was a lobbyist for Merck, which manufactures the vaccine, and that Mr. Perry got campaign contributions from the drug maker. 
The contributions were $5,000 - but there's no question that the lobbyist, Mike Toomey, played a major role in Mr. Perry's decision to issue the executive order. "If you're saying I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended," Mr. Perry fired back. 
Mrs. Bachmann had her own choice line: "I'm offended for all the parents and little girls who didn't have a choice." 
9:09 P.M. | Jobs Created by Stimulus Bill
 Perry says the first stimulus bill created zero jobs. True?
schltrlegal, Grand Terrace
Like most of the Republican candidates, Mr. Perry takes a dim view of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was championed by President Obama and approved by Congress in 2009.
The stimulus bill, Mr. Perry said tonight, has "created zero jobs."
But the reality is more complicated.
There is no question that Mr. Obama is presiding over a period of profound economic misery and high unemployment. Since Mr. Obama became president in January 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country has lost 1,705,000 jobs. And while the president's advisers had once predicted that the stimulus bill would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent, they were wrong: According to the Department of Labor, it is now at 9.1 percent, a level the White House believes will not abate before the end of next year.
But without the federal stimulus bill the situation would probably be worse, most fiscal and budget analysts, including many Wall Street firms, agree.
According to data collected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the stimulus bill, between its passage in February 2009 and June 2011, has increased the number of people employed by 1 million to 2.9 million, figures that include jobs created and jobs preserved.
Moreover, while the stimulatory effect of the bill peaked in 2010 and is now declining, according to the research, it is still preserving jobs that might otherwise be lost. And during the second quarter of 2011, the bill raised real gross domestic product by 0.8 percent to 2.5 percent.
The bill has proved somewhat more expensive than originally estimated, however, with a total budget impact of about $825 billion over 10 years rather than $787 billion.
9:05 P.M. | Fact Check: Rich Nation, Poor Nation
Mr. Romney repeated his line, "We're an energy-rich nation, but we're living like an energy-poor nation." He has never quite explained what he means by this, but the United States consumes more energy per capita than any nation on earth outside the Persian Gulf. 
9:04 P.M. | Fact Check: The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad
Mr. Paul said the United States Embassy in Baghdad cost $1 billion and was bigger than the Vatican. Almost. The Congressional Research Service says the final cost was $736 million (a $140 million cost overrun). The embassy compound covers 104 acres; Vatican City covers about 110 acres.
9:01 P.M. | Fact Check: Perry Debates Himself on Social Security
As Mr. Perry was assailed by some rivals for his misleading claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme, he also seemed to be debating himself at times.
Mr. Perry used the debate to talk about the need to shore up Social Security, which politicians on the left and the right agree is needed if the program is to be able to continue paying out full benefits a quarter of a century from now. But in making his case, Mr. Perry both exaggerated the problems facing Social Security and adopted a very different tone than he did in his book "Fed Up" just a year ago, in which he described Social Security as a failure that "we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now."
Tonight, Mr. Perry said Social Security had to be fixed so that "our children actually know that there's going to be a retirement program there for them."
But in the past, as Mr. Romney correctly pointed out, Mr. Perry has repeatedly suggested that Social Security, which pays benefits to 56 million Americans, is undesirable, and that it may even be unconstitutional.

8:58 P.M. | Perry's Money-Saving Efforts 
Mr. Perry used a question on balanced budgets to talk about how he saved money by consolidating 12 state agencies into 5. But that move in 2003 has been often debated and highly controversial. Under the legislation, the state outsourced a large number of services to private companies, paying them billions of dollars a year. Many of Mr. Perry's own aides and staffers, as well as state lawmakers, have gone to work for the contractors providing these services. 
8:53 P.M. | Politics and Poker 
One of the biggest challenges for Mr. Romney will be the jobs and economic record in Texas, where Mr. Perry has presided as governor for the last decade.
But he's clearly got a strategy: Describe the success in Texas as having little to do with Mr. Perry and more to do with the environment that Mr. Perry oversaw. 
During the debate tonight, Mr. Romney cited the state's oil, its lack of an income tax, its right-to-work laws and a Republican Legislature as evidence that just about anyone could have done well as governor.
"If you're dealt four aces, that doesn't make you a terrific poker player," Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Perry couldn't have expected that exact attack, but he had a pretty good retort. 
"You were doing pretty good until you got to talking poker," Mr. Perry said.
The serious question, though, is whether Mr. Perry's record of job creation and the economic situation in Texas will mean more to regular Republican voters than the background that Mr. Romney cites.
8:51 P.M. | Can't We All Just Get Along?
Newt Gingrich, peacemaker?
At least in the past two debates, that's the role Mr. Gingrich has been playing, trying to turn the focus away from Republican squabbles and back to President Obama.
At the debate in California last week, Mr. Gingrich told the moderators, "Well, I'm frankly not interested in your effort to get Republicans fighting each other." And tonight, after a back-and-forth between Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney over Social Security, Mr. Gingrich sought to break up the fight yet again.
"I'm not particularly worried about Governor Perry and Governor Romney frightening the American people, when President Obama scares them every day," Mr. Gingrich said.
8:49 P.M. | Does the Audience Matter?
Does the audience matter at these debates? If so, then Mr. Perry might have the edge over his main rival, Mr. Romney.
The hall is filled with members of the Tea Party, a group that views Mr. Romney with suspicion. And that was clear in just the first few minutes of the debate.
Mr. Perry got much applause for his answers about Social Security. Mrs. Bachmann got some applause for calling for an ownership society, in which personal responsibility and property ownership takes precedence over government handouts. Even Mr. Paul got applause.
But the audience seemed downright tepid toward Mr. Romney as he attacked Mr. Perry on Social Security and defended his own experience on jobs.
Mr. Romney might take solace in the fact that the audience in Tampa is hardly representative of the overall Republican electorate (much less the overall country).
But if the disparity continues, it might make harder for Mr. Romney's spinners to convince people that their man won the debate after it's over.
8:37 P.M. | Huntsman and Bachmann Start Differently
Two of the candidates who have to make a real impression at the debate tonight have taken very different approaches early on.
Mrs. Bachmann was thrown a softball, getting the first question, about Social Security, from a Tea Party member. But instead of going after Rick Perry - and maybe getting a bit of attention - she quickly shifted the conversation to her talking points about "Obamacare."
Meanwhile, Mr. Huntsman, the former Utah governor, who has been totally overshadowed at previous debates, showed a lot more energy. Asked about Social Security, he basically said of Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry: a pox on both your houses.
"We've got the answers," a spirited Mr. Huntsman said. "We don't have leadership." 
8:37 P.M. | Fact Check: Bachmann and Medicare
Michele Bachmann, asked about Social Security and Medicare, said, "We know President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare."
This is a distortion of the health care law passed last year. In its effort to stem the inexorable rise of Medicare spending, the law carves out $500 billion in savings over 10 years, through a combination of higher Medicare payroll taxes and reduced payments to providers. 
Those savings were credited toward expanding health care to those who are currently uninsured. Although it's roughly correct to say $500 billion was shifted from the Medicare program to the new health care program, it's a stretch to say the money was "stolen," especially since the Medicare savings were also adopted in the budget that House Republicans passed earlier this year (but the Senate rejected).
8:30 P.M. | Fighting About Social Security 
Gov. Rick Perry was hit early with a predictable question on Social Security, which Mr. Perry has called a "monstrous lie" and a "Ponzi scheme." 
In an opinion column published in USA Today on Sunday, he toned it down a little, saying Social Security needed to be saved. Mr. Perry, who Mr. Romney has said wants to away with the entitlement program, started off with a firmly worded promise that people who currently rely on Social Security won't be weaned off it and that those nearing retirement will be safe, too. At the debate, Mr. Romney is trying to portray Mr. Perry as a flip-flopper, saying he used to want to abolish the program, and has now changed his tune. Mr. Perry is doing the same thing, quoting from Mr. Romney's book, in which he suggested that Social Security was effectively a criminal enterprise. On paper, the two candidates apparently believe the same thing. In practice, they're each accusing the other of changing his tune.
8:20 P.M. | Right Out of the Gate: Romney vs. Perry
Well, that didn't take long.
On the very first question of the night, and without all that much prompting, Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney began a spirited exchange over Social Security.
The exchange was an indication of how much Mr. Romney is worried about Mr. Perry's surge in the polls. And also an indication of how much Mr. Romney thinks Mr. Perry's statements on Social Security could be fatal for him.
Mr. Perry, who has called Social Security a "Ponzi scheme" and a "failure," sought to defend his comments, but Mr. Romney was having none of it.
Over and over, Mr. Romney directed questions directly at his rival: "Do you still believe that Social Security should be ended as a federal program like you did six months ago?"
Mr. Perry was ready for it, saying that his book was designed to spark a conversation.
"We're having one of those now," Mr. Romney said.
8:09 P.M. | Are You Ready for Some ... Debating? 
Those watching the Republican debate may be missing "Monday Night Football." But watching the debate's intro on CNN, they might have been confused. Like a good sports contest, a deep-voiced announcer offered viewers a list of the contenders.
Mitt Romney: The Early Front-Runner
Rick Perry: The Newcomer
Michele Bachmann: The Firebrand
And the rest of the field:
Jon M. Huntsman Jr.: The Diplomat
Ron Paul: The Libertarian
Rick Santorum: The Fighter
Herman Cain: The Businessman
Newt Gingrich: The Big Thinker
The announcer did not call it a smack-down. But the candidates were introduced by Wolf Blitzer, the moderator, in a way that made you expect to hear about their height and college (as in: "At 6-foot-6, from North Carolina ...")
And the announcer did say: "Eight candidates. One stage. One chance to take part in a groundbreaking debate."
6:48 P.M. | Republicans Meet in Florida for Tea Party Debate
Just days after a debate in California, the eight Republican presidential candidates will square off again tonight at a forum in Tampa, Fla.
On the agenda: an expected clash over Social Security as Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, refuses to back away from calling the retirement program a "Ponzi scheme." Mr. Perry's rivals have spent the weekend hammering him on the issue, which will probably take center stage tonight.
Also at play will be efforts by the other candidates to seize the spotlight from Mr. Perry and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. That is especially true for Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, whose campaign has faded since she won the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa last month.
Others on the stage will include Representative Ron Paul of Texas; Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah; Herman Cain, the former C.E.O. of Godfather's Pizza; Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker; and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.
One thing that could be different tonight? The debate is being jointly sponsored by CNN and the Tea Party Express. The moderator, CNN's Wolf Blitzer, will be asking some questions submitted by Tea Party members - a move that could inject a different feel into the exchange.

HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Perry adopted a very different tone on the entitlement program than he did in his book "Fed Up" just a year ago and other checks on the candidates' statements.

 BODY:
Perry Debates Himself on Social Security
As Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was assailed by some rivals for the Republican presidential nomination at Monday night's debate for his misleading claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme, he also seemed to be debating himself at times.
Mr. Perry used the debate to talk about the need to shore up Social Security, which politicians on the left and the right agree is needed if the program is to be able to continue paying out full benefits a quarter of a century from now. But in making his case, Mr. Perry both exaggerated the problems facing Social Security and adopted a very different tone than he did in his book "Fed Up" just a year ago, in which he described Social Security as a failure that "we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now."
At the debate, Mr. Perry said Social Security had to be fixed so that "our children actually know that there's going to be a retirement program there for them."
But in the past, as Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, correctly pointed out, Mr. Perry has repeatedly suggested that Social Security, which pays benefits to 56 million Americans, is undesirable, and that it may even be unconstitutional. 
In "Fed Up" (Little, Brown and Company, 2010), Mr. Perry wrote that "by any measure, Social Security is a failure." He described it as "a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal, in stark contrast to the mythical notion of salvation to which it has wrongly been attached for too long, all at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government." Promoting the book on MSNBC last November, Mr. Perry asked: "Why is the federal government even in the pension program or the health care delivery program? Let the states do it."
When pressed on those statements by Mr. Romney, Mr. Perry responded: "If what you're trying to say is back in the '30s and the '40s that the federal government made all the right decisions, I disagree with it." As the audience of Tea Party activists applauded, he continued: "It's time for us to get back to the Constitution. And a program that's been there 70 or 80 years, obviously we're not going to take that program away."
Mr. Perry countered that Mr. Romney had used tough words for Social Security in his own book, "No Apology."
"You said if people did it in the private sector it would be called criminal,'' Mr. Perry told Mr. Romney. "That's in your book."
In the section he was apparently referring to, Mr. Romney was criticizing Congress for spending the Social Security surplus on other things. He asks what would happen if a private bank administering a trust fund did the same thing, and answers, "They would go to jail."
Mr. Perry repeated his description of Social Security as a Ponzi scheme.
"It has been called a Ponzi scheme by many people long before me," he said.
But while there are some superficial similarities, it is ultimately a misleading exaggeration to describe Social Security as a Ponzi scheme.
Charles Ponzi was a Boston con man who promised investors impossibly high interest rates in the 1920s, and who paid off his early investors by taking money from later investors - a pyramid scheme that can work only if an ever-increasing pool of investors puts in money.
Social Security, by contrast, is a pay-as-you-go retirement system by design. Current workers and employers pay taxes that are used to pay benefits to current retirees. For many years, the program took in more money than it paid out, and invested the surplus - the "Social Security trust fund" - in treasuries. In 2010, Social Security began paying out more in benefits than it received in taxes. As more baby boomers retire, and there is a shortage of new workers, that shortfall is expected to grow.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated last month that the combined Social Security trust funds would be exhausted in 2038. There are a number of steps that could be taken before then to keep the program sustainable, like raising taxes, reducing benefits by raising the retirement age, or reducing cost-of-living increases. But if nothing happens by then, forecasts show that Social Security will not have enough money to pay its promised benefits in full. But the money will not dry up: Even if that happens, the budget office found, tax collections will still be sufficient to pay 81 percent of the promised benefits.
The Social Security Administration issued a briefing paper in 2009 noting the differences between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme. "There is a superficial analogy between pyramid or Ponzi schemes and pay-as-you-go programs in that in both money from later participants goes to pay the benefits of earlier participants,'' it wrote. "But that is where the similarity ends."
The paper noted that a program with 40 million people receiving benefits, and 40 million people paying taxes, could be sustained forever. "It does not require a doubling of participants every time a payment is made to a current beneficiary, or a geometric increase in the number of participants,'' it found.
Mr. Perry spoke approvingly Monday night about how some municipalities in Texas had opted out of Social Security, saying that they got a better deal. But that is for their government employees. It is not clear what his vision of letting states handle retirement programs would mean for private-sector workers.
And opting out is not always a good idea: when the city of Central Falls, R.I., filed for bankruptcy this year, it moved to cut the pensions of its police officers and firefighters by as much as half - and, since they had opted out of Social Security, many have no other income to rely on.
Mr. Perry spoke about the need to fix Social Security for "kids that are my children's age." In the past, when he suggested that Social Security might not be there for his children, the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal think tank, wrote him a letter noting that the program is projected to have enough money to pay more than 80 percent of its benefits after 2038 even if its trust funds are exhausted then. "This means, for example, that if your children - currently 28 and 25, respectively - were to retire at age 67 and do as well as you have in their working careers, they would receive $38,145 and $39,410 (in 2011 dollars) each, every year, for the rest of their lives,'' the letter said. "It is clearly inaccurate to say that this program will not exist for young people." 
Bachmann and Medicare
Michele Bachmann, asked about Social Security and Medicare, said, "We know President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare."
This is a distortion of the health care law passed last year. In its effort to stem the inexorable rise of Medicare spending, the law carves out $500 billion in savings over 10 years, through a combination of higher Medicare payroll taxes and reduced payments to providers.
Those savings were credited toward expanding health care to those who are currently uninsured. Although it's roughly correct to say $500 billion was shifted from the Medicare program to the new health care program, it's a stretch to say the money was "stolen,'' especially since the Medicare savings were also adopted in the budget that House Republicans passed earlier this year (but the Senate rejected).
Jobs Created by Stimulus Bill
Like most of the Republican candidates, Mr. Perry takes a dim view of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was championed by President Obama and approved by Congress in 2009. The stimulus bill, Mr. Perry said Monday night, has "created zero jobs." But the reality is more complicated.
There is no question that Mr. Obama is presiding over a period of profound economic misery and high unemployment. Since Mr. Obama became president in January 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country has lost 1.7 million jobs. And while the president's advisers had once predicted that the stimulus bill would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent, they were wrong: According to the Department of Labor, it is now at 9.1 percent, a level the White House believes will not abate before the end of next year.
But without the federal stimulus bill the situation would probably be worse, most fiscal and budget analysts, including many Wall Street firms, agree.
According to data collected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the stimulus bill, between its passage in February 2009 and June 2011, has increased the number of people employed by 1 million to 2.9 million, figures that include jobs created and jobs preserved.
Moreover, while the stimulatory effect of the bill peaked in 2010 and is now declining, according to the research, it is still preserving jobs that might otherwise be lost. And during the second quarter of 2011, the bill raised real gross domestic product by 0.8 percent to 2.5 percent.
The bill has proved somewhat more expensive than originally estimated, however, with a total budget impact of about $825 billion over 10 years rather than $787 billion. 
Bringing the Troops Home From Afghanistan 
In response to a question about protecting women and children from the "radicals" in Afghanistan, both Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Perry agreed that the United States, which saw a huge ramp up in troop levels in 2009 and 2010, should bring troops home. They agreed that the solution is "to make sure that the Afghan people increasingly take responsibility for their security going forward," as Mr. Huntsman said.
Mr. Perry, in particular, seemed to be far more emphatic about the need to bring troops home than he was less than a month ago, when he was quoted in an Associated Press story about the need to "start having a thoughtful conversation with those commanders in the field about how to be bringing our young men and women back." He added then, according to the A.P., that "the president made a huge mistake by signaling the enemy that we're going to leave at a particular time. That's bad public policy, but more importantly it put our kids in harm's way."
But in Monday's debate he appeared to be much more unequivocal, saying "the best way for us to be able to impact that country is to make a transition to where that country's military is going to be taking care of their people, bring our young men and women home, and continue to help them build the infrastructure that they need, whether it's schools for young women like yourself or otherwise." The last part of his comment was a reference to the Afghan immigrant who had asked a question during the debate.
While NATO's efforts in Afghanistan are widely seen as a failure by many Americans and Europeans (who have played a larger role there than in the occupation of Iraq) there is little hope the country's own security forces, whose attrition rates are high and who have little participation by ethnic Pashtuns in the most crucial and war-torn areas, can control the insurgency without enormous support from Western forces.
The Taliban is overwhelmingly made up of Pashtuns, who dominate the country's east and south, and a combination of sympathy and fear has made it all but impossible to recruit and deploy Pashtun troops into many of these areas. While Pashtuns make up only a little more than 40 percent of the country's population, the remaining major ethnic groups are viewed warily in Pashtun areas and there are great concerns about how effective troops made up of these groups can be and how much support they will ever get from Pashtun locals.
The Hazara, the Shiite minority who were long disadvantaged and oppressed by the country's Pashtun rulers but who now have disproportionate over-representation in the Afghan security forces in Pashtun areas, are viewed with particular suspicion. And the fear is very mutual, as memories of massacres at the hands of the Taliban remain fresh in the minds of many Hazara.
For sure, many Pashtun even in rural areas have no love of the Taliban, but the problem is that, compared with the Western-backed and hopelessly corrupt and feckless Afghan government, many Afghans see the Talibs as a less-worse alternative for how to order society. While they may be considered "radicals" to many in the country -- especially regarding the treatment of women -- they are also seen by many others as less corrupt than the NATO-backed official government, and better at resolving important everyday disputes in the Pashtun countryside, such as over land ownership, a common issue that splits families and tribes.
As for Governor Perry's hope that lots of schools and infrastructure will be built, that is optimistic. Despite funneling tens of billions of NATO dollars into the country in the past decade, little serious non-military infrastructure has been erected in the country's Pashtun areas, and much of the Western aid money has been diverted to warlords, Afghan political leaders and power brokers, and to the insurgency.
In recent years the Talibs have shut down schools and brutally discouraged women's education, sometimes throwing acid on schoolgirls on the way to classes. It is hard to see how that changes for the better anytime soon.
One exception has been in the country's Hazara heartland as well as in Hazara-dominated western Kabul, where boys and girls have been receiving educations the past half-dozen years that their parents could never have imagined when the Taliban ruled the country, vaulting Hazara students far ahead of Pashtuns in terms of success at college qualifying examinations and other yardsticks. The Hazara are fearful of what will happen after NATO forces leave, and whether their gains will be wiped away. 
Health Care Payment Advisory Board
Mr. Romney said the federal health care legislation championed by President Obama would ultimately lead to panels that dictate to people what kind of health care they can get.
While it is not clear precisely what panel Mr. Romney was referring to, the health care law did create the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is tasked with slowing the growth in Medicare costs, and the board has drawn criticism from many Republicans and some Democrats for taking too much power away from lawmakers.
The board will consist of 15 voting members drawn from among physicians, other health professionals and experts in health care finance and delivery, nominated by the president and approved by the Senate.
But while the board does have the power, starting in 2015, to propose specific cuts to Medicare if spending appears likely to exceed projected levels in any given year, those proposals are not binding on Congress, though the law makes it relatively hard to overrule the recommendations. And the law spells out that the board's recommendations "shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums." 
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad
Mr. Paul said the United States Embassy in Baghdad cost $1 billion and was bigger than the Vatican. Almost. The Congressional Research Service says the final cost was $736 million (a $140 million cost overrun). The embassy compound covers 104 acres; Vatican City covers about 110 acres. 
 Energy Consumption
Mr. Romney repeated his line, "We're an energy-rich nation, but we're living like an energy-poor nation." He has never quite explained what he means by this, but the United States consumes more energy per capita than any nation on earth outside the Persian Gulf. - 
Rick Perry's Contributions From Merck
Mr. Perry's rivals pounced with a vicious fervor on his decision (later withdrawn) to require young girls in his state to receive inoculations against the virus that can cause cervical cancer. During the exchange, Mrs. Bachmann reminded the audience that Mr. Perry's former chief of staff was a lobbyist for Merck, which manufactures the vaccine, and that Mr. Perry got campaign contributions from the drug maker. Mr. Perry said the contribution was for $5,000, adding, "If you're saying I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended." 
But a look at campaign finance reports shows Merck (courtesy of Merck PAC) has donated given almost $30,000 to Mr. Perry in the past 10 years.

HEADLINE: Social Status and How the Elected Vote

BYLINE: JOHN SIDES


HIGHLIGHT: Members of Congress from certain occupational groups tend to skew policies toward members of their own social class, research suggests. 

 BODY:
John Edwards's $400 haircut. Senator John McCain's apparently uncountable houses. President Obama's vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Most recently, Mitt Romney's home renovations. These things suggest that many, if not most, politicians at the federal level come from the upper social classes. Certainly they are much wealthier than the average American. But does the social class of elected leaders actually affect how they vote?
Nicholas Carnes, a political scientist at Duke University, finds that it does. In this forthcoming paper, he studied the connection between the occupational backgrounds of members of Congress from 1901 to 1996 and their voting behavior. Occupational backgrounds have proven to be stronger predictors of many political attitudes than other markers of class, like education and income. (The data he draws upon are here.) He uses a simple seven-category typology: farm owners, businesspeople, other private-sector professionals (like doctors), lawyers, politicians, service-based professionals (like teachers), and workers (industrial, farm and union).
As one might imagine, people from working-class backgrounds were only a small minority during this period. In fact, except for the growing representation of politicians at the expense of lawyers - a shift that derives in part from changes in how the data was coded rather than anything substantive - the occupational backgrounds of members of the House have been remarkably stable.
How does this matter? Using one measure of the ideology of House members - DW-NOMINATE scores - Mr. Carnes estimates that the gap between representatives who entered Congress as workers and those who entered as businesspeople is approximately 10 points on a 100-point scale. A measure of voting behavior, scores awarded by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., showed even larger occupational disparities. On a 0-100 scale where 0 indicates preferences closer to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s, workers scored about 20 on average, while service-based professionals scored about 35 and businesspeople about 55.
Furthermore, these disparities were largely stable across decades and are apparent among many subgroups of legislators - Democrats, Republicans, men, women, representatives in safe seats and swing seats, representatives who represent larger and smaller numbers of working-class people, and so forth.
Tracing the policy implications of these disparities is tricky. But Mr. Carnes suggests that the effects could be meaningful:
For instance, while the average member of Congress in my sample voted with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. approximately 56 percent of the time if the class composition of Congress were identical to that of the nation as a whole, the average member would have supported the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s position between 59 percent ... and 69 percent of the time which translates into approximately one to three more major progressive economic policies in each Congress (assuming that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. supports approximately two dozen bills every two years).
In Larry Bartels's book Unequal Democracy, he finds that the voting behavior of senators is much more closely tied to the views of their upper-class constituents than their middle-class or working-class ones. One reason could be that upper-class people are more likely to vote, donate to politicians and contact them to express their opinions. But Mr. Bartels's results persist even when controlling for the views of actual voters and those who have contacted their representatives. Mr. Carnes's findings suggest another explanation: members of Congress vote as upper-class people would want them to because members of Congress tend to be upper class themselves.
Increasing the representation of lower and working classes in Congress is no easy feat. As Mr. Carnes notes, their under representation precedes the growth of campaign spending and existed when parties largely controlled the nominations process and when they had less influence. But here is one possibility. The literature on the underrepresentation of women in political office centers on their lack of political ambition and the failure of political elites to recruit them. It may be time to study the underrepresentation of certain social classes in the same way.

HEADLINE: Rental Car Roulette

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Travelers who rent cars frequently may wonder why the same four-door midsize sedan has a drastically different price tag depending on where the car is rented.
The cost of doing business in different markets is a big factor -- including labor, real estate and the price to insure a fleet of cars. Varying tax rates can also affect the final bill, especially in places that levy special taxes on car rentals.
But the number of car rental companies that serve a particular market also plays a significant role in price. And competition is a growing issue as the industry consolidates and leaves just a few dominant companies that each own several car rental brands. 
Jonathan Weinberg, president of the car rental agency AutoSlash.com, analyzed September midweek rentals booked through the site and found customers were paying about $97 a day in New York City, including taxes, versus $40 in Las Vegas and $45 in Miami and Los Angeles.
''In somewhere like Los Angeles, you have so many different vendors at the airport, and many are low-priced value providers,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''There's so much competition for customers, it tends to drive prices down.''
In Miami, which recently built a combined rental car center near the airport, 16 companies compete for customers, including more than half a dozen discounters like Payless, Advantage, E-Z Rent-a-Car and Ace. Being in the same place puts the low-priced providers on more of a level playing field, since travelers take the same bus to get to the building and do not have to wait longer for a company that cannot afford frequent bus service. A new train running from the Miami airport to the rental car center replaced the bus last week.
Another competitor in Miami is Sixt -- a German company that has locations worldwide but is just gaining a toehold in the United States.
''The new consolidated Miami rental facility provided Sixt an opportunity to get in there,'' Mr. Weinberg said. Other cities that have at least 11 car rental companies at their airports include Los Angeles, Phoenix and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., whereas there are only six companies at Kennedy International Airport in New York, all major brands.
Richard Broome, a senior vice president with Hertz, acknowledged that the company reacted to rates set by competitors, especially the discounters that compete with Hertz's Advantage brand.
''The more competitors you have in a market at an airport, the more pricing competition you would expect,'' Mr. Broome said, though he also cited operational costs and basic supply-and-demand issues as rate factors.
''The price to rent a car in Denver around President's weekend will typically be more expensive than to rent that same car in Cleveland,'' he said.
Local taxes are another important variable in price differences -- and one that has been getting more scrutiny as the travel industry fights municipalities that tax visitors to help pay for new stadiums and other projects that do not necessarily benefit travelers.
A study of travel taxes published this spring by the Global Business Travel Association, an association of travel managers, found that Chicago O'Hare, Boston Logan, Las Vegas McCarran and Kennedy airports levied the highest taxes on car rentals -- adding 20 to 25 percent to the base price of the car.
Despite this growing tax bite, one bit of good news for travelers is that car rental rates have actually declined from their 2009 peak.
''It's not like the price of a car is dropping through the floor -- it isn't,'' said Neil Abrams, president of the Abrams Consulting Group, which advises car rental companies. ''Rates are below what they were, but are still relatively high on a comparative basis.''
According to the group's weekly survey of rental prices, the average rate for a midsize car at 10 major airports in mid-August, for example, was $85, not including taxes or fees, compared with $93 at the same time last year. In 2009, the price was $103, roughly the high point for rates in the decade the survey has tracked prices charged by the major car rental brands. (The Abrams index does not include discounters like Payless.)
The reason for the recent price decline is not weak demand: Avis Budget, Dollar Thrifty and Hertz all reported positive earnings in the second quarter of 2011, in part because of increases in rental days. But with a strong market for used cars, rental companies have been making money selling their older vehicles, so they have not set prices as aggressively as they did when the recession hit.
''There's an incentive to buy cars, maybe even more cars than you can rent at an optimum price because you know you're going to make a lot of money at the back end,'' Mr. Abrams said. ''That has a muting effect on rental pricing.''
As for the effect of competition on pricing, Mr. Abrams said that even with more airports building consolidated rental car centers, discounters like Payless or Fox Rent a Car faced challenges in capturing corporate clients. ''Fox isn't in Detroit, they're not in Boston, and they're not in Miami or Atlanta,'' he said. ''If you're a corporate customer, and you've got people traveling all over the place, you can't use a supplier that can't meet your employees' needs.''
But business travelers renting through corporate accounts have been somewhat shielded from sticker shock by discounted rates. Ovation Corporate Travel clients, for instance, paid an average of $81 a day for a rental car in New York City in the first half of 2011 and $40 in Las Vegas. Those prices include taxes, fees and options like navigation systems.
For those who do not benefit from a corporate discount, one way to save is checking to see if the price has dropped after making a reservation, or booking through a site like AutoSlash, which does this automatically.
''Rates start out very high, and then they tend to come down as the rental day approaches,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''We see rental prices fluctuating wildly.''

HEADLINE: Bringing Home Ec Back to the Classroom

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a former home economics teacher, I say bravo to Helen Zoe Veit (''Time to Revive Home Ec,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 6). 
During the 20 years I taught home economics in both junior and senior high school, I made it a priority to teach healthy eating habits. My students always prepared dishes that were nutritious and easy for them to cook.
Fresh fruits and vegetables were included in these lessons whenever possible, and we frequently discussed the hazards of including too much salt, sugar and fat in the diet.
These students often returned during their college years to thank me for teaching them these skills.
I was disheartened when home economics was eliminated from the curriculum in many New York school systems.
Most children are no longer taught how to cook at home and therefore do not have the tools to help them make good food choices.
Bringing home economics back to the classroom would be a huge step toward educating our population about the hazards of obesity while teaching them to eat responsibly.
AUDREY MANNERS Nantucket, Mass., Sept. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
Helen Zoe Veit makes great points, but the sole focus on food covers such a tiny piece of the picture.
The benefits of teaching adolescents basic healthy cooking and nutrition are hard to overstate, but living as an adult encompasses so much more that's glossed over, if mentioned at all, in high school or college and by many parents who may never have learned the ins and outs themselves.
The core components of modern home ec should be what to expect in the world of college loans and grants, your first bills, managing personal health care, budgeting, taxes, job application strategies (including interview etiquette), civic responsibilities and resources, and even some basic parenting skills.
If the purpose of high school is to provide students with the minimum level of literacy needed for a fighting chance as an adult, that should absolutely include both academic and practical skills.
T'SERA MINGST-BELCHER Jersey City, Sept. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
Cheers for ''Time to Revive Home Ec''! This was a summer of breakthrough achievement for our 8-year-old granddaughter. She learned not only to ride a bike but also to scramble her own eggs. I do believe that she took even more satisfaction in cooking her own breakfast than in showing off her cycling skills.

HEADLINE: Ideas From Outsiders Help a Bank Trim Jobs and Cut Costs

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
As Bank of America executives prepared last week to announce the first phase of their turnaround plan, a group of consultants hurried to complete their recommendations for the overhaul, called Project New BAC.
The 44 senior bank managers and roughly two dozen consultants assigned to the initiative worked through lunch, barely pausing to enjoy the pepperoni, sausage and vegetarian pies that had been ordered from a pizzeria.
On Monday, the bank's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, unveiled the broad strokes of their five-month effort, announcing plans to eliminate 30,000 jobs and cut annual costs by $5 billion over the next three years. 
''We don't have to be the biggest company out there. We have to be the best,'' Mr. Moynihan said.
The consulting firms enlisted to help with Project New BAC - EHS Partners and the Promontory Financial Group - are what are known in the industry as bank doctors. Financial firms often turn to these specialists in periods of crisis, seeking out their recommendations on deep and wide-ranging cuts to bolster revenue and eliminate unnecessary expenses.
The idea is that outsiders can find thousands of small savings and inefficient processes that insiders may miss.
Promontory and EHS both have long ties to Bank of America, and to each other.
Eric Holder, who is leading EHS's work on Project New BAC, and Neil Smith, Promontory's head consultant on the project, were both members of a team from Tandon Capital Associates that helped the Fleet Financial Group with a similar effort in 1994.
On that project, called Fleet Focus '94, Mr. Holder and Mr. Smith worked with a team of 50 internal managers known inside the bank as the ''Nifty 50.'' One of those 50 managers was a budding young lawyer named Brian T. Moynihan.
At Fleet, the consultants recommended cutting Styrofoam coffee cups that cost the company $48,000 a year. Name-brand toner for Fleet's laser printers was replaced with a generic toner to save $200,000 a year.
In all, Fleet cut annual costs by $300 million and laid off 3,000 workers. The changes helped Fleet's bottom line and set the stage for an eventual takeover. In 2004, it was acquired by Bank of America for about $48 billion in stock, at the time one of the largest bank mergers in history.
In 1999, Mr. Holder, Mr. Smith and another consultant, Jeremy D. Eden, started their own firm, EHS Partners. They worked on cost-cutting for institutions including Mellon Financial, the PNC Financial Services Group and the Union Bank of California.
But in 2009, Mr. Smith left EHS to start a rival team at Promontory Financial, a large consulting firm that specializes in regulatory and legal work and that helped Morgan Stanley revamp itself as a bank holding company after the financial crisis.
A person with knowledge of the companies who spoke anonymously to avoid angering the firms described Mr. Smith's split from Mr. Holder as an acrimonious divorce that capped years of tension between the men, making their joint assignment on Bank of America all the more unlikely.
''I can't even imagine how that works,'' the person said. ''When you think about the importance of figuring out Bank of America's issues, that's hard enough. To add another level of complexity with the consultants working out their own issues is another thing.''
Promontory and EHS declined to comment on their relationship. Bank of America declined to comment on the two firms, and a spokesman said many of the changes made in Project New BAC had come from bank employees rather than from outside consultants.
Since Project New BAC was announced last spring, Mr. Holder's team from EHS; Mr. Smith's team, Promontory Growth and Innovation; and another team from Promontory that is focusing on regulatory issues have been working four days a week from the bank's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., camping out in cubicles on the seventh floor.
The Bank of America managers assigned to work on the project full time have led small teams of bank managers in a division-by-division review of operations. In phase one, roughly 150,000 ideas were submitted by Bank of America employees, and the best were presented to Mr. Moynihan and his management team.
Consultant-led reform programs are common in banking, especially in the case of a company that, like Bank of America, has grown rapidly through mergers and acquisitions. When done correctly, the recommendations can trim fat and make a bank more competitive.
''For a larger bank with so many acquisitions in the past, it makes sense to have someone come look at the process and the overlaps,'' said Jefferson Harralson, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods.
The process can be painful. One project led by EHS, a 1999 revamp of the Union Bank of California that was called ''Mission Excel,'' saved the bank hundreds of millions of dollars and increased profits. But those savings included cutting 1,400 jobs, and the project was reportedly renamed ''Mission Expel'' by some employees.
''Barnacles grow on a bank, and it's good to have an outsider come scrape them off,'' said Charles Wendel, president of Financial Institutions Consulting. ''But one of the great cliches is that you can't shrink your way to greatness.''
After submitting their final recommendations, the team of consultants and company employees shared drinks on Thursday on a terrace at Bank of America's headquarters. Mr. Moynihan thanked them for their hard work, which in some cases included relocating temporarily to Charlotte.
But their job is far from over. The first phase focused on Bank of America's retail side, where many of the most obvious cuts were made. In the next phase, which is expected to begin in late October, EHS and Promontory will look at the commercial banking and wealth management divisions.
''They're pulling the lower hanging fruit first,'' said Mr. Harralson. ''There's more to come.''

HEADLINE: German Auto Show Combats the Gloom

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- There may be no better cure for a banker suffering the sovereign debt blues than a new Porsche, and few cities with more bankers in need of solace than Frankfurt.
So it is all too fitting that the biannual Frankfurt Motor Show, which opens its doors this week, is defying the euro crisis with dozens of new models, including the latest incarnation of the Porsche 911.
But even as BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and others boast new sales records and roll out important new models, car executives are looking warily in the rearview mirror. They are wondering whether they, too, will be overtaken by the same forces that are pushing down growth on the Continent and raising fears about the future of the euro. 
Makers of luxury cars, a category that also includes VW's highly profitable Audi unit, may be particularly vulnerable to the side effects of global financial turmoil.
''What we learned in the last crisis in 2008 is that the customers of premium carmakers react much faster than other customers,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. ''They lose money in stock markets and they will be cautious about buying new products.''
There is likely to be little overt sign of such worries at the Frankfurt show, which opens to the public Thursday and runs through Sept. 25. Set on vast exhibition grounds just a short drive from the sovereign debt crisis response center -- also known as the European Central Bank -- the show will offer a visual antidote to the gloom that permeates nearby bank office buildings.
Because of its size, and because it is held only every other year, the Frankfurt show is an especially big event for the German companies, and they can be expected to stage lavish displays.
Despite the slack U.S. economy and a marked slowdown in the pace of European growth in recent months, carmakers continue to report sales records. Porsche said Monday that it recorded its best August ever, delivering more than 9,000 vehicles, a 43 percent increase compared with August 2010.
Ford, which has its European headquarters and a major factory in Cologne, said Monday that it had its best August in Europe since 1998, with sales up 19 percent from a year earlier, to 72,200 vehicles. Ford sales from January through August, however, are down 2 percent in Europe, and the company hinted at the risk of a slowdown.
''The economy remains very challenging and consumers are jittery -- particularly in the euro zone,'' Stephen Odell, chief executive of Ford of Europe, said in a statement. He added, ''We remain optimistic.''
As Mr. Odell suggested, one of the ways the debt crisis can spread to the auto industry is via consumer confidence. If people are afraid of losing their jobs, they are unlikely to make major purchases.
''There is huge anxiety about job security and people have less money in their pockets,'' said Tim Urquhart, an analyst at IHS Automotive.
Another way that the debt crisis can infect the car market is through banks. They are under pressure from investors and regulators to preserve cash so that they can absorb losses on their holdings of government bonds. The retrenchment could make it more difficult for some potential buyers to get car loans.
During the recession of 2009, carmakers recovered quickly because of extraordinary demand from newly affluent Chinese. Some manufacturers saw sales in China nearly double, and China became Volkswagen's largest market. But growth there is slowing, and will probably not shield the companies from declines in the United States and Europe again.
''You're not going to get the massive 20 to 30 percent increases we were getting last year, that can't happen indefinitely,'' Mr. Urquhart said.
Nor will debt-challenged governments be able to repeat the cash-for-clunkers programs and other stimulus measures they provided to keep car factories open. Those programs preserved jobs but also meant that Europe avoided a reduction in carmaking capacity that some analysts say is overdue.
This time, the reckoning will be harder to avoid. Particularly vulnerable will be mass-market carmakers like Renault, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Fiat, which are dependent on their domestic European markets. Fiat faces the added problem that in its home market, Italy, the government is drastically cutting spending to restore confidence in its ability to repay its debt.
Car executives, not wanting to spoil the mood in Frankfurt, would rather talk about their stylish new models than about economic peril. But there is even a hint of austerity in the new products. Lightweight construction and fuel economy are big themes this year, partly for environmental and regulatory reasons but also because of high fuel prices.
Fuel efficiency, combined with style and a little bit of fun, is a main selling point for some of the most closely watched new models, including the VW Up; the Fiat Panda (a popular four-door hatchback); and a coupe version of the BMW Mini.
Even the 911 guzzles markedly less fuel than its predecessors. The new 911 is 45 kilograms, or 100 pounds, lighter than the previous version, because of increased use of aluminum in place of steel in the body. It uses a third as much fuel than the original 911 from 1963, yet has more than double the horsepower, according to Mr. Dudenhoffer of the University of Duisburg-Essen.
Having just gone through one financial crisis, the carmakers may avoid some of the mistakes they made last time. For example, Mr. Dudenhoffer said, companies have followed more prudent leasing policies. If drivers return their leased vehicles en masse like they did several years ago, companies like BMW and Mercedes should not be stuck with lots full of cars that can only be sold at a loss.
But the downturn is coming on more quickly than expected, and there has not been much time to get ready.
Said Mr. Urquhart of IHS Automotive, ''I don't see anyone who is invulnerable.''

HEADLINE: Her Bank Got Enough Help When It Was in Trouble. She Didn't.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For those who live in the alternate universe that is New York outside of Manhattan, brownstone Brooklyn and assorted upper-income offshoots, Mimi Pierre Johnson's story is depressingly familiar.
She and her husband bought their four-bedroom home in Elmont, on Long Island, for $413,000 in 2005. Then the recession blew in. Her husband lost his construction job, her real estate work slowed and their boiler wheezed and died. Their once-reasonable mortgage resembled a forbidding mountain.
She dialed her bank, JPMorgan Chase, seeking a lifeline. The bank gave her a temporary modification, but then canceled it. It lost her documents. It did not return her calls. Late fees and lawyer bills piled up. ''I'm a Realtor; I know I'm doomed,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''But I want to say to Chase, 'Hello!? The government gave you a bailout to help people like me.' '' 
Here, Ms. Johnson is mistaken. Presidents George W. Bush and Obama spent more than $1 trillion in taxpayer money to bail out our largest banks and corporations. But they exacted no quid pro quo. JPMorgan Chase has recorded splendid profits and has no obligation to bail out hundreds of thousands of homeowners facing dispossession.
Instead, the battle to hold JPMorgan Chase -- and its brothers in government-supported finance -- accountable has fallen to state and city officials. Some in New York sound eager for a rumble (the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has taken a tough line, seeking piles of documents from banks, including JPMorgan Chase).
Pitchforks, too, are raised by movements like the one that Ms. Johnson has enlisted in, New York Communities for Change. Run by the reconstituted remnants of Acorn (a community organizing group laid low by conservative dirty tricksters and its own missteps), the group has joined with unions to lobby towns and cities to close accounts with Chase, unless the bank begins to write down mortgages.
This campaign has a mouse-that-roared quality. The villages of Hempstead and Freeport withdrew millions of dollars. Ithaca barred the bank from bond offerings.
JPMorgan Chase measures its assets in trillions. This is no threat.
Yet bank officials are quick to jump on the telephone. When the floods of Tropical Storm Irene recede, Binghamton, a city of almost 50,000, is expected to vote to withdraw tens of millions of dollars from Chase. In other words, a toothache could get worse.
JPMorgan Chase officials offer an indignant defense. Mistakes were made, but they were not the worst offenders.
Push housing advocates, and they concede this point. Wells Fargo and Bank of America -- which announced 30,000 layoffs on Monday -- are horses running neck and neck with Chase.
But Joseph Sanders of Staten Island Legal Services would make a poor character witness. ''I can't honestly say Chase is head and shoulders worse,'' he said. ''They are just right near the top of a clueless group.''
The Obama administration runs a mortgage relief program that has fallen vastly short of its goals. Treasury officials finally have stiffened, grading banks and withholding incentive payments. In the last quarter, two truants sat in the worst category: JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
Chase officials offer careful throat-clearing. ''We continue to make significant improvements to our processes and controls,'' said Thomas A. Kelly, a company spokesman. ''We expect future scorecards will reflect that.''
Mr. Schneiderman has refused to sign off on an agreement that would exempt banks from prosecution in exchange for $20 billion in mortgage relief. (The nation's 49 other attorneys general recently tossed Mr. Schneiderman off their executive committee.) But New York City officials, who control tens of millions of dollars in bank accounts and lucrative bonding businesses, have tossed rose petals at JPMorgan Chase. Their view is that banks are to New York what the auto industry was to Detroit.
The city comptroller, John C. Liu, recently pushed the city's Banking Commission to require banks to disclose mortgage modifications and foreclosures, with breakdowns by economic class. Mayoral appointees on the commission rejected the idea.
Ms. Johnson lives just east of the city line. Not long ago, she flew to Florida to tend to her critically ill mother. She missed her final modification payment by a few days, and the bank canceled it. She begged. ''They told me, 'Mrs. Johnson, if we did it for you, we'd have to do it for thousands of people.' ''
Which, after all, is the point.

HEADLINE: In Florida, 9/11 Tribute Is Shaped by Recession

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. -- Like so much else in Florida these days, the ambitious and touching Sept. 11 memorial in this small town was jolted hard by the recession. 
The memorial began small, with a request in 2004 for a chunk of steel from the remnants of the twin towers and the idea of a modest, but fitting tribute. It grew large, with 11 tons of marble for one sculpture and sheets and sheets of steel for four others. Then it turned even larger, with requests for a $1 million, air-conditioned glass building to house the expansive artworks.
But reality -- and the few choice words of a Pembroke Pines commissioner and taxpayers who balked at the cost -- finally took hold. In the end, the memorial, unveiled Sunday, is a testament to tragedy, courage and perseverance -- but also to compromise and common sense: the steel and marble sculptures stand under a gazebo, at a cost of $167,000, which it is hoped will be repaid through donations.
''This was designed to be delivered to the residents of Pembroke Pines at no cost to them,'' said Angelo Castillo, a city commissioner here and recent New York City transplant who asked Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York for a piece of steel. ''And my original concept was much more modest.''
''Sometimes it was difficult,'' Mr. Castillo admitted, ''but what we have here, at the end of the day, is something spectacular.''
Those who crowded the gazebo after the ceremony could not have agreed more. In their view, the cost and controversy are irrelevant.
''It's a moot point,'' said Elizabeth Ennis, 44, a physician's assistant who lives here. ''It's a statement from the community that we stand together.''
Four towering steel pieces form a ring inside the gazebo: One is a massive three-dimensional New York City firefighter, his jacket flapping in the wind. He is straddled by jagged towers of steel, representing the World Trade Center. Across, the figure of a girl stares resolutely from the top of a pile of steel.
The city could not afford bronze so Felix Gonzalez, the sculptor, who is a retired Miami-Dade County firefighter, welded the steel. The materials were donated or came from discretionary county money. The artists, who spent years on the project, donated their time. (Mr. Gonzalez received a $20,000 stipend.)
''People came out to watch me make these at an abandoned firehouse on the edge of the Everglades,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''Firefighters from New York City stood there and cried and hugged me. It kept me going.''
In the center of the gazebo lies the four-sided marble sculpture, representing shock, grief, acceptance and rebuilding. Faceless forms cower, fall from the sky, pray, protect one another and then rise toward the sky. At the top, rests the chunk of steel from the twin towers.
''These people who died were bigger than life,'' said Benoit Menasche, the 74-year-old marble sculptor. ''How can I not give them something bigger than life?''

HEADLINE: Attacking the Obesity Epidemic by First Figuring Out Its Cause

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
If you have gained a lot of unwanted pounds at any time during the last 30-odd years, you may be relieved to know that you are probably not to blame. At least not entirely.
Many environmental forces, from economic interests of the food and beverage industries to the way our cities and towns are built, have conspired to subvert the body's natural ability to match calories in with calories out.
And the solution to the nation's most pressing health problem -- the ever-rising epidemic of overweight and obesity at all ages -- lies in the answer to this question: Why did this happen in the first place?
That is the conclusion of an impressive team of experts who spent the last two years examining obesity-promoting forces globally. They recently published their findings online in a series of reports in The Lancet. 
But as has happened with smoking, it will take many years, a slew of different tactics and the political will to overcome powerful lobbying by culpable industries to turn the problem around and begin to bring the prevalence of overweight and obesity back to the levels of the 1970s.
What Changed?
When I was growing up in the 1940s and '50s, I had to walk or bike many blocks to buy an ice cream cone. There were no vending machines dispensing candy and soda, and no fast-food emporiums or shopping malls with food courts. Nor were we constantly bombarded with televised commercials for prepared foods and drinks laden with calories of fats and sugars.
Yes, we kids had our milk and cookies after school, but then we went out to run around and play until dark. Television watching (through my father's business, my family acquired an early TV with a seven-inch screen) was mostly a weekend family affair, not a nightly ritual with constant noshing.
Most meals were prepared and eaten at home, even when both parents worked (as mine did). Eating out was a special event. ''Convenience'' foods were canned fruits and vegetables, not frozen lasagna or Tater Tots. A typical breakfast was hot or cold cereal sweetened with raisins or fresh fruit, not a Pop-Tart, jelly doughnut or 500-calorie bagel with 200 calories of cream cheese.
Before a mass exodus to the suburbs left hordes of Americans totally car-dependent, most people lived in cities and towns where feet served as a main means of transportation.
Since 1900, the energy requirements for daily life have decreased substantially with the advent of labor-saving devices and automobiles, yet American weights remained stable until the 1970s. Dr. Boyd A. Swinburn, an obesity researcher at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, and his co-authors in one Lancet paper call that decade the ''tipping point.''
As more women entered the work force, the food industry, noting a growing new market, mass-produced convenience foods with palate appeal. The foods were rich in sugar, salt and fat, substances that humans are evolutionarily programmed to crave.
''Women were spending a lot less time on food preparation, but the industry figured out ways to make food more readily available for everybody,'' Steven L. Gortmaker, a sociologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, said in an interview. ''The industry made it easier for people to consume more calories throughout the day.''
As Dr. Swinburn and his co-authors wrote, ''The 1970s saw a striking rise in the quantity of refined carbohydrates and fats in the U.S. food supply, which was paralleled by a sharp increase in the available calories and the onset of the obesity epidemic. Energy intake rose because of environmental push factors, i.e., increasingly available, cheap, tasty, highly promoted obesogenic foods.''
During a morning run in Ohio some years ago, I passed five fast-food and family restaurants in one long block, including one that advertised a ''Texas-size breakfast'' of three scrambled eggs, two fried potato cakes, a buttered croissant and a choice of three sausage links, three ounces of ham or four strips of bacon -- enough to produce a Texas-size heart attack, and for $1.99. Americans are not known for resisting such temptations, especially if money is tight.
The Lancet authors reported that to bring the weights of Americans back to 1978 levels, steep reductions in caloric intake are needed: about 240 calories a day less for the average person and double that amount for obese adults, whose body mass index is 35 or higher.
'Systems Approach' Needed
Several coordinated, complementary policies are needed to turn the epidemic around, Dr. Gortmaker and his co-authors wrote in one report. He pointed out that four interventions worked together to drive smoking rates down to 20 percent from 40 percent.
First, tobacco advertising was banned from television. Then tobacco taxes were increased, the nicotine patch became available and smoking was banned in more and more public places.
Just as the decline in smoking did not happen overnight, a reduction in the rates of overweight and obesity will take a while, Dr. Gortmaker said. He emphasized the importance of taking action immediately, before the increase in life expectancy that Americans have enjoyed is reversed by obesity-caused diseases.
He and his co-authors listed three of the most cost-saving and health-saving measures: a 10 percent tax on unhealthy foods and drinks (like sugar-sweetened beverages, a proposal defeated in New York State by industry pressure); more obvious nutrition labeling of packaged foods, like a red, yellow or green traffic light on package fronts; and reduced advertising of ''junk foods and beverages to children.''
''Marketing of food and beverages is associated with increasing obesity rates and is especially effective among children,'' they wrote. Dr. Gortmaker pointed out that ''very few children are born obese,'' but most American children grow up in an obesogenic environment. For those who become obese by age 10 or 11, he and his co-authors said, family-based programs are needed to keep overweight from carrying over into adulthood. (In Scotland recently, authorities went so far as to remove two children from a family that had failed to control the youngsters' girth.)
''Children aged 2 to 19 consume seven trillion calories of sugar-sweetened beverages a year. It's a $24 billion industry just for kids alone,'' Dr. Gortmaker said.
He called a tax on sugared drinks a ''no-brainer,'' noting that it could raise billions of dollars a year for cash-starved states. California, for example, could bring in $1.5 billion a year with a 1-cent-per-ounce excise tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, he said.
But Dr. Gortmaker and his co-authors noted, ''Almost all food policies recommended as priority actions, including front-of-pack traffic light labeling, have been heavily contested by the food industry.'' Although there has been some reduction in unhealthy food advertisements on children's television, the decline has been minimal.
Also needed -- and less controversial -- are school-based programs to encourage healthier eating and exercise habits and to reduce television watching, the authors said. Schools that introduce healthful foods in the classroom have shown that they are more likely to be eaten in the lunchroom and at home.
Of course, the rising overweight and obesity rate is not just an American problem. The effect is being seen globally, even in low- and middle-income countries. This month the United Nations General Assembly will focus on noncommunicable diseases, with the ''wicked problem'' (as Brian Head, a social scientist at the University of Queensland in Australia, put it) of the global obesity epidemic
front and center.

HEADLINE: Callahan Fills Drury's Role as Captain of Rangers

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Ryan Callahan was named the captain of the Rangers on Monday, succeeding Chris Drury, who retired in August after agreeing to a buyout from the team in June.
''He leads by example with courage and a tireless work ethic on and off the ice,'' General Manager Glen Sather said in a statement. 
Callahan, a Rochester native and an alternate captain the previous two seasons, had long been seen as a candidate to be the captain. But there was recent speculation that center Brad Richards would be named the captain, after he signed as a free agent in July in a nine-year, $58.8 million deal.
Richards was named an alternate captain Monday, and he and a current alternate, defenseman Marc Staal, will assist Callahan. Richards served as an alternate with his previous team, the Dallas Stars, as well as with the Tampa Bay Lightning, with whom he won a Stanley Cup under Rangers Coach John Tortorella in 2004.
Callahan becomes the Rangers' 26th captain. He has played five N.H.L. seasons, all with the Rangers, and he won a silver medal with the United States at the 2010 Olympics. Last season, he had career highs in goals (23), assists (25) and points (48) despite missing 22 games with injuries.
DEVILS RESTRUCTURING The owners of the Devils are restructuring some of their bank loans to facilitate the sale of the 47 percent share of the club held by Raymond Chambers and his company, Brick City L.L.C.
If the refinancing is completed in the next several weeks as expected, it will help resolve a thorny ownership struggle. Chambers and Jeff Vanderbeek, the team's other primary owner, have argued for months over the value of Chambers's stake. During that time, the team missed the playoffs and the economy slowed.
Forbes values the team at $218 million, the 11th-most valuable franchise in the N.H.L. The Devils were the most indebted team in the league, with debts worth 115 percent of the value of the club, Forbes said.
While the two sides continue to negotiate a price for the stake, lenders have extended a deadline by about 45 days for the team to make payments on a loan worth about $100 million.
''The Devils value their relation with their banks and are confident a refinancing will be completed shortly,'' the team said in a statement. ''As stated previously, ownership is close to finalizing an agreement that would lead to a buyout of Brick City's share of the company.''
The team denied a report in The New York Post on Monday that the team's bankers were prepared to push the Devils into bankruptcy. New season ticket sales are 130 percent higher than last year, the team added. KEN BELSON

HEADLINE: Two-Tier Pay Now the Way Detroit Works

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- They are a cornerstone of Chrysler's unlikely comeback: 900 employees turning out a Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle every 48 seconds of the working day at an assembly plant here.
Nothing distinguishes them from other workers at the Jefferson North plant, except their paychecks. The newest workers earn about $14 an hour; longtime employees earn double that.
With the economy slumping and job creation once again a pressing issue in the White House and Congress, the advent of a two-tier wage system in Detroit is spiking employment for one of the country's most important manufacturing industries. The new jobs, which are seen as long term, are being watched closely by economists, executives in other industries and Washington policy makers eager to increase employment in manufacturing and other areas.
For many, the opportunity for steady employment is welcome, even at a lower wage and with no certainty when it might increase. 
''Everybody is appreciative of a job and glad to be working,'' said Derrick Chatman, who makes $14.65 an hour putting tires on Jeeps after being laid off at Home Depot, working odd construction jobs and collecting unemployment.
What was once seen as a desperate move to prop up the struggling auto industry is now considered an integral part of its future. The demand for $14-an-hour manufacturing jobs is providing Detroit's Big Three automakers with a ready pool of eager new employees. Last year, Chrysler was flooded with inquiries about the jobs here. It froze the list after receiving 10,000 applications.
The companies say the two-tier wages are paying off. Despite the disparity, there is no appreciable difference in the Grand Cherokees produced on the shift dominated since last fall by the lower-paid workers, the plant manager says. At General Motors, savings from its two-tier workers are crucial to production that began last month of an inexpensive, subcompact car in suburban Detroit.
Two-tier wage systems have been tried in the airline industry and others with spotty success. Usually the lower wages disappear rather quickly when the economy picks up. But the arrival of vastly different wage rates in auto factories is a seminal event in an industry long influenced by a powerful union devoted to equal pay regardless of seniority.
''This is not going away,'' said Kristin Dziczek, a labor analyst at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''It has allowed the Big Three to reduce labor costs without cutting the pay of incumbent workers. Is it good for the health and competitiveness of the companies? Yes. And is that good for job security? Yes.''
Four years ago, the United Automobile Workers agreed to allow Chrysler, G.M. and Ford to pay lower wages to new hires to help close the cost gap with foreign carmakers. Now the two-tier arrangement is at the forefront of labor talks between the U.A.W. and the Detroit companies.
The union's president, Bob King, has made an increase in entry-level wages a top priority in negotiations for a new national contract to replace the current agreement, which expires Wednesday.
So far, about 12 percent of Chrysler's 23,000 union workers earn the lower wage, and over all, 4,000 or so of the 112,000 U.A.W. members are second-tier hires. Those numbers are expected to grow -- and in fact can increase significantly even under the current contract. The jobs are central to the contract talks because they are viewed as critical to the industry's continued recovery.
Some benefits for the lower-tier workers are scaled back as well. They get the union's traditional medical benefits, but a maximum of four weeks paid time off a year, versus five for the longtime workers. And instead of the guaranteed $3,100-a-month pension a full-paid worker receives after age 60, the new hires have to build their own ''personal retirement plan'' based on contributions from the company of less than $2,000 a year.
The gap in wages between regular and entry-level workers has created dissent in U.A.W. ranks. Some long-term employees have demonstrated against the two-tier system and called for it to be abolished. Mr. King, however, has focused on getting meaningful pay raises for the lower tier rather than eliminating it.
At the big Labor Day parade in Detroit, union activists chanted ''equal pay for equal work,'' and some full-paid workers said they were willing to forgo a wage increase in the new contract to help the lower-tier employees.
''In order to get those guys up, we'll take a signing bonus or profit-sharing instead,'' said Gary Wurtz, a line worker at G.M.'s plant in Orion Township, Mich., where 40 percent of the employees are lower tier.
There were early problems with turnover among new hires who could not keep up with the pace of assembly-line work, according to Pat Walsh, the manager at Chrysler's plant here. But the workers who stayed have performed well. ''Our quality numbers have been very good,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''And our data doesn't show any differences per shift or per workstation.''
Workers at Jefferson North said that the pay gap had not created visible tension. Rather, they say the older workers have encouraged the new hires to hang tough in hopes of achieving full-wage status down the road.
''They're just telling us to hold out and that everything is going to get better,'' Mr. Chatman said.
Mr. Chatman, who is 44 and single, said the security of the job is paramount to him. But he does not hide the fact that he expects one day to make as much money as his top-wage counterparts.
''I think they should get rid of the two tiers,'' he said. ''I hope it's not here to stay. I hope it was just a steppingstone to get things back going again at Chrysler.''
There is no hard timetable for the lower-paid workers to move to full-wage status, but it could take years. As part of the government's bailout of G.M. and Chrysler, the union agreed that no second-tier worker could move up until 2015 at the earliest. At Ford, which did not receive federal aid, the current contract lets the company fill 20 percent of its union jobs with lower-paid workers before it moves any into the top tier.
Experts on two-tier arrangements say that advancement opportunities are critical to the system's success. ''If you know you're going to get to the top wage eventually, the system can work,'' said Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''The big problem is when you think you'll never get there.''
For now, employees like Mr. Chatman are exhilarated by their steady paychecks and the emotional reward of being part of Chrysler's turnaround. Mr. Chatman was recently promoted to be a team leader in the plant, facilitating the efforts of 10 other employees, including two full-wage workers (no additional pay).
He can't help smiling every time he sees each shiny new Grand Cherokee, one of Chrysler's top-selling models, roll off the line. Still, it's tough to accept that his entire annual salary of about $30,000 is not enough to afford the least expensive Jeep made at Jefferson North.
''It would be a shame to work at Chrysler,'' he said, ''and not be able to drive a Chrysler.''

HEADLINE: A Healing Touch From Hospitals

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
SOME advertising agencies weathering the economic downturn are getting a shot in the arm from the most suitable of sources: hospitals.
In the first six months of 2011, advertising by American hospitals, clinics and medical centers rose 20.4 percent, to $717.2 million, from $595.5 million in the same period in 2010, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
Advertising agencies increasingly are trying to quicken the pulse of consumers, who have come to expect ads with doctors in scrubs posing with impressive machinery, ad copy boasting of ''skilled'' doctors and ''caring'' nurses, and the latest ratings from U.S. News and World Report. 
A new television commercial for Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, for example, features pedestrians on a busy sidewalk, and the text, ''We can't help you with playoff tickets. We can't help you with co-op board approval, or getting your child into a preschool. But if it's really a matter of life and death -- we can help.''
A print ad for the campaign, much of which celebrates the fact that the hospital has been around since 1857, has this headline: ''We had cardiologists before the city even had arteries.''
The campaign is by the New York advertising firm of DeVito/Verdi.
''We're looking to brand a hospital while breaking some of the cliches and unwritten rules of hospital marketing, like showing a building, showing pictures of the medical staff, or showing machines,'' said Andrew Brief, director of client services for DeVito/Verdi.
DeVito/Verdi also created a campaign for Mount Sinai Medical Center, which began running in 2003. Print ads featured patient success stories with catchy headlines such as ''Ironic that a plumber came to us to remove a clog.''
Also featuring patients' stories are television commercials introduced by NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital around the beginning of 2011. The campaign, by Munn Rabot in New York, includes a spot featuring Heather McNamara, 9, in the commercial, who describes a lifesaving procedure when she was 7 to remove a baseball-size cancerous tumor.
Patient testimonials have become so popular in the last decade that some hospitals get their hearts -- and their heart clinics -- set on the approach.
''They say, 'We have really satisfied patients so why not use patient testimonials to tell our story?' '' said Susana Cascais, managing director of Frank Unlimited, a Seattle agency whose local clients include the Group Health Cooperative and the Everett Clinic. ''But we try as much as possible to steer our clients away from those cliches, because if you cover the logos in those ads, it could be anybody.''
A billboard by the agency for Group Health last year, highlighting secure online medical records, read, ''Helpful for when your wife yells, 'What is wrong with you?' '' And a print ad, for the Everett Clinic about pediatric care and scheduled to be introduced on Sept. 26, reads, ''We diagnose mumps, ear infections and Legos lodged in noses daily.''
Also X-raying the funny bone is Bethesda Heart Hospital, in Boynton Beach, Fla., which recently ran billboards along I-95 in Boynton Beach and nearby Delray Beach, cities popular with retirees.
''Your heirs can wait,'' read one billboard; another, ''Outlive your foursome.''
Paul Amelchenko, the creative director at BFW Advertising in Boca Raton, Fla., which produced the ads, explained in an e-mail message that the strategy ''was to focus on the benefit of the hospital (we help you live longer) versus the features that they have (great technology, world class physicians) that all other hospitals claim to have as well.''
A television spot for the Mayo Clinic that began in August starts with a single firefly in the night sky, which gradually lights up with too many to count, and is accompanied by the voiceover, ''You can make an appointment with one doctor -- or you can choose Mayo Clinic, where a team of experts works together for you.''
The campaign -- by Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies -- includes a similar spot with paper lanterns multiplying in the night sky.
Reid Holmes, executive creative director at Campbell Mithun, said an institution as well regarded as the Mayo Clinic need not ''prove its performance ability.'' Instead, spots highlight the collaborative approach of the doctors and the fact that -- with facilities in Minnesota, Arizona and Florida -- it is more accessible than consumers may think.
''The reputation that the Mayo Clinic has is its own proof point,'' said Mr. Holmes. ''But a predominant misperception in many ways is either, 'I'm not dire enough to need them,' or, 'I'm just a regular dude and I can't get access to them.' '' The ads, he continued, demonstrate ''that anyone can get an appointment at Mayo.''
At UPMC, which is based in Pittsburgh and operates 20 hospitals, some current commercials and online-only videos take the unusual approach of de-emphasizing hospital care. The spots, which feature people who are not actors, highlight efforts like a college scholarship program.
The videos are part of a broader campaign, called ''Life Changing Medicine,'' started late last year by Grey New York, part of the Grey Division of the Grey Group, which is owned by WPP.
''When looking at building the brand of the hospital, this organization goes beyond just the hospital and beds,'' said Dean Walters, a marketing vice president for UPMC. ''What consumers don't usually see is the tremendous giveback to the community that UPMC makes.''

HEADLINE: Gentlemen, Start Conserving

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Is green Nascar an oxymoron? After all, the sport is all about watching gas guzzlers drive at high speeds in circles for hours. Until 2007, race cars used leaded fuel. Tens of thousands of fans still drive to races in recreational vehicles and other gas hogs.
But more than any other American sport, Nascar is also a for-profit business, and like many companies these days, it is focused on cutting costs by recycling, conserving and generating its own energy. While the core of the sport remains unchanged, Nascar, its teams, track operators and sponsors are employing an ambitious set of green initiatives that includes collecting used fuel, planting trees to offset carbon emissions, and deploying sheep to keep the infield grass short.
Going green not only saves money that can be spent on drivers and cars, but it has also created new revenue by attracting sponsors to Nascar that want to trumpet their eco-friendliness to the millions of fans who watch races on television and at the track. 
Of course, these efforts will not alter the essence of a sport that celebrates fast cars that burn copious amounts of gasoline, a fact that has led many critics to accuse Nascar of greenwashing, or claiming unfairly to be environmentally friendly. But many who work in Nascar say that reducing and recycling are imperative precisely because so much waste is produced, and if money can be saved in the process, all the better.
''The incongruity is part of what makes going green in this sport so impactful,'' said Michael Lynch, Nascar's director of green innovation. ''There's a bias that the sport is not green and therefore the fans aren't green.''
Nascar is not the first sport to have an eco-campaign. Baseball teams including the St. Louis Cardinals and the Seattle Mariners are aggressively recycling and conserving. The Portland Trail Blazers, the Miami Heat and the Orlando Magic among other N.B.A. teams play in arenas certified by the United States Green Building Council. The builders of a new Formula One track in Austin, Tex., are planning a host of environmental initiatives, including buying carbon offsets.
Many environmentalists support these efforts not just because of the volume of resources consumed at stadiums and at arenas, but also because so many people watch sports and are likely to follow examples set by the players, teams and leagues. This may be particularly true at Nascar races, where the event itself is about consumption.
''This is not the sport that you would expect to hear green messages, so it's a good learning opportunity,'' said Andrew Winston, who runs Winston Eco-Strategies. ''You're reaching millions of people who have not heard much about it at all and are sometimes hostile to it. So if you open their eyes to it, it's certainly worth it.''
Indeed, the greening of Nascar is a sweeping undertaking because so many people attend so many races in so many places, at tracks that are turned into small cities with all the associated problems of garbage, water, power, sewage and air quality. To tackle these challenges in a systematic way, Nascar hired Lynch in 2008, just as teams, tracks and others in the sport started to feel the effects of the recession.
Rather than institute rules, Lynch brought people from all parts of Nascar together to figure out how environmental programs could help them cut tens of millions of dollars in costs without imposing too much strain on their operations.
Lynch started by expanding efforts already under way. Safety-Kleen, a $1.2 billion recycler of automotive fluids that started working with Nascar two decades ago, expanded its collection of used fuels, lubricants and oily rags at tracks and race team shops. In addition to the 225,000 gallons of fluids it expects to bring in this year, Safety-Kleen also recycles oil filters, fluorescent light bulbs, metal shavings, aluminum and steel.
''None of that goes in a landfill,'' said Drew Patey, the director of motor sports for Safety-Kleen which, because of its alliance with Nascar, now works at IndyCar races, too. ''Guys in the heartland who didn't see recycling as a priority are seeking us out.''
Nascar also claims to have the largest recycling program in sports because of Coca-Cola and Coors Light, two Nascar sponsors that are expected to recycle about 12 million bottles and cans this season, twice as much as last year. At races, the trucking company Freightliner stations a clean-diesel rig -- with a Richard Petty custom paint scheme -- bearing a Coca-Cola compactor that crushes up to 1,000 containers a minute. Hundreds of tons of cardboard are also collected each season.
Despite the scale of these efforts, Lynch does not disagree with environmentalists who call these recycling measures low-hanging fruit. So he has supported other projects like the installation last year of 40,000 solar panels over 25 acres at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa. The track operator, which spent about $15 million to build the three-megawatt solar farm, now saves about $500,000 a year in energy costs and has produced electricity equal to 324,000 gallons of gasoline.
''We gained a lot of fans because of it,'' said Brandon Igdalsky, the raceway's president. ''Our generation is trying to clean up the things that our grandparents and great-grandparents did.''
Igdalsky said that he paid more for his solar power system because he bought parts made in the United States. Indeed, many businesses at Nascar, perhaps playing to the sports' fans, which skew toward the South and the Midwest, view their green initiatives almost as a patriotic duty. Generating electricity from the sun is not just about saving money, but also a way to wean the country off imported oil.
That was part of the thinking behind Nascar's decision to make Sunoco Green E 15 ethanol blend its official fuel this season. The choice was contentious. Fans and drivers protective of the sports' traditions look warily on efforts to tinker with something as elemental as fuel. Many environmentalists object to corn-based ethanol because it may drive up food prices and may not reduce emissions by as much as its proponents claim.
The ethanol blend Nascar uses does boost horsepower slightly, alleviating fears that it would hurt speeds on the track. And many at Nascar note that ethanol is produced with corn grown in the United States, which and helps reduce reliance on imported oil.
''We have all the resources here and we have to take care of the environment,'' said Clint Bowyer, a driver with Richard Childress Racing. ''Ethanol is a big step in that direction.''
As part of a broader sponsorship, Nascar put the logo of American Ethanol, the promotional group for Growth Energy and the National Corn Growers Association, on the green flags used to start races.
To offset the substantial amount of greenhouse gases still produced at races, Nascar has started to plant 10 mature trees after each race, often in communities near the tracks. The Toyota Camry hybrid is the pace car of choice at many races. At the Infineon track in Sonoma, Calif., a small herd of sheep graze on the infield to keep the grass trimmed.
Another example is the Roush Fenway team, which recycles 96 percent of each car it produces and has eliminated Styrofoam cups and bought bicycles for workers to get around its facility in North Carolina. Still, even the most avid environmentalists at Nascar acknowledge this is only the beginning of a long process to clean up the sport.
''We're realists and we race cars that burn a fossil fuel that get four to five miles per gallon, and we can't change that,'' said Ian Prince, the chief sustainability officer at Roush Fenway. ''But we can change the other 99 percent of it.''

HEADLINE: Premier Of Turkey Takes Role In Region

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Heba Afify contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Seeking to capitalize on Turkey's growing stature and influence across the Arab world at a time of regional upheaval, its prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared on Egyptian television late Monday once again calling Israel ''the West's spoiled child.''
Mr. Erdogan's appearance kicked off a so-called Arab Spring tour, with plans to also visit Libya and Tunisia in addition to Cairo. He is seeking to enhance his regional celebrity and bolster Turkey's standing as a potential role model for Arab states fitfully inching toward democracy. His visit comes at a moment when the revolutions of the Arab Spring have thrown into question much of the established order that has prevailed in the region for the last 30 years, including the terms of Israel's uneasy peace with its neighbors, in particular, Egypt. 
Once a close ally of Israel, Turkey accelerated its growing stature across the Arab world -- and further upended the regional order -- when it downgraded diplomatic relations with Israel and expelled its ambassador early this month after Israel refused to issue an apology for a deadly commando raid last year aboard an aid ship trying to break the embargo of the Gaza Strip. But even before the recent flare-up with Israel, Mr. Erdogan was already lionized across the region for his commitment to Islamist politics, pluralistic constitutional democracy and energetic economic development. In Egypt, aspiring Islamist politicians often try to sell themselves as ''the Egyptian Erdogan.''
Even before any diplomatic meetings in Cairo, he opened his visit with an appearance Monday night on a popular television talk show, where the host, Mona el-Shazly, introduced him with an Oprah Winfrey-style video biography as ''a man who is admired not only by a large sector of Turkey but also by a large sector of Arabs and Muslims.''
''The Turkish state is in its core a state of freedoms and secularism,'' Mr. Erdogan said, explaining Turkey's support for the Arab revolutions. ''The world is changing to a system where the will of the people will rule. Why should the Europeans and Americans be the only ones that live with dignity? Aren't Egyptians and Somalians also entitled to a life of dignity?''
''As a Turk,'' he added, ''I didn't want to be watching this situation from afar as if I was watching a football game.''
He also arrived in Cairo just days after a mob's invasion of the Israeli Embassy brought relations between Egypt and Israel to a level of tension not seen in the three decades since the Camp David accords. And his trip also comes at a moment when leaders of the Palestinian Authority are in Cairo consulting with Arab states and European diplomats in preparation for a bid to seek United Nations recognition as a state.
Mr. Erdogan seemed to present himself as a spokesman for the backlash against Israel unleashed by the revolts across the region.
''Israel is the West's spoiled child,'' he said, ''to this day it has never executed a decision by the international community.''
Asked about Turkey's downgrade of diplomatic relations with Israel, he vowed that his nation would not back down until Israel apologized for its forces killing eight Turkish citizens and an American of Turkish decent aboard an aid flotilla seized in international waters on its way to the blockaded Gaza Strip. ''Israel cannot play with our dignity,'' he said.
He faulted the United States, as well, for failing to demand a similar apology for the killing of its citizen in the commando raid. ''One of the victims was an American from Turkish origin, but America did not protect the right of its citizen after that,'' he said.
Mr. Erdogan also sought to sign on to the attempts, in anticipation of a statehood bid, to broker a reconciliation between the secular Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank and the Islamist militant faction Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. Some reports had suggested that Mr. Erdogan planned to visit Gaza on his tour in a symbolic snub to the Israelis and a boost for Hamas. But in the television interview Mr. Erdogan said he preferred to visit together with Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, and his Hamas counterpart, Ismail Haniya.
''I told Abbas to come with me so that we can all go together, Mahmoud Abbas, Erdogan and Ismail Haniya,'' Mr. Erdogan said. ''You know what he said? He said, yes I will come with you. I have hope and I am waiting for this visit.''
Mr. Abbas is expected to announce soon how the Palestinian Authority will stake its claim at the United Nations, whether seeking partial membership through the General Assembly or full membership through the Security Council. If the Palestinians go to the Security Council, the United States is expected to veto the move, further straining relations with the Arab world.
Mr. Erdogan, for his part, used his television appearance to promote the merits of the Turkish model of Islamist-led democratic capitalism. ''Management of people, management of science and management of money,'' he said, sticking to slogans rather than details. ''If you do those three, you will accomplish your goal.''

HEADLINE: Perry's Criticism of Social Security as 'Ponzi Scheme' Dogs Him in Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
As Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was assailed by some rivals for the Republican presidential nomination at Monday night's debate for his exaggerated claim that Social Security is a ''Ponzi scheme,'' he also seemed to be debating himself at times.
Mr. Perry used the debate to talk about the need to shore up Social Security, which politicians of all stripes agree is needed if the program is to continue paying out full benefits a quarter century from now. In making his case, Mr. Perry adopted a very different tone from what he did in his book ''Fed Up'' just a year ago, when he described Social Security as a failure that ''we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now.'' 
Mr. Perry said that Social Security had to be fixed so that ''our children actually know that there's going to be a retirement program there for them.''
But in the past, as Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, correctly pointed out, Mr. Perry has repeatedly suggested that Social Security, which pays benefits to 56 million Americans, is undesirable, and that it may even be unconstitutional.
In ''Fed Up,'' Mr. Perry described Social Security as ''a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal, in stark contrast to the mythical notion of salvation to which it has wrongly been attached for too long, all at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government.'' On MSNBC last November, he asked: ''Why is the federal government even in the pension program or the health care delivery program? Let the states do it.''
When pressed on those statements, Mr. Perry responded: ''If what you're trying to say is back in the '30s and the '40s that the federal government made all the right decisions, I disagree with it. It's time for us to get back to the Constitution. And a program that's been there 70 or 80 years, obviously we're not going to take that program away.''
Mr. Perry repeated his description of Social Security, saying, ''It has been called a Ponzi scheme by many people long before me.''
While there are some superficial similarities, it is ultimately a misleading exaggeration to describe Social Security as a Ponzi scheme.
Charles Ponzi was a Boston con man who promised investors impossibly high interest rates and who paid off his early investors by taking money from later investors -- a pyramid scheme that can work only if an ever-increasing pool of investors puts in money.
Social Security, by contrast, is a pay-as-you-go retirement system by design. Current workers and employers pay taxes that are used to pay benefits to current retirees. For many years, the program took in more money than it paid out. In 2010, Social Security began paying out more in benefits than it received in taxes. As more baby boomers retire, and the number of new workers does not keep pace, that shortfall is expected to grow.
Mr. Perry spoke approvingly Monday of how some municipalities in Texas had opted out of Social Security. But that is for their government employees. It is not clear what his vision of letting states handle retirements would mean for private-sector workers.
And opting out is not always a good idea: when the city of Central Falls, R.I., filed for bankruptcy this year, it moved to cut the pensions of its police officers and firefighters by as much as half -- and, since they opted out of Social Security, many have no other income to rely on.
Jobs From Stimulus
Turning to the economy, Mr. Perry asserted that the stimulus had ''created zero jobs.''
That is not what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and many economists, have found.
While the president's advisers had once predicted that the stimulus bill would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent, they were wrong: it is now at 9.1 percent. But without the stimulus it would probably be worse, many analysts believe.
According to data collected by the Congressional Budget Office, the stimulus bill, between its passage in February 2009 and June 2011, has increased the number of people employed by 1 million to 2.9 million, figures that include jobs created and jobs preserved.
Health Care Panels
On health care, Mr. Romney said the legislation championed by President Obama would ultimately lead to panels that dictate to people what kind of health care they can get.
The health care law did create the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which must come up with ways to slow the growth in Medicare costs.
Though the board does have the power, starting in 2015, to propose specific cuts to Medicare if spending appears likely to exceed projected levels, those proposals are not binding. And the law spells out that the board's recommendations ''shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums.''

HEADLINE: On Eve of Special Election for Weiner's Seat, Candidates Seek to Firm Up Support

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
On the eve of a special election in the heavily Democratic House district last represented by Anthony D. Weiner, the Republican candidate expressed confidence that an upset was within reach, while his Democratic opponent played down the anxiety in his party and predicted that a strong turnout effort would propel him to victory.
On Monday, the final day of intense campaigning played out before a watchful audience not just in Brooklyn and Queens, but also in Washington. A victory on Tuesday by the Republican, Bob Turner, in a traditional Democratic stronghold like New York State's Ninth Congressional District would reinforce concern among Democrats that President Obama's standing with voters may have deteriorated substantially, and Mr. Turner urged voters to send just such a message.
The Democratic candidate, Assemblyman David I. Weprin, who trailed by six points in a poll released on Friday, shook off questions about his campaign and said he expected to be celebrating a ''big victory'' on Tuesday evening. 
''The only poll that counts is the one tomorrow,'' Mr. Weprin said. ''We're going to have every union behind us, we're going to have more troops in the field, and we're going to pull out the traditional Democratic vote.''
The race to replace Mr. Weiner had not initially been expected to be competitive: registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district three to one, and a Republican last won the seat in 1920. But Mr. Turner has framing the contest as a chance for voters to rebuke Mr. Obama for what Mr. Turner considers the president's ineffectual handling of the economy and his lukewarm support of Israel, and Mr. Weprin appears to have compounded his challenges by running what members of his own party acknowledge has been a weak campaign.
Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant who is not involved in the race, projected that only about 10 percent of the district's 343,000 registered voters would participate in the election. The two campaigns predicted a modestly higher turnout.
In interviews on Monday, many people in the district said they were unaware of the special election. Several asked a crowd of reporters and campaign volunteers gathered outside Mr. Weprin's campaign office what the commotion was about; invariably, they registered a blank look when told about the special election. But some registered voters found the race increasingly hard to avoid, thanks to the barrage of automated phone calls and mailings in recent days. And the race's national implications have drawn increasing attention from the news media.
In the final hours of the race, both candidates tried to motivate residents to vote with endorsements from prominent politicians. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and former President Bill Clinton, both Democrats, recorded automated phone calls on behalf of Mr. Weprin, and the Obama re-election campaign sent its supporters text and e-mail messages on Monday asking them to help with get-out-the-vote efforts.
Meanwhile, Mr. Turner got help from two former New York City mayors: Edward I. Koch, a Democrat, recorded a phone message for him, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, appeared with Mr. Turner at the Long Island Rail Road station in Forest Hills, Queens, in front of a battalion of television cameras.
Mr. Giuliani declared the election an opportunity to send a message to Mr. Obama, whose new jobs proposal he described as ''warmed-over spit.'' Mr. Giuliani compared Mr. Turner to Senator Scott Brown, a Republican who won an upset victory last year in a special election in Massachusetts, and to the Republicans elected in House races across the country last year after campaigning on the promise of cutting government spending.
''The enthusiasm and the emotion is on Bob's side -- the machine politics is on the other side,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''So we're going to see which trumps the other.''
Both candidates had some stumbles as they sought to reach out to voters on Monday. Mr. Turner was turned away when he tried to campaign at a home for the elderly in Forest Hills; an administrator said the home had not been given notice of the candidate's visit.
And Mr. Weprin had trouble getting attention at the Queens Community House Rego Park Senior Center; a chair yoga class was in progress, and the candidate's remarks were drowned out by the click-clack of shuffling mah-jongg tiles. One woman brushed past Mr. Weprin, whom she did not appear to recognize, to embrace the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and tell her that she would be the city's next mayor.
Later, at his campaign office above a grocery store in Forest Hills, Mr. Weprin said that more than a thousand volunteers would be on the streets in the Ninth District on Tuesday. He was joined by Jon Bauman -- a k a Bowzer from the rock 'n' roll group Sha Na Na -- who rolled up his sleeves and said Mr. Weprin's ''army'' would do the same.
Representative Joseph Crowley, who as the Democratic Party chairman in Queens was instrumental in naming Mr. Weprin the Democratic nominee, defended the candidate as the best man for the job. But Mr. Crowley seemed flustered when a reporter asked him why, in a heavily Democratic district, the race was so tight.
''Firstly, this is, you know, it's an interesting time,'' Mr. Crowley said. ''We have some very serious questions facing our nation right now, and I think that whenever there's a special election, it's called a special election for a reason.''
Other Weprin supporters questioned the usefulness of polls in the race.
''I think what you're getting is a lot of angry people -- I don't doubt it -- who knee-jerk say 'Turner,' because they think it represents something different,'' said Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate. ''I don't think necessarily those people are going to come out and vote.''
Voting Information
Voters in New York State on Tuesday will elect a new representative from Brooklyn and Queens, as well as six members of the Assembly from around the state. Voters in some areas will also elect party nominees for a variety of local offices.
In New York City, the polls for the special and primary elections open at 6 a.m. and close at 9 p.m. Voters in the city who need information about polling places or about voting should call the Board of Elections at 1-866-VOTE-NYC
(1-866-868-3692). Voters can also go to gis.nyc.gov/vote/ps/index.htm to find their polling sites.

HEADLINE: At Debate, Perry Wears a Bull's-Eye as 7 Other G.O.P. Candidates Take Aim

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ASHLEY PARKER; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- The Republican presidential candidates aggressively confronted Gov. Rick Perry at a debate here on Monday night, and pressed him to explain his views on Social Security and his decade-long record in Texas, including an effort to require the vaccination of schoolgirls and granting children of illegal immigrants a college tuition break.
The rapid rise of Mr. Perry, who joined the race only a month ago, made him a central target for his Republican rivals. He sought to deflect the critiques with humor and sarcasm, but he tried to clarify his position on Social Security, whose constitutionality he has questioned.
He said that he ''slam-dunk guaranteed'' promised benefits would be available to current retirees, but also suggested the nation should examine ideas like allowing states to opt out of Social Security and set up their own programs. 
He repeatedly tangled with Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who pushed him again and again to expound on his positions. When Mr. Perry tried to flick away the questions, Mr. Romney declared: ''We're running for president.''
The debate went a long way in clarifying the contours of the Republican contest, both in terms of the strength of the candidates -- for the second time in a row, Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry were the main players -- but also on the issues driving the race. It is rare in a presidential primary to have such a vivid difference of opinion on a critical issue, as is the case with Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry on Social Security.
The Republican presidential debate often took on the feel of a rollicking political game show, playing out before a studio audience of 1,000 Tea Party activists here at the Florida State Fairgrounds. The debate was continually interrupted by applause, but it remained an open question whether the cheers or the jeers provided an accurate reflection of how Republican voters elsewhere were judging the evening.
A day after the nation commemorated the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, the debate dealt almost exclusively on domestic concerns. The criticism that the Republican candidates leveled at one another overshadowed the time spent assailing the policies of President Obama.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who has struggled to break into the exchanges between Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney, forcefully stepped into the conversation as she challenged Mr. Perry for a program he advocated in Texas requiring girls entering the sixth grade to be vaccinated against the human papilloma virus, which causes a sexually transmitted disease that is linked to cervical cancer.
After Mr. Perry repeated his lament that it was a mistake to have required the vaccination with an executive order rather than through legislation, Mrs. Bachmann said: ''To have innocent little 12-year-old girls be forced to have a government injection through an executive order is just flat out wrong.''
To applause, she reprised questions about the role Mr. Perry's former chief of staff, Mike Toomey, might have played in pushing the executive order as a lobbyist for the drug company that makes the vaccine, Merck. She suggested that the company generated thousands of dollars in donations to Mr. Perry.
''The company was Merck and it was a $5,000 contribution that I had received from them,'' said Mr. Perry, who actually received $30,000 in donations, records show. ''I raised about $30 million -- if you're saying that I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended.''
Mr. Perry, who was positioned at the center of the stage, did not retreat from the criticism. But he drew jeers for his decision in 2001 to allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public universities in Texas. Mrs. Bachmann sharply criticized him and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania suggested an ulterior motive.
''Maybe that was an attempt to attract illegal -- I mean Latino -- voters,'' Mr. Santorum said.
Mr. Perry defended the policy, which is already a subject of concern to people he has met in early-voting states. While the economy has dominated the campaign debate, the issue of immigration is simmering and the exchange on Monday night offered a glimpse into its volatility.
''If you've been in the state of Texas for three years, if you're working towards your college degree, and if you are working and pursuing citizenship in the state of Texas, you pay in-state tuition there,'' Mr. Perry said. ''It doesn't make any difference what the sound of your last name is, that's the American way.''
While it was the fifth Republican presidential debate of the year, it was only the second time that Mr. Perry has joined the candidates on stage. His views on a variety of subjects are less well known than many of his rivals, so the questions often returned to him. He said that it was time to bring American troops home from Afghanistan ''as soon and as safely as we can.''
Representative Ron Paul of Texas also took a shot at Mr. Perry when asked whether he deserved credit for his economic record in Texas. ''I would put a little damper on this,'' Mr. Paul said, ''but I don't want to offend the governor, because he might raise my taxes or something.''
The candidates were welcomed onto the neon-lit stage by Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchor, as though they were contestants in a lightning round, complete with nicknames, including Mrs. Bachmann, ''The Firebrand''; former Speaker Newt Gingrich, ''The Big Thinker''; and Mr. Santorum, ''The Fighter.''
CNN's decision to co-sponsor the debate with the Tea Party Express resulted in a more roiling debate than the more decorous one last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California. The audience of about 1,000 made no secret of whom it liked and whom it did not, cheering along Mr. Perry and Herman Cain, a former business executive, and being cool to Mr. Romney.
Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney, whose lecterns were positioned side by side, quickly turned their answers into a nightlong match of one-upmanship. At one point, Mr. Perry leaned over and patted his rival on the back as the moderator asked Mr. Romney if Mr. Perry deserved any credit for job creation in Texas.
''If you're dealt four aces,'' Mr. Romney said, ''that doesn't make you necessarily a great poker player.''
But Mr. Perry was ready with a quip of his own: ''Mitt, you were doing pretty good until you got to talking poker.''
Former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman of Utah came prepared with a pocketful of zingers, but his dry delivery, coupled with a Tea Party audience who never quite warmed to him, often left his one-liners hanging awkwardly.
Fielding a question on Social Security, Mr. Huntsman tried: ''You've got Governor Romney, who called it a fraud in his book 'No Apology.' I don't know if that was written by Kurt Cobain or not.'' (Not a Nirvana crowd, apparently. There was no applause or laughter on that allusion to the band's hit ''All Apologies.'')
Later, when Mr. Perry said that it was impossible to secure the border, Mr. Huntsman called it an almost ''treasonous comment,'' alluding to Mr. Perry's remarks early in the campaign that were critical of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke. Mr. Huntsman delivered the line with a grin, but the audience offered only a hushed murmur.
Then, trying to land another attack against Mr. Romney, Mr. Huntsman said: ''We could spend all night talking about where Mitt's been on all the issues and that would take forever.''
But even to a crowd that was far from gracious to Mr. Romney, the hall was nearly silent.

HEADLINE: What's a Presidential Library to Do?

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- When Republicans gathered at the Ronald Reagan Library and Museum here for the presidential debate last week, the backdrop was an overhauled exhibition on the Reagan presidency, done under the watchful eye of Nancy Reagan. It is intended, in part, to be a more complete depiction of the Reagan presidency, replacing one that many had seen as a bit too worshipful and airbrushed.
But another exhibition that just opened at yet another presidential museum not far away -- the Watergate installation at the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda -- has offered a stark challenge to the Reagan tribute here, exposing both the different ways that these two museums have chosen to remember their subjects and the different positions that the two former presidents hold in the nation's and the Republican Party's memory.
''The Reagan library is the way presidential libraries have been in the past,'' said Jon Wiener, a history professor at the University of California, Irvine. ''The Nixon library represents the new kind of museum that presents more of an historic view, warts and all.'' 
The Watergate exhibition is so detailed, searing and unapologetic -- ''What did the president know, and when did he know it?'' asks a panel that greets visitors -- that it was shunned by Nixon loyalists. They did not attend the opening ceremony this year and provided it no financial support, and last week, one museum docent resigned his post in protest.
By contrast, the revamped Reagan library -- ''He fought for freedom; he set out to change the nation,'' attendees are informed in the introductory film -- was financed and developed by the Reagan Foundation. Mrs. Reagan approved much of the content, library officials said. Attendees at the invitation-only debate of the presidential candidates were encouraged to view the display, which opened to the public in February.
Both museums are run by the National Archives, after being built by supporters of each president. The Reagan Foundation's influence over the museum reflects both the extensive network of family, friends and contributors who are part of the foundation, which finances many of the museum's activities, and Reagan's enduring popularity.
What is more, the Nixon Foundation, as part of long negotiations that led to the National Archives' taking over the museum and transferring Nixon's papers there, yielded a great deal of authority to the Archives in revamping the museum.
The result at the Reagan library is a decidedly modest accounting of the Iran-contra affair, the major scandal that hit the administration, which avoids laying blame on anyone. There is also a sympathetic accounting of the impact of Reagan's economic policies that has drawn questions from Democrats and economic historians.
The mention of Reagan's first wife, the Oscar-winning actress Jane Wyman, is so fleeting that it is easy to miss under the flurry of exhibitions about Nancy Reagan's gowns and dedication to her husband. While the Nixon library marked the 40th anniversary of the publication of the Pentagon Papers by declassifying the documents -- a gesture that was more symbolic than anything else -- there is no plan to mark the 25th anniversary of the Iran-contra scandal, Reagan museum officials said.
What is at play here -- in the sole metropolitan region that can boast of having two presidential libraries -- is an uneasy debate about what a presidential library is supposed to be: A celebration of its subject or a dispassionate depiction of an American presidency.
''They should be honest to history: They are run by the National Archives,'' said Benjamin Hufbauer, a professor of fine arts at the University of Louisville who wrote a book on presidential libraries. ''The Reagan library is better than it was before -- it's better than the clean whitewash it used to be, when it didn't mention Iran-contra at all. But it tends to be a celebration of Reagan, a shrine.''
As a historian, Professor Wiener said: ''I am much more interested with what the Nixon library was able to do, which took a long time. The Reagan library is still committed to the idea of defending Reagan against his critics.''
Reagan library officials defend the revised exhibition here as an accurate and balanced depiction of his time in office, particularly with the revisions that took account of the Iran-contra scandal.
''I think our mission is to educate these people,'' said John Heubusch, the executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, which financed the library. ''I think that these new exhibitions do a good job of education.''
Mr. Heubusch said he had not visited the Watergate exhibit so he could ''not comment on how quote-unquote tough it is.'' But he said he was satisfied with the way Iran-contra was now addressed, particularly after it had been ignored before.
At the Nixon library, the Watergate exhibition has stirred such tensions that a docent resigned with a blistering attack on Timothy J. Naftali, the director of the library and curator of the Watergate exhibition.
''The president, who admirably redeemed himself in the sunset of his life from the monstrous shadow of Watergate, is now being enthusiastically dishonored at his own library by a 'Manchurian' figure, Dr. Timothy Naftali,'' the docent, Will Alexander, wrote in a letter of resignation last week.
''Presidential libraries are built, in large part, to showcase the accomplishments of the presidents,'' Mr. Alexander wrote. '' It would be disingenuous to ignore a president's failings, mistakes and frailties; they all had them. But it's far worse to revel in those failings in a way that keeps a dark cloud hovering over their accomplishments.''
Mr. Naftali said he viewed the mission of his museum as trying to present a historically complete portrait of Nixon. ''The library has a nonpartisan mission,'' he said. ''It's a nonpartisan federal institution. And it has an obligation to provide exhibits that encourage the study of history.''
Larry Hackman, the former director of the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum, said directors of presidential libraries had to deal with pressures from family members and close supporters of the president. Mr. Hackman, who encountered such pressures as he pushed that museum to deal with questions about Truman's decision to use nuclear weapons, says that the process got easier with the passage of time, as family members and supporters began to die off.
''The fatal continuing flaw are those private foundations,'' said Mr. Hackman, who ran the library from 1995 to 2000. ''They will tell you they are a great deal because of all the nonfederal money they are bringing in. In my opinion, there are hidden and in some cases there are some odious strings that come with that money that keep the library directors, no matter how well intentioned they are, from developing certain exhibitions or programs.''
James Gardner, who was named last month as the National Archives executive in charge of presidential libraries, said he anticipated this to be a regular source of tension in his position.
''What I would look for is a balance between history and memory,'' Dr. Gardner said, as he talked about balancing conflicting demands. ''There should be room for both.''

HEADLINE: Obama Offers Jobs Bill, And the G.O.P. Balks

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON--President Obama sent his jobs bill to Congress on Monday, urging lawmakers to put aside ''political games'' and pass the $447 billion plan meant to increase hiring as the government struggles to curtail persistent high unemployment.
But just two hours after Mr. Obama, flanked by firefighters, construction workers and teachers in the Rose Garden, waved a copy of the jobs plan and issued his call for bipartisanship, Republicans took aim at the White House plan to pay for the jobs initiative through tax increases on more affluent Americans, most of them tax increases previously rejected by lawmakers. 
White House officials said they nonetheless believed the proposal could pass Congress. The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said administration officials had seen ''some conciliatory messaging from some members of Congress'' since lawmakers returned from their summer recess after presumably getting an earful from voters fed up with the political brinkmanship that characterized the negotiations over the debt ceiling.
''We have some indication that the message of the American people is being heard by members of Congress,'' Mr. Carney said.
Congressional Republicans were not, however, sounding that conciliatory; they promptly fired off e-mails to let their displeasure with the idea of tax increases be known. ''Beware the Tax Man,'' was the subject line in an e-mail from one House Republican staff member. Brendan Buck, spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, added his own quick reaction, criticizing the proposal as one that ''doesn't appear to have been offered in that bipartisan spirit.''
In a news briefing with reporters on Monday, Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and House majority leader, took pains to say that he was open to the president's legislative proposals. But he made clear that if they are paid for primarily through tax increases, Republicans would not be going along.
''I sure hope that the president is not suggesting that we pay for his proposals with a massive tax increase at the end of 2012 on job creators,'' Mr. Cantor said.
If Mr. Obama's bill resembled the 2009 stimulus plan, he said, ''I don't believe that our members are going to be interested in pursuing that; I certainly am not.''
The White House budget director, Jack Lew, said the bulk of the plan -- some $400 billion -- would be paid for by limiting itemized deductions for charitable contributions and other deductions claimed by individuals making more than $200,000 a year and families making at least $250,000 annually. Another $40 billion would come from closing loopholes for oil and gas companies and $3 billion would come from additional taxes on corporate jets. Fund managers would pay $18 billion in higher taxes on certain income.
Mr. Lew said the new Congressional committee charged with finding $1.2 trillion in savings this year as part of the agreement to raise the debt ceiling would have the option of accepting the payment proposals submitted by Mr. Obama, or proposing new ones of their own.
The American Jobs Act, which the president unveiled Thursday, would cut some taxes through an extension and expansion of the current reduction in payroll taxes, worth $240 billion. Smaller businesses would also get a cut in their share of payroll taxes, as well as a tax holiday for hiring new workers. The plan also provides $140 billion for modernizing schools and repairing roads and bridges -- spending that Mr. Obama says is critical to maintaining economic competitiveness.
The administration has pointed to forecasts from economists that the mix of tax cuts and new spending would spur growth and appreciably reduce the jobless rate. Mr. Carney on Monday declined to forecast the actual number of additional jobs that the White House anticipates could come if Congress enacts the jobs bill.
''On Thursday, I told Congress that I'll be sending them a bill called the American Jobs Act,'' Mr. Obama said during Rose Garden remarks on Monday morning, holding up the proposal. ''Well, here it is.'' He said that American voters could not afford to wait 14 months until the next election for lawmakers to act.
He sounded what is clearly going to be a central theme for this fall, as he strikes out into the country to sell his jobs proposal to Americans (he is going to Mr. Boehner's home state, Ohio, on Tuesday in a visit to Columbus, and to Raleigh, N.C., on Wednesday): ''Let's pass this bill,'' Mr. Obama said several times during his remarks.
But while the president's new mantra is ''pass this bill now,'' the legislation's fate seems more along the lines of, pass some of this bill at some point, maybe.
Democrats in the Senate plan to try to move ahead with Mr. Obama's bill, once its costs have been evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office, sometime over the course of the coming weeks. It is far from clear the bill can pass that chamber even with the Senate under Democratic control. A combination of Republicans put off by tax increases and Democrats who are in tough re-election battles could leave the measure short of the 60 votes needed to clear procedural obstacles.
Republicans will almost certainly not bring the White House bill to the floor of the House, where its chances for approval are even more remote. In fact, Mr. Cantor even found fault with Mr. Obama's new mantra. ''To say 'pass my bill' 17 times is not the tone nor is it a way forward for us that will be acceptable to the American people,'' he said. And Mr. Boehner promised Monday that the proposal would receive vigorous Republican review.
Turning complaints Democrats have made all year about Republican unwillingness to compromise back on the White House, Congressional Republicans are now saying that Mr. Obama is being too inflexible, and that they will instead pick off pieces of the legislation to wind through their committees and come to possible separate votes. Those elements of his plan that could pass muster include the extension of a payroll tax holiday for employees and small businesses as well as an extension of unemployment benefits.

HEADLINE: Friending Yahoo May Make Sense

BYLINE: By ROB COX and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
Now that Yahoo has fired its chief executive, anything could happen to the company, which has become a rudderless Internet hodgepodge. Private equity firms, one of Yahoo's founders and even AOL are said to be pondering bids. But consider a more radical option: a takeover by the rival most responsible for Yahoo's fall from grace -- Facebook.
It's easy to marshal arguments against Facebook staining itself Yahoo purple. The social network is already growing rapidly. Revenue doubled in the first half to $1.6 billion with profit of nearly half a billion. 
Moreover, Facebook is a private company without the $20 billion or so in cash needed to buy Yahoo. Since Facebook is just starting to profitably harvest its audience of 750 million users, the firm should stick to its strengths, or so the argument goes.
But Facebook has the ingredients to make Yahoo succeed, starting with a clear mission. Yahoo has struggled to articulate a vision beyond being the first page people see when they open a browser. Little binds together Yahoo's disparate pieces -- news, photo albums, stock quotes, e-mail, job listings and entertainment. They look like orphaned applications for a social network.
What does unify Yahoo is a relatively robust display advertising platform. In an overall bad second quarter, display revenue increased 5 percent to $467 million. Facebook is still building out its capacity to sell such ads. A combination would make a compelling pitch to advertisers.
In search, both have a common nemesis in Google. They also have a shared partner in Microsoft, which owns a piece of Facebook and whose Bing search engine collaborates with Yahoo -- and could one day join the merged entity.
A deal would nevertheless be highly complex. A reverse merger, where Yahoo shareholders would be issued Facebook stock, isn't usually done on such a scale and would most likely need the assent of Yahoo's board. Facebook also has no M.& A. experience generally.
But it does have a management team led by its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, whom Yahoo shareholders would be delighted to put in charge. That alone should be sufficient incentive to at least study such a seemingly outlandish idea.
Dimon Is Off-Base
JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has made some good arguments against bad regulation. But his suggestion in an interview with The Financial Times that the United States opt out of ''anti-American'' Basel III rules undermines his case. If huge private sector banks are to avoid future government rescues, they need to hold more capital.
To be fair, Mr. Dimon supports the basic increase in capital for all banks under Basel III, to a minimum 7 percent ratio of core Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. What gets his goat is the extra capital buffer demanded of globally systemic banks -- a group that clearly includes JPMorgan. As Mr. Dimon outlined in this year's letter to shareholders, he thinks that would leave the bank with much more capital than it requires.
Moreover, he's right to highlight global inconsistencies in regulation. And while other chief executives surely protest in private about the mass of regulations they are trying to digest, the JPMorgan chief is one of the few willing to go public with his criticisms.
But there are some disconnects. First, giant globally active banks still benefit from implicit government support. Whatever the Dodd-Frank Act and equivalent legislation elsewhere says, markets show their faith in future bailouts by providing the biggest lenders with cheaper financing.
In order to counteract that subsidy and reduce the costs of future support, the largest banks need even bigger cushions against failure. What would really be anti-American would be for a giant United States bank to need more taxpayer cash. The need for an extra capital buffer might diminish if and when it's clear that a huge financial firm could be allowed to fail in an orderly way. But despite efforts to make that happen, it isn't yet credible.
Also, it's not as if JPMorgan's mostly European rivals don't face challenges of their own, including from even tougher new rules. Even China is embracing Basel III. Any Asian competitive threat surely comes more from the region's economic clout than supposed weaker rules. Mr. Dimon is often on the mark with his criticisms of regulation; this time, he's trying to have it both ways.

HEADLINE: U.S. Spending Billions on Rural Jobs, but Impact Is Uncertain

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is investing billions of dollars to promote economic development in rural areas by bringing broadband service and small-business financing to regions with chronic poverty and high unemployment.
But critics say the administration has little to show for its efforts, which highlight the difficulties of creating jobs in remote areas. They say the money has gone to areas where it is not needed, to promote broadband where it already exists and for industrial parks designed to attract business and jobs that may never materialize.
The Agriculture Department said it had provided more than $6.2 billion to help nearly 10,000 small and emerging rural businesses expand, creating or saving more than 250,000 jobs since 2009.
''Rural areas are important to our economic future,'' said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who heads the White House Rural Council, established in June to aid job creation by increasing the flow of capital to rural areas. ''It is important that people understand that a large portion of America gets its water, food, fuel from these areas.'' 
The government's figures for job creation or preservation are difficult to verify. Still, economists like Lionel Beaulieu, the director of the Southern Rural Development Center at Mississippi State University, said financing for rural programs might have prevented even deeper levels of poverty and unemployment.
''The truth is,'' Mr. Beaulieu said, ''we don't know how much worse it would have been if not for this funding.''
Either way, the government program underscores the slow, expensive work of job creation at a time when the administration is trying to make rural development a part of its economic recovery policy. While the nation suffers from high unemployment and a weak economy, rural areas have been especially hit hard. The latest Census Bureau figures show that 16.6 percent of rural Americans are living in poverty, compared with the national average of 13.9 percent.
Last month, President Obama took a three-state rural bus tour where he held town-hall-style meetings and spoke with local leaders. Also last month, the White House released a report, ''Jobs and Economic Security for Rural America,'' which promotes jobs creation efforts in rural areas and highlights spending on roads and bridges, broadband and small-business loans.
One project, in rural Mississippi, is a proposed industrial park for aerospace companies. The project has been highlighted by the administration because it focuses on regional development, rather than singling out a county or town.
With more than $30 million in federal grants and loans over the past two years, Lowndes County, Miss., has bought land and built roads and water and sewer lines to lure some of the largest companies in the world to the Global Industrial Aerospace Park in eastern Mississippi. Local officials say they hope the project, when completed, will employ up to 2,100 people and spread benefits into neighboring Alabama.
''Our goal is to bring in the kinds of high-paying jobs that you normally don't see in rural areas,'' said Joe Max Higgins Jr., an economic development official in Columbus, Miss.
The county wants to expand an existing park that houses several industries, including three aerospace companies.
''The Global Industrial Aerospace Park will be appealing to the many companies, both domestic and foreign, that work in this industry,'' Trina George, state director of the Agriculture Department Rural Development office in Jackson, Miss., said when the loan was announced in June. ''This will be a growing and important source of jobs.''
But critics like Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst with the Cato Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington, say industrial parks rarely fulfill their promise.
Mr. DeHaven said that as a budget official in Indiana he saw similar efforts to build industrial parks or to get businesses to expand and add jobs with government loans.
''And a lot of the time you ended up with empty fields and buildings and the jobs never materialized,'' he said. ''It's vote buying pure and simply.''
The president ''is in trouble with a bad economy and wants to look like he's doing something,'' Mr. DeHaven said.
He said that even if rural areas managed to get companies to relocate, they were not creating jobs, simply moving them from one area to another with the help of federal taxpayers.
Another highly promoted Obama administration project -- to bring broadband to rural areas -- has also drawn criticism. In its report, the rural council said it had expanded broadband service to more than seven million rural Americans, including three million rural households and more than 350,000 rural businesses.
Under the stimulus act, $7.2 billion was allocated for expanding broadband to unserved and underserved areas, most rural. A 2009 Agriculture Department inspector general report found that the agency had made loans to provide broadband in 148 communities ''within 30 miles of cities,'' including Chicago and Las Vegas, and that 77 percent of all loans had gone to areas that already had broadband access available through private companies.
A report the same year by Northwestern University found that expanding broadband service to rural areas often did not offer the economic benefits promised or contribute to increased salaries or the tax base or create jobs.
''That's not to say there is no benefit; there is some modest growth'' said Shane Greenstein, a co-author of the report and a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. ''But when you look at the data, it shows that the net benefit economically of bringing broadband to rural areas is small and arguably negative. Rural communities have a lot of issues, and broadband alone is not going to solve them.''
One of the biggest criticisms of rural development is that money may be going to areas that do not need it. Last year, rural development financing came under fire after the Indian tribe that runs the prosperous Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut, which had more than $1.3 billion in gross revenues in 2009, got a $54 million loan from the Agriculture Department to build a community center and tribal government office building. The Agriculture Department defended the loan, saying it would create jobs.
Mr. Vilsack said the administration wanted to ensure that rural communities could create jobs, attract businesses and provide necessary services to their residents.
He added that critics might have some valid points, particularly around the issue of bringing broadband to some rural areas where it would be too expensive. But in those areas, Mr. Vilsack said, the government has opted to finance cheaper means of Internet access like wireless or satellites.
''Still, broadband is essential to rural areas just as rural electrification was in the 1930s,'' he said.
Mr. Higgins, the economic official in Mississippi, said he was glad that the administration was putting the spotlight on rural economic development. He said he dismissed critics who say that government is wasting money by investing in Lowndes County's effort to attract aerospace companies.
''Companies that come in want to have land, water, sewer, everything ready to develop,'' Mr. Higgins said. ''It helps us move to the front of the line of places competing against us for the same companies.''

HEADLINE: In Britain, a Panel Urges a Sweeping Bank Overhaul

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
6:47 p.m. Updated
LONDON - As banks across Europe came under renewed pressure, Britain's government proposed a radical industry makeover on Monday that could cost the financial firms as much as 7 billion ($11 billion).
On Monday, the government-appointed Independent Commission on Banking called for banks to separate their deposit-taking operations from investment banking services, stopping short of completely breaking up the firms. The panel plans to give banks until 2019 to adapt to new rules intended to make the financial sector more stable, saying an ''extended implementation period would be appropriate.'' 
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said the commission, led by a former Bank of England chief economist, John Vickers, ''has done an excellent job.''
''John Vickers himself has set out a timetable and I intend to stick to that timetable,'' Mr. Osborne said.
Jon Pain, a partner at KPMG, called the proposals ''game changing'' and said they were ''a return to a more simple 1940s and '50s style of retail banking where it is perceived as more of a basic utility.''
The proposals, which go beyond banking reforms in the United States and elsewhere, are expected to lead to extensive lobbying from the banks before any final decisions on new rules are made by the British government.
Under the proposal, British banks would have to separate their businesses taking deposits and lending to consumers and businesses from groups involved in stocks, derivatives and equity and debt underwriting. The two subsidiaries would be separately capitalized, have different boards, different cultures and report results as if they were two different companies, the commission report said. Capital from the investment banking unit could be injected into the retail bank if needed, and the two businesses could share customers and expertise, the commission said.
Some banking executives have argued that the changes would hurt investors, the economy and industry competitions.
Banks with large investment banking operations, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, may be most affected by the new rules, some analysts have said. The separation could drive up their funding costs if investors and lenders perceived them as riskier. Spokesmen for the two banks declined to comment.
British banking stocks fell on Monday, with Barclays down 1.6 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland more than 3 percent, as markets were unnerved by the nagging prospect of a Greek default.
But the commission has argued that the benefits - particularly a healthier banking industry with less probability of government bailouts - would outweigh the short-term costs.
''Retail subsidiaries would be legally, economically and operationally separate from the rest of the banking groups to which they belonged,'' the commission said in its 360-page report. ''The improved stability that structural reform would bring to the U.K. economy would be positive for investment both in financial services and the wider economy.''
The 2019 deadline is about four years later than some analysts had expected; the new rules would be adopted after the next general election.
Prime Minister David Cameron has grown increasingly nervous that making major changes now could harm an already weak economic recovery, two government officials said last week. They declined to be identified because no final decision had been made.
Mr. Vickers warned the government that scrapping parts of the proposals or changing them in favor of the banks would be ''a great mistake.''
''The too-big-to-fail problem must not be recast as a too-delicate-to-reform problem,'' Mr. Vickers said.
''More stress for banks'' this year because of Europe's sovereign debt crisis ''underlines that the status quo is not an option,'' he said. ''Things will need to change.''
Ed Balls, the opposition Labor Party's candidate for the treasury position, said the commission put forward ''a tough and radical proposal'' and that ''the stalled recovery is not an excuse for ducking reform.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ban on E. Coli in Ground Beef Is to Extend to 6 More Strains

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The federal government will ban the sale of ground beef tainted with six toxic strains of E. coli bacteria that are increasingly showing up as the cause of severe illness from food. Officials have been under pressure from food safety advocates and some elected officials to do more to keep the potentially deadly bacteria out of meat, but the beef industry said the move was not needed and could force the price of ground beef to rise.
The new rule, which officials said would be announced on Tuesday, means that six relatively rare forms of E. coli will be treated the same as their notorious and more common cousin, a strain called E. coli O157:H7. That strain has caused deaths and illnesses and prompted the recall of millions of pounds of ground beef and other products. It was banned from ground beef in 1994 after an outbreak killed four children and sickened hundreds of people. 
''We're doing this to prevent illness and to save lives,'' said Dr. Elisabeth Hagen, the head of food safety for the Agriculture Department, which regulates meat. ''This is one of the biggest steps forward in the protection of the beef supply in some time.''
It is not illegal to sell fresh meat or poultry containing most toxic bacteria, like salmonella; they are frequently found on groceries' meat, and thorough cooking typically kills the pathogens. But since the 1994 outbreak, which involved hamburgers served at Jack in the Box restaurants, regulators have treated E. coli in ground beef differently.
Many people eat rare or undercooked ground beef, and if it is tainted, resulting illnesses can be deadly. Toxic E. coli, in its most common O157 form, is so virulent that just a few organisms can make people violently sick. The toxic E. coli live in the digestive tracts of cows and can get on meat during slaughter. It can cause bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps and, in severe cases, kidney failure.
In recent years, scientists found that several other strains of E. coli in food were also making people sick, and they identified the six most potent, called the Big Six non-O57s. Beginning at least four years ago, the U.S.D.A. began considering extending its ban to those additional toxic strains.
But the American Meat Institute, an industry group, has argued that safety measures already in place are sufficient. On Monday, the group was highly critical of the extended ban.
''Imposing this new regulatory program on ground beef will cost tens of millions of federal and industry dollars -- costs that likely will be borne by taxpayers and consumers,'' the group said in a statement. ''It is neither likely to yield a significant public health benefit nor is it good public policy.''
While several outbreaks caused by the Big Six strains have been linked to produce, the group pointed to the fact that only one has been related to ground beef. In that outbreak, last year, three people fell ill.
''It's just not supported by the science,'' James H. Hodges, the institute's executive vice president, said in an interview.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that E. coli strains other than O157:H7 cause nearly 113,000 illnesses each year, one-third of which can be attributed to tainted beef, according to U.S.D.A. officials. Until recently, few cases were reported, however, because most medical labs were not equipped to test for the less common forms.
The Agriculture Department will begin enforcing the rule in March, to give the meat industry time to prepare. The rule will apply to hamburger meat and trim or beef scraps that go into it, as well as some other products, like steaks that have been tenderized with machines that use needles to poke minute holes in the surface. Some meat processors have begun to test for the six strains in recent months in anticipation of federal action, and many others will most likely begin testing once the government begins its own testing.
Under the rule, raw meat containing the Big Six E. coli cannot be sold to the public. Currently, most packing plants divert meat containing E. coli O157:H7 for use in cooked products, and will most likely do the same with meat containing the new strains, as well. The bacteria is killed by heating the meat to 160 degrees.
While the new rule significantly expands the Agriculture Department's beef ban, it does not include all forms of toxic E. coli. A highly virulent strain of the bacteria that caused dozens of deaths among people who ate contaminated sprouts in Europe this summer is not one of the Big Six because it has not been detected as a cause of illness in the United States.
Dr. Hagen said the list of banned pathogens might grow. ''This is where we started and it doesn't rule out the possibility that we would consider other pathogens in the future,'' she said.
The new rule highlighted the patchwork and often confusing nature of food safety regulation, where most meat is under the jurisdiction of the U.S.D.A. while most other foods, including produce, are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The F.D.A. already considers it illegal to sell food containing any bacteria, including toxic forms of E. coli or other substances that could make people sick.
Dr. Hagen also said the rule did not conflict with the Obama administration's push to cut back on regulation that could increase costs for business at a time of economic hardship.
''There's really no inconsistency between having a strong economy and having a safe food supply,'' Dr. Hagen said. The U.S.D.A. estimated that the rule would cost the industry up to $10 million a year for testing and holding meat back from the fresh ground beef market.
''The amount this is going to cost is insignificant compared to the lives that will be saved,'' said Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, who pushed for the expanded rule.
After the U.S.D.A. banned the O157 form of E. coli from ground beef in 1994, the meat industry sued to block the move, but the agency prevailed in court.
Mr. Hodges, of the meat institute, said the group had yet to see a full version of the rule and would consult with its members before deciding how to respond.

HEADLINE: To Lift Stock, McGraw-Hill Splits in Two

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
7:27 p.m. Updated
McGraw-Hill said on Monday that it would break itself up, spinning off its education division to focus on its business information unit in an effort to lift its stagnant share price.
The remaining business will concentrate on the higher-growth operations of Standard & Poor's, along with the financial data provider Capital IQ and the energy and metals information service Platts. McGraw-Hill also said that it would cut costs and buy back $1 billion in stock this year.
The move may put pressure on other companies to evaluate the future of their own education arms. One such company facing questions from restive shareholders has been The Washington Post Company, which owns the Kaplan education business. 
This has been a busy year for corporate breakups, as companies try to generate greater returns for their shareholders despite sluggish markets and a weak economy. More than a dozen companies have announced plans for splits this year, including Sara Lee, Kraft Foods and ConocoPhillips.
Several, like Kraft and now McGraw-Hill, are splitting their operations into a high-growth operations and a lower-growth one that nonetheless generates steady profits and could pay a big dividend.
For McGraw-Hill, its announcement was the culmination of a business review it had conducted for nearly a year in response to shareholder complaints about the company's stock price. This summer, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan took a big stake in the company and added to the pressure for a major overhaul. Jana and the Canadian pension fund met with McGraw-Hill executives last month and presented a more ambitious breakup plan - a four-way split.
A representative for Jana said on Monday that the hedge fund was pleased by the company's actions, although it would ''review the scope and impact of these steps as well as other potential steps to unlock shareholder value.''
Still, a bigger breakup of McGraw-Hill is not on the table, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
In a conference call, Harold McGraw III, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said, ''Today's announcement is a significant milestone - one more - in the history of our 122-year-old company, which has always been dedicated to the growth of societies and the advancement of knowledge.'' McGraw-Hill shares rose 4 percent, to $40.26, on Monday.
Analysts have estimated that if the company split off it various parts, including the education unit, the collective share prices could trade as much as 20 percent higher.
In spinning off the education unit, McGraw-Hill is shedding one of its best-known businesses. Begun in 1888 with The American Journal of Railway Appliances, the company has since grown into a sprawling publishing conglomerate with education, media and financial data units.
Many of those operations arose from acquisitions. McGraw-Hill bought an academic publisher in 1952 to help form its education business, while it bought Platts in 1953 and Standard & Poor's in 1966. The company acquired J.D. Power and Associates, the research service, in 2005.
Putting all those businesses under one roof has obscured their individual values, investors have argued. McGraw-Hill's current core is S.&P., which has produced double-digit revenue and profit growth. By contrast, the education business lost money last quarter.
S.&P., however, is facing other issues. The ratings agency was cast in an uncomfortable spotlight earlier this summer when it lowered its credit rating on the United States. The Justice Department is looking into its ratings of subprime mortgage securities, while the company's former president, Deven Sharma, stepped down late last month.
Peter Appert, a senior research analyst with Piper Jaffray, wrote in a research note on Monday that the steps McGraw-Hill outlined ''make strategic sense'' and will help close the gap between where share prices currently trade and the $48 his team thinks the company is worth.
The argument for a total breakup was that individually each of the businesses would trade at higher values. But McGraw-Hill argued that the remaining four businesses would complement one another and appeal to customers seeking a wide array of services.
''These four businesses are more valuable together than separate,'' Mr. McGraw said in an interview.
Breaking up the remaining businesses into components could create several weaker companies that would have trouble competing on their own, the company said. And selling them could generate high corporate taxes for the company, it said.
Still, McGraw-Hill, which is in the process of selling off several television stations, may consider divesting smaller assets, the people briefed on the matter said.
Under the terms of the plan, McGraw-Hill will become McGraw-Hill Markets, which is expected to have $4 billion in revenue this year, with about 40 percent of that coming from international operations. That business will continue to be led by Mr. McGraw.
The education business, McGraw-Hill Education, is expected to generate $2.4 billion in revenue this year. It will be led by its current president, Robert J. Bahash, until the newly formed company finds a chief executive.
McGraw-Hill began contemplating its options for raising its stock price last fall, and in March it hired the investment bank Evercore Partners to advise it on a possible spinoff of the education unit.
The company expects to complete the spinoff by the end of next year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fears Rattle Big Banks In France

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
PARIS -- French banks moved toward the center of the European debt storm Monday as investor concern about their ability to handle a potential Greek default raised the possibility that France's government might need to shore up the banks' financial positions.
Even as French officials proclaimed that the country's banks were sound, shares in BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, two globally connected French banks considered ''too big to fail'' by their home government, slid as much as 12 percent. And their cost of short-term borrowing continued to soar, making it more expensive for them to finance day-to-day operations.
The looming question is whether the French government will have to step in to support its banks, much as the American government did during the financial crisis in September 2008. Then, as now, a retreat by nervous investors threatened the banks' liquidity. Back then the United States responded by guaranteeing various types of loans to the banks to keep the financial system operating.
French officials on Monday took pains to say they stood behind the banks. Seeking to reassure investors, France's central bank governor, Christian Noyer, said in a statement, ''No matter what the Greek scenario, and whatever measures must be passed, French banks have the means to face up to it.'' 
But behind the scenes, the French government is preparing for all eventualities. If a recapitalization becomes necessary to restore investor confidence in any French bank -- even if the banks do not technically require new capital -- then the government will be prepared to take such action, said a senior government finance official involved in managing the situation, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Given the need for France, along with Germany, to play a central role if the European debt crisis is to be resolved, the perceived stability of the biggest French banks is a crucial issue.
And big American banks, which do extensive business with BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, want to know their French counterparts are sound. Over the last month, the French banks have found it increasingly expensive to secure short-term loans in dollars for their United States dealings, while their cost of short-term borrowing in general has soared. And the cost of insuring against default of the banks' own bonds has spiked to record levels in recent weeks.
Efforts to calm investors was to little avail on Monday, as the French market slumped even more deeply than most other European exchanges. United States stock indexes, after being down for most of the trading session on Monday, ended up for the day.
French officials sought to flood the airwaves on Monday with reassuring statements, the second time in a month they came out swinging to combat the perception of problems. Last month, the government also scrambled to show that the nation's AAA sovereign rating was intact, after the Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States debt caused nervous investors to question France's standing.
On Monday, the question of whether the French state might need to nationalize its banks in the event of further turmoil was met with an unequivocal ''non''-- at least for now.
''It is totally premature to discuss'' even a partial nationalization of French banks, the French industry minister, Eric Besson, assured the country in an early morning television interview.
Societe Generale announced Monday it would raise new cash by selling off assets. Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, along with a third bank, Credit Agricole, are considered integral actors in the French economy. They lend billions of euros to businesses and individuals, and the government has said it will never let any of them fail.
France's financial watchdogs are monitoring the bank situation closely, officials said, as is President Nicolas Sarkozy, who would be loath to see one of the banks stumble to the point where a merger or takeover might be required before the French presidential election next spring.
Still, the government is preparing reassurances in case depositors start to worry too much about the safety of their money, said a French banker who has been involved in discussions with the government, but was not authorized to speak publicly.
Thierry Dissaux, the chief executive of the French Deposit Insurance Fund, said bank deposits in France were insured up to 100,000 euros per individual and business. But Mr. Dissaux said it was unlikely the fund would be tapped during the crisis.
''The worries over the health of the French banking system are beyond reason,'' he said during an interview.
Some investors agree. David Thebault, the head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris, said that his company had started snapping up Societe Generale shares, considering them a bargain. The stock, which closed Monday at 15.57 euros, was trading above 52 as recently as February.
Despite a failure by the Group of 7 finance ministers to take any specific action to mitigate Europe's crisis at a meeting this weekend in Marseille, many investors now expect the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities to step in with various measures to pump more liquidity into the financial system if markets remain volatile and economic conditions continue to deteriorate.
The banks, and Societe Generale especially, suspect that their shares have come under attack from speculators betting that the share price will decline -- something that the government decided to investigate last month when the stock of Societe Generale fell 21 percent in a single trading day before recovering. The government also imposed a temporary ban on investors betting against the shares of France's major banks and insurance companies.
But those efforts have not convinced investors. On Monday, new problems came as concern mounted that Moody's Investors Service might downgrade French banks because of their exposure to Greek sovereign debt.
Societe Generale issued yet another statement to calm nerves, this time saying it held relatively little in the way of troubled government bonds from Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal or Spain. It said it was increasing efforts to reduce costs and strengthen its balance sheet, and that it planned to free up $4 billion of capital by 2013 through the sale of assets.
French banks hold fewer Greek government bonds than Italian banks do, though they hold more than German banks, which sold many of these assets early in the Greek crisis. Societe Generale has only about 2 billion euros and Credit Agricole 800 million euros worth of Greek bonds, compared with about 4 billion euros held by BNP Paribas.
Societe Generale and Credit Agricole, however, have greater exposure to the Greek banking system because they each bought a retail banking subsidiary there during the boom years, when expansion was the trend. Should the Greek banking system falter -- a certainty if Greece defaults on its debts -- both French banks would be in trouble, analysts say.

HEADLINE: Wary Investors Start to Shun European Banks

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and GRAHAM BOWLEY; Eric Dash and Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When a $225 million loan to BNP Paribas comes due Thursday at Legg Mason's Western Asset management unit, managers at its money market funds will be exercising caution. Instead of renewing the loan as they would have as recently as two months ago, they are looking to park investors' money elsewhere, avoiding BNP and other Continental banks in favor of institutions in Scandinavia, Canada and Britain.
Even as European investors race to abandon shares in French banks, on this side of the Atlantic, banks, brokerages and other American financial institutions are quietly reducing their exposure too, turning down requests for fresh loans from the euro currency region and seeking alternative investments.
In August, American money funds and other suppliers of short-term credit chose not to refinance roughly $50 billion of debt issued by European banks, a drop of 14 percent, according to JPMorgan research. Traders are so worried that they are forcing French banks like Societe Generale and BNP Paribas to pay more to borrow dollars -- and they often can do so only for a week or less. 
''Money market managers in the U.S. continue to prune risk,'' said Alex Roever, who tracks short-term credit markets for JPMorgan Chase. ''The issue is headline risk; fund managers may be comfortable with the banks' credit, but many are hearing from shareholders worried by what they have read about French banks.''
Unlike their American counterparts, France's biggest banks are more dependent on short-term funding. Money market funds in the United States have been among the biggest lenders, lending $161 billion to French banks in August, although that is down 39 percent from a month earlier.
''It hasn't been a wholesale pullback,'' Mr. Roever said. In 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers -- when a key money market fund sustained huge losses on Lehman debt and investors started pulling their money out of the funds -- he said, ''everybody shut off at once. It was like a cliff. This time the pullback has been more gradual.''
It's not just money market funds that are getting cold feet.
On Wall Street, some big American banks have become wary of derivatives tied to French banks like Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, several traders said. The two French giants are major international players in the derivatives arena, so a pullback would hurt egos and the bottom line of both companies. Derivatives are investment instruments whose value is tied to another underlying security.
And since last month, according to several bankers who insisted on anonymity, hedge funds and other firms have also withdrawn hundreds of millions of dollars from prime brokerage accounts held at French banks. Prime brokers hold assets for hedge funds and other investors, while providing loans for increased leverage on their bets.
While still small, this kind of transfer echoes the larger move hedge funds made as Lehman teetered in 2008, when a tidal wave of withdrawals helped sink the bank.
Not everyone is anxious. Some money market giants like Fidelity and Federated Investors are sticking with French banks despite the increased anxiety. At Federated, which has $114 billion under management in prime money market funds, about 13 to 17 percent of assets remain invested in French bank debt, according to Deborah Cunningham, a senior portfolio manager at Federated.
''We're always rethinking it and assessing it, but we've not come up with a different answer,'' she said. ''We don't feel there's any jeopardy with regard to repayment.''
At Fidelity, which manages a total of $428 billion, Adam Banker, a spokesman, said, ''We're very comfortable with our money market funds' European bank holdings, including French bank holdings.'' As capital becomes more costly or scarce for European banks, the resulting rise in their borrowing costs risks impairing their own ability to lend, economists warn. That threatens to undermine the general economic growth prospects of already-weakened nations like Italy and France, which in turn would make the banks' position worse.
''There is a paucity of capital in the European banking system,'' said Eric Green, an economist at TD Securities. ''There is crisis fatigue in Paris and Berlin. Now there is some question about how much they are prepared to go to the mat to save Greece from default.''
In another sign of the strain, Societe Generale put out an unusual announcement on Monday morning revealing it had more than halved its unsecured dollar funding to $33 billion euros, from $72 billion euros in early July. That has forced the bank to look elsewhere for dollars to finance its operations, including the foreign exchange markets.
With French and other European banks chasing dollars, the cost of swapping euros for dollars three months from now has spiked. The so-called foreign exchange basis swap is where European banks are increasingly being forced to turn as other forms of dollar funding dry up. It has risen to about 112 basis points, or 1.12 percent. It had stood at 28 basis points in late July.
That is painfully high, but still far below the 200 basis points, or 2 percent, it reached in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. And that's after a number of emergency support measures undertaken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to ensure that global financial institutions do not run short on dollars.
Another indicator of heightened concern is the increasing cost of insuring European bank debt through credit-default swaps, which rose to records, said Otis C. Casey, director of credit research at Markit.
The Markit iTraxx senior financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers rose to about 3.15 percent after being at about 1.77 percent at the end of July. That means it now costs $315,000 a year to insure $10 million in bank debt for five years; at the end of July, the cost was $177,000.
For French banks, the cost is even greater. Credit-default swaps on Credit Agricole reached a record of 3.25 percent Monday, up from 1.11 percent in April. Similar instruments to insure debt of Societe Generale stood at 4.5 percent, compared with 1.07 percent in April.
The cost of insuring European sovereign debt now stands at its highest level since September 2009. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-default swaps on 15 governments increased to around 3.57 percent -- it had stood at 1.57 percent in April, according to Mr. Casey.
At the epicenter of the problem -- Greece -- the cost of insuring $10 million worth of Greek debt now equals $5.7 million, a new high, underscoring how the market is already factoring in the likelihood of a Greek default.
For now, the market is signaling that the risks are likely to loom larger for European institutions than banks in the United States. Still, the longer the uncertainty persists, the more investors on both sides of the Atlantic will feel jittery. What's more, regulators do not fully know just how much of a risk derivatives tied to European banks pose for American firms.
''Because of the uncertainty with the Germans, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, you're not going to see an easy, quick resolution,'' said Mr. Roever of JPMorgan. ''This is a problem that isn't going away soon.''

HEADLINE: Going Out With A Bunga

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
Florence, Italy
September has been Italy's most uncertain month, with questions about whether the Parliament will pass an austerity package, if that package will be stringent enough and how Europe's fiscal stewards will react.
There's also this: what sort of celebration will the country's epically libidinous emperor -- sorry, prime minister -- orchestrate for his 75th birthday? Silvio Berlusconi's big milestone is about two weeks away, and you have to assume he'll pull out all the stops, but you also have to wonder what stops are left to be pulled. The man hasn't been shy about sating himself.
As we now know, thanks to his current trial on charges of paying for sex with a minor, he regularly assembles veritable harems of young women for bacchanals with a dress code that could be described as whimsical. He calls them ''bunga bunga'' parties, which has no particular translation and no need of one. The hormonal gist comes through. 
The bunga allegations grabbing headlines last week were that Berlusconi, in moments of pulchritudinous piety, was treated to lap dances from women attired as nuns. This followed claims that he received ministrations from women outfitted as nurses. And it's said that Italy is a chauvinistic society! For Berlusconi, no profession is beyond a woman's pantomime.
We Americans have found great entertainment in all of this -- lengthy Berlusconi exposes appeared recently in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair -- because it's lurid, yes, but also because it's reassuring. Our own political madness pales beside his triple-X opera buffa.
But we shouldn't just gape and laugh. His country's path from glorious to ridiculous, paved in part by his carnal and legal distractions, threatens the financial stability of Europe, and benefits no one. Beyond that, Italy presents a cautionary tale for many immodestly privileged Western democracies that have been lulled by comfort into complacency; have let too much silliness create too much damage; and haven't held leaders to adequate account.
Our is one of them. America is in some ways a petit guignol version of Italy. We also coast on the accomplishments of yesteryear. Also neglect our infrastructure. Also watch young people struggle. Also waste precious time while lawmakers behave in petty, self-serving fashions. Also let money corrupt politics.
Money is Berlusconi's lance, his armor, his steed, his everything. A billionaire many times over, he uses it to engender loyalty, and his business empire reaches deep into the image-burnishing and opinion-manipulating realms of television, journalism and publishing. At the end of a long interview years ago, he asked me if a recent book of mine had been distributed in Italy. It hadn't.
''Would you like it to be?'' he said.
But Italians have had his number for a while, and have seen their country's economy stagnate and debt rise over the last decade. And Berlusconi, in power for much of the last 17 years, has made minimal progress on necessary tax, regulatory and entitlement reforms.
So how does he last? I asked many smart, concerned Italians that question, and was told that Italians have been too slow to take a hard enough look at his shenanigans, and allowed him to entrench himself.
The opposition, meantime, hasn't mustered the maturity to move past its fractiousness and make him go away.
''The fact remains that there's no alternative,'' Giuliano Pisapia, Milan's new mayor, told me. Milan is a Berlusconi stronghold, and yet Pisapia unseated a Berlusconi loyalist, proving the prime minister's vulnerability. But nationally, Pisapia doesn't see someone poised to supplant Berlusconi.
In a country with such treasure and beauty, maybe hardship is dulled and the situation hasn't become quite bad enough.
I asked Mario Calabresi, a celebrated Italian journalist, why young Italians, whose unemployment rate is estimated to be about 27 percent, weren't protesting on the scale of the ''indignados,'' or indignant, who crowd public squares in Spain. He said it was partly because their parents remain affluent enough to supply them with money for clothes, clubs and beach vacations, at least for now.
''You're indignado, but not so indignado that you'd rather go to the square than to the restaurant,'' he said as we sipped espresso on a cobbled piazza in Turin.
Still he hasn't given up his belief that Italians will pull it together. Neither has the mayor of Florence, Matteo Renzi, an emerging center-left star.
''If Italians decide they really want to change 20 years of immobility, silence and political scandals, we have a future,'' he said Monday in his Palazzo Vecchio office, whose walls and ceiling are covered in magnificent frescoes.
''It's not easy to work here,'' he added, ''because you're surrounded by the past. But I want to believe the most beautiful page in Florence's history hasn't been written.'' I hope that's true for all of Italy. For us, too.

HEADLINE: Relations With China

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s article about China (''China's Rise Isn't Our Demise,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 8) doesn't mention key facts about our dysfunctional economic relationship with Beijing. 
First, the United States trade deficit with China is rising. Second, the Peterson Institute on International Economics estimates that the yuan is more undervalued today (28.5 percent) than it was a year ago (24.2 percent).
Third, China's rise so far has come at America's expense. The trade deficit with China has reduced America's gross domestic product. Private-sector job creation, particularly in manufacturing, reached a post-World War II low last decade. Multinational companies are shifting both production and innovation to China.
Lulling the American people into a false sense of security is both dangerous and politically tone-deaf. A recent poll shows that many Americans believe that China has the world's strongest economy. It's time for the administration to show that if China wants our respect, it needs to earn it by honoring the rules of international trade.

HEADLINE: As Perry Rises, G.O.P. Elite Look Toward Romney

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- The rising presidential candidacy of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is stirring excitement for many Republican voters but is creating unease in some quarters of the party's establishment, particularly over his views of Social Security, which are at the root of an intensifying competition with Mitt Romney.
The decision on Monday by Tim Pawlenty, a former Republican presidential rival, to support Mr. Romney's campaign signals the beginning of an effort by some party leaders to try to slow the ascent of Mr. Perry -- or to push him to explain positions that are considered provocative.
In announcing his endorsement on Monday, Mr. Pawlenty said he believed Mr. Romney was the only candidate with the ''unique qualifications to confront and master our severe economic predicament.'' The judgment of Mr. Pawlenty, who dropped out of the presidential race last month, was carefully watched by some Republicans because he knows both men well. 
The endorsement was a visible marker in a quietly continuing battle for the soul and direction of the Republican Party between traditional party leaders and grass-roots conservatives. To some degree it is a clash of styles and of principle versus pragmatism, but it also encompasses foreign and domestic policy differences, some of which have surfaced as the presidential campaign has intensified.
The comments Mr. Perry has made about Social Security -- questioning its financial footing and its constitutionality -- were at the center of a Republican presidential debate here Monday night.
The intense focus on the topic has caused anxiety among some Republicans working to win a Senate majority and keep control of the House next year.
''The people who are on Social Security today, they need to understand something,'' Mr. Perry said at the outset of a contentious exchange at the debate. ''Slam-dunk guaranteed. That program is going to be there for them when they arrive there.''
Over and over again, Mr. Romney directed questions directly at his rival: ''Do you still believe that Social Security should be ended as a federal program like you did six months ago?''
The balancing act between the Republican establishment and the activists who have gained prominence in the Tea Party movement has been unfolding for nearly two years, testing a party that wants to corral its enthusiasm without alienating moderate voters. But the 2012 campaign is the first presidential race to take place since the Tea Party began influencing the composition of the Republican electorate.
While many party leaders are taking a wait-and-see approach before choosing sides in the presidential primary, Republican advisers to House and Senate campaigns said they were not eager for Social Security to become a central theme in their races next year. Several Republicans have said they are waiting for a series of debates to play out before making a decision.
One month after declaring his bid for the Republican nomination, Mr. Perry has solidified an early edge in polls. But his popularity among activists has not been widely echoed by the party establishment, which is at odds with how races often unfold.
Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, said the party's nominee needed to connect with suburban voters -- moderates and independents -- if he or she wanted to defeat President Obama next year. Mr. Roskam said Mr. Perry, whose state includes many suburban communities, ''knows how to do it,'' but added that as a presidential candidate his comments about Social Security and other issues might not play well.
''Those suburban voters are going to have an incredible amount of influence in this cycle,'' Mr. Roskam said.
Vin Weber, a former member of Congress from Minnesota, backed Mr. Pawlenty and is now supporting Mr. Romney. Mr. Weber said there was ''deep concern'' inside the Republican Party about nominating someone like Mr. Perry, who has had limited experience appealing to independents and moderate voters who often decide elections.
''What I think you are seeing is that it's partially establishment versus Tea Party, there's no question about that,'' said Mr. Weber, who is now a Washington lobbyist. He added, ''How concerned should we be? People I talk to are concerned.''
Hours after Mr. Pawlenty announced his endorsement of Mr. Romney, the Perry campaign said it had secured the support of Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who traveled to Florida to attend the Republican debate. Mr. Jindal said the economic record that Mr. Perry had built in Texas would hold strong appeal for Republican voters.
''Rick Perry is the candidate who can lead our party to victory in 2012,'' Mr. Jindal said. ''His record on job creation simply cannot be beat.''
But a large share of governors, members of Congress and donors are still watching the campaign from a distance, with a mix of curiosity and concern about the rise of Mr. Perry. They admire his ability to connect with voters, particularly with those in the Tea Party movement, but they have raised concerns about his ability to appeal to moderate voters in the general election.
Mr. Romney was quick to embrace the endorsement from Mr. Pawlenty -- aides to Mr. Perry conceded that they, too, had pursued it -- but it remained an open question what effect, if any, it would have on the campaign.
Justin Sayfie, who was a co-chairman of the Pawlenty campaign in Florida, said Monday that he was surprised by the timing of Mr. Pawlenty's endorsement of Mr. Romney. Mr. Sayfie said he intended to make his own decision after following the next two debates in the state.
''I'm going to take it into consideration,'' he said.
Mr. Pawlenty dropped out of the race after a third-place finish last month at the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa and has a campaign debt of at least $500,000 that he is trying to retire, a task for which Mr. Romney's top donors have pledged help.
In a campaign appearance in South Carolina on Monday, Mr. Pawlenty described Mr. Romney as the ''most capable, most electable, most knowledgeable candidate by far in the race.'' Those words were not always how Mr. Pawlenty characterized Mr. Romney. He had criticized Mr. Romney's Massachusetts health care plan, referring to the program as ''Obamneycare.''
But since Mr. Pawlenty ended his candidacy on Aug. 14, he has talked frequently to Mr. Romney. The two men, along with their wives, spent an evening together recently at Mr. Romney's home in New Hampshire.
''My sense was that if we had to have someone else become the nominee that wasn't me, I thought that he would be the best guy to be that nominee,'' Mr. Romney said Monday. ''The fact that it didn't work out for him the way he wanted it to meant that it was probably a pretty natural thing for us to get together.''

HEADLINE: German Leader Faces Key Choices On Rescuing Euro

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- As Europe struggles to reverse a plunge in financial confidence, the world waits for Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, to make a fundamental choice. She, more than any other European politician, will have to either summon the leadership to rescue the euro or concede that the political will is not there.
Mrs. Merkel, 57, faces far-reaching decisions about how to deal definitively with the debt crisis in Europe and, more immediately, whether to allow Greece to default or even to leave the currency union. American officials fear that if she does not act more decisively, bank lending could freeze up and the result would be another sharp financial downturn on both sides of the Atlantic.
Fears of a worsening debt crisis slammed European stocks on Monday, especially shares of French banks, forcing the French government to declare its support for its three largest financial institutions. The turmoil added to worries that the Greek crisis would prove difficult to contain without more robust action from Germany and, ultimately, its taxpayers. 
The project of European integration, which began in the difficult years after World War II, is also on the line. If Greece were forced to abandon the euro, as more and more voices on the German right are demanding, it would be a jarring setback for solidarity on the Continent.
Critics say Mrs. Merkel has focused too much on protecting her political standing inside Germany, placing her position as chancellor above the need for bold, risk-taking leadership to rescue the European currency zone. But that would mean sinking more German money into an ever-deepening economic union that voters have shown an antipathy for.
Her governing coalition is already splintering over the Greece bailout, and her party, the Christian Democratic Union, has suffered setbacks in state elections, including this month in the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, where her parliamentary home district is located. Her father died in the stretch run heading into that election, adding personal anguish to a politically fraught moment.
Mrs. Merkel's efforts to please both sides on the question of the debt crisis -- through stern talk about Greece's failure and profligacy on the one hand and a series of conditional debt guarantees to prop up Europe's problem child on the other -- have succeeded in ultimately pleasing neither.
Supporters argue that Mrs. Merkel has worked in a typically low-profile, methodical fashion to make the best of a difficult situation, winning passage for unpopular bailouts while wringing greater fiscal responsibility from the most heavily indebted nations.
The resignation Friday of Jurgen Stark, a German member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, and the second significant German figure at the bank to leave its governing council this year, offered a window into the intensity of German opposition to the steps Germany and the central bank have already taken in bailing out the weaker southern nations.
''The chasm between what is needed in terms of economic policy and what is possible in terms of domestic politics and party politics has widened,'' said Cornelius Adebahr, a Europe expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. ''She needs to show stronger leadership, but so far she hasn't even revealed in what direction she really wants to move.''
Events appear to be forcing Mrs. Merkel to tip her hand. With the latest market assault this week on French financial institutions, the spillover from the debt crisis has now reached the German border. With first Italy and now France affected, problems once dismissed as confined to the distant periphery of Greece and Portugal have arrived at the core of Europe, and with them unavoidable questions about the continent's future.
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, her buoyant, antic foil, hopes to draw Mrs. Merkel into deeper commitments to an economic government for the currency zone, once again making France and Germany the motor of European integration that the two countries have been since their reconciliation after World War II. And if France's struggles are not enough to prod Germany and its phlegmatic leader to take bold action, analysts say, it is likely that nothing will.
''We've been pretending for a year and a half that the Greek crisis could be solved this way, but it's not the case and this has created uncertainty,'' said Guntram B. Wolff, deputy director of Bruegel, a research organization based in Brussels.
The latest volatility and vulnerability in European markets may well mark the end of Mrs. Merkel's efforts to straddle the fence between shielding Greece from default and avoiding an irrevocable step toward deeper economic and fiscal union between the euro zone countries.
The prolonged state of confusion and uncertainty may be as bad or even worse than the underlying problems themselves.
''If they would agree on a specific solution, say to the default of Greece, I would see a relatively low likelihood that the euro zone would also default or be destroyed,'' said Michael Schroder, head of the research department of international finance at the Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany. ''What's really a danger is this chaos which we have at the moment.''
To observers outside Germany, the stern chancellor appears strong, but unwilling to act decisively. Inside Germany she sits atop a fractious and increasingly unreliable coalition of three parties -- her Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union of Bavaria and the pro-business Free Democrats.
France, as a presidential republic with a majority party in Parliament, has fewer domestic political problems than Germany, with its federal system and negotiated coalitions. But Mr. Sarkozy knows that he cannot move without Germany. Much as the two leaders do not like each other and have radically different personalities, Mr. Sarkozy has sought to ensure that France and Germany move as one, and that he is outwardly supportive of Berlin.
Much hinges on getting all 17 nations in the euro zone to ratify the decisions of July 21, as the French Parliament has done, which includes an increase in the bailout fund and an expansion of its powers. Those decisions would already mark a shift in Germany's harder-line positions on the euro.
An expanded European Financial Stability Facility would be able to act as a kind of bank, supported by all the members. It would be a significant step toward using Europe's collective clout with debt markets to rescue countries with much weaker standing.
Dedicated supporters of the European project agitate for a centralized fiscal union, more like the United States, to replace Europe's current hybrid structure, in which member countries use a common currency even as they determine spending and debt levels on their own. But it is no longer clear whether Mrs. Merkel can even muster the votes to pass the Greek bailout deal reached in July, much less win backing for bold new steps.
In recent days, many of Mrs. Merkel's conservative and free-market allies in Parliament and even respected German economists have grown ever harsher in their condemnations of Greece. The drumbeat from the right to not only cut off aid, but indeed force Greece out of the euro zone, has grown ever louder.
Eurobonds -- issuing common European debt that any member of the currency zone could tap -- is one popular solution among European Union officials in Brussels.
But analysts say that if forced to choose, the Free Democrats in all likelihood would vote no on them, a parliamentary defeat that could well bring down her government.
''That,'' Mr. Adebahr said, ''would be the end of the road.''

HEADLINE: The India Growth Story: Glass Half Full or Half Empty?

BYLINE: VIVEK DEHEJIA


HIGHLIGHT: The about-face on India's economic forecast is remarkable for the speed in which analysts have reversed themselves.

 BODY:
Reading the foreign and domestic newspapers these days, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the bloom has come off the rose of the India growth story. For instance, a leading Indian business daily, Mint, recently ran a series questioning India's future growth prospects, and pointing to the unfinished economic reform agenda. 
And a few weeks before that, a leading international business weekly, The Economist, made a similar case.
What is remarkable about this shift is not so much that it has happened, but rather how quickly it has come. Indeed, The Economist, as recently as a year ago, was predicting that India was poised to overtake China's double-digit growth rate. 
So what has changed?
After a long spell of boosterish coverage of India's skyrocketing GDP, commentators have noticed the faltering and uneven liberalization of the economy, and the apparent inability of the squabbling Indian political class to forge a durable consensus around a further economic reform agenda.
This change of tone is emblematic of increasing skepticism about India, both at home and abroad. 
Yet, it is hard to see how the facts on the ground have changed so much in the past year. In terms of "news," the only significant items have been the persistence of high inflation and a slight downgrade of the growth forecast for the coming fiscal year, hardly enough to turn such bullish coverage bearish, so quickly.
A simple calculation based on textbook growth theory suggests that, with a domestic savings rate of 35 percent, and an incremental capital-output ratio of 4, the economy's supply-side growth potential is 8.75 percent, well within the statistical margin of error of medium-term growth forecasts.
The current downturn can thus best be explained by a transitory drop on the demand side, transmitted from the economic woes in Europe and the United States, and high world commodity prices, which simultaneously help to explain high and persistent inflation - which, in any case, is a bugbear in most emerging market economies. 
Perspective is useful. India's growth trajectory has always been messy. The first phase of economic reform in 1991 came not because of a liberal change of heart in India's socialist elite but at the point of a gun: the country faced economic collapse.
Further reforms have invariably been accomplished opportunistically and by stealth, rather than by planning and premeditation, leaving them haphazard and incomplete.
The commitment of India's political elite to an Anglo-American economic model centered on the dominant role of private capital and largely unfettered market competition is weak, if, indeed, it exists at all. Such is often the case in large, poor democracies, in which redistribution generally trumps growth, not just in India. Populist politics is, after all, the obverse side of a thriving democracy.
So what is going on? Is it simply a matter of perspective -- first seeing the glass half full, and now half empty?
The reforms of 1991 and after, partial though they were, did unshackle the economy, which began to take off, and has continued to grow robustly, if not spectacularly. There was, perhaps, just cause for celebration that India's success could point the way to other emerging countries the world over. There is a viable democratic alternative to the Chinese model, the message seemed to say; if authoritarian and repressive China can grow at 10%, then noisy and democratic India growing at 8 percent is great news indeed.
What seems to have turned the narrative in recent months, and tempered the enthusiasm, is the realization that rapid growth, in a poorly regulated economy presided over by a weak state, is invariably accompanied by growing inequalities of wealth and income, rampant corruption, and political capture by a class of well-connected operators who are cronies first, capitalists second.
It is now becoming an indispensable trope of the revised India story to argue that the country is replicating the experience of America's "Gilded Age," with the many new billionaires who made their money through proximity to power, rather than productivity and innovation, standing in for the "robber barons" of yesteryear. 
The trouble is, India has not even begun to undertake the regulatory reforms that the United States accomplished in the half-century following its Gilded Age, to say nothing of completing the unfinished economic reform agenda. Yes, India may continue to stumble along at a growth rate of 8 percent, but much more unequally, and with egregiously higher corruption, than it might otherwise.
To put it another way, to achieve and sustain 10 percent growth, the Indian economy will need to boost the investment rate to 40 percent. Domestic savings cannot, nor should, rise much further - as 35 percent is about the most that the economy can manage, and is also close to what economists reckon is "optimal," in the sense of trading off present versus future consumption.
The gap of 5 percent will therefore have to be filled by foreign investment. This, in turn, will require that India move beyond its improvised, patchwork model, and forge a political consensus around broader and deeper economic and regulatory reforms, in addition to modernizing its creaky infrastructure. All of this, and more, will be necessary to entice jittery foreign investors, and placate domestic ones, too.
Until then, whether the glass is half full or half empty will depend, after all, on just how thirsty you are.

HEADLINE: Bursting the 'Nutty Bubble'

BYLINE: GUY TREBAY


HIGHLIGHT: People who spend a lot of time around the luxury-goods trade live in what Linda Fargo, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, termed the other day "a nutty bubble.''

 BODY:
People who spend a lot of time around the luxury-goods trade live in what Linda Fargo, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, termed the other day "a nutty bubble.'' While the world outside the Fashion Week tents teeters on the economic brink, the people inside them teeter around on shoes, she said, for which they think nothing of spending $1,500 a pair. 
Business this season has been strong at Bergdorf Goodman, Ms. Fargo says. Statistics indicate that this is true throughout the entire luxury-goods sector. A front-page article in The New York Times last month noted that Nordstrom had a waiting list for a Chanel sequined tweed coat with a $9,000 price tag; Neiman Marcus had sold out almost every size in a particular $775 Christian Louboutin shoe; and Mercedes-Benz had sold more cars in July than it had in any other July in the last five years. 
No one wants to be a buzz-wrecker during Fashion Week, when designers and everyone else is struggling to lift the industry out of the doldrums -- or anyway to distract the average consumer from stubbornly high unemployment, the reality that the top 1 percent of Americans now earn roughly 18 percent of all income, and that with poverty rates at their highest levels in 27 years, those Louboutin platform pumps are probably not for you.
Like Las Vegas casinos, where legend has it that they pump in oxygen to keep gamblers spending, the atmosphere inside the "nutty bubble" of the Lincoln Center tents can make you feel a little stoned. By the time the 100th Birkin bag has strolled past, it seems normal that a person might spend $8,000, the starter price for this Hermes classic, on a handbag. It stops being odd when one hears a person boast of having snagged a pair of high-waist Yves Saint Laurent trousers for just $1,590 online at Net-a-Porter. 
Since the Columbus Circle subway stop is just a short walk from Lincoln Center and 59th Street, it is also a stop away from 125th Street on the A, so this reporter quit the tents on Monday and took a quick ride to Harlem to check out the retailing scene there. 
American households spend on average well under $2,000 a year on clothing. A lot of that money is handed over not at Bergdorf Goodman but in places like the Nicole boutique on 125th Street near St. Nicholas Avenue. On Monday, a line of shoppers waited there outside the dressing room to try on jersey dresses that cost $9.99, or belted knit outfits no less appealing than some of the stuff on the current runways, though at a cost of $19.99.
It struck this reporter that what it lacked in atmosphere, Nicole made up for as a corrective to some of the disorienting hype around Fashion Week. Neat and tidy and basic, with long rows of price-coded racks, the boutique has just one mirror, which, as it happened, seemed to offer a clear and welcome reflection of the real world.

HEADLINE: The Death of the Confidence Fairy

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: RIP at the IMF.

 BODY:
In the first half of last year a strange delusion swept much of the policy elite on both sides of the Atlantic -- the belief that cutting spending in the face of high unemployment would actually create jobs. I went after this stuff early and hard (I suspect that the confidence fairy will be one of my lasting contributions to economic discourse); still, it's good to have a steadily mounting weight of evidence about just how wrong that view was.
The latest entry is a comprehensive review of past episodes of austerity by economists at the IMF, from which the figure above is taken. Yes, contractionary policy is contractionary. And as the authors point out, it's probably even more contractionary than usual under current conditions:
The reduction in incomes from fiscal consolidations is even larger if central banks do not or cannot blunt some of the pain through a monetary policy stimulus. The fall in interest rates associated with monetary stimulus supports investment and consumption, and the concomitant depreciation of the currency boosts net exports. Ireland in 1987 and Finland and Italy in 1992 are examples of countries that undertook fiscal consolidations, but where large depreciations of the currency helped provide a boost to net exports.
Unfortunately, these pain relievers are not easy to come by in today's environment. In many economies, central banks can provide only a limited monetary stimulus because policy interest rates are already near zero (see "Unconventional Behavior" in this issue of F&D). Moreover, if many countries carry out fiscal austerity at the same time, the reduction in incomes in each country is likely to be greater, since not all countries can reduce the value of their currency and increase net exports at the same time. 
Simulations of the IMF's large-scale models suggest that the reduction in incomes may be more than twice as large as that shown in Chart 2 when central banks cannot cut interest rates and when many countries are carrying out consolidations at the same time. These simulations thus suggest that fiscal consolidation is now likely to be more contractionary (that is, to reduce short-run income more) than was the case in past episodes. 
Unfortunately, austerity programs are now the rule everywhere; even if the new Obama plan became law, which it won't, it would only slow the pace of fiscal consolidation in America, and there's nothing like it even on the table elsewhere.
Economic policy: we're doing it wrong.

HEADLINE: At TechCrunch Conference, Talk of a Bubble

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: This year's TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco was rife with debate over whether the technology industry was experiencing Bubble 2.0.

 BODY:
This year's TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco sometimes felt more like an episode of "E! True Hollywood Story" than a high-priced technology gathering.
Although attendees discussed newly announced start-ups and venture funds, the conversations in the conference halls were often discussions of TechCrunch's founder, Michael Arrington, who appeared on stage. AOL, the parent company of TechCrunch, had announced that Mr. Arrington was no longer employed by the company, though it was financing his venture fund.
The gossip quickly moved to a more fruitfully economic discussion: the talk of a technology bubble 2.0.
Curiously, the answer to the question of whether a new tech bubble existed was not determined by wealth or status, but rather age. People I spoke with who had experienced the first bubble in the late 1990s were convinced that we should be prepared for a large pop of biblical proportion.
"It feels like it's 1999 all over again," said Stuart MacDonald, chief marketing officer of FreshBooks, an online billing and bookkeeping site for small businesses. "So many of these people who didn't see it all happen the last time think this is all fresh and new, but it's really a lot of people saying the same things." Mr. MacDonald said he was the chief marketing officer for Expedia in the '90s.
"I just hope it ends differently this time," he said.
Rick Webb, co-founder of the Barbarian Group advertising agency, who is now taking time off from the tech scene, seemed unimpressed by the new companies presenting themselves at the conference. "It just doesn't feel like there is anything new out there. All the start-ups keep announcing the same thing with a different name and a lot of money backing them."
Rachel Sklar, an adviser for Hashable, a business networking application, said: "The mood of the conference feels like it's a gold rush. It feels like a bit of a scramble."
She said, "Everyone just wants a little piece of everything that is happening, from social to mobile, even as many of these start-ups feel insular."
But the newbies to the tech scene saw things a little differently.
John Exley, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator, talked about the state of technology with the effervescence of a lottery winner. "It's electric!" Mr. Exley gleefully proclaimed. "I think we're only in the beginning of what's possible with social and mobile and the start-up scene."
"My bet is there will be a small downturn but it will pick right back up," Mr. Exley said. "I don't think it'll be anything like what I read about happening when I was 9 years old."

HEADLINE: Humans and Their Planet - One Big 'Design Space'

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The perils, promise and inevitability of an engineered us.

 BODY:
Brad Allenby is at it again, and thank goodness for him and for his ability to prod people out of their cognitive comfort zones in a time of astonishing change.
He has posted an article on Slate in advance of a meeting planned for Thursday in Washington on the question, "Is Our Techno-Human Marriage in Need of Counseling?" The gathering is part of a collaboration by Slate, the New America Foundation and Arizona State University, where Allenby, a professor of engineering and ethics, teaches and thinks about the human path in this century and beyond.
In his Slate piece, Allenby largely draws on ideas he has conveyed in "The Techno-Human Condition," a valuable book co-authored with his colleague Daniel Sarewitz. The Slate piece is part of a planned three-way virtual conversation that began earlier today with the bloggingbioethicist Kyle Munkittrick proclaiming, "Gentlemen, start your exobrains," as he took the first stab at defining issues arising with "the convergence of human beings and technology." Coming next is a piece from Nicholas Agar, an associate professor at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and author of Humanity's End: Why We Should Reject Radical Enhancement and other books.
Some of you may have watched (or read the transcript from) a mind-bending onstage conversation I had with Allenby earlier this year:
Wrigley Lecture Series - Andy Revkin and Braden Allenby from Sustainability @ ASU on Vimeo.
If you missed it, I encourage you to dive in. Here's one of my favorite Allenby lines:
If you think about the world of the past, it was humans changing the world for their benefit. Now you have a situation where that arrow goes both ways. Humans may be changing the world, but we can also start to redesign ourselves in deliberate ways. [Full transcript.]
In the meantime, here's a provocative extract from Allenby's riff in Slate:
We've always had technologies that restructured society, culture, economies, and psychology-the steam engine did, railroads did, cars did, airplanes did, and search engines that increasingly substitute for memory do. But depending on how you count, we have five foundational technologies now-nanotech, biotech, robotics, information and communication tech, and applied cognitive science-all of which are not only evolving in interesting and unpredictable ways; they are actually accelerating in their evolution. Moreover, they're doing that against the backdrop of a world in which systems we've always framed as "natural"-the climate, the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, biology and biodiversity, and others-are increasingly products of human intervention, intentional or not. We are terraforming everything, from our planet to one another and it's all connected, of course.
Critically for our purposes, the human being is more and more becoming a design space.

HEADLINE: Bruce Kovner, Founder of Caxton, to Step Down

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Bruce Kovner, a pioneer of the hedge fund industry and a founder of Caxton Associates, will hand the reins to his chief investment officer in a largely expected but rare industry succession.

 BODY:
Bruce Kovner, a founder of Caxton Associates, will retire as chairman of his $10 billion hedge fund firm at the end of the year, handing off the reins to his chief investment officer in a largely expected but still rare succession for the hedge fund industry.
"After 34 years in the trading business and 28 years leading Caxton, the time has come to hand the leadership of the company to a new generation," Mr. Kovner, 66, wrote in a letter sent to investors on Tuesday. "I do so knowing that I will miss the adrenalin rush of confronting the markets every day but also confident new leadership will carry on the traditions, style and substance of Caxton's successful history."
Caxton's chief investment officer, Andrew Law, a former proprietary trader for Goldman Sachs who joined the firm in 2003, will take over as chairman starting in 2012, the letter said. But the transition has been years in the making. In 2008, Mr. Kovner named Mr. Law chief investment officer, in a signal to investors that he would no longer take a leading role in trading at the firm. That year, which heralded the onset of the financial crisis, Mr. Law returned 13 percent to Caxton investors, compared with an average 19 percent drop for hedge funds and a 37 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
As a generation of hedge fund founders begins to gray and contemplate retirement, the industry has been fixated with the question of whether the business they built can live without them at the helm. Some firms, like Shumway Capital Partners, learned the hard way that succession plans do not always work. When Chris Shumway announced that he was handing over investment decisions at his hedge fund last year, investors fled en masse, forcing him to close up shop.
Others, like George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, have decided that rather than weather the whims of outside investors, they would manage their own money as a family office, a designation that allows them to largely avoid regulation.
Bloomberg News earlier reported the news of Mr. Kovner stepping down.
Since its founding in 1983, Caxton has returned money to investors at an average annual rate of 21 percent, among the top performance profiles in the industry. The hedge fund places bets on global events, trading stocks, currencies and commodities, among other things, in an effort to profit on the state of the world. His time at the helm of Caxton has also served Mr. Kovner well - his personal wealth is estimated at around $4.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
An accomplished pianist, Mr. Kovner briefly attended the Juilliard School and is now the chairman of its board of trustees and a major donor. He is also a staunch Republican supporter, counting among his associates former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney.
"Although I will miss the stimulation and camaraderie of daily involvement at Caxton, I am also very much looking forward to spending more time n the many interests I have outside of the trading arena," Mr, Kovner wrote in his letter. "These include my work at the Juilliard School, my efforts in education reform, my family foundation and other philanthropy, and the nurturing of new companies particularly in the areas of drug discovery and medical technology."
"Most of all, I look forward to spending more time on the simple pleasures of life."
Mr. Law followed Mr. Kovner's letter with one of his own to investors, detailing his plans to maintain continuity at the firm when he takes control. 
"The core of our tenets of our trading philosophy - total focus upon absolute return, risk control, liquidity and drawdown - will remain constant," he wrote. "These tenets have served us well through the financial convulsions of the past four years."
Mr. Law said he would focus on trading while others would run the day-to-day operations of the firm. Caxton will also form an operating committee that will meet with Mr. Law weekly, he said in the letter.

HEADLINE: Deadline Extended for Mortgage Help

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The deadline for federal emergency home loan help has been extended to Sept. 15.

 BODY:
The federal government has extended the deadline until Sept. 15 for strapped homeowners in 27 states to apply for emergency help.
Initially, the Department of Housing and Urban Development had set a July 27 deadline for the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program, to ensure that funds could be distributed by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. But the deadline was extended a second time to give people more time to apply. Instructions on how to apply can be found here.
The program offers "bridge" loans to homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgages due to a job loss or medical problem. (Homeowners must be at least three months behind on their mortgages.) Eligible homeowners can receive financial help to pay their mortgage for up to two years, or up to $50,000, whichever comes first. The loans do not have to be repaid, as long as the homeowner continues making mortgage payments on time for five years.
The $1 billion program was expected to help 20,000 to 30,000 distressed homeowners. An estimated 84,000 people sent in preliminary applications, and 40,000 of those passed the initial eligibility screening, said a housing department spokesman, Brian Sullivan.
But to receive final approval for assistance, applicants must provide detailed documentation of their need, like a letter of termination from an employer and a notice of delinquency from the lender.
The emergency program is available in the following states: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
The program aims to offer aid to homeowners in states ineligible for the larger, $7.6 billion "hardest hit" fund, which provided assistance to 18 states and the District of Columbia that absorbed the worst of the housing crisis. Those 18 states were Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Tennessee.
In addition, five other states have similar programsof their own: Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. About 11,000 applications were received in those states, with about 3,000 approved as of the end of August, according to the housing department.
Have you applied for assistance under the program? Let us know about your experience.

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The good news is the bad news could be - and has been - a lot worse.

 BODY:
Maybe it's back-to-school fever, but everyone I know seems besieged by pessimism. I'm distressed by water shortages, the state of the labor movement and the Somalian famine, which may needlessly kill 700,000 people this year. Friends are overwhelmed by their memories of 9/11 and of the horribly blown opportunities to use an excruciatingly painful event to move us towards a better place. 
Issues pile upon issues: the president's failure to even initiate the change we thought we heard him promise. Ill parents and unemployed children. Irene, and the inevitable questions about climate change. The wipe-out of farms in the Northeast. All of this was bad enough, and then that chest-beating Djokovic won the U.S. Open. 
I got my Everything-Is-Going-Wrong feeling. It was time for a call to Charles Kenny.

Kenny, a Brit who lives in the District of Columbia and has a sharp mind, a quick wit and the fancy title of senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, has come to my rescue before. Once, when I was trying to counter the ubiquitous but historically incorrect notion that population growth will make it impossible to feed everyone on the planet, I asked him his view, and he replied, "The bottom 650 million people, planet-wide, live on an income roughly 1/100th of the richest 650 million, which means that each one percent rise in the incomes of the richest has the same impact on consumption and resources as doubling the incomes of the poorest. So if you want to stop runaway exploitation of the earth's resources through population control it makes the most sense to sterilize Americans and Europeans, because they're the problem."
Remembering this kind of original, unusual and radical thinking, as well as the stuff that fills Kenny's book "Getting Better: Why Global Development is Succeeding and How to Improve the World Even More," made me reach for the phone. "Help," I said. "I'm depressed about the progress of the human race." (I didn't tell him about Djokovic.)
"Relax," he said. "We're doing pretty well; only a couple of things are going in the wrong direction. We are, it's true, storing problems for later by destroying our stocks of biodiversity, using oil, land and water at unconscionable rates, and chucking CO2 in the atmosphere, so it's not entirely a rosy picture. 
"But never," he continued, "has there been a time in history when the average human could live so long, where food has been as plentiful, where newborns have a better chance of surviving. It's really hard to think of an important area where things aren't better: literacy, gender equality, the absence of slavery, the rights of minorities."
Is it, as I've long suspected, that we (humans) always believe that we (individuals currently alive) are experiencing the worst time ever? 
No hesitation: "Yes. Certainly the Romans thought that, and there's a long tradition of pessimism, especially" - he said this without cruelty - "amongst the writing classes. Nearly all really poor people around the world, those with the right to complain, don't; they say 'yes' when asked if life is going to be better for their kids. It's the luxury of the well-off to be depressed." 
My friends and I qualify, evidently. I'm not confident my kids will be better off, though my family history would indicate otherwise: my grandparents fled the anti-Semitism of early 20th century Europe to live in slums in New York, but died untortured and well-fed, with mostly thriving children; my own parents lived through the Depression and hungry childhoods, World War II, and the disappearance of dozens of relatives in the Holocaust, but have survived happily in a way few of their antecedents could have dreamed. I've seen war and misery and hunger and injustice, certainly, but experienced little of that directly. My big complaints are not about my own bad luck but about that of others, and about how much better things could be than they actually are. 
It's hard to feel positive when the wild-eyed optimism of 2008 - remember? crying with joy? dancing in the streets? - has folded before a reality in which the difficulties and horrors of the first decade of the millennium remain not only unresolved but undiminished. And so, I demanded of Kenny, even given worldwide improvement, what could you possibly say about the States, where health care, education, immigration, food, the environment, social services and more are all being strangled by forces of reaction and the corpocracy? 
He yielded, a little: "The short-term picture ." He groaned: ugh. "But the trends are good. We know how to fix global warming, and carbon taxes will work even if they begin on a local level. Food will continue to improve, too. Immigration issues will be resolved.
"Even the safety net We'll wind up raising the retirement age, which will help both productivity and Social Security. Or we could start giving people more days off; the 35-hour-work-week isn't a bad idea. Business won't like that, but if we give incentives and introduce it gradually, they'll live with it."
O.K., but famine?, the pessimist persisted. "Famine," he said, "is no longer an act of nature but one of war. People only starve in places like North Korea or parts of Somalia, where evil people are in charge. 
"That famine still exists is a terrible thing, something that keeps the world from being a more wonderful place than it is. But it's a more wonderful place than it ever has been." 
There. Don't you feel better? I do. Except for the Djokovic guy.

HEADLINE: Land Rover Deploys Two Defenders at Frankfurt

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The automaker showed hardtop and open-air interpretations of a future Defender 4x4, but final specifications and North American sales intentions are far from set.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- How does a brand make a battering ram of a vehicle at a time of increasing concerns about fuel economy, tailpipe emissions and curb weight?
In the case of the Land Rover DC100 and DC100 Sport concepts, two takes on the Land Rover Defender, the answer is a slimming program with results that would be the envy of every daytime talk show host.
Land Rover officials emphasized that neither the DC100 nor its minimalist companion, the DC100 Sport, were production-ready vehicles, but merely testosterone-enriched concepts. But at the vehicles' official debut here Tuesday, the company reiterated that the new Defender, the production version of the DC100, would be a lean and hungry machine.
"Land Rover remains committed to a goal of reducing curb weights of its S.U.V.'s by as much as 500 kilos over the next 10 years, via the use of lighter materials such as aluminum, high-strength steel and carbon fiber," said John Edwards, the company's global brand director, during the brand's news conference.
Still, even leaned-down and cleaned-up, the new Defender might not be a vehicle that could be sold in America. It still might not meet certain safety and emissions criteria set by the federal government, especially if it comes equipped with a diesel engine. That power plant is a probable option for the rest of the world.
"No decision has been made on whether the new Defender will come to North American markets," Mr. Edwards said.
Power for the concepts is supplied by a 2-liter, 4-cylinder gasoline engine, mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. In addition to diesel options, the company suggested hybrid "possibilities" also existed, including use of stop-start engine management at idle.
The rugged Defender, despite a cult following that embraced its charismatic, boxlike design and anything-goes engineering, was discontinued in North America after the 1997 model year because it could not meet a new federal standard on air-bag deployment. In truth, however, it was also a fuel guzzler, a heavy polluter, morbidly obese and prone to shed parts.
"Defender was loved the world over for its simple, honest and distinctive design," Mr. Edwards said. But, while remaining "true to its heritage," the new Defender "must meet the requirements of changing global markets."
Gerry McGovern, the stylist responsible for the DC100 and Land Rover's reigning design director, said, "This is just the beginning of a four-year journey to design a relevant Defender for the 21st century."
Aside from Land Rover's usual insistence on best-in-class off-road capability, terrain management and 4-wheel drive, the DC100 features 22-inch wheels and tires -- a contradiction not likely to be seen in the production vehicle because of its vulnerability to wheel breakage and tire sidewall damage in hard use.
Three-across front seating, Mr. McGovern said, evoked past Defenders (The model dates to 1948). A fold-down front windshield, cut-down side windows and a canvas top on the DC100 Sport were other classic Defender design cues.
A new and intriguing feature, which Land Rover said could be ready for production by the scheduled 2015 introduction, was "self-cleaning, self-healing" paint and bodywork. What a welcome feature that would be on a battering-ram all-terrain vehicle.
None of the features shown on the concept, however, are guaranteed for the production vehicle, the company stressed.

HEADLINE: How to Raise Revenue Without Violating the Tax Pledge

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Opportunities abound for the government to raise revenue without raising taxes, an economist writes.

 BODY:
The biggest barrier to reducing the budget deficit is the Republican insistence that taxes not be increased by so much as a penny. As we saw in the Republican candidates' debate on Aug. 11, when asked if they would support a plan with $10 of spending cuts for $1 of tax increase, every candidate declined to support that plan.
But with federal revenues at a 60-year low, every serious budget analyst knows that revenues must be increased to stabilize the nation's finances, not just in dollar terms, but as a share of gross domestic product.
However, no Republican politician dares to acknowledge this, for fear of excommunication and likely defeat by some Tea Party patriot in the next primary.
Enforcement of Republican tax dogma is handled by Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, a group that isn't actually in favor of tax reform because it supports every gimmicky tax cut that comes down the road and likewise opposes eliminating any special-interest tax provision if it would lead to higher taxes on anyone.

For 25 years, Mr. Norquist has demanded that every Republican running for office anywhere sign a no-tax-increase pledge, which every G.O.P. presidential candidate and virtually every Republican member of Congress has done. Allied groups like the Club for Growth will spend whatever it takes to defeat any Republican who violates the pledge or refuses to sign it.
With Republican control of the House of Representatives and enough Republicans in the Senate to filibuster to death any measure deemed by Mr. Norquist to violate the sacred pledge, spending cuts appear to be the only permissible means of reducing the deficit.
There are, however, ways of cutting spending by raising revenue. While this sounds like magic, it is done all the time.
The first thing one needs to know is that not all federal revenues count as revenues. Some are classified as "offsetting receipts" or "offsetting collections." Such revenues are classified as negative spending rather than as revenues. The classification has no effect on the deficit but does make both federal spending and revenues about $600 billion lower than they actually are.
Details on offsetting receipts can be found in Chapter 16 of the analytical perspectives volume of the federal budget. As it explains, such receipts consist of user fees and other voluntary payments made to the government in exchange for services of various kinds.
There are a wide variety of such receipts, but I want to focus on the one that is probably most familiar to people - premiums paid by beneficiaries for Medicare Part B, which amount to $65 billion this year.
When Medicare was established, it had two parts, A and B. Part A pays for hospitalization and is financed by a payroll tax that all workers pay. Part B pays for doctors' visits and is voluntary. Its cost is financed by premiums paid by beneficiaries and by general revenues.
Originally, beneficiaries paid for 50 percent of Part B's benefits. But in 1973, the law was changed and the percentage of benefits covered by premiums fell steadily until 1985, when premiums were fixed at 25 percent of the program's costs. Thus if beneficiaries still paid as much of Medicare Part B's costs as they originally were supposed to then federal revenues would be $65 billion higher this year.
And here's the kicker: higher Part B premiums wouldn't count as higher revenues, but as lower spending for Medicare. Therefore, it would not be a tax increase, would not violate the sacred pledge and would cut Medicare, which Republicans all say they want to do.
Even libertarians could support higher Part B premiums because the program is voluntary. Anyone who doesn't want to pay the premiums (or receive the benefits) doesn't have to. That's the key reason why Part B premiums aren't considered to be taxes.
There is really only one good argument against making Medicare beneficiaries pay for more of their benefits - it will be massively unpopular among elderly people. Right now they are getting something for nothing, and they like it. According to a recent Urban Institute study, single people and two-earner couples get back three times as much as they pay into Medicare and single-earner couples get back six times their contributions.
There are many other ways, as well, where the concept of offsetting receipts could be used to reduce federal spending while raising revenues through higher fees and reduced subsidies.
Once upon a time, it was a principle of conservative budget analysis that the federal government ought to impose user fees wherever possible, because it was unfair for taxpayers to subsidize programs that benefited only a limited group of people or businesses.
For example, user fees were a big part of the recommendations put forward by the Grace Commission, established by Ronald Reagan to find ways of reducing federal costs. It published an entire volume detailing opportunities to impose fees and raise those insufficient to cover benefits received by users of government services.
The Wall Street Journal editorial writer Stephen Moore, who was formerly head of the Club for Growth and is a close ally of Mr. Norquist in enforcing the anti-tax orthodoxy among Republicans, once wrote a paper for the conservative Heritage Foundation recommending a variety of new fees to reduce the deficit.
Libertarian groups like the Cato Institute and the Reason Foundation have argued that establishing fees for government services would help make them viable for privatization, which would shrink the size of government.
The Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Budget Office periodically publish reports on user fees that can easily be consulted for ideas on how they can be improved. Budget conventions that treat such fees as reduced spending offer a way out of the budget impasse imposed by the tax pledge. And they could make a major contribution to meeting the $1.5 trillion deficit-reduction target that the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction must meet by Nov. 23.

HEADLINE: Night Shift Moms

BYLINE: LISA BELKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Working while the rest of the family sleeps

 BODY:
Juggling parenting with paid work means keeping a constant eye on the clock, thinking of all you could do if there were only a few more hours in a day. 
None of us can create time, but many of us play around with it a bit, upending the concepts of day and night to carve out and cram in pockets here and there. The most typical version of this is the laptop in bed after the kids are asleep, or the BlackBerry in the pediatrician's waiting room. For 5 percent of employed women, though (that's a little more than three million), this means going a step further, and working between nine at night and eight in the morning. 
That the night shift has grown in recent years is a result of a 24/7 economy, Jennifer Haupt writes in the latest issue of Woman's Day magazine, to be published next week. But the fact that there are 250,000 more women working those shifts than men seems to be a result of deliberate choice on the part of many mothers as a way of juggling work and home. "According to a joint study by the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California and the Center for American Progress," Ms. Haupt writes, "26 percent of night-shift workers choose that schedule because it makes child care easier."
But this includes a toll. Lack of sleep comes to mind, and all the women Ms. Haupt interviewed describe being exhausted much of the time. Feeling out of sync with the rest of the family is another problem they mentioned. And marriages can feel the strain. As guest blogger Jamie Richwrote here last spring, about her own 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. shift: 
 To be sure, the likelihood of marital discord increases for families when one parent works at night... I know why. When I work at home, I can still kiss my family goodnight. But when I go to the office, Brian and I pass in the doorway with a quick peck before we hand over Eloise. Sometimes the three of us rendezvous at rush hour on the crowded Underground-train platform in London's financial district. Squeezing Eloise through the crush of bankers and lawyers, we make the trade, and I continue to the office while they head home. If Brian works late, I hand her off to the baby sitter - minus the kiss - and settle for a goodnight text message to Brian. Still, the fulfillment of staying engaged in my profession and the personal richness of being available for our daughter makes up for the few hours of awake time that I miss each week with my family.
Is the night shift a solution to your family's work/life juggle? Or would it only cause more problems?

HEADLINE: Senate Tries Again on Disaster Aid

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: A proposal would provide $5.1 billion more for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

 BODY:
 UPDATE 6:50 p.m.: The Senate on Tuesday cleared the way for consideration of a large aid package for communities and people affected by this summer's hurricanes and tornadoes by tucking $6.9 billion in new disaster aid into a Republican-sponsored bill to renew sanctions against the Burmese government. 
 The question of how to increase federal disaster aid, and by how much, has raised some controversy on Capitol Hill in recent days because many Republicans would like to see any increase in aid offset by federal spending cuts. The House plans to include new disaster aid in a short-term spending plan that is expected to hit that chamber's floor next week, with far lower levels expected and a possible offset though cuts to an auto loan program.
 While an initial attempt in the Senate to win passage of the package failed on a procedural vote Monday night, the Senate agreed Tuesday to move forward with a vehicle to increase funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency by $5.1 billion, including $500 million to fill a shortfall for just the month of September. 
The measure passed 61 to 38, with 1 senators not voting. All of those who voted against the measure were Republicans, though many Republicans who hail from states that have been hit hard by disasters, like Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, voted in favor of the measure. Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, voted in favor of a similar measure on Monday but changed his vote to no on Tuesday. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican freshman from Pennsylvania, flipped in the opposite direction. 
 The current balance in the Disaster Relief Fund is $407 million; in recent weeks, FEMA has spent $365 million to aid cities and people harmed by Hurricane Irene. Since Jan. 1, the president has issued disaster declarations in 48 states. 
 The supplemental monies include $1.3 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, which helps repair water-damaged infrastructure; $266 million in fiscal year 2012 to the Department of Agriculture; $135 million in fiscal year 2012 for the Economic Development Administration; and $100 million in community block grants to help rebuild neighborhoods damaged by natural disasters. 
 A measure that passed this summer to raise the debt ceiling included federal spending caps; that deal allowed for those caps to grow to accommodate emergency disaster aid. 
On Monday evening, a procedural vote on the Burma bill failed in the Senate with six Democrats missing. Some members were taken aback that the funding request was bigger than the previous White House request, or because they were not up to speed on the details. The $4.6 billion that Senate Democrats seek for the 2012 fiscal year is above the $1.8 billion President Obama requested in February.
 On the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Reid accused Republicans of deviating from normal disaster relief policies in the name of fiscal austerity.
"It is unthinkable that Republicans would waste time catering to the radical Tea Party while innocent victims of devastating disasters bide their time," Mr. Reid said. "This is not a nation that stands idly by while our fellow Americans suffer. We are a nation of action. When it is in our power to aid a fellow citizen, we have always done what it takes. And we have done it without politics, without pandering and without a moment's delay."
 Also Tuesday, the House approved and sent to the Senate a measure that would avert a second shutdown of the Federal Aviation Administration through the end of January and extend highway and transit programs set to expire this month through March 2012.
An earlier version of this post provided incorrect vote totals. The final vote for cloture on a disaster aid and Burmese trade restrictions bill on Tuesday was 61 in favor and 38 against, with one abstention; not 53 in favor and 33 against, with 14 abstentions. It also erroneously stated that Senator Dan Coats of Indiana voted against cloture on Monday but changed his vote to yes on Tuesday, and that Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania voted in favor on Monday but rejected cloture on Tuesday. The vote changes were reversed. Mr. Coats changed his vote from yes to no, and Mr. Toomey changed his vote from no to yes.

HEADLINE: Deluxe Apartment, Village Town House or Staten Island Manse?

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: In this week's Appraisal: Fancy New York addresses are easy to find on TV and in film. Which genuinely fictional home would you chose to live in?

 BODY:
This week's Appraisal tells the tale of one of the town houses that stood in for Carrie Bradshaw's Upper East Side pad on "Sex and the City" and the real-life couple, Harold Eliot Leeds, an architect and Pratt professor, and Wheaton Galentine, a filmmaker, who lived there for 50 years. 
Whether it's the "Godfather" manse in Staten Island, the Brooklyn Heights townhouse in "Moonstruck," or Liz Lemon's "30 Rock" flat on Riverside Drive, rarely are shabby New York addresses used in screens big and small. (The relatively modest home of the Bunkers on "All in the Family," at the fictional address of 704 Hauser Street, is in fact is at 89-70 Cooper Avenue in Glendale, Queens, according to this 2007 article in the Times Travel section. The article also identifies a number of fancier fictional homes including the Jeffersons' "deluxe apartment in the sky" at 85th Street and Third Avenue.)

HEADLINE: Boathouse Restaurant Capitulates to Union

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: After a monthlong strike and pressure from the National Labor Relations Board, the owners of the restaurant in Central Park agreed to recognize the union and rehire a dozen workers terminated for backing the union.

 BODY:
Facing a strike that has lasted a month, the owner of the Boathouse Restaurant in Central Park has made several major concessions in the hope of ending the walkout, among them agreeing to recognize and negotiate with a union, representatives of the two sides said.
The restaurant's owner, Dean Poll, has also agreed to rehire more than a dozen fired workers. But even so, union officials said they were not ready to end the strike. Peter Ward, president of the New York Hotel Trades Council, said on Tuesday that his union would not end the walkout until the two sides hammered out a full union contract.
Mr. Ward said he was delighted that Mr. Poll had agreed to recognize the union after he had battled an organizing drive at the restaurant early this year.
"This is a grand slam for the union," Mr. Ward said in an interview. "Dean Poll has done everything he said he'd never do. He's recognized the union, and he's agreed to take back close to 40 people."
Mr. Poll agreed to make concessions after facing intense pressure from the National Labor Relations Board. The board said it was ready to file a legal complaint accusing the Boathouse of illegally threatening and questioning workers, as well as illegally firing and otherwise punishing more than 15 workers for backing the union.
In addition, the labor board had told Mr. Poll that it planned to seek a highly unusual judicial order to require the Boathouse to grant union recognition to the Hotel Trades Council and to enter contract negotiations with it, even though no vote has been held to determine whether the restaurant's 140 workers want to unionize. Mr. Ward said that last winter 70 percent of the employees had signed cards calling for a union.
The labor board seeks such orders only on rare occasions when it is convinced that an employer's illegal actions are so widespread, intimidating and egregious that they would prevent a fair unionization vote from being held.
David L. Weissman, a lawyer for the Boathouse, said Mr. Poll had agreed to talk with the union, partly at the behest of City Hall, which has worked behind the scenes to end the dispute.
"The most important thing is we have to come together and make sure the Boathouse has a future," he said.
Mr. Weissman said that, in its settlement talks with the labor board, the restaurant had made no admissions of wrongdoing.
"I don't think there's a victory on either side," he said.
He expressed disappointment that the fired workers who had been offered reinstatement had not gone back to work. They remain on strike.
Mr. Poll's decision to recognize and bargain with the union was reported Monday night by Crain's New York Business.
Two union representatives said Mr. Poll had gone to Mr. Ward's office to conduct contract negotiations. The two sides had made substantial progress, one union representative said, but the Boathouse was asking the Bloomberg administration for some relief on its rent payments to make it easier for the restaurant to pay for a labor settlement.
"From my perspective, there's no settlement in sight," Mr. Ward said. "We're not going anywhere. We're going to remain on strike. The strike is having a devastating effect on his business."
The dispute has become intertwined with the union's battle with Mr. Poll over a license he won to run Tavern on the Green, also in Central Park. Mr. Poll never reopened Tavern after he was unable to reach a contract agreement with Mr. Ward's union, which represented the 400 Tavern workers under the previous licensee, Warner LeRoy.
Mr. Weissman said, "Unless we sign an agreement that's economically viable, then we're going to be in the same situation as Tavern on the Green, not being able to meet the expenses and costs and have another closed restaurant. That's not what the Boathouse wants, what the union wants or what the city wants."

HEADLINE: More New Yorkers Living in Poverty

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: New York State's poverty rate hits its highest level since 1998.

 BODY:
 New York State's poverty rate climbed to 16 percent last year, the third consecutive annual increase and the highest rate since 1998, according to census figures released Tuesday. Nearly 3.1 million New Yorkers were living below the official poverty rate in 2010, also the highest total in 12 years. 
 The statewide rate climbed from 14.2 percent in 2008 to 15.8 percent in 2009 and inched up to 16 percent last year. 
 The poverty rate was 43 percent among households headed by a single mother, 24.6 percent among children younger than 18, 14 percent among 18-to-64-year-olds and 11.1 percent for people 65 and over,
"People have trouble conceptualizing number as large as three million, but this new data means that if New York State residents in poverty all held hands, they could create a line that would run from Times Square to the Golden Gate Bridge," said Joel Berg, the executive director for the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. "For those of us who see surging lines at food pantries and soup kitchens citywide, these new numbers are no surprise." 
More detailed figures for New York City are due to be released later this month.

HEADLINE: A Guide to Cutting Through Special-Election Spin

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The campaign press is likely to exaggerate the impact of special elections, but they can provide us with some insight if we look at their results very carefully. 

 BODY:
I used to take the view -- and I think I've been pretty consistent about this -- that special elections to Congress, while interesting on their own merits, should more or less be ignored in terms of their national implications.
I still probably err toward that side now. The campaign press is likely to exaggerate the impact of special elections (as it does with most day-to-day events). If I were interviewed on television and had the time for just one five-second comment, it might be spent on pointing this out.
But that's an oversimplified position. Special elections, unlike polls, are "hard" data -- real people voting on real candidates and real issues -- and can provide us with some insight if we look at their results very carefully.
Since we have the luxury of space here, let me make several quick points that pertain both to the contests in New York and Nevada on Tuesday night, and to the spin that you're likely to hear from Republicans and Democrats afterward, depending on the results.
1. Blaming the candidate is often a poor excuse, as it appears to be here for Democrats.
Candidates can matter: Would Republicans have lost the Senate race in Delaware last year -- they lost it in a landslide, in fact, by 17 points -- had they nominated Michael N. Castle rather than Christine O'Donnell? Polls before the race suggested that Mr. Castle would have won.
Harry Reid ran a brilliant campaign to save his Senate seat in Nevada, but with an approval rating only in the high 30s, he probably would not have accomplished that had he been up against a better candidate than Sharron Angle.
Even in the case of the Massachusetts special election in 2010, there was room to assign some of the blame -- certainly not all of it -- to the Democratic candidate, Martha Coakley, as well as to give some of the credit to the strong personal qualities of Scott Brown.
But these are exceptional cases: Ms. O'Donnell and Ms. Angle were inexperienced candidates who were far outside the political mainstream in their states. Ms. Coakley insulted the Red Sox -- in a race in Massachusetts.
I don't think Assemblyman David I. Weprin, the Democratic candidate in the New York race, comes all that close to that bright-line test.
The grievances against him are fairly petty: for instance, that he misstated the size of the national debt -- a gaffe, to be sure, but one of a minor magnitude that most candidates would expect to make at least once or twice over the course of a campaign. Or that Mr. Weprin is a bad dancer. (The Republican candidate, Bob Turner, made a couple of gaffes as well).
Mr. Weprin is not a world-beating candidate, but he's been elected to other offices several times before and he holds positions on the issues that square well with his district. And it's not as if Mr. Turner -- a 70-year-old who has never held elected office before, who raised very little money and who lost by 20 points in 2010 -- is the Queens equivalent of Scott Brown.
The polls did show that Mr. Weprin had favorability ratings inferior to those of Mr. Turner -- but sometimes that's a symptom of a losing campaign rather than one of its causes.
2. New York's Ninth Congressional District has highly unusual demographics, with a set of local issues that are unlikely to extrapolate well to the rest of the country.
On the other hand, while all Congressional districts have their quirks, New York's Ninth is especially unusual.
First, there are the local issues -- Barack Obama's positioning toward Israel, Mr. Weprin's endorsement of a plan to build a mosque and Muslim cultural center in Lower Manhattan, and possibly gay marriage -- that will resonate more in Queens than they will in the rest of the country.
Roughly 40 percent of voters in the Ninth District are Jewish, 20 times the rate in the country as a whole. Moreover, and perhaps more important, many of those voters are Orthodox Jews, who often have starkly different political viewpoints than Reform or secular Jews, and who are extremely rare in the United States outside a few spots in the New York region.
There's also the fact that the district was already behaving unusually in 2008. Despite having a 37-point edge in party registration, Mr. Obama won the election by only 11 points there -- barely better than the seven-point edge he had nationwide. I doubt that there was any district in the country, perhaps outside a few remnants of the "Solid South," where so many enrolled Democrats voted against Mr. Obama.
Mr. Obama's unpopularity is no doubt a huge factor in this race. But certain types of critiques are likely to be disproportionately resonant in this particular district compared with others.
3. If the polls are right, the result in Nevada should be as troubling to Democrats as the result in New York.
Although the special election in Nevada has gotten less attention, in some ways it might be the more appropriate race for drawing national implications.
Sure, Nevada's Second Congressional District has a few oddities: it's had fast population growth and crashing housing prices. But its demographics are otherwise fairly "normal" and heterogeneous. And in contrast to the New York district, it seems to be a place where Democrats were making a lot of progress: Mr. Obama lost it by less than a full percentage point in 2008, whereas John Kerry was beaten there by 16 points in 2004.
Democrats probably weren't going to be favored in this district, which is still somewhat Republican-leaning. But a double-digit loss, as seems possible based on the polls, is a decidedly subpar result for them.
In addition, the national implications notwithstanding, Nevada is a pivotal state in both the presidential and Senate elections next year.
4. Academic studies find that special elections do have some predictive power, especially taken as a group.
A study by David Smith and Thomas L. Brunell on special elections to the House since 1900 finds that they do anticipate general election results to some extent: there is a modest, but statistically significant, correlation between how many seats change hands during special elections and which party does best in the next midterms.
The connection does not always work. In advance of the 2010 elections, Democrats won seven of the nine special elections to the House, with an even score as far as seats changing parties. (Democrats lost Hawaii's First Congressional District to Republicans, but won New York's 23rd, both under somewhat unusual circumstances with multicandidate fields.) Then they lost 63 seats in November.
Nor is it clear that special elections have predictive power above and beyond other factors, like economic performance and generic ballot polls. Still, they seem to provide kernels of useful data.
5. Special elections have more predictive power if you look at the margin of victory and not just the result.
Mr. Smith and Mr. Brunell have another finding that echoes something I've frequently said about special elections: They have more predictive power for national elections if you look at the margins of victory rather than the winners and losers. If Mr. Weprin pulls out a victory by 1,000 votes, we should basically draw the same implications as if he had lost by 1,000 votes, even though the headlines will be much different.
6. Special elections can also affect the behavior and morale of the parties, and they may do so here.
But that assumes that parties are as cool-headed about the results as we're attempting to be here. And they aren't. A loss in New York's Ninth District, after a rough couple of months for Democrats, will only worsen their morale. It could discourage other Democrats from running.
And it could affect campaign strategy in other races. Republicans might conclude that Israel is a vulnerability for Mr. Obama, for instance, and make it a bigger part of their campaigns. That may or may not be a good strategy for them -- but it could affect the landscape of the campaign all the same.
7. Special elections won't provide us with much insight into the degree of anti-incumbent sentiment.
This is axiomatic: Barring unusual cases, incumbents aren't on the ballot in special elections. So their results are likely to tell us more about how open-seat races might play out than those in which there is an incumbent on the ballot.
In some ways, in fact, a poor result for Democrats might tell us more about the Senate picture, where there are a number of key open-seat races (including in Nevada), than it would about the House, where the Democrats have dozens of fertile Republican incumbent targets. A "throw the bums out" mentality could still produce some gains there even if Democrats were having a rough night otherwise.

HEADLINE: Google Introduces Long-Awaited Flight Search

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: Google introduced a tool for searching flights, using software acquired in its acquisition of ITA.

 BODY:
Updated 2:15 p.m. 
Google introduced flight search on Tuesday, competing head-to-head with travel search engines like Kayak, Orbitz and Microsoft's Bing.
The service has been expected since Google announced last year its intention to buy ITA Software, which makes the flight search software used by many airlines and travel search engines like Orbitz and Bing. The deal underwent intense antitrust scrutiny, but the Department of Justice approved the acquisition, with caveats, in April.
Google said its flight results are not influenced by any paid relationship; the search engine directs travelers to the airline's own Web site to book the flight.
Google has said that it wanted to buy ITA to provide a new, open-ended kind of travel search, so that, for instance, people could ask Google where they could go to find warm weather and beaches in December for under $300 round-trip.
The service introduced Tuesday was not Google's full offering but an initial step in that direction, according to the company. For now, it only shows select cities in the United States and results for economy-class, round-trip flights.
When travelers search for flights on Google or visit google.com/flights, they will see flight options from a variety of airlines, which they can sort by departure or arrival time, flight duration, route, airline or price. Taking a step toward its ultimate goal, the service includes a way to filter flights by time and price to figure out where to go. 
Like Bing, Google's flight search compares prices over time, and like Hipmunk, a travel search start-up, people can sort flights visually on a graph, based on duration and price.
Google says its results are fast; on an initial try-out of the service, they do seem to appear instantaneously, compared with other sites where users wait while the site compiles results.
Google's flight search joins other travel offerings, like hotel search, which it introduced in July.
The Department of Justice has required Google to continue to license ITA's software to other sites that now compete with Google, many of which vocally opposed the acquisition.
On Tuesday, Robert Birge, Kayak's chief marketing officer and a spokesman for FairSearch.org, a group of businesses that believe that Google has a monopoly in search and fought the acquisition, said in a statement that Kayak's flight search is superior.
"We recognize Google is a formidable competitor, but they haven't been successful in every vertical they've entered," Mr. Birge said. "We use multiple data sources and proprietary technology, all of which helps us in our efforts to provide people with comprehensive, fast and accurate answers to their flight search needs."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Self-Regulator Makes Case for More Power

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is stepping up its bid for more power, telling Congress on Tuesday that it is well equipped "to serve as at least part of the solution" to overseeing the investment advisory industry.

 BODY:
Wall Street's self-regulator is stepping up its bid for more power, telling Congress on Tuesday that it is well equipped to replace the Securities and Exchange Commission as overseer of the investment advisory industry. 
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, which already examines some 4,500 broker dealers, now wants to add more than 11,000 investment advisory firms to its docket. The push has ignited concern among investment advisers and even some regulators, who question the wisdom of trusting Wall Street to police itself. 
Still, the S.E.C.'s own oversight is prone to blind spots. The agency examined only 9 percent of registered investment advisers last year. 
 "We believe we are uniquely positioned to serve as at least part of the solution to this pressing problem," Richard Ketchum, the group's chief executive, is expected to say on Tuesday before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Financial Services.
The hearing coincides with the committee's recent introduction of draft legislation that would authorize self-regulatory groups like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to examine investment advisers. 
The bill, sponsored by Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services, does not specify a self-regulator of choice. But for now, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is the only self-regulatory group positioned to take on the broad new power over investment advisers, a group that includes hedge fund managers and large retail firms like Raymond James and Charles Schwab. 
The group has pushed other lawmakers to get behind the measure. "We believe the draft is a thoughtful approach to addressing the critical need for increased adviser regulation," Mr. Ketchum said in his testimony. 
But the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's critics are skeptical of giving the organization new authority, given its spotty record of policing Wall Street in the lead up to the financial crisis. 
The North American Securities Administrators Association, a collection of state securities regulators, "vigorously opposes creation of a self-regulatory organization," said Steven D. Irwin, Pennsylvania's securities commissioner.
"We see little benefit in constructing a new layer of bureaucracy, with its incumbent expense," he said, adding that the self-regulatory model "typified by Finra is replete with conflicts of interest."
Investment advisers, likewise, frown on a regulatory shake-up, citing the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's "questionable track record." Of course, some firms also enjoy the lighter touch of the S.E.C., which inspects the books at advisory firms roughly every 11 years on average.
"We continue to support strong regulation and oversight by the S.E.C., a single governmental regulator, fully accountable to Congress and the public," David Tittsworth, executive director of the Investment Adviser Association, an industry trade group, said in written testimony prepared for the subcommittee. Mr. Tittsworth argued that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's regulation would favor the broker dealer industry, which it already oversees. 
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a nonprofit born out of the 2007 merger of the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange's regulatory arm, is moving to allay those concerns. 
"We would implement regulatory oversight that is tailored to the particular characteristics of the investment adviser business," Mr. Ketchum said. He added that the group would create a separate entity to run its investment advisory oversight and would hire dozens of new staff members to gear up for the new regime. 
On Tuesday, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's bid found support from an unlikely corner: the Consumer Federation of America. 
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the consumer group and a longtime critic of self-regulatory organizations, would prefer for Congress to increase the S.E.C.'s funding. But the S.E.C., while receiving a modest funding increase this year, still cannot keep pace with the growing industry. 
"Having spent the better part of two decades arguing for various approaches to increase S.E.C. resources for investment adviser oversight with nothing to show for our efforts, we have been forced to reassess our opposition to" to groups like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. She said the federation had concluded that self-regulatory oversight "would be a significant improvement over the status quo."

HEADLINE: Vincent Reinhart Joins Morgan Stanley

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The economist and former Federal Reserve official has done research on economic recoveries following financial crises.

 BODY:
Vincent R. Reinhart, an economist and former head of the Federal Reserve's monetary division, is joining Morgan Stanley as its chief United States economist in New York. 
The appointment of Mr. Reinhart, 54, is timely given the current state of the economy: His work, with that of his wife, Carmen Reinhart, has detailed how long and painfully slow recoveries can be after a financial crisis. 
In a paper delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyo., in August 2010, the Reinharts noted that in "the 10-year window following severe financial crises, unemployment rates are significantly higher than in the decade that preceded the crisis."
Housing prices and economic growth also tend to be much lower, they found. "If deleveraging of private debt follows the tracks of previous crises as well, credit restraint will damp employment and growth for some time to come," they wrote.
Since leaving the Fed in 2007, Mr. Reinhart has been a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. For 17 years at the Fed, he held senior positions, including economist of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's interest rate policy group. 
"Vincent has been an important voice in global economic debates for years, and we welcome him to Morgan Stanley," Ted Pick, the firm's global head of equities, said in a statement. "He complements a talented global team of economists and strategists at the firm, and we look forward to his thought leadership and insight."
Mr. Reinhart also previously worked as an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A graduate of Fordham, he received master's degrees from Columbia University.

HEADLINE: Regulators Aim to End 'Too Big To Fail'

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The F.D.I.C. unanimously approved two sets of rules on Tuesday that would mandate so-called living wills at the nation's largest financial firms.

 BODY:
Nearly three years to the day that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Wall Street teetered on the brink, federal regulators are seeking to wipe out the infamous phenomenon that Wall Street is too big to fail. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation unanimously approved two sets of rules on Tuesday that would mandate so-called living wills at the nation's largest financial firms, a crucial step in enforcing the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the financial crisis.
One new rule will force huge bank holding companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase -- along with other sprawling corporations that present a systemic risk to the economy -- to spell out plans for unwinding their business through bankruptcy should they once again fall on hard times. 
Under a separate rule adopted on Tuesday, the F.D.I.C. will require the depository arm at the nation's 37 largest banks, those housing more than $50 billion in total assets, to create their own contingency plans. The so-called resolution proposal would allow the F.D.I.C., acting as receiver, to dismantle the banks outside the bankruptcy process. 
"These two rules will ensure the comprehensive and coordinated resolution planning for both the insured depository and its holding company and affiliates in the event that an orderly liquidation is required," the F.D.I.C.'s acting chairman, Martin J. Gruenberg, said in a statement. The Federal Reserve must now bless the living will plan for it to become official, a move that is expected to come as soon as this week.
The rules underscore the changing regulatory landscape unfolding since the financial crisis, when Washington enacted a $700 billion bailout for banks, the automotive industry and the giant insurer American International Group. At the time, the Bush and Obama administrations said they had no choice but to rescue the firms. After all, they were so large and interconnected that their collapse would have further imperiled the nation's already fragile economy. 
But under the F.D.I.C.'s new living will plan, big financial firms must provide a road map of their business to regulators, who can then keep an eye on Wall Street's health. The documents will open a window into the financial industry's investments, trading counterparties and concentration of risk. The firms also must share what amounts to a Plan B -- details for how the company can be wound down through the bankruptcy process. 
Under pressure from the industry, regulators agreed to phase in the due dates for firms to submit the living wills. The largest banks and financial firms, those with more than $250 billion in assets, are the first in line to file their paperwork. 
Armed with the contingency plans, regulators say they can prevent a repeat of the chaotic Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, which still lingers on today. 
"It's a preventative tool," said Thomas P. Vartanian, a former regulator who is now a partner at the law firm Dechert. "This will help the regulators be more nimble." 
Mr. Vartanian cautioned, however, that detecting the next financial crisis was no sure bet. "The question at the end of the day is will this help at the margin or will it change the whole picture," he said.

HEADLINE: The Merrill Lynch and Lehman Deals, 3 Years Later

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch and Barclays bought units of Lehman Brothers, but only one of these deals is looking smart.

 BODY:
This is a tale of two deals.
Three years ago today, Bank of America leapt into the maelstrom and bought Merrill Lynch for about $50 billion. Early the next morning, Lehman Brothers announced its bankruptcy filing. Lehman soon sold its investment banking and capital markets operations to Barclays for $250 million.
One of these deals has been a success. The other is questionable. The difference shows not only how a chief executive's hubris can destroy a company, but how three years later, the failure of the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the banks themselves to shrink significantly the banks' mortgage liabilities still threatens our economy.
 Of the two deals, the hands-down winner is the Lehman Brothers acquisition. Barclays paid anything but retail for Lehman, and in the process acquired a powerful franchise in the United States. Barclays is now the seventh-largest American investment bank measured by revenue, according to Dealogic. The former Lehman bankers are competing strongly in some crucial areas. In advising on mergers and acquisitions in the United States, Barclays was fifth in the first half of the year, according to Dealogic. Barclays was also the largest adviser on debt offerings in the world and third-largest in the United States.
At first blush, Merrill is also performing well, but in a way that highlights Bank of America's scarily poor performance. The bank lost $8.8 billion in the second quarter after taking a $20.7 billion write-off for mortgage-related losses. It would have been worse without Merrill. Bank of America's investment banking and wealth management operations, which are largely old Merrill operations, contributed $2.1 billion to Bank of America's profits on $11.3 billion of revenue.
While Merrill is currently throwing a lifeline to its parent, Bank of America, Merrill has also contributed substantially to Bank of America's problems. The Merrill acquisition added nearly $900 billion worth of assets to Bank of America's balance sheet. With that, Merrill's liabilities related to the mortgage crisis were assumed by Bank of America. It is unclear how big they are, but they total in the tens of billions. During the financial crisis, Merrill's mortgage problems forced Bank of America to take an extra $20 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program money.
This is where the two deals truly differ. Barclays's regulator stopped Barclays from buying Lehman before it declared bankruptcy. This was unbelievably lucky for Barclays. By buying Lehman out of bankruptcy, Barclays did not take on Lehman's toxic assets. These consisted of more than $600 billion in debt. Barclays avoided liability for most of it.
In contrast, Bank of America plunged headlong into buying Merrill. The deal was driven by Bank of America's former chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, who had lusted after Merrill Lynch for years. Bank of America paid a 70 percent premium three years ago for a bank that was worth far less and might have been insolvent. And while Bank of America executives a few months later appeared to get cold feet, the federal government pushed them to close the deal.
Being as deeply in the mortgage market as Merrill was - if not more so - Bank of America should have been aware in September 2008 of the problems looming on the horizon. Yet Mr. Lewis's eagerness to buy Merrill consumed all sober judgment. At the same time, blaming him alone is also simplistic. I wonder where the Bank of America board was in all of this. This is yet another example of a board failing in its responsibility to ask hard questions.
Things would have been different had Bank of America waited. It would at a minimum have paid a bargain basement price for Merrill, one that was tens of billions lower at least.
There is still some talk of spinning off Merrill Lynch. The operations of Merrill have already been combined with Bank of America, so a real separation would be complicated. And the recent reorganization of the bank's management - which puts Merrill Lynch's wealth management business under David Darnell, the co-chief operating officer, but Bank of America-Merrill Lynch under the other chief operating officer, Tom Montag - also makes a split more difficult.
Ultimately, Barclays made a better deal by doing what should be done in an acquisition, carefully assessing the future liabilities and limiting them as much as possible. But let's be clear. Barclays did this only because it was forced to by the regulator.
The first lesson of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch is that impatience and a chief executive's hubris can lead to some very bad decisions. And regulators can sometimes stop these heady moves.
There is also a larger lesson here. In the case of Barclays, a regulator asserted that the liabilities could not be assumed. These had to be dealt with before the acquisition. The result was a messy and expensive bankruptcy process for Lehman, but one that has allowed the viable part of Lehman to prosper.
In contrast, Merrill was anything but a clean acquisition. Merrill's toxic assets were put together with Bank of America's and Countrywide's toxic assets. While some argue that Merrill's investment banking division is helping Bank of America, this ignores the fact that Merrill's mortgage assets are now most likely hurting the bank even more.
The ultimate lesson from these two deals is that taking your medicine early is worthwhile. Regulators and banks still have not come to terms with the mortgage debt on bank balance sheets left over from the financial crisis, let alone the liability these banks face for selling these mortgages to investors.
This is a problem concentrated in the large banks. As of the end of last year, the four biggest banks held 42 percent of the $950 billion in second-lien loans then outstanding, according to The American Banker, which most banks have yet to write down. Bank of America alone held $136 billion of these loans as of the first quarter. Second-lien loans are the riskiest of mortgage assets because they are the most likely to be written down. According to CoreLogic, 23.1 percent of the nation's mortgaged homes are underwater, their owners owing more than the home is worth. This means that there will be more pain for Bank of America and other large banks in the coming years.
Putting together Bank of America's and Merrill's bad assets has only kicked the can down the road. Three years after that fateful September weekend changed Wall Street, the same mortgage liabilities continue to haunt many banks. This is not a worry for Barclays, at least in the United States. It made the better deal.

HEADLINE: With Surf, Fisker Builds a Karma Hauler

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The wagon will join the range-extended Karma electric sedan in 2013, the company said.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Fisker Automotive, the nascent electric car manufacturer, unveiled its Surf wagon here on Tuesday.
Henrik Fisker, the company's head designer and chief executive, said the Surf would definitely join the Karma as part of the company's lineup and would be available for North American and international delivery in 2013. Price will be in the same range as the Karma, which is selling from about $97,000 to $110,000.
A turbocharged 260-horsepower 4-cylinder gasoline engine, which does not turn the wheels, acts as a generator to charge the battery pack. The Surf would have an electric-only range of 50 miles and an additional 250 miles when the gas engine is engaged. Like the Karma, the Surf operates in Sport or energy-saving Stealth modes. In Sport, the car can reach 60 m.p.h. from a standstill in 5.9 seconds and achieve a 125 m.p.h. top speed, while in Stealth those numbers are a more conservative 7.9 seconds and 95 m.p.h., according to Mr. Fisker.
He added that the Surf was envisioned to be a utilitarian lifestyle vehicle along the lines of the classic Chevrolet Nomad or Dodge Magnum wagons.
The market for surfer-focused vehicles would seem dubious at best, even in the hot California beach culture. Honda introduced the Element utility vehicle in the 2003 model year and said its hose-out interior (not available on the Fisker Surf, by the way) and other rough-and-ready features were aimed at young men who surfed or otherwise spent a lot of time at the beach. Honda found the demographic to be smaller than originally hoped and less affluent that envisioned.
Unemployed slackers might be too harsh a term, but if beach bums couldn't afford a sub-$20,000 Element, one wonders how they might bankroll the purchase of a six-figure Surf.

HEADLINE: Regulators Fear Legal Challenges to Derivatives Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: In the wake of a court ruling, Scott O'Malia of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said his agency was rewriting rules to account for their impact on the financial industry.

 BODY:
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is moving to safeguard dozens of derivatives regulations from legal challenges after a federal appeals court recently struck down a new rule for corporate America, an agency official said Tuesday. 
Scott O'Malia, a Republican member of the commission, said his agency was rewriting its so-called position limits rule, among others, to account for the regulation's economic impact on the financial industry. In July, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the so-called proxy access rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission, rebuking that agency for not fully evaluating the rule's economic effects.
"That ruling sent a wake-up call," Mr. O'Malia said during a speech at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's annual conference in New York on Tuesday. "We are trying to do better in our rule-making."
He warned, however, that the commodity trading commission's cost-benefit analyses were still not up to snuff. "We're not there yet," he said. 
The new rules stem from the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul enacted after the credit crisis. Over the last several weeks since the appellate court decision was handed down, industry groups like the United State Chamber of Commercehave been examining legal challenges to other crucial components of Dodd-Frank, people familiar with the matter said. 
The commodity trading commission's position limits plan, which will rein in speculative trading on more than 20 commodities, is one likely target. In March, the Futures Industry Association urged the commission to scrap its position limits plan, saying it "may be legally infirm."
Mr. O'Malia previously called on the agency to re-examine every cost-benefit analysis drawn up for Dodd-Frank. Now, the agency has agreed to delay voting on the trading caps proposal until officials draft a more robust cost-benefit analysis. 
"I want to be sensitive to the costs," Mr. O'Malia said. 
Gary Gensler, the agency's chairman, recently defended the process, saying, "It is important to point out that each of our final rules includes a careful consideration of costs and benefits."
In May, the commission's general counsel and chief economist issued a memo spelling out guidelines for cost-benefit analyses. But following the appeals court decision, agency lawyers revisited the earlier criteria. The general counsel recently sent out another memo detailing the agency's exposure to possible legal challenges. 
Mr. O'Malia, speaking to an audience of derivatives lawyers and risk managers, noted the broad influence Wall Street was exerting on regulators. 
"I think the industry has has a huge impact on the rule-writing process," he said. "We are listening."

HEADLINE: General Electric to Pay Back Warren Buffett

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: General Electric said it would pay back the $3 billion investment that Berkshire Hathaway made during the depths of the financial crisis.

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett continues to collect benefits from the financial crisis. 
On Tuesday, General Electric said it would pay back the $3 billion investment that Berkshire Hathaway made during the depths of the financial crisis, netting Mr. Buffett a tidy profit. 
Mr. Buffett will get back his principal, a $300 million bonus, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, according to the regulatory filing. General Electric is set to repay the investment on Oct. 17.
The billionaire investor has been quick to capitalize on the problems of financial firms, forging deals at beneficial terms to Berkshire.
Just before striking a deal with General Electric, Mr. Buffett picked up a stake in Goldman Sachs in 2008. Earlier this year, the investment bank returned the $5 billion to Berkshire along with an extra $500 million for paying back the investment early. 
The investment netted Mr. Buffett $1.7 billion in total, or roughly $190,000 a day. At the time, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, joked that he would pay the Omaha investor back in one-dollar bills. Mr. Buffett said that was fine, provided Goldman kept up the dividend until he was finished counting the bills. 
As the market turbulence has picked up in recent months, Mr. Buffett has continued to hunt for opportunities. 
In August, Berkshire took a $5 billion stake in Bank of America. Mr. Buffett is set to receive a 6 percent annual dividend.
Berkshire Hathaway provided G.E. with much needed support in the crisis. 
Amid the market turmoil in the fall of 2008, the conglomerate ratcheted back expectations for earnings, citing "unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services markets." The company also cut its dividend, stopped its stock buyback program, and issued additional shares to raise capital. 
But it wasn't enough. 
As the stock continued to plummet, General Electric reached out Berkshire for a lifeline. With his investment, Mr. Buffett gave his implicit stamp of approval.
But Mr. Buffett extracted a hefty price for his largesse. The company agreed to pay a 10 percent annual dividend on the $3 billion investment. 
Since then, G.E. has steadily improved its operations, notably retooling its finance arm to focus on less risky lending strategies. In the second quarter, G.E. Capital reported a profit of $1 billion, up 57 percent from the same period in 2010.
"General Electric proved to be vulnerable to the financial crisis in 2008, as the group had sizeable troubled assets and was too dependent on funding through the commercial paper market," Henk van Tulden, an analyst with financial firm Financiele Diensten Amsterdam, wrote in a recent report. "The company reacted by restructuring, downsizing and stabilizing its financial division."
But despite the improvements, the stock has continued to languish, a situation that could crimp Mr. Buffett's total profits on his G.E. investment. Berkshire still has the option to buy $3 billion worth of G.E. common shares for $22.25 a piece until late 2013. 
G.E. is currently trading at $15.41, down nearly 40 percent from when Mr. Buffett made his investment nearly three years ago.

HEADLINE: A Wilderness Ranger, Age 21

BYLINE: MAX BEARAK


HIGHLIGHT: A college student spends his summer scrambling over hundreds of miles of rock and dirt in the mountain ranges of eastern Nevada, courtesy of a group known as the Student Conservation Association.

 BODY:
I'm a senior in college, which means that everyone I meet feels entitled to ask me, "So, what are you planning to do after you graduate?" But I'm at a liberal arts school, so I always respond with an "I'm not sure yet" or an "I'm going to take what comes my way."
The truth is, over the last couple of summers I've been scratching a few itches -- a few jobs that I probably won't pursue after college but that were nonetheless appealing. Two of the most overwhelming urges were to use my hands for some physical labor and to work outdoors, preferably somewhere stunningly beautiful. So this summer I packed up an old Chevy Impala till it was almost bursting and drove out to Ely, Nev., to work in Humboldt National Forest as a wilderness ranger.
The job involves lots of hiking and data-gathering in areas that Congress has designated as wilderness areas. Armed with a GPS unit, a topographic map and a satellite phone, a partner and I scrambled over hundreds of miles of rock and dirt in the mountain ranges of eastern Nevada, more often than not without trails to guide us, marking down locations of natural springs, abandoned mine shafts and areas affected by invasive species.
Far from the tourist bonanzas in Colorado and California, not once did I run into another hiker in the wilderness areas, where no motorized travel is permitted. I had come seeking physical work and the outdoors, and I received it in full, complete with starry nights, sweeping vistas of thunderstorms coming my way across vast valleys, and the pleasure of falling asleep in a pitched tent to the sound of aspen leaves blowing in the wind.

Humboldt National Forest and Nevada as a whole are entirely located in the Great Basin, a geological region in which the land (if you believe my amateur geology) is slowly being pulled apart, creating long and deep north-south fissures in the earth where the ground is weaker.
Into those fissures slide massive rocks, yielding vast valleys that alternate with skinny north-south ranges where the rock has seesawed upward. From above, or via Google Earth, the ranges look like green caterpillars inching along a golden carpet of desert. I've now walked almost the entire length of three of those ranges.
In no small part I owe my opportunity to work as a wilderness ranger to the federal government's extensive ownership of public lands and its commitment (though sometimes not wholly reliable) to their management and conservation.
The federal government owns a whopping 84.5 percent of the land in the state of Nevada, more than in any other state in the country. The Forest Service administers the long strips of jagged mountain covered in fir, pine, aspen and juniper; larger, emptier swaths are home to some of our country's biggest missile and bomb testing ranges; and the remaining two-thirds are under the Bureau of Land Management's purview. Countless animals roam this territory, including mustangs, elk, mule deer and mountain lions.
Nationwide, the federal government has direct ownership of nearly 30 percent of the land, and someone has to manage all of it. That opens immense and rewarding opportunities for young people to take part in the stewardship. With youth unemployment rates hovering just beneath 20 percent, getting hands-on training and work experience on public lands is a valuable way to improve your competitive standing in today's job market.
Traditionally, government agencies that administer public lands have tended to hire locally, which puts job seekers in urban areas, especially in eastern states, where little land is publicly owned, at a disadvantage. In contrast to Nevada, less than one-half of 1 percent of the land in Connecticut and Rhode Island is federally owned.
Then there was a case like mine: I had scarcely even gone camping or backpacked for leisure in my whole life when I applied to the Student Conservation Association, a nonprofit nongovernmental organization that recruits interns interested in conservation and places them in over 500 natural and cultural sites in all 50 states. Most of the jobs I applied for were marketed as wilderness ranger or trail crew positions, and they were overwhelmingly in parks and forests in the intermountain West, saturated as it is with public lands.
The application was simple and to the point. I used it to apply for multiple positions, which, had I branched out, could have included archaeology or even ecological research projects. It also gave me access to positions in other states, whereas applying directly through government agencies might have limited me to scarcer jobs close to my home in Minnesota.
By last spring, I had submitted my application for over 20 positions, and despite my inexperience, I heard back from a good number of them and arranged short phone interviews.
In conjunction with agencies like the Forest Service and the National Park Service, the Student Conservation Association now places successful applicants into about 4,200 positions each year. For high school students, it offers four-to-six-week positions in which they work on a team with six to eight other peers, usually doing trail maintenance.
For applicants 18 and older, positions last from 12 weeks to a year. Offerings come into the association on a rolling basis, and applications are submitted on the same rolling basis. I applied for the busy summer season, but given the ease of applying to so many positions at once, my chance of getting hired greatly increased.
Jobs on public lands are expanding with federal stimulus money, and the association is responding by enlarging its own operations. Kevin Hamilton, vice president for marketing and communications at the conservation association, told me in an e-mail that in view of the management needs on public lands and a surge in interest among the young, his organization planned to place 10,000 members per year by the end of the decade.
The government itself envisages similar positions. Ken Salazar, secretary of the interior, has laid out plans for a 21st-century Youth Conservation Corps, which would greatly expand service and work opportunities for young people on public lands.
This expansion is crucial to meeting environmental needs but also to accommodating young Americans seeking work in this field: figures from this last summer season show that only one in four applicants to the association gets placed, largely because of a shortage of financing. While the interns make less than a regularly employed Forest Service employee doing the same job, the cost to the association is still high.
The interns' travel costs are reimbursed, and each one receives a room-and-board stipend. Some interns also receive Americorps education awards through their service, which translate into sizable scholarships. Such an opportunity is rare in an economy where many prospective employers require interns to pay for their work experience.
The association is also committed to turning internship experiences into careers. Mr. Hamilton explained that a large percentage of the agencies' work forces will reach retirement age in the next few years. "Virtually all the agencies are looking for younger and more ethnically/culturally diverse employees to help them better connect with the broad audiences they must serve," he wrote in an e-mail.
I'm already longing to return to the wilderness as my classes begin. Something out West really beckoned to me, and following that call is a decision I'll never regret.

Today's Times

        
The decision by Tim Pawlenty, a former Republican presidential candidate, to support Mitt Romney's campaign signals the beginning of an effort by some party leaders to try to slow the ascent of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Jeff Zeleny and Michael D. Shear report. Mr. Perry's candidacy is creating unease in some quarters of the party's establishment, particularly over his views of Social Security.

        
White House officials said they believed President Obama's jobs bill could pass Congress, despite Republicans taking aim at the plan just two hours after Mr. Obama called for bipartisanship. They denounced the plan to pay for the jobs initiative through tax increases on more affluent Americans - most of them tax increases previously rejected by lawmakers, Helene Cooper and Jennifer Steinhauer report.

        
The federal government paid billions of dollars more to hire contractors than it would have cost government employees to perform similar services, Ron Nixon reports. A new study shows that contractors charged the federal government more than twice the amount it pays federal workers.

        
The Obama administration is investing billions of dollars to promote economic development in rural areas, but critics say the White House has little to show for its efforts. Opponents of the efforts say that the money has gone to areas where it's not needed, and that the lack of progress highlights the difficulties of creating jobs in remote locations, Ron Nixon reports.
Happenings in Washington

        
After morning meetings with advisers and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, President Obama will travel to Columbus, Ohio, to talk about his jobs proposal. When he gets back to Washington, he will meet with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet with President Traian Basescu of Romania. Later Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, will host a reception in honor of the 17th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act.

        
The first lady, Michelle Obama, will honor the Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Award winners with a luncheon at the White House. The winners will later attend the National Teen Design Fair with a keynote address given by Tim Gunn, co-host of Lifetime's "Project Runway."

HEADLINE: Warren Jumping Into Race for Brown's Senate Seat

BYLINE: ABBY GOODNOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: Elizabeth Warren is jumping into the race for Senate from Massachusetts against Scott Brown.

 BODY:
BOSTON - Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law professor who has battled the financial industry as a consumer advocate, will announce her candidacy Wednesday for what will likely be a high-profile race against Senator Scott P. Brown.
 A senior adviser to Ms. Warren said she would spend the day greeting voters in Boston, Springfield, Worcester and other heavily Democratic cities around Massachusetts. Ms. Warren, 62, started an exploratory committee last month and for weeks has been meeting quietly with Democratic activists while mulling whether to join an already-crowded field of Democrats hoping to unseat Mr. Brown.
"The pressures on middle-class families are worse than ever, but it is the big corporations that get their way in Washington," Ms. Warren said in a statement Tuesday. "I want to change that. I will work my heart out to earn the trust of the people of Massachusetts." 
Democrats salivate at the thought of unseating Mr. Brown, a popular freshman who shocked them in 2010 by winning the seat that Edward M. Kennedy held for 47 years. National Democrats, in particular, have been eager for Ms. Warren to join the race after deciding that the field lacked a standout. 
 Mr. Brown has already raised nearly $10 million for his re-election race, but many Democrats say Ms. Warren could easily match him in fund-raising by tapping into national networks. 
 Ms. Warren's attacks on the banking industry after the economic collapse won her acclaim among liberal Democrats. She helped create the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington, but President Obama decided against tapping her to run it after Senate Republicans threatened to block her nomination.
 Republicans have already branded Ms. Warren a Harvard elitist and an outsider, stressing that she was born and raised in Oklahoma. But Ms. Warren has stressed her upbringing on "the ragged edge of the middle class." The daughter of a maintenance man, she has said that she began waiting tables when she was 13. 
 Other Democrats in the race include Alan Khazei, who co-founded a national service program and finished third in a field of four candidates in the Democratic primary in 2009, and Setti Warren, the mayor of suburban Newton. The other declared candidates are Thomas Conroy, a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives; Marisa DeFranco, a lawyer in Salem; Robert Massie, a former candidate for lieutenant governor; Jim King, a lawyer in Boston; and Herb Robinson, an engineer from Newton. 
A previous version of this article misstated Senator Scott P. Brown's middle initial as 'R.'

When you think of the William J. Clinton Foundation, you probably think of AIDS and malaria treatment in poor countries around the world. Or maybe micro-credit for thousands of micro-businesses in many of those same places. Now add to those accomplishments the ability to book Lady Gaga, Usher, and Bono and the Edge of U2 for a party.
The foundation announced on Tuesday that those performers, along with others to be announced -- a group promised to collectively represent "the most influential and socially responsible artists in music, film and television" -- will be taking part in "A Decade of Difference: A Concert Celebrating 10 Years of the William J. Clinton Foundation," at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on Oct. 15. The show will be broadcast live online by Yahoo. 
"I am proud that some of today's most influential performers are coming together to raise awareness about the work of my foundation," President Clinton said in a statement. "In the past decade, commitments to my Clinton Global Initiative have improved the lives of more than 300 million people around the world. We've lowered the cost of AIDS and H.I.V. treatment, combated climate change, strengthened economies, increased access to education and healthcare, provided financing and mentoring for small businesses. This celebration marks 10 years of these efforts and demonstrates how much we can do to make a difference in the years ahead."
U2's record of social and political activism is well known, as is Lady Gaga's support for gay rights. Usher, the singer of hits like "Yeah!" and "Love in This Club," is perhaps not as closely identified with social causes. He does, however, have an educational foundation, Usher's New Look, which made more than $840,000 in charitable contributions in 2009, the last year for which its tax returns are publicly available. For the last two years Usher's New Look has held a leadership conference in Atlanta, the singer's hometown. The guest of honor at the inaugural event was President Clinton.

HEADLINE: American Military Team Visits Libya to Assess Risks of Reopening U.S. Embassy

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
TRIPOLI, Libya -- American forces are back on the shores of Tripoli -- albeit in a small way.
Four members of the American military are in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, to determine what security measures are necessary to reopen the United States Embassy here, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday.
The embassy closed when staff members and other American citizens were evacuated during the six-month revolution that drove Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi from power. It is now preparing to reopen as Libyan-American relations begin a new chapter. 
Diplomatic relations with what is now Libya have a complex history going back to America's first decades. Though another North African Muslim state, Morocco, was among the first countries in the world to recognize the United States diplomatically, the new nation soon fought the Barbary Wars in the region over attacks on its ships by Berber pirates from Tripoli -- the origin of the ''shores of Tripoli'' reference in the Marines' Hymn.
In more recent years, given America's seesawing relationship with Colonel Qaddafi, the United States Embassy was closed for a long time. Even after it reopened in 2006, it was guarded by Libyan security personnel, not the Marine guards that are common at other diplomatic posts around the world.
Now, with Colonel Qaddafi ousted, many Libyans express excitement at the prospect of improved relations with the West and the rest of the world. Officials of the de facto government and citizens alike say they plan to seek foreign advice about establishing the rule of law, expanding their economy and adhering to international human rights standards after decades of isolation.
The challenges involved were highlighted on Tuesday when Amnesty International released a report contending that anti-Qaddafi forces had committed unlawful killings and torture during the rebellion.
The report said that the pro-Qaddafi forces had committed many more serious violations, but that Colonel Qaddafi's opponents ''have also committed human rights abuses, in some cases amounting to war crimes, albeit on a smaller scale.''
The Transitional National Council, the new government in Libya, issued a statement on Tuesday acknowledging that there had been ''a small number of incidents'' committed by anti-Qaddafi fighters during the uprising.
The council condemned ''any abuses perpetrated by either side'' and said it was ''firmly committed to upholding human rights and the rule of law, both international and local -- the violation of rights no longer has a place in Libya.''
Dr. Aref Nayed, the chief of the council's stabilization team, said a day before the report was released that a top priority was to seek the advice of international experts to establish Libyan institutions that could protect the human rights of both sides in the conflict.
Many Libyans say they are hungry for foreign advice and help; some road signs even display the flags of the United States and other Western countries and thank them for their assistance -- a rare sight in this part of the world. But Libyans are wary of the possibility that foreign interests might hijack their revolution, making even the visit of four members of the American military a delicate matter.
Capt. John Kirby of the Navy, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told The Associated Press that the American service members, including two who specialize in the disposal of explosives, are not in Libya in an offensive or defensive military capacity, only to help the State Department.
The Pentagon has acknowledged only once before that American service members were inside Libya during the uprising -- in March, when Marines rescued an American pilot who had ejected over the country while participating in a NATO airstrike. There has been speculation that intelligence personnel were on the ground helping to target airstrikes. The White House said no ground troops would be deployed during the NATO action.
Diplomatic relations soured early in Colonel Qaddafi's rule; the United States withdrew its ambassador in 1972 and closed its embassy in 1979 after a mob burned it. That same year, the United States listed Libya as a sponsor of terrorism; in 1986, after a bombing in a Berlin disco, the United States conducted airstrikes in Libya. Relations worsened with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.
But in 2003, relations started to normalize after Colonel Qaddafi renounced chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. A liaison office opened in 2004; it was upgraded to an embassy in 2006.
While other American embassies in the region tend to be fortresslike compounds, the Libyan government had not given permission for construction, and the American diplomatic offices in Tripoli were instead in residential houses.

HEADLINE: Poverty Rate Soars to Highest Level Since 1993

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Another 2.6 million people slipped into poverty in the United States last year, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday, and the number of Americans living below the official poverty line, 46.2 million people, was the highest number in the 52 years the bureau has been publishing figures on it.
And in new signs of distress among the middle class, median household incomes fell last year to levels last seen in 1996.
Economists pointed to a telling statistic: It was the first time since the Great Depression that median household income, adjusted for inflation, had not risen over such a long period, said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard. 
''This is truly a lost decade,'' Mr. Katz said. ''We think of America as a place where every generation is doing better, but we're looking at a period when the median family is in worse shape than it was in the late 1990s.''
The bureau's findings were worse than many economists expected, and brought into sharp relief the toll the past decade -- including the painful declines of the financial crisis and recession --had taken on Americans at the middle and lower parts of the income ladder. It is also fresh evidence that the disappointing economic recovery has done nothing for the country's poorest citizens.
The report said the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line last year, 15.1 percent, was the highest level since 1993. (The poverty line in 2010 for a family of four was $22,314.)
The report comes as President Obama gears up to try to pass a jobs bill, and analysts said the bleak numbers could help him make his case for urgency. But they could also be used against him by Republican opponents seeking to highlight economic shortcomings on his watch.
''This is one more piece of bad news on the economy,'' said Ron Haskins, a director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution. ''This will be another cross to bear by the administration.''
The past decade was also marked by a growing gap between the very top and very bottom of the income ladder. Median household income for the bottom tenth of the income spectrum fell by 12 percent from a peak in 1999, while the top 90th percentile dropped by just 1.5 percent. Overall, median household income adjusted for inflation declined by 2.3 percent in 2010 from the previous year, to $49,445. That was 7 percent less than the peak of $53,252 in 1999. Part of the income decline over time is because of the smaller size of the American family.
This year is not likely to be any better, economists said. Stimulus money has largely ended, and state and local governments have made deep cuts to staff and to budgets for social programs, both likely to move economically fragile families closer to poverty.
Minorities were hit hardest. Blacks experienced the highest poverty rate, at 27 percent, up from 25 percent in 2009, and Hispanics rose to 26 percent from 25 percent. For whites, 9.9 percent lived in poverty, up from 9.4 percent in 2009. Asians were unchanged at 12.1 percent.
An analysis by the Brookings Institution estimated that at the current rate, the recession will have added nearly 10 million people to the ranks of the poor by the middle of the decade.
Joblessness was the main culprit pushing more Americans into poverty, economists said.
Last year, about 48 million people ages 18 to 64 did not work even one week out of the year, up from 45 million in 2009, said Trudi Renwick, a Census official.
''Once you've been out of work for a long time, it's a very difficult road to get back,'' Mr. Katz said.
Median income fell across all working-age categories, but was sharpest drop was among the young working Americans, ages 15 to 24, who experienced a decline of 9 percent.
According to the Census figures, the median annual income for a male full-time, year-round worker in 2010 -- $47,715 -- was virtually unchanged, in 2010 dollars, from its level in 1973, when it was $49,065, said Sheldon Danziger, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.
Those who do not have college degrees were particularly hard hit, he said. ''The median, full-time male worker has made no progress on average,'' Mr. Danziger said.
The recession has continued pushing 25-to-34-year-olds to move in with family and friends to save money. Of that group, nearly half were living below the poverty line, when their parents' incomes were excluded. The poverty level for a single person under the age of 65 was $11,344.
''We're risking a new underclass,'' said Timothy Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
''Young, less-educated adults, mainly men, can't support their children and form stable families because they are jobless,'' he added.
But even the period of economic growth that came before the recession did little for the middle and bottom wage earners.
Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the period from 2001 to 2007 was the first recovery on record where the level of poverty was deeper, and median income of working-age people was lower, at the end than at the beginning.
''Even before the recession hit, a lot of people were falling behind,'' he said. ''This may be adding to people's sense of urgency about the economy.''
The suburban poverty rate, at 11.8 percent, appears to be the highest since 1967, Mr. Sherman added. Last year more Americans fell into deep poverty, defined as less than half the official poverty line, or about $11,000, with the ranks of that group increasing to 20.5 million, or about 6.7 percent of the population.
Poverty has also swallowed more children, with about 16.4 million in its ranks last year, the highest numbers since 1962, according to William Frey, senior demographer at Brookings. That means 22 percent of children are in poverty, the highest percentage since 1993.
The census figures do not count noncash assistance, like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, and economists say that as a result they tend to overstate poverty numbers for certain groups, like children. But rises in the cost of housing, medical care and energy are not taken into account, either.
The report also said the number of uninsured Americans increased by 900,000 to 49.9 million.
Those covered by employer-based insurance continued to decline in 2010, to about 55 percent, while those with government-provided coverage continued to increase, up slightly to 31 percent. Employer-based coverage was down from 65 percent in 2000, the report said.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the rise in the poverty rate misstated the year in which the median income, which fell last year, was at a similar level. It was 1996, not 1997. The article also gave an incorrect figure for the number of people the Census Bureau found to be in poverty in the United States. The number is 46.2 million people, not 56.2 million.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the rise in the poverty rate misstated the name of a research center based at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. It is the Institute for Research on Poverty, not the Institute for Research and Poverty.

HEADLINE: The Merrill Lynch and Lehman Deals, Three Years Later

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @Steven- Davidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
This is a tale of two deals.
Three years ago today, Bank of America leapt into the maelstrom and bought Merrill Lynch for about $50 billion. Early the next morning, Lehman Brothers announced its bankruptcy filing. Lehman soon sold its investment banking and capital markets operations to Barclays for $250 million.
One of these deals has been a success. The other is questionable. The difference shows not only how a chief executive's hubris can destroy a company, but how three years later, the failure of the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the banks themselves to shrink significantly the banks' mortgage liabilities still threatens our economy. 
Of the two deals, the hands-down winner is the Lehman Brothers acquisition. Barclays paid anything but retail for Lehman, and in the process acquired a powerful franchise in the United States. Barclays is now the seventh-largest American investment bank measured by revenue, according to Dealogic. The former Lehman bankers are competing strongly in some crucial areas. In advising on mergers and acquisitions in the United States, Barclays was fifth in the first half of the year, according to Dealogic. Barclays was also the largest adviser on debt offerings in the world and third-largest in the United States.
At first blush, Merrill is also performing well, but in a way that highlights Bank of America's scarily poor performance. The bank lost $8.8 billion in the second quarter after taking a $20.7 billion write-off for mortgage-related losses. It would have been worse without Merrill. Bank of America's investment banking and wealth management operations, which are largely old Merrill operations, contributed $2.1 billion to Bank of America's profits on $11.3 billion of revenue.
While Merrill is currently throwing a lifeline to its parent, Bank of America, Merrill has also contributed substantially to Bank of America's problems. The Merrill acquisition added nearly $900 billion worth of assets to Bank of America's balance sheet. With that, Merrill's liabilities related to the mortgage crisis were assumed by Bank of America. It is unclear how big they are, but they total in the tens of billions. During the financial crisis, Merrill's mortgage problems forced Bank of America to take an extra $20 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program money.
This is where the two deals truly differ. Barclays's regulator stopped Barclays from buying Lehman before it declared bankruptcy. This was unbelievably lucky for Barclays. By buying Lehman out of bankruptcy, Barclays did not take on Lehman's toxic assets. These consisted of more than $600 billion in debt. Barclays avoided liability for most of it.
In contrast, Bank of America plunged headlong into buying Merrill. The deal was driven by Bank of America's former chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, who had lusted after Merrill Lynch for years. Bank of America paid a 70 percent premium three years ago for a bank that was worth far less and might have been insolvent. And while Bank of America executives a few months later appeared to get cold feet, the federal government pushed them to close the deal.
Being as deeply in the mortgage market as Merrill was - if not more so - Bank of America should have been aware in September 2008 of the problems looming on the horizon. Yet Mr. Lewis's eagerness to buy Merrill consumed all sober judgment. At the same time, blaming him alone is also simplistic. I wonder where the Bank of America board was in all of this. This is yet another example of a board failing in its responsibility to ask hard questions.
Things would have been different had Bank of America waited. It would at a minimum have paid a bargain basement price for Merrill, one that was tens of billions lower at least.
There is still some talk of spinning off Merrill Lynch. The operations of Merrill have already been combined with Bank of America, so a real separation would be complicated. And the recent reorganization of the bank's management - which puts Merrill Lynch's wealth management business under David Darnell, the co-chief operating officer, but Bank of America-Merrill Lynch under the other chief operating officer, Tom Montag - also makes a split more difficult.
Ultimately, Barclays made a better deal by doing what should be done in an acquisition, carefully assessing the future liabilities and limiting them as much as possible. But let's be clear. Barclays did this only because it was forced to by the regulator.
The first lesson of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch is that impatience and a chief executive's hubris can lead to some very bad decisions. And regulators can sometimes stop these heady moves.
There is also a larger lesson here. In the case of Barclays, a regulator asserted that the liabilities could not be assumed. These had to be dealt with before the acquisition. The result was a messy and expensive bankruptcy process for Lehman, but one that has allowed the viable part of Lehman to prosper.
In contrast, Merrill was anything but a clean acquisition. Merrill's toxic assets were put together with Bank of America's and Countrywide's toxic assets. While some argue that Merrill's investment banking division is helping Bank of America, this ignores the fact that Merrill's mortgage assets are now most likely hurting the bank even more.
The ultimate lesson from these two deals is that taking your medicine early is worthwhile. Regulators and banks still have not come to terms with the mortgage debt on bank balance sheets left over from the financial crisis, let alone the liability these banks face for selling these mortgages to investors.
This is a problem concentrated in the large banks. As of the end of last year, the four biggest banks held 42 percent of the $950 billion in second-lien loans then outstanding, according to The American Banker, which most banks have yet to write down. Bank of America alone held $136 billion of these loans as of the first quarter. Second-lien loans are the riskiest of mortgage assets because they are the most likely to be written down. According to CoreLogic, 23.1 percent of the nation's mortgaged homes are underwater, their owners owing more than the home is worth. This means that there will be more pain for Bank of America and other large banks in the coming years.
Putting together Bank of America's and Merrill's bad assets has only kicked the can down the road. Three years after that fateful September weekend changed Wall Street, the same mortgage liabilities continue to haunt many banks. This is not a worry for Barclays, at least in the United States. It made the better deal.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: North Korean Cruise Seeks Tourists, 8 to a Room

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Edy Yin contributed research.

 BODY:
ABOARD THE MANGYONGBONG, off North Korea -- It was billed as a cruise ship, but the creaking, nearly-40-year-old vessel that set sail from the remote North Korean town of Rajin had more of the trappings of a tramp steamer. With its cramped cabins, cut-rate cuisine and foul, water-deprived bathrooms, it was not about to compete anytime soon with Cunard or Carnival in the leisure industry.
Then again, it does not have to. As North Korea's latest venture into the tourism business, it need not concern itself with rivals. The trick, as its operators conceded, will be to attract enough vacationers.
Desperate for foreign currency, officials in secretive North Korea are trying to lure tourists to holiday cruises along the length of the impoverished country's east coast. Earlier this month, a trial run by the rusty Mangyongbong was completed in 43 trying hours at sea. More than 200 people were packed into dim and musty cabins, sometimes eight to a room with floor mattresses. Chinese tourists and businesspeople shared quarters with North Korean officials and foreign journalists. 
The inaugural cruise presumably had support at the highest levels in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The organizer, Taepung International Investment Group, falls under the National Defense Commission, which answers directly to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il.
''I love peace and the Korean Peninsula,'' said Park Chol-su, president of Taepung, as he sat on the deck of the Mangyongbong. ''Our company symbolizes peace. We can even hire Americans.''
The North Korean government may be one of the world's most paranoid and hermetic, but it sees tourism playing an increasingly important role in its economy. Tourism is exempt from the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations to pressure Mr. Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons program, and it has been growing in recent years as foreigners strain to get a glimpse of this country.
It is difficult to get reliable statistics on tourist numbers, but one well-connected person in the industry estimated that at least 24,000 foreign tourists visited last year, more than 80 percent of them Chinese.
There have even been two recent motorcade tours in which Chinese have driven their own cars into North Korea.
Critics say money from tourism helps prop up a repressive regime. But advocates of engagement contend that tourism helps open the country to outside influences, and that the revenue could help ordinary Koreans get through the current hardship.
''Tourism was a major factor that allowed Cuba to weather the end of the Soviet trading system after the cold war,'' said John Delury, a historian at Yonsei University in Seoul who observes relations between the two Koreas and China. ''Of course, North Korea can't rival tropical Cuba as a tourist destination, but Pyongyang's embrace of bringing in foreign visitors is a positive sign of willingness to integrate more fully with the outside world.''
For Westerners, the annual staging of mass performances in Pyongyang, the Arirang Festival, has traditionally been the biggest draw, while Chinese have tended to make short trips across the border. But North Korean officials are clearly trying to appeal to higher-end travelers with the new cruise program. Mr. Park said he hoped to bring Europeans on the next voyage, possibly in October. He also said he intended to get a bigger, swankier boat.
The trial run began on Aug. 29, when Mr. Park led scores of foreigners across the border from northeast China to Rajin, the port town that North Korea has designated a free economic and trade zone. Some of the visitors had paid about $470 for the five-day trip, which included several days on land. Others were traveling free of charge because they were friends of Mr. Park, who is a Chinese citizen. Many of the Chinese ran tour agencies, and Mr. Park and North Korean officials were trying to encourage them to promote North Korea tourism.
Bilingual government guides had been assigned to the tour buses. An affable 25-year-old, Mun Ho-yong, spouted off some facts in English about his country: ''In 1950, there was a war, the Korean War, started by the United States.'' Now, he said, Korea had entered the phase of ''universal socialist construction.''
In Rajin, a town of dirt roads and occasional blackouts, the guides stuck to the program, first taking their guests to a towering portrait of North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung, for photographs and then ushering them into a theater to watch children perform patriotic numbers. That night, the visitors attended a banquet where the vice mayor, Hwang Chol-nam, toasted Mr. Park for organizing the cruise.
''It has not been easy,'' Mr. Hwang said. The two then belted out a karaoke song glorifying Kim Il-sung.
But it was at noon the next day that the real festivities got under way. At the harbor, where ships bearing coal depart for Shanghai, officials in dark suits lined up along a red carpet to give speeches. Then came the blaring of music dedicated to -- whom else? -- Kim Il-sung (''The Marshal Rides a Galloping White Horse''). Confetti flew and about 500 students and workers in uniforms waved flags and plastic flowers as the boat lurched from the dock.
The Mangyongbong had been used as a cargo ship since 1992, but before that had served as a passenger ferry mostly for North Koreans living in Japan. Their families were forcibly taken to Japan during the Japanese occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945, and decades later they rode the ferry to visit relatives in their homeland.
The North Korean coastline disappeared from view for much of the 21-hour journey south. There was no shuffleboard. Chinese passengers broke out decks of cards. Mr. Hwang, the vice mayor, changed from a navy suit into a green polo shirt and drank beers with foreigners on the top deck. An American asked him whether there was any chance the ship might stray into international waters and encounter foreign naval vessels.
''You're in North Korea here,'' Mr. Hwang said. ''You're completely safe. The North Korean military is protecting you.''
Dinner that night resembled a mess hall at an American Army base in Iraq: metal trays, fluorescent lights, diced chicken and cucumbers ladled from self-serve communal bowls. Waitresses threw leftovers overboard. The wind blew bits of trash back onto the deck.
The next morning, the boat pulled into the harbor of the nature park at Mount Kumgang, not far from the border with South Korea. The day and night spent there involved hiking, an acrobatics show and a video pitch for the Chinese businesspeople on investing in the park. The South Korean government has barred its citizens from traveling there since a fatal shooting in 2008, and the park's South Korean developer has suspended its operations. ''Now we're in a military zone; if you stay behind, you get shot,'' Mr. Mun said, apparently jokingly, as the buses pulled up to a rocky beach.
The hotel had a tennis court and a bar, and the visitors were taken to a well-trimmed golf course. There was even a North Korean-style duty-free shop offering, among other things, a homegrown version of Viagra (main ingredient: antler).
The return trip took 22 hours. After a lunch of instant noodles, the harbor at Rajin loomed in the distance. ''We admit that we have a lot of shortcomings to overcome,'' Mr. Park said.
The passengers stared at the buses waiting to take them back to China. ''One trip is enough for a lifetime,'' someone said. The ship slowly approached the dock.
Then there was a great crashing sound, and the Mangyongbong shuddered. ''It's like the Titanic,'' a Chinese man yelled. People pointed at the concrete pier -- the ship had rammed straight into it, denting the front of the hull and reducing a corner of the structure into a pile of rubble. The captain, it seemed, was just as eager as everyone else to get back to shore.

HEADLINE: Luxury Hotels Market the Memories They Can Make

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
SINCE the financial crisis began, millions of wealthy consumers have decided to play down the joy of accumulating things in favor of the pleasure of accumulating experiences. As a result, purveyors of premium-priced products and services are embracing the notion that they provide customers with moments to remember rather than with more stuff that needs dusting (by the help, most likely).
A case in point is the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company division of Marriott International, which is expressing that sentiment as the theme of a campaign scheduled to begin on Thursday: ''Let us stay with you.'' 
The switch, replacing the usual hotel-chain request to ''Please stay with us,'' is intended to convey that the memories of a visit to a Ritz-Carlton luxury property will last longer than another fluffy bathrobe.
Another upscale lodging chain, Orient-Express Hotels, is taking a similar tack in a campaign that is to begin on Monday, which carries the theme ''Embark on a journey like no other.'' The campaign is centered on video clips of a fictional family whose name, the Astorbilts, evokes wealth of yore but whose behavior is contemporary, valuing experiences over material possessions.
Orient-Express and Ritz-Carlton are among several luxury lodging chains that are continuing to advertise despite the recent bumpy ride that the economy has taken America on. Others include the Luxury Collection, part of Starwood Hotels and Resorts; Conrad Hotels and Resorts, an upscale brand in the Hilton Worldwide portfolio; and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.
''Our business volumes are currently ahead of the same time last year and our future bookings are ahead of the same time last year,'' said Chris Gabaldon, chief sales and marketing officer at Ritz-Carlton.
''I say that with caution,'' he added, because ''the economy is still very much in the early stages of a fragile recovery.''
Still, ''the one area the affluent consumer is likely to spend money on is travel,'' Mr. Gabaldon said. ''It's almost like rewarding yourself for making it through difficult times.''
His counterpart at Orient-Express, David Williams, chief marketing officer, echoed that assessment. ''At this point in time, revenue is about 14 to 15 percent up from last year,'' Mr. Williams said, ''and our booking trends are still very positive.''
''We don't have our eyes closed,'' he added, ''but our clients have been resilient.''
Still, encouraging even the rich to spend now is no walk on a private beach.
''Luxury is not a necessity,'' said Mark Miller, chief strategic officer at the Ritz-Carlton creative agency, Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., part of the Saatchi & Saatchi division of the Publicis Groupe.
So the new campaign takes an emotional tack, Mr. Miller said, to encourage travelers to evolve from ''measuring a stay in the number of days'' to ''measuring a stay in the number of memories, so you get your memory's worth, not just your money's worth.''
The ads list ways that guests can ask the hotels' 34,000 employees -- called the ''ladies and gentlemen of the Ritz-Carlton'' -- to create memories. Among them: ''Let us invent a drink in your honor,'' ''Let us take you snorkeling by moonlight,'' ''Let us turn a weekend getaway into a honeymoon you never thought you'd have,'' ''Let us introduce your kids to a loggerhead turtle,'' ''Let us re-create the recipe from your favorite meal in Paris'' and ''Let us make you captain of your very own ship.''
The videos in the Orient-Express campaign chronicle the ''unique experiences'' enjoyed by the Astorbilt family, which may remind viewers of other make-believe brand families, assembled by fashion labels, like the Diors and the Hilfigers.
The clips follow the Astorbilts -- father Duke, mother Lauren, son Maximillian and daughter Penelope -- as they travel and stay at properties like the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro; the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge and the Hotel Monasterio, both in Peru; and the Hotel Cipriani in Venice. And they also travel on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
''The idea is to create a world around each character,'' said Richard Christiansen, creative director at Chandelier Creative in New York, the Orient-Express creative agency, rather than to follow the template for hotel advertising and ''talk about a service and a room.''
''This had to be more editorial, more cinematic'' than traditional lodging campaigns, he added, ''so it feels like experiences, the experiences you get on a journey.''
To help the ads appeal to younger consumers, both campaigns will have extensive presences in social media like Facebook, Foursquare, Tumblr and Twitter as well as at online locations like orient-express.com/journeylikenoother and ritzcarlton.com/stories.
Orient-Express wants to attract ''the 29-year-old investment banker,'' Mr. Christiansen said, along with its typical customers who are ages 40 to 60.
The goal is to dispel perceptions of ''a stuffy old hotel,'' he added, and ''infuse a little sexiness back into the brand.''
The budget of the Ritz-Carlton campaign is estimated at $10 million to $15 million. According to Kantar Media, part of WPP, Ritz-Carlton spent $13.5 million on ads last year, $9.1 million in 2009, $17.6 million in 2008 and $22.1 million in 2007.
Orient-Express is spending about $1 million on its campaign. According to Kantar Media, Orient-Express spent $495,000 on ads last year, $158,000 in 2009, $496,000 in 2008 and $408,000 in 2007.

HEADLINE: Import Prices Fall for Second Time in 3 Months

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Prices of goods imported into the United States fell in August for the second time in three months as the cost of oil and food dropped, while autos stabilized, the Labor Department said Tuesday. 
The department said the import-price index fell 0.4 percent. The decline followed a 0.3 percent increase in July. Economists projected a 0.8 percent decrease, according to the median of 52 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices excluding fuel rose 0.2 percent.
Slower growth in Europe and emerging economies like China, together with less demand in the United States, may restrain the cost of goods from abroad. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said last week that ''transitory'' influences that had pushed up some prices would wane, and that the central bank had tools to spur growth if necessary.
Compared with a year earlier, import prices rose 13 percent, the report showed, down from a revised 13.8 percent increase in the 12 months ended in July.
The cost of imported petroleum fell 2.1 percent from the prior month and was up 44 percent from a year earlier.
Import prices excluding all fuels increased 5.3 percent from August 2010, after rising 5.4 percent in the year that ended in July.
Imported food was 0.8 percent less expensive last month. The cost of imported automobiles was little changed, which may reflect the easing of supply constraints after the disaster in Japan.
Consumer goods excluding vehicles showed a 0.3 percent gain and were up 2 percent over the last 12 months, the biggest year-over-year increase since November 2008. Costs for clothing made overseas climbed 1.2 percent last month.
United States export prices increased 0.5 percent after declining 0.4 percent the previous month, the report showed. Prices of farm exports increased 2.2 percent, while those of nonfarm goods climbed 0.3 percent.
The price of consumer goods shipped overseas excluding autos climbed 5.9 percent over the last 12 months, the biggest gain since the records began in 1983.

HEADLINE: Schrager Makes Over a Legendary Chicago Hotel

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Ian Schrager, whose indefatigable pursuit of buzz over the last 30 years has produced memorable hotels like the Royalton and the Gramercy Park in New York, the Mondrian in Los Angeles and the Delano in Miami Beach, is about to open his first new project as an independent hotelier since the 2008 financial crash.
Mr. Schrager's new venture -- which will have a limited opening here on Thursday -- is Chicago's faded but legendary Ambassador East Hotel.
''I'm in an opportunistic business,'' he said on a recent walk-through of the hotel's public spaces. ''You can't have a hotel company without having a hotel in Chicago. I've always wanted one, but never found one to buy until now.'' 
The hotel, which Mr. Schrager is calling the Public, dates from 1926 and is about a mile north of the Loop central business district in the Gold Coast lakefront residential neighborhood.
Mr. Schrager acquired the Ambassador East in the spring of 2010 for $25 million from the Harp Group, a locally based hospitality investment and development firm that paid $44.5 million for it in 2005. Harp Group's lender, iStar Financial of New York, retains an interest in the project.
''Basically, it turned out to be an arranged short sale,'' said Adam McGaughy, a senior vice president of Jones Lang LaSalle and Harp Group's broker for the transaction.
He added: ''It was very good timing for Schrager. At that point, no one knew what was going on in the market. The sky was still falling. He timed it just before the market for investment recovered later that summer.''
Since then, Mr. Schrager has spent $35 million on the renovation. When added to the purchase price, the total is about $60 million, or just over $200,000 a room, an ostensible deal in a city where luxury hotel properties regularly trade in the range of $300,000 to $400,000 a room.
And in contrast to other properties that Mr. Schrager has developed, room rates will also be something of a bargain. The Public has 285 rooms, about 30 percent of which are suites. Rates, at least in the beginning, will start at $135 a night, considerably below the average for the downtown Chicago luxury market.
Downtown Chicago has about 34,000 hotel rooms with overall occupancy expected to reach 71 percent this year.
''The whole idea is there has to be value,'' Mr. Schrager said. This means, he added, ''No $5 Hershey bars in the minibar and no $20 pots of room service coffee. People won't accept that anymore.''
He described the Public as ''a paradigm shift.''
''The idea is to have a less expensive hotel where you still have great service, great design and an exciting food and beverage concept,'' he said. ''Because I think the country's more complicated now. It's not going to be so much about upward mobility in the future.''
Mr. Schrager says he hopes the Public will be the first link in a new chain of boutique hotels across the country.
This is his second try at creating a boutique hotel chain in recent years. The first was a star-crossed collaboration with Marriott International for a chain called Edition, which was announced with much fanfare in 2007 but has resulted in the opening of only two hotels, in Honolulu and Istanbul.
Even though the Public's room rates will be lower than a typical Schrager property, Mr. Schrager said he was not skimping on design, which has been his calling card and a way of compensating for the small room sizes and cramped bathrooms that he acknowledges are a fact of life in many vintage hotels.
''I'm able to take compromised conditions and, through good design, neutralize them,'' he said.
But those who remember outre touches like the giant log that served as a couch in the lounge of the Hudson Hotel in New York may be surprised by the overall restraint of the Public.
''It's not design on steroids,'' said Anda Andrei, Mr. Schrager's in-house architect for close to 30 years. ''We wanted to keep a lot of the history there because the bones are so beautiful. It's understated in a way but at the same time glamorous, because there is a certain glamour to clean, beautiful design.''
The one area of the hotel where some of Mr. Schrager's characteristic outrageousness comes into play is the storied dining room, the Pump Room.
In the days when cross-country train travel inevitably involved a layover in Chicago, the Pump Room was the local equivalent of New York hot spots like the Stork Club and El Morocco.
''A lot of visiting celebrities liked to go there and the next day you would read about them in the gossip columns,'' said Tim Samuelson, the City of Chicago's cultural historian. ''The Pump Room always had an edge of coolness to it.''
Two early fans were Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, both of whom incorporated references to the Pump Room into their respective versions of ''My Kind of Town'' and ''Chicago.'' (Sinatra's favorite booth in a sheltered alcove toward the back has been preserved.)
The reconfigured Pump Room is dominated by what Ms. Andrei calls ''the constellation,'' an elaborate overhead lighting system of dozens of resin globes attached at various points to what appears to be a steel jungle gym suspended from the ceiling.
Mr. Schrager has teamed up with a celebrity chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
''The food will be very simple: a blend of what's popular in New York and four or five classic Pump Room dishes,'' Mr. Vongerichten said. ''It's really about keeping affordable prices. Some main courses will be under $20. Most will be between $17 and $28. We'll have something for everyone.''
One potential drawback for the Public is its location, which is at the northern edge of the downtown area.
''It's a challenging location because it's north and residential,'' said Ted Mandigo, the director of TR Mandigo & Company, a hospitality consulting firm in Elmhurst, Ill. ''But that also is part of the charm of the property. You pull up and it's a shady street and the people you see on the sidewalk are the people who live around there.''
Mr. McGaughy of Jones Lang LaSalle agrees.
''It's not on Michigan Avenue and it's not within two blocks of all the corporate activity,'' he said. ''But I think the kind of savvy travelers Schrager will be targeting will understand the location.''

HEADLINE: Large Package of Disaster Aid Clears a Hurdle in the Senate

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
UPDATE 6:50 p.m.: The Senate on Tuesday cleared the way for consideration of a large aid package for communities and people affected by this summer's hurricanes and tornadoes by tucking $6.9 billion in new disaster aid into a Republican-sponsored bill to renew sanctions against the Burmese government.
The question of how to increase federal disaster aid, and by how much, has raised some controversy on Capitol Hill in recent days because many Republicans would like to see any increase in aid offset by federal spending cuts. The House plans to include new disaster aid in a short-term spending plan that is expected to hit that chamber's floor next week, with far lower levels expected and a possible offset though cuts to an auto loan program. 
While an initial attempt in the Senate to win passage of the package failed on a procedural vote Monday night, the Senate agreed Tuesday to move forward with a vehicle to increase funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency by $5.1 billion, including $500 million to fill a shortfall for just the month of September.
The measure passed 61 to 38, with 1 senators not voting. All of those who voted against the measure were Republicans, though many Republicans who hail from states that have been hit hard by disasters, like Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, voted in favor of the measure. Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, voted in favor of a similar measure on Monday but changed his vote to no on Tuesday. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican freshman from Pennsylvania, flipped in the opposite direction.
The current balance in the Disaster Relief Fund is $407 million; in recent weeks, FEMA has spent $365 million to aid cities and people harmed by Hurricane Irene. Since Jan. 1, the president has issued disaster declarations in 48 states.
The supplemental monies include $1.3 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, which helps repair water-damaged infrastructure; $266 million in fiscal year 2012 to the Department of Agriculture; $135 million in fiscal year 2012 for the Economic Development Administration; and $100 million in community block grants to help rebuild neighborhoods damaged by natural disasters.
A measure that passed this summer to raise the debt ceiling included federal spending caps; that deal allowed for those caps to grow to accommodate emergency disaster aid.
On Monday evening, a procedural vote on the Burma bill failed in the Senate with six Democrats missing. Some members were taken aback that the funding request was bigger than the previous White House request, or because they were not up to speed on the details. The $4.6 billion that Senate Democrats seek for the 2012 fiscal year is above the $1.8 billion President Obama requested in February.
On the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Reid accused Republicans of deviating from normal disaster relief policies in the name of fiscal austerity. ''It is unthinkable that Republicans would waste time catering to the radical Tea Party while innocent victims of devastating disasters bide their time,'' Mr. Reid said. ''This is not a nation that stands idly by while our fellow Americans suffer. We are a nation of action. When it is in our power to aid a fellow citizen, we have always done what it takes. And we have done it without politics, without pandering and without a moment's delay.''
Also Tuesday, the House approved and sent to the Senate a measure that would avert a second shutdown of the Federal Aviation Administration through the end of January and extend highway and transit programs set to expire this month through March 2012.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Seeking a Fiscal Plan That Will Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''How to Really Save the Economy'' (Sunday Review, Sept. 11), Robert J. Barro urges a tax on consumer spending and elimination of the corporate income tax, among other ideas. 
Consumption taxes are highly regressive and depress consumer spending (as they did in Japan). By coddling shareholders and raising their expectations of high dividends, low corporate taxes encourage short-term thinking and further outsourcing of jobs to low-wage countries.
It is clear that America faces long-lasting unemployment. Employee expenses are paid for with pretax income, which means that hiring more employees lowers a company's taxes. Businesses will be disinclined to invest if the public is not buying their products and services, which requires the public to have more disposable income, not less.
My prescription would be nearly the opposite of what Professor Barro proposes: raising both corporate taxes and the taxes of high-income people to encourage pretax investments such as hiring, upgrading of facilities, on-the-job training, and state and municipal bonds.
KAREN SANDNESS Minneapolis, Sept. 11, 2011
To the Editor:
I disagree with Robert J. Barro on many counts, but let me address just one, his recommendation to create a federal value-added tax (VAT).
The poor spend most of their income on VAT-eligible purchases, meaning that they would be taxed at close to the 10 percent that Mr. Barro recommends, while the wealthy, who spend a small portion of their income on such purchases, would be taxed at a fraction of that.
He adds that a 10 percent VAT would yield roughly 5 percent of gross domestic product, apparently a worthwhile goal, while from 2000 to 2008 corporate taxes were ''only 1.9 percent of G.D.P.,'' apparently so inconsequential that, according to him, they should be abolished.
Can Mr. Barro give the number between 1.9 and 5 percent that divides the worthwhile from the inconsequential?
JACK HERSCHLAG Upper Montclair, N.J., Sept. 11, 2011
To the Editor:
In advancing the classical supply-side argument for how to solve our current economic problems, Prof. Robert J. Barro states, ''Today's priority has to be austerity, not stimulus.''
Were he to seek some empirical data, he might consult the British prime minister, David Cameron, and ask, paraphrasing Sarah Palin, ''How's that austerity thing workin' out for ya?''

HEADLINE: Fears Ease in France, and Shares Edge Higher

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Tuesday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index higher for a second day, as French banks eased concerns over their access to funding and investors watched for signs of progress in solving Europe's debt crisis.
All 10 main industries in the S.& P. 500 advanced, and gains were led by industrial, raw material and technology companies. The Dow Jones transportation average rose 3.4 percent as airline stocks climbed. Shares in Wells Fargo & Company and Fifth Third Bancorp rose more than 1 percent, on the heels of a rally by European lenders. Stock in the health insurer Aetna rose 5.4 percent as it said profit would probably beat its previous forecast. 
The S.& P. 500 was up 10.6 points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,172.87 after falling as much as 0.4 percent. The index has risen 1.6 percent in two days. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.73 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,105.85. The Nasdaq composite index added 37.06 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,532.15.
''Stocks are trading on the news of the day and the news was moderately favorable,'' said Michael Cuggino, who oversees $15 billion at Permanent Portfolio Funds in San Francisco. ''While the issues of liquidity and health of the European banking system and the long-term viability of the euro are still out there, today is a day where people are looking beyond that. We've had a big correction. Levels really haven't gotten back to where they were.''
Global stocks rose as BNP Paribas, France's biggest bank, and Societe Generale surged after easing concerns over their access to funding. Shares in Societe Generale jumped after its chief executive, Frederic Oudea, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in New York that the bank's potential losses from European sovereign debt were ''manageable'' and that it could do without access to money market funds in the United States.
''For our bank, the exposure to sovereign debt is low, absolutely manageable,'' Mr. Oudea said. ''We have plenty of buffers of liquidity and we are adjusting to the reduction in the money market fund exposure.''
Stocks briefly trimmed gains after a report that the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said Greece should not receive any aid beyond what had already been agreed upon.
The KBW bank index rose 1.2 percent. Stock in Wells Fargo gained 1.1 percent to $24.36. Fifth Third Bancorp shares rallied 4.2 percent to $10.35.
All 20 stocks in the Dow Jones transportation average rose. Shares of Delta Air Lines climbed 8.3 percent to $7.99. United Continental Holdings advanced 7.4 percent to $19.28.
Aetna shares rose 5.4 percent to $40.53. Earnings excluding some items this year are now expected to be more than $4.60 to $4.70 a share, the company said in a corporate filing Tuesday. Demand for medical care continues to be lower than previous expectations, helping to contain costs, Aetna said.
The situation in Europe overshadowed the latest economic data from the Labor Department, which said prices of goods imported into the United States fell in August for the second time in three months as the cost of oil and food dropped.
The department said the import-price index fell 0.4 percent. The decline followed a 0.3 percent increase in July. Economists projected a 0.8 percent decrease, according to the median of 52 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices excluding fuel rose 0.2 percent.
Interest rates rose. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 13/32, to 101 6/32, and the yield rose to 1.99 percent from 1.95 percent late Monday. Gold rose $16.90, to $1,826.80, and crude oil settled at $90.28, a gain of $1.97.

HEADLINE: Amid Strike, Restaurant Is Making Concessions

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Facing a strike that has lasted a month, the owner of the Boathouse Restaurant in Central Park has made several major concessions in the hope of ending the walkout, among them agreeing to recognize and negotiate with a union, representatives of the two sides said.
The restaurant's owner, Dean Poll, has also agreed to rehire more than a dozen fired workers. But even so, union officials said they were not ready to end the strike. Peter Ward, president of the New York Hotel Trades Council, said on Tuesday that his union would not end the walkout until the two sides hammered out a full union contract. 
Mr. Ward said he was delighted that Mr. Poll had agreed to recognize the union after he had battled an organizing drive at the restaurant early this year.
''This is a grand slam for the union,'' Mr. Ward said in an interview. ''Dean Poll has done everything he said he'd never do. He's recognized the union, and he's agreed to take back close to 40 people.''
Mr. Poll agreed to make concessions after facing intense pressure from the National Labor Relations Board. The board said it was ready to file a legal complaint accusing the Boathouse of illegally threatening and questioning workers, as well as illegally firing and otherwise punishing more than 15 workers for backing the union.
In addition, the labor board had told Mr. Poll that it planned to seek a highly unusual judicial order to require the Boathouse to grant union recognition to the Hotel Trades Council and to enter contract negotiations with it, even though no vote has been held to determine whether the restaurant's 140 workers want to unionize. Mr. Ward said that last winter 70 percent of the employees had signed cards calling for a union.
The labor board seeks such orders only on rare occasions when it is convinced that an employer's illegal actions are so widespread, intimidating and egregious that they would prevent a fair unionization vote from being held.
David L. Weissman, a lawyer for the Boathouse, said Mr. Poll had agreed to talk with the union, partly at the behest of City Hall, which has worked behind the scenes to end the dispute.
''The most important thing is we have to come together and make sure the Boathouse has a future,'' he said.
Mr. Weissman said that, in its settlement talks with the labor board, the restaurant had made no admissions of wrongdoing.
''I don't think there's a victory on either side,'' he said.
He expressed disappointment that the fired workers who had been offered reinstatement had not gone back to work. They remain on strike.
Mr. Poll's decision to recognize and bargain with the union was reported Monday night by Crain's New York Business.
Two union representatives said Mr. Poll had gone to Mr. Ward's office to conduct contract negotiations. The two sides had made substantial progress, one union representative said, but the Boathouse was asking the Bloomberg administration for some relief on its rent payments to make it easier for the restaurant to pay for a labor settlement.
''From my perspective, there's no settlement in sight,'' Mr. Ward said. ''We're not going anywhere. We're going to remain on strike. The strike is having a devastating effect on his business.''
The dispute has become intertwined with the union's battle with Mr. Poll over a license he won to run Tavern on the Green, also in Central Park. Mr. Poll never reopened Tavern after he was unable to reach a contract agreement with Mr. Ward's union, which represented the 400 Tavern workers under the previous licensee, Warner LeRoy.
Mr. Weissman said, ''Unless we sign an agreement that's economically viable, then we're going to be in the same situation as Tavern on the Green, not being able to meet the expenses and costs and have another closed restaurant. That's not what the Boathouse wants, what the union wants or what the city wants.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart to Announce Women-Friendly Plans

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Wal-Mart planned to announce on Wednesday new programs aimed at helping women-owned businesses and women workers, as the company continues to deal with the possibility of individual claims of sex discrimination after the Supreme Court threw out a class-action suit by women workers this summer.
In an advance draft of the announcement, Wal-Mart said it planned to source a total of $20 billion in products from women-owned businesses in the United States over the next five years, which works out to an average of $4 billion a year, versus the $2.5 billion a year it currently spends, and to double what it buys from women-owned businesses globally by 2016. 
The company said it would also support training of women in factories and farms that are Wal-Mart suppliers, donate $100 million to causes supporting women's economic development, and ask its vendors and ad agencies or public relations firms to increase gender and minority representation on their Wal-Mart accounts.
''If you look at retail, the vast majority of our customers are women, and if you look at Wal-Mart, the majority of our associates are women,'' said Leslie A. Dach, executive vice president of corporate affairs for Wal-Mart, in an interview. ''It makes complete sense for us to really have a focus on how we have the best associates we can, how we help women suppliers succeed and how we engage our communities.''
The $5 billion a year that Wal-Mart plans to spend with women-owned businesses would still be a small percentage of Wal-Mart's overall budget. The $4 billion a year, on average, that Wal-Mart will spend sourcing from women in the United States works out to about 5 percent of the company's annual operating expenses.
''Over the course of the five years, we are going to both have to seek out the businesses that are there, and open ourselves up to that, and also we're going to help these businesses grow,'' he said. ''They'll range from construction to farming to food, and one of the great things about this is we will also improve the assortment of products we sell to people, and help our products become more relevant.''
Mr. Dach said the announcement on Wednesday was not in reaction to the class-action suit against Wal-Mart, which charged unfair treatment of women in the workplace; the Supreme Court recently threw out the case. Some of the plaintiffs have said they will still try to sue the company through individual claims.
But some critics were quick to fault Wal-Mart's plans. Janet Shenk, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. official, said its move to buy more products from women was a way of not dealing with problems.
''Once again, Wal-Mart is avoiding every issue that touches on how its products are produced,'' said Ms. Shenk, who oversees some corporate grants at the Panta Rhea Foundation, which works to combat corporate influence. ''It's not about who owns the factory. So far as I know, there's no evidence that factories and businesses owned by women treat their employees better or have better conditions than factories and businesses owned by men.''
Yet CARE, a nonprofit development and relief agency, said Wal-Mart support would help advance its work.
''The typical woman we work with is a woman working in an apparel factory in, say, Bangladesh,'' said Melanie Minzes, senior director for development at CARE. ''She is probably illiterate, probably gets sick pretty easily because she doesn't have much health education. With Wal-Mart's commitment, we are going to be able to reach tens of thousands of women like her and improve their lives and economic positions. We will be able to teach them to read, how to address common abuses they face and what proper nutrition is, all things that will make her a better, healthier employee.''
Wal-Mart has measured the gender and ethnic diversity at law firms that work for it since 2005. In the draft of Wednesday's announcement, it did not specify what new standards might be. Asked why there were no specifications, Mr. Dach said that ''it's important for us to be realistic about that as we make change -- we're not asking anyone to turn over their work force, but we're confident that it will help us get results like it did in the legal field.''
According to the draft, Wednesday's announcement will be similar to ones Wal-Mart has made in the past several years outlining goals on locally sourced agriculture, addressing ''food deserts'' in urban areas and reducing energy use.

REWRITING RULES The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is moving to safeguard dozens of derivatives regulations from legal challenges after a federal appeals court struck down a new rule for corporate America, an agency official said Tuesday. 
Scott O'Malia, left, a Republican member of the commission, said his agency was rewriting its so-called position limits rule, among others, to account for the regulation's economic impact on the financial industry. BEN PROTESS
LIVING WILLS Nearly three years after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Wall Street teetered on the brink, federal regulators are moving to wipe out the notion that Wall Street is too big to fail.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approved rules on Tuesday that would mandate so-called living wills for the nation's largest financial firms that would force them to spell out plans for unwinding their business should they fall on hard times. BEN PROTESS
VOICE OF EXPERIENCE Vincent R. Reinhart, below, an economist and former head of the Federal Reserve's monetary division, is joining Morgan Stanley as its chief United States economist in New York.
The appointment of Mr. Reinhart, 54, is timely given the current state of the economy: his work, with that of his wife, Carmen Reinhart, has detailed how long and painfully slow recoveries can be after a financial crisis.
DEAL IN LIMBO On the heels of Cerberus Capital's efforts to escape its agreement to buy most of Innkeepers USA Trust out of bankruptcy, Skyworks Solutions may be trying to back out of its $262.5 million deal to acquire Advanced Analogic Technologies.
But while Cerberus followed the standard playbook, claiming a material adverse change to Innkeepers, the Skyworks claims are much more novel and involve several parties with cold feet, the Deal Professor says. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF

HEADLINE: Economy Putting the Squeeze on Deficit Panel, Top Budget Officer Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The director of the Congressional Budget Office painted a grim near-term picture of the American economy on Tuesday and said ''cuts in federal spending and increases in taxes will tend to slow the economic recovery.''
At the same time, the director, Douglas W. Elmendorf, told a powerful new Congressional committee on deficit reduction that the government's growing debt would ''lead to lower output and incomes'' and could ''increase the probability of a sudden fiscal crisis.'' 
As the 12-member panel began its race against a November deadline to recommend substantial federal savings, Mr. Elmendorf said its task had become more difficult because the outlook for the economy had worsened in the last month.
''We expect employment to expand very slowly during the rest of this year and next year, leaving the unemployment rate close to 9 percent through the end of 2012,'' Mr. Elmendorf said.
The panel is supposed to recommend ways to reduce federal deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years, or else the government will make across-the-board cuts in many federal programs to achieve those savings.
Under the law, the committee must take a final vote by Nov. 23, but Mr. Elmendorf said his office would need a legislative proposal by early November to assess its impact on the deficit.
Republican members of the panel said growth in federal spending -- for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, in particular -- was the main factor in the nation's fiscal problems. Mr. Elmendorf said spending for the big three benefit programs would account for 12.2 percent of the gross domestic product in 2021, compared with an average of 7.2 percent in the last 40 years.
The difference, 5 percent of the economy, ''is a very big number,'' Mr. Elmendorf said.
Democrats said higher revenues were essential. Federal revenues are equivalent to 15.3 percent of the G.D.P. this year, compared with an average of 18 percent over the last 40 years, the budget office said. Under current law, which provides for the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts in 2013, revenues will grow to nearly 21 percent of the economy by 2021, it said.
Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, said that without higher revenues, ''you are talking about dramatic cuts in health and retirement security for America's seniors.''
But Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, ''Federal revenues have equaled or exceeded 20 percent of G.D.P. only three times: in 1944 and 1945, during World War II, and in 2000,'' when the government ran a surplus.
Two Republicans on the deficit reduction committee, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona and Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, said they believed that the government could save large amounts of money by rooting out fraud and waste in benefit programs.
Mr. Elmendorf told lawmakers that ''there is no evidence'' to suggest that such antifraud efforts could produce a large share of the $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction the panel is supposed to recommend.
The budget office director put a price tag on the cuts that would occur automatically if legislation originating in the committee did not become law by Jan. 15.
Military spending would be cut by $454 billion over 10 years, Medicare by $123 billion and other domestic programs by more than $300 billion, he said. With these cuts, the government would have less need to borrow, so debt-service costs would be reduced by nearly $170 billion over 10 years, he added.
Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a member of the panel, said the goal of saving $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion was formidable but realistic in the larger context of federal spending. The budget office estimates that the federal government will spend $44 trillion in the coming decade.
One of the most difficult questions for the panel is how to reduce the budget deficit without threatening the fragile economic recovery.
Mr. Elmendorf said, ''There is no inherent contradiction between using fiscal policy to support the economy today,'' with tax cuts or additional spending, and ''imposing fiscal restraint several years from now.''
However, Republicans were skeptical of that approach. Too often, they said, the additional spending, though labeled temporary, has become permanent, as with some provisions of the economic stimulus law adopted in 2009.
On one point lawmakers agreed on Tuesday.
''All problems are easier to solve with a strong, growing economy,'' said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''We need growth, not just revenue and not just cuts.''

HEADLINE: For Idaho and the Internet, Life in the Slow Lane

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; John Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
POTLATCH, Idaho -- Barry Ramsay, who owns a small manufacturing company here between two mountains, remembers the day his Internet connection crashed for several hours. Work crews had to ride up in snowmobiles to discover the problem.
''They said that bears had been rubbing against the towers,'' Mr. Ramsay said. In this mountainous state, where some connections depend on line of sight, even snow and fog can disrupt the signals. ''These are the kind of problems you probably don't have in an urban area,'' he said.
And, according to a new study, they are among the problems that have earned Idaho an unfortunate distinction: it had the slowest Internet speeds in the country earlier this year for residential customers who were downloading things like games -- a ''dismal'' average of 318 kilobytes per second.
Translation: In Idaho, it would take you 9.42 seconds to download a standard music file compared with 3.36 seconds in Rhode Island, the state with the fastest average speeds, at 894 kilobytes per second. 
The slowest city, by the way, was also in Idaho: In Pocatello, it would take nearly 12 seconds to download that music file, according to the study by Pando Networks, a company that helps consumers accelerate downloads. In the nation's fastest city, Andover, Mass., a Boston suburb, it would take just over one second.
Such speed distinctions might seem insignificant. But with larger files, downloading delays of just a few seconds can stretch into crucial minutes or hours and over time result in losses across many aspects of life, some experts say, beyond entertainment and games, affecting fields such as public safety, education and economic growth. It is not clear how many households throughout this state still have no Internet, but nationally, the figure is 28 percent -- most of them in rural areas.
The United States as a whole lags in speed, coming in 25th behind South Korea, which has the fastest speeds in the world. Even Romania clocks in ahead.
''This is about our overall competitiveness,'' said Jonathan Adelstein, the administrator of the federal government's Rural Utilities Service and a major advocate of broadband. ''Without broadband, especially in rural areas, kids might not reach their full potential. And we can't expect to be competitive in a global economy.''
More than 11 federally funded projects are under way in Idaho, at a cost of $25 million, to establish high-speed broadband.
Yet this sparsely populated, mountainous state still lags in residential speeds, and the Pando study is only the most recent indicator. The federal government's National Broadband Map put Idaho at 47th for download speeds of three megabits or greater. But the Pando study stung the collective psyche of officials here.
''The last thing I need is a report that says we don't have the capacity and speed, when I know it exists,'' said Gynii A. Gilliam, executive director for the Bannock Development Corporation, a nonprofit group working for economic growth in the Pocatello area. She noted that Allstate Insurance was opening a $22 million call center in Pocatello and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has a service center there. ''We have not lost any business because of Internet speeds,'' she said.
Indeed, speeds for Idaho's businesses can be as fast as those anywhere, if customers pay for it. The federal government says Idaho is among the states with the greatest disparity in speeds available in urban areas versus rural areas.
Even Ms. Gilliam acknowledged that her home service was sluggish.
''It feels like it's moving in slow motion,'' she said. ''A lot of times I'll start downloads and not complete them.'' She said she was happy as long as she could get e-mail.
But others are concerned.
''We have not been participating in the telecommunications revolution,'' lamented State Representative John Rusche, a retired pediatrician, a former health insurance executive and the Democratic leader in the State House. As someone concerned about electronic medical records, he has been pushing for better Internet service for years.
The Pando study examined 4 million actual download speeds of Pando-supported products -- games, antivirus software and television shows -- by residential customers across the country from January to June.
The study found the fastest residential Internet speeds in New England and the mid-Atlantic states and the slowest in the mountain west.
Idaho encapsulates some of the challenges for mountain states. Home to the Bitterroot Range of the Rockies, the state is crisscrossed by a series of peaks, ridges, forests, high plateaus and river valleys, making it expensive to lay cable or build towers.
''We have a guy here who was dropped into remote, isolated areas of Iraq to set up their telecommunications systems,'' said Christine L. Frei, director of the Clearwater Economic Development Association in Lewiston. ''He told me, 'We had better communications in Iraq than you have in central Idaho.' ''
Idaho is also sparsely populated, with an average of 19 people per square mile. (Rhode Island, by comparison, has more than 1,018 people per square mile.) Providers have little financial incentive to build a whole infrastructure across rugged terrain just to reach one or two homes.
''We're in business to make a profit,'' said Jim Schmit, vice president and general manager in Idaho for CenturyLink, formerly Qwest and now the state's largest Internet service provider. Still, Mr. Schmit said that 92 percent of CenturyLink customers here had ''access'' to broadband, though he declined to say how many of those who could subscribe actually did so.
Bibiana Nertney, a spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Commerce, said residential customers often could not afford broadband.
''It's not the lack of availability,'' she said. ''It's the lack of demand and what people are willing to pay. It goes to Idaho's philosophy and mentality that we don't spend more than we need.''
While grants and loans are available to build out the Internet infrastructure, Kerrie Hurd, the broadband liaison for the federal Department of Agriculture Office of Rural Development in Idaho, said the grant requirements could be onerous.
''Not a lot of communities are willing to put in the application and find the broadband provider, especially when taxpayers want money to spend on an essential service, like fixing the streets and updating the sewer system,'' she said.
A bright spot is the Idaho Education Network, which provides high-speed broadband to all high schools in the state and allows residents and business owners to use the service at the schools. Unfortunately, because of cuts to school funding, some schools are open fewer hours.
To address the cost issue, Mr. Schmit of CenturyLink said that starting next month, the company would offer broadband services at a discount to low-income customers.
But some say more needs to be done.
''I don't think enough people understand just how bad the situation is,'' said Susan Crawford, who focused on broadband issues for President Obama early in his administration. ''It really is time for this country to invest in getting its citizens online where we don't have Internet access, especially in rural areas, so we stop sending jobs to India that we could be sending to Idaho.''

HEADLINE: Summer Home for Equestrians

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
Every year, the elite competitive equestrian circuit makes its way around the country, from Ocala, Fla., to Culpeper, Va., to Thermal, Calif. These traveling troupes of privilege and skill also take with them small armies -- of trainers, grooms, farriers, veterinarians, even equine acupuncturists and masseuses.
And for the last eight years, this band of competitors and assorted adjuncts have added a somewhat surprising destination to their junket: Saugerties, N.Y., a blue-collar town on the Hudson River about 110 miles north of New York City.
Eight years ago, HITS Incorporated, a company that produces equestrian competitions, built a $15 million showground here; the riders came. More than 3,000 horses and 2,200 competitive equestrians and their entourages descend on this village every summer. And the influx of a moneyed demographic and their free-flowing cash has played a part in transforming the town.
''I feel like Saugerties has won the lottery,'' says Daisy Bolle who owns Dig, a high-end clothing shop on Partition Street in the village, which has 3,971 residents, according to the 2010 United States Census. 
''When we first came to town, there were a lot of empty stores,'' she says. ''And now it feels really vibrant. It's like having the Hamptons in your backyard.''
The Saugerties stage of the circuit has about 300 competitive heats, or classes, at various levels for riders to compete or show in per week, and it runs in three three-week bursts, beginning May 25 and ending Sunday. Olympians like Peter Leone, Nona Garson and Anne Kursinski, as well as top amateurs like Georgina Bloomberg, the daughter of New York City's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, have been regular competitors. Thomas G. Struzzieri, 52, the president and chief executive of HITS, has lived in Saugerties for 13 years and brought the state-of-the-art show grounds here, with its 12 giant barns equipped to hold 1,200 horses on 240 acres, five minutes from town.
''It had a charm I thought my customers might like,'' he said of the town. Not to mention that it was also personally convenient.
''When you run horse shows around the country, it's nice to sleep in your own bed once in a while,'' he said.
But unlike places like Culpeper, Saugerties is not traditionally horse country.
''It's a blue-collar community for sure,'' Struzzieri said, ''but they've been really accepting of the horse clients, and they look at it as a great resource.''
But figuring out just how to roll out the welcome mat for the horse set has taken some trial and error.
At Inquiring Minds Bookstore and Cafe, Cheryl Rice, the store's manager, set up a prominent display of books and manuals on all things equine in May. As of August, few had sold.
''Maybe they didn't have such a need for horse knowledge in book form,'' she said, ''because they're already in the business.'' Next year she may try horse novels.
At Dig, Bolle filled the shelves with horse-themed jewelry and equestrian print clothes her first year open. None sold, she says.
''I think they don't need the horsey stuff because they have horses,'' she said. ''What's better than that?''
What did work was extending her store hours late into the night, a move followed by many other businesses, after realizing the riders' competition schedules left little room for daytime shopping. On a particularly bustling Saturday night, she says, she has made up to an additional $10,000 from 6 to 11 p.m.
''You have to make hay while the sun shines,'' she said with a laugh.
The gingerbread ponies with white manes of royal icing flew off the shelves at Hudson Valley Dessert Company on Main Street at twice the rate of cookies shaped like the rest of the barnyard, Constance Bailey, the owner, said. Bailey goes through 150 of the $1 cookies on a horse show weekend, ''which doesn't exactly make us rich, but it makes us friends,'' she said.
The influx of athletes, many with citified low-fat and low-carbohydrate tastes, has led her to change her menu. Bailey serves a salad with lime juice instead of dressing and whips up a cream-free soup specifically for when the riders are in town. On show weeks, she orders 300 extra pounds of flour, 45 dozen more eggs and 10 gallons of extra syrup from Breezy Maples Farms.
The riders' presence accounts for $3,000 in extra business a week, Bailey says.
Down the street at Flanigans Cleaners, decals on the window spell out We Groom the Rider, a slogan the owner, Michael Flanigan, adopted after he realized that he too had a corner to grab in the riding market: the equestrian uniform, a dark jacket with a cotton blouse with a collar called a rat catcher, needs to be always sparkling. He dry cleans more than 2,000 of the shirts alone, at $4.50 apiece, every summer.
It would be difficult to find a business owner in town who does not sing the praises of the summer horse invasion, Flanigan said, but he acknowledged that conflicts had arisen.
Hulking pickup trucks hauling horse trailers caused knots of traffic in the early years and sparked local complaints until places like the hardware store took it upon themselves to hand out maps to the newcomers.
There are also less tangible tensions. The median per capita income in Saugerties is a little more than $20,000, and equestrian competitions are famously the sport of kings.
On a personal level, there can arise the same types of resentments that crop up between working-class residents of the Hamptons and the deep-pocketed set that goes there to play.
In October, Struzzieri plans to open Diamond Mills Hotel and Tavern, a boutique hotel and conference center overlooking the Esopus Creek waterfall, which cost $12 million to $14 million to build and will charge guests up to $400 a night.
''Do I believe that the horse show changed the town? I think it's worked well in this town,'' he said, pointing to economic blows the area has weathered like the shutting in 1994 of the I.B.M. plant in nearby Kingston, N.Y., which employed around 1,500 people.
''I think the horse show has been a part of this community finding its way.''
On a Saturday night this summer, clumps of women and girls in pastel polo shirts, tall polished black boots and tan britches with suede patches jammed Stella's Station, an ice cream parlor on Partition Street. On the opposite side of the counter, a team of young female employees scooped frozen treats, sweating. In the parking lot of the fully-booked Comfort Inn on Route 32 North, off-duty grooms smoked and traded horse stories in Spanish.
Around 10 p.m. two customers lingered at Emiliani Ristorante on Ulster Avenue, huddled close over a plate of linguine, discussing the merits of a chestnut-colored mare.
''People will say, Ugh, the restaurants are so crowded when they're here,'' said Bolle, the owner of Dig. ''But I say, Yes, but we get to have that restaurant all year round. And if they weren't here, I don't know if we would or not.''

HEADLINE: Stocking Up on Warehouse Properties

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Developers and investors are starting to make big bets on industrial real estate, following signs that consumers may be starting to spend again. Sales of such properties have jumped nearly threefold from last year, according to figures from commercial real estate companies, and the vacancy rate has fallen for three consecutive quarters.
The industrial market is often a leading indicator for commercial real estate, improving before the office market. This is because when companies begin seeing increased demand from consumers their first steps are to increase production and ramp up inventory. ''Only then do they hire new employees and look to grow their offices,'' said Robert C. Kossar, a managing director and the head of the industrial real estate group for New York and New Jersey at Jones Lang LaSalle. 
Signs of the market's growth are apparent in the New York metro area. On a brownfield site in Edison, N.J., the J. G. Petrucci Company is building a 570,000-square-foot warehouse even though the developer has not lined up a single tenant. It is one of the first industrial properties built on spec in New Jersey since the recession.
''The timing is right because while rents are still low, there are clear signs that the market is tightening,'' said James G. Petrucci, the company's president. ''I am confident that there will be any number of companies wanting this space by the time it is completed.''
In the first half of this year, the vacancy rate declined to 9.7 percent, its third quarterly decline and its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009, according to Cushman & Wakefield. During the same period, a total of 70 million square feet traded hands, an increase of nearly 160 percent, the brokerage firm said. And year-to-date, leasing activity has risen more than 27 percent to 205 million square feet, compared with the same period last year, the company's research showed.
''If you look at the fundamentals over the past six months or so, there is very strong leasing, declining vacancies and positive net absorption,'' said Tim Wang, a senior vice president at Clarion Partners, which last month purchased 2.8 million square feet in industrial properties from Prologis Inc. for $118 million and is looking for other acquisitions. In addition, ''industrial properties are very simple to operate,'' Mr. Wang said. Even large buildings typically have only one or two tenants; they are less capital-intensive because landlords do not offer tenant improvement allowances or other terms common in office leases; and the cash flow from the rent is mostly stable and predictable.
Clarion Partners is one of several companies that have been increasing their industrial properties. Among the biggest buyers is Blackstone, which had meager holdings in the sector before spending $2 billion to acquire 275 industrial buildings earlier this year. Other companies that are buying aggressively include Terreno Realty Corporation, Morgan Stanley, the Cabot Group and CenterPoint Properties, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Matrix Development Group, a private company with offices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, recently joined with Morgan Stanley to acquire a 265,000-square-foot warehouse in Robbinsville, N.J. The company is also constructing a 150,000-square-foot industrial building for the beverage distributor Ritchie & Page, also in Robbinsville.
''We are at the inflection point in the market,'' said Alec Taylor, a principal of Matrix Development. ''Building values are still low, but rental activity and absorption rates are improving. Now is the time to buy buildings and in six months to a year, lease them up and improve their value.''
Ports also play a role in industrial real estate, and in New Jersey investors are making big bets that port business will increase. This is in part because of a $5.25 billion project to widen the Panama Canal by 2014. The widening will allow large cargo ships that currently anchor in California and use trucks or the railroad to move goods to the East Coast to sail directly to New Jersey.
The widening of the canal could mean big business for Port Newark-Elizabeth, and to prepare for an influx of larger ships the Port Authority of New York and New Jerseyplan to raise the Bayonne Bridge by 2016.
''There is a growing need for shipping that is not showing signs of abating anytime soon,'' said Dave Adams, the president of Port Newark Container Terminal, one of five major terminals at Port Newark. The terminal is positioning itself to take advantage of the improving market conditions. This summer, it extended its lease with the Port Authority, which owns the port, to 2050 and agreed to invest $500 million in capital improvements.
''Our goal is to be able to double the capacity of our facility from about 650,000 shipping containers a year to 1.2 or 1.3 million,'' Mr. Adams said.
But while the market for larger properties, usually 300,000 square feet or more, that cater to the biggest beverage or food distributors or major retailers is showing improvement, the market for spaces of 50,000 square feet and under is still struggling.
''There is a disconnect in the market,'' said John Huguenard, a managing director and head of national industrial investment sales at Jones Lang LaSalle. ''Entrepreneurial businesses haven't come back the way big business has.''
In Long Island, for example, where the industrial market mostly serves local businesses, ''the vacancy rate is around 6.2 percent, which sounds good,'' said Jack O'Connor, a principal and director of the national industrial practice group at Newmark Knight Frank in Long Island. ''But that is because none of the firms track buildings under 20,000 square feet. If they looked at the smaller industrial spaces, they would see a vacancy rate of 10 percent to 11 percent.'' Prices also have dropped: in 2007, smaller warehouses sold for $125 a square foot, but today the price would be closer to $75 a square foot, Mr. O'Connor said.
Smaller properties are languishing, Mr. O'Connor said, ''because banks aren't lending, and people have no equity in their homes to take out second mortgages to finance new businesses.''
And even the growth in the market for large industrial properties comes with cautions, experts say. ''The volatility in the financial markets and the picture of a slow recovery, especially with employment, is having a guarded effect,'' Mr. Kossar said. ''The signs are trending in the right direction, they are all pointing toward a recovery, but it is a cautious optimism.''

HEADLINE: At Frankfurt Show, Automakers Are Optimistic

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Norbert Reithofer, the chief executive of BMW, correctly called the last big auto industry crisis in 2008. So if the sage of Munich was predicting another sharp downturn, that would be cause for concern.
But like his peers at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Tuesday, the ebullient Mr. Reithofer was remarkably sanguine. With the exception of Spain, Greece and several other European countries, Mr. Reithofer said in an interview, BMW has not seen any sign that the sovereign debt crisis is hurting car sales.
''If you ask me, am I worried about the whole political situation, naturally I'm worried,'' Mr. Reithofer said. But he added that BMW was still recording sales gains even in the slow-growing United States market and continued to expect worldwide sales of 1.6 million vehicles this year, an increase of more than 10 percent from 2010. 
Just in case, though, BMW and other carmakers are preparing for the worst. Memories of the 2009 recession are still vivid, and they learned that they must be able to cut costs and production if a downturn comes.
''We learned from the last crisis how important it is to adjust quickly,'' Mr. Reithofer said.
The Frankfurt exhibition grounds, where the motor show will open to the public on Thursday and continue through Sept. 25, seems to exist in a different dimension than the crisis-addled banking industry just outside the gates.
Signs of European economic stagnation notwithstanding, car companies spent huge sums to show off their new products in Frankfurt. Audi, the premium car unit of Volkswagen, erected an entirely new building to house its display, while Daimler's Mercedes unit spent more than 1 million euros ($1.36 million) just on a musical stage presentation to accompany the introduction of a hydrogen-powered concept car.
''If you look at the pure numbers, you could say, 'What crisis?' '' said Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the Audi management board who is responsible for sales. ''In our numbers, you don't see it.''
Even in the United States, Audi sales increased 15 percent through August compared with those in the period a year earlier, in part because the company upgraded its dealer network. With a wide array of new models coming to market, Mr. Schwarzenbauer said, ''even if the situation gets a little bumpier we still expect growth.''
Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler, said the company's expectation was that the global economy would slow but not reverse and that emerging markets would continue to act as a locomotive for the auto industry. He acknowledged that he could be wrong. ''Nobody has a crystal ball,'' Mr. Zetsche said.
''Our customer base still has the wherewithal to afford a Mercedes if they want to buy one,'' Mr. Zetsche told a small group of reporters. ''So far nobody is seeing a direct impact.''
Even volume carmakers, whose customers would normally suffer the most in a downturn, remain optimistic. Nick Reilly, the president of General Motors Europe, said that, so far, he was not seeing any decline in sales in Europe.
''We are not seeing yet the lack of confidence you would expect,'' he said.
But if a slump comes, Mr. Reilly said, Opel, which is owned by G.M., is prepared to cut production and avoid the losses that nearly sank the company in 2009.
The company has cut overall capacity since the 2009 crisis, and worked out agreements with workers that would allow Opel to quickly reduce production.
Likewise, BMW learned lessons from the last crisis and has taken steps to become less vulnerable. It is leasing fewer cars and instead encouraging buyers to finance their purchases. That strategy is intended to avoid getting stuck with tens of thousands of used cars when leasing contracts expire, as happened a few years ago.
BMW has also made production more efficient, Mr. Reithofer said. The redesigned 1 Series compact, which was presented in Frankfurt, cost less to produce than its predecessor, he said, and the same will be true of the new 3 Series due out next year.
The executives are aware of economic indicators providing warning signs of slower European growth. But their own early indicators have not yet reacted, Mr. Schwarzenbauer of Audi said. Corporate fleet and used-car markets, which typically react first in a slump, continue to hold up, he said. Dealers, who are the first to sense a shift in customer moods, also remain upbeat. Growth in China has slowed down, but continues to be robust, Mr. Schwarzenbauer and other executives said.
It is possible, of course, that the carmakers are simply in a state of denial. The world still has more car factories than demand requires, a function of the reluctance by political leaders to allow such large employers to close. Mr. Reilly of G.M. estimated the overcapacity in Europe at 15 percent to 25 percent.
The executives also seem to be concerned about the political drift in Europe, and the slow pace with which a new aid package for Greece, approved in July, is being put in place.
Mr. Zetsche, who as one of Germany's leading executives has the ear of political leaders, indicated that he had expressed his concern. Mr. Reithofer of BMW was among executives who took out ads in German newspapers this year calling for more decisive action.
The carmakers do not want to see the euro fail, a worst case that would create a crisis for them as well. ''I can't imagine another fragmented European economy,'' Mr. Reithofer said.
Saving the euro ''might cost us money, but it's worth it,'' he said. ''The euro will survive -- we have to make it survive.''

HEADLINE: Lady Gaga and Bono Lend Clinton a Hand

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
When you think of the William J. Clinton Foundation, you probably think of AIDS and malaria treatment in poor countries around the world. Or maybe micro-credit for thousands of micro-businesses in many of those same places. Now add to those accomplishments the ability to book Lady Gaga, Usher, and Bono and the Edge of U2 for a party. 
The foundation announced on Tuesday that those performers, along with others to be announced -- a group promised to collectively represent ''the most influential and socially responsible artists in music, film and television'' -- will be taking part in ''A Decade of Difference: A Concert Celebrating 10 Years of the William J. Clinton Foundation,'' at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on Oct. 15. The show will be broadcast live online by Yahoo.
''I am proud that some of today's most influential performers are coming together to raise awareness about the work of my foundation,'' President Clinton said in a statement. ''In the past decade, commitments to my Clinton Global Initiative have improved the lives of more than 300 million people around the world. We've lowered the cost of AIDS and H.I.V. treatment, combated climate change, strengthened economies, increased access to education and healthcare, provided financing and mentoring for small businesses. This celebration marks 10 years of these efforts and demonstrates how much we can do to make a difference in the years ahead.''
U2's record of social and political activism is well known, as is Lady Gaga's support for gay rights. Usher, the singer of hits like ''Yeah!'' and ''Love in This Club,'' is perhaps not as closely identified with social causes. He does, however, have an educational foundation, Usher's New Look, which made more than $840,000 in charitable contributions in 2009, the last year for which its tax returns are publicly available. For the last two years Usher's New Look has held a leadership conference in Atlanta, the singer's hometown. The guest of honor at the inaugural event was President Clinton.

HEADLINE: Bigger Economic Role for Washington

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Just weeks ago, economists and financial analysts were dismissing Washington as largely irrelevant to the economy's course in coming months, if only because it chose to be. They are not dismissing it anymore.
The possibility of major parts of President Obama's $447 billion jobs bill becoming law, and of further steps next week by the Federal Reserve, have forecasters saying that the decisions Washington makes in the weeks ahead could have a substantial effect on economic growth and unemployment. At a minimum, the stimulus could be insurance against the headwinds blowing from Europe's debt crisis and the impact of the recent government spending cuts in this country.
The jobs package of tax cuts and spending initiatives could add 100,000 to 150,000 jobs a month over the next year, according to estimates from several of the country's best-known forecasting firms; the potential Fed actions could add 15,000 more jobs a month over two years. 
While those estimates are difficult to verify, the nation's economy since April has added an average of only about 40,000 jobs a month, raising concerns about a double-dip recession.
It remains uncertain, of course, what Congress or the Fed will do and, if they do act, whether their actions will have the intended effects.
Many businesses and consumers remain sufficiently scarred by the financial crisis and long economic slump that they are awaiting clear evidence of a recovery before beginning to spend and hire at a healthy pace again. And Congressional Republicans, after initially expressing openness to the jobs plan, turned sour when Mr. Obama on Monday proposed to offset its short-term costs with future tax increases on wealthy taxpayers.
But the economy's weakness, as well as polls showing low approval ratings for both Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans, seem to have raised the prospects of a policy response.
That is a significant shift. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said he was not inclined to take more steps to help growth, out of a belief that a recovery was solidly under way. And the new House Republican majority and Mr. Obama had spent much of the year negotiating spending cuts to reduce deficits.
But economists and bond investors have grown increasingly critical of those cuts, warning of a repeat of 1937, when government austerity helped caused a double-dip recession. Moody's Analytics has estimated that the current fiscal policy would subtract 1.7 percentage points from gross domestic product next year. State and local cuts have eliminated 259,000 jobs this year.
''If you look at the state of the economy, we want -- we need -- the policy makers to be very proactive, and that means both fiscal and monetary policy makers,'' said Krishna Memani, director of fixed income and a senior vice president at Oppenheimer Funds. ''If we don't do that, the drag from fiscal contraction in 2012 will become very, very acute.''
More than half of Mr. Obama's $447 billion jobs package consists of extending and expanding payroll-tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and those cuts have among the best chance of winning Republican support.
The administration's main goal is to increase demand for goods and services -- the lack of which appears to be the economy's central problem -- which could then give employers the confidence to hire. Most of the rest of the plan is for assistance to the long-term unemployed, which would also put money in people's hands, and infrastructure spending, which would have a more direct impact on job creation.
While the plan also includes a tax credit for businesses that increase their payrolls, its direct impact on hiring is likely to be small, economists say. Macroeconomic Advisers, which was founded by Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor, did not even include the tax credit in its analysis because it saw the effect as being so ''modest.''
In all, the firm projected that the plan would add roughly 1.25 percentage points to gross domestic product and create 1.3 million jobs in 2012. JPMorgan Chase estimated that the plan would increase growth by 1.9 points and add 1.5 million jobs. Most bullish is Moody's Analytics, which forecast that the package would add 1.9 million jobs, cutting the unemployment rate by a point, and increase growth by two percentage points.
The proposal ''would help stabilize confidence and keep the U.S. from sliding back into recession,'' Moody's said. Congress will not pass many of the proposals, it predicted, ''but the most important have a chance of winning bipartisan support.''
Fed officials will consider several options when the central bank's policy-making committee meets for two days next week. The leading contender is a plan to shift the composition of the Fed's $2.6 trillion investment portfolio, selling short-term Treasury securities and using the money to buy longer-term securities.
If it works, the shift should modestly cut credit costs for businesses and consumers. Macroeconomic Advisers estimated that the Fed could raise gross domestic product by about 0.4 percentage points over two years, increasing jobs by about 350,000 over the same period.
An impact of that magnitude would be roughly the same as the Fed achieved through its recently-completed purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities, popularly known as QE2.
Under the new plan, the Fed would be absorbing more risk for each dollar it invests; 10-year Treasury securities are riskier than one-year securities because the investor makes a longer commitment. By shifting its portfolio, the Fed would seek to drive investors into even riskier assets, reducing borrowing costs.
Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a speech in London last week that the central bank had an obligation to ratchet up its efforts. With an unemployment rate of 9 percent, he said, Fed officials should be ''acting as if their hair was on fire.''
But Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said Monday that the Fed already had ''filled the gas tanks of the economy,'' that he doubted its ability to do more, and that the responsibility now fell on the rest of the government.

HEADLINE: In Republican Race, a Heated Battle Over the HPV Vaccine

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
An unlikely issue -- whether to vaccinate preadolescent girls against a sexually transmitted virus -- has become the latest flashpoint among Republican presidential candidates as they vie for the support of social conservatives and Tea Party members.
The issue exploded Monday night when Representative Michele Bachmann and former Senator Rick Santorum attacked Gov. Rick Perry of Texas during a debate for issuing an executive order requiring sixth-grade girls to be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus, criticizing the order as an overreach of state power in a decision properly left to parents. Later, Sarah Palin, who has yet to announce her 2012 intentions, also found fault with Mr. Perry.
The issue pushes many buttons with conservatives: overreach of government in health care decisions, suspicion that sex education leads to promiscuity and even the belief -- debunked by science -- that childhood vaccinations may be linked to mental disorders. 
On Tuesday, Mrs. Bachmann of Minnesota raised that concern by suggesting Mr. Perry had put young girls at risk by forcing ''an injection of what could potentially be a very dangerous drug.'' Appearing on NBC's ''Today'' show, she recounted that after the debate in Tampa, Fla., a tearful mother approached and said her daughter had suffered ''mental retardation'' after being vaccinated against HPV. ''It can have very dangerous side effects,'' Mrs. Bachmann said.
The focus on Mr. Perry's record on the issue put him on the defensive during a debate for the second week in a row, this time among his core constituency of Tea Party voters.
''It's the perfect storm of an issue,'' said Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Party of Iowa, noting that Mr. Perry, the front-runner in recent polls, was being attacked from his right flank. ''You could tell these blows landed and affected him.''
Although Mrs. Bachmann called the HPV vaccine dangerous, a report last month from the Institute of Medicine, which advises the government, found that it was generally safe. There is no evidence linking it to mental retardation.
The vaccine is strongly recommended by medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Cancer Society, to prevent cervical cancer, which kills about 4,000 women in the United States annually.
The recommended age of vaccination for girls is 11 or 12, before they become sexually active. But only Virginia and the District of Columbia require vaccination for middle school entry, according to the cancer society.
Dr. Deborah Saslow, the group's director of breast and gynecological cancer, said it did not advocate requiring HPV vaccinations before entering middle school, since parents and even doctors need more time to get used to the idea of the vaccine and to accept that it is safe.
When Mr. Perry issued his executive order in 2007, he made Texas the first state to require vaccinations, although parents could opt out. The order was instantly controversial -- the State Legislature overturned it by bipartisan majorities before it could be carried out -- and criticisms were raised at the time that Mr. Perry was doing a favor for a former chief of staff, Mike Toomey, who was then a lobbyist for Merck, the maker of the first HPV vaccine on the market, Gardasil.
Merck was lobbying legislatures around the country at the time to require Gardasil for middle school girls, but amid criticism -- led by conservative groups worried that it would promote early sex -- the company withdrew the campaign.
Mrs. Bachmann, whose campaign had lost the wind in its sails ever since Mr. Perry entered the nomination race last month, used Monday night's debate to accuse the governor of what she later called ''crony capitalism'' because of his ties to Mr. Toomey and Merck, which donated to his campaign. Ms. Palin echoed those charges on Fox News.
Mr. Perry, who said during the debate that he should have worked with the Texas Legislature, not issued an executive fiat, dismissed any suggestion that he could be bought for a mere $5,000 contribution (records show he actually received $30,000 from Merck).
A spokesman for Mr. Perry, Mark Miner, called Mrs. Bachmann's and others' comments ''ridiculous.''
''You're going to have candidates grasping for straws and grasping to get attention,'' Mr. Miner said. ''However Governor Perry will continue focusing on issues that matter to people such as creating jobs and improving the economy.''
Mrs. Bachmann said she would continue to raise the vaccine issue because it shows ''very real distinctions'' between herself and Mr. Perry.
Republican strategists also said that the issue was unlikely to go away, and that Mr. Perry's actions in 2007 raised questions not only among social conservatives, but with party members and independents who would find it an overreach of executive authority.
''I think it undercuts Governor Perry's ability to criticize Governor Romney on health care,'' said Steve Duprey, the Republican national committeeman for New Hampshire, referring to Mr. Romney's support of an individual mandate in Massachusetts. ''We're a state that takes a dim view on the government compelling us to do anything.''
Mrs. Bachmann's suggestion that HPV vaccines could be dangerous caused some influential conservative bloggers and broadcasters to suggest that she had carried the attack too far, raising questions about her judgment in echoing the thoroughly debunked views that vaccines are linked to autism or other mental illness.
Rush Limbaugh on Tuesday said she ''may have jumped the shark'' with her linking of HPV vaccines to mental retardation.
Appearing on the talk show of another conservative host, Sean Hannity, Mrs. Bachmann backpedaled a bit. ''I am not a doctor, I am not a scientist, I'm not a physician,'' she said.

HEADLINE: In Ohio, Obama Emphasizes School Upgrades as Part of Jobs Proposal

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- President Obama took his jobs sales pitch to a high school in this politically crucial swing state on Tuesday, challenging Congress to act swiftly on his $447 billion proposal of tax cuts and stimulus projects to buck up the economy.
In a high-octane performance that came with all of the bells and whistles of a campaign event -- right down to U2's ''City of Blinding Lights'' blaring across the field -- Mr. Obama said the $25 billion for education construction and improvements in the plan would achieve two goals at once: modernizing American schools and putting construction workers back on the job. 
But even as Mr. Obama was cranking up his call to action ( ''Pass this bill'' has turned into an audience chant a la ''Yes we can''), he was also indicating that he is willing to take piecemeal passage of the bill after Republicans and some Democrats suggested that Congress would not adopt the proposal intact. The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters aboard Air Force One that if Congress broke off elements of the bill to pass, Mr. Obama would sign those portions into law, and then go back to pushing for the rest.
But, Mr. Carney added, ''Congress will have a lot of explaining to do'' if by the end of the year lawmakers have not moved to aggressively boost job growth.
Democratic advisers to Mr. Obama say that they plan to compete ferociously for the electoral votes of Ohio, which the president won in 2008. Republicans are already complaining that Mr. Obama's jobs tour is more about the election than about jobs.
''After calling a joint session of Congress to propose yet a second stimulus of failed policies, the president is hitting the road this week in a political attempt to sell his package of old ideas,'' The Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, said in a statement. ''But unsurprisingly, he's only stopping in major 2012 battleground states.''
Mr. Obama will be traveling to North Carolina State University in Raleigh on Wednesday, visiting a state he somewhat improbably won in 2008 and which his political advisers hope he can keep next year.
In Columbus, Mr. Obama told the friendly crowd of students and political supporters to ''call and e-mail and tweet and fax and visit and tell your congresspersons that the time for gridlock and games is over and the time for action is now.''
He made his remarks at the Fort Hayes Art and Academic High School, which has recently benefited from federal funding to renovate.
''There are construction projects like this all over the country just waiting to get started,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So my question to Congress is, 'What on earth are you waiting for?' ''
He stood near a giant banner that looked like one of the ''change'' campaign banners from 2008, except that this one said ''American Jobs Act.'' The crowd of more than 3,000 people at the school acted like they were at a campaign event, too. They chanted: ''Pass this bill! Pass this bill! Pass this bill!''
White House officials said the $25 billion, if approved by lawmakers, would help at least 35,000 public schools. The investment would make rural schools a priority, as well as schools financed through the Bureau of Indian Education. The money, White House officials said, could be used for a tasks such as repairs or technology upgrades.
But Republicans continued to dump cold water on the proposal.
''It's great to talk about schools,'' said Kevin DeWine, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday morning. But, he added, ''I'm not willing to say that just because the president pulls $25 billion dollars out of thin air, that's something that members of Congress should blindly support.''
Meanwhile Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said he did not ''know exactly what I'm going to do yet with the president's jobs bill, but we're going to have a full caucus meeting on it on Thursday.''
For Mr. Obama, the trip to Ohio was an incursion into the home state of the man he will be fencing with, House Speaker John A. Boehner, as he tries to push his jobs plan. But it was also more than that; Tuesday's trip represented one of what promises to be many visits to swing states as the White House tries to sell Mr. Obama's proposals to the American people while at the same time protecting Mr. Obama from a backlash from voters if the plan fails in Congress. By pushing so hard, Mr. Obama will be able to point to his own efforts, while seeking to tag the Republicans with a 'do-nothing' label, an administration official said.
Whether this plan will work remains in doubt, but some Republicans -- even while pledging to oppose the bill, have at least adopted a more moderate tone. Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, was not in town for Mr. Obama's visit, but he has notably declined to pour criticism on the plan.

HEADLINE: Repaying Buffett Has Its Upside

BYLINE: By ROB COX, AGNEST T. CRANE and HUGO DIXON

 BODY:
When Warren E. Buffett invests in companies like General Electric or Goldman Sachs, markets almost always interpret it as a great vote of confidence. But is it not an even more positive signal when those same companies, returned to health and flush with abundant profits, pay him back? If so, then investors might want to use G.E.'s decision to return Mr. Buffett's money -- which served as a life raft to the company during the 2008 crisis -- to reflect on just how much better off the American financial system has become.
G.E. officially notified Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Tuesday that it intended next month to repurchase the $3 billion of preferred stock the company sold him in October 2008. The company has flagged the move for a while. 
Under terms of the deal it struck with Mr. Buffett when market mayhem was breaking loose, G.E. was obliged to wait three years to call the bonds. It also needed to give at least 30 days' notice -- hence this week's letter from Fairfield, Conn., to Omaha, Neb.
Mr. Buffett's money does not come cheap, so it's logical that G.E., as Goldman did recently, would seek to exit the deal as soon as possible. The perpetual preferred stock carries a dividend of 10 percent and can be repurchased at a 10 percent premium. Berkshire also received warrants to buy $3 billion of common stock at $22.25 a share within the next five years. With G.E. stock trading around $15, the warrants are currently out of the money. But that should not diminish the positives to be gleaned from G.E.'s payback. The company's financial position is much stronger. G.E., led by Jeffrey R. Immelt, holds some $90 billion of cash to deal with any blips in refinancing the medium-term debt it took on during the crisis; halved its dependence on the short-term commercial paper market; and has nearly reached a goal of whittling down its finance arm's balance sheet to $440 billion.
True, many banks in the United States are still wobbling, thanks to mortgage and European debt woes. But even with all these troubles, Mr. Buffett secured only a 6 percent dividend and a 5 percent repurchase premium on his $5 billion investment in Bank of America last month. That, combined with G.E.'s decision to hand back his money, marks progress, however slow and grinding it may feel.
A Taxing Idea
An Italian megatax would be a game changer. A one-time wealth tax of 400 billion euros (about $550 billion), as proposed by the former UniCredit chief Alessandro Profumo, would solve Italy's debt problem, thus helping reverse the euro crisis in general. Italians are wealthy enough that they could afford it. They certainly have no business asking for help from the Germans, who are actually poorer. But before such an idea has a hope of becoming reality, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi would first need to go.
Italian entrepreneurs, including the head of Confindustria, the business lobby, have reacted surprisingly well to Mr. Profumo's idea. Part of the reason is that every week Italians are effectively suffering a wealth tax as a result of plunging domestic stock and bond markets.
The latest austerity program, which would balance budgets in 2013, has not stopped the rot. Even media reports that Italy was cozying up to China in the hope of getting it to buy bonds has not helped. Yields rose again on Tuesday after a poor bond auction.
So getting the agony over with has some appeal to Italy's wealthy. The 400 billion euros that Mr. Profumo has proposed would cut national debt to below 100 percent of gross domestic product from 120 percent. That would change market psychology. Equity and bond prices might rebound, meaning investors might gain more on the market swings than they lost on the tax roundabout.
What's more, Italians are frankly rich enough to bail out their own government. The latest Bank of Italy data shows that net wealth was 8.6 trillion euros, or 566 percent of G.D.P., in 2009 -- more than Germany's 6.1 trillion euros or 246 percent of G.D.P. in 2008. Even if a wealth tax focused only on the richest people, a one-time tax of 10 percent, collected over a few years, should do the trick.
Mr. Profumo has not just pushed the tax idea. He has offered to enter politics as part of a coalition government to help see the idea through. Sadly, that can happen only if Mr. Berlusconi quits. For now, despite all the judicial scandals and economic mismanagement, he is clinging to power. ROB COX,

PERSON: Carl Oglesby 

HEADLINE: Carl Oglesby, 76, Antiwar Leader in 1960s

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Carl Oglesby, who led Students for a Democratic Society as it publicly opposed the Vietnam War but who was later expelled by a radical faction that became the Weather Underground, died on Tuesday at his home in Montclair, N.J. He was 76.
The cause was lung cancer, said his partner, Barbara Webster. 
Mr. Oglesby, who left a military industry job and a comfortable lifestyle to join S.D.S., was the organization's president from 1965 to 1966. Trained as an actor and a playwright, he was regarded as one of the most eloquent spokesmen of the period.
''He was the great orator of the white New Left,'' Todd Gitlin, a Columbia University professor who was the president of S.D.S. from 1963 to 1964, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''His voice was a well-practiced instrument.''
Mr. Oglesby's speech ''Let Us Shape the Future,'' delivered at an antiwar rally in Washington on Nov. 27, 1965, is considered a landmark of American political rhetoric. In it, he condemned the ''corporate liberalism'' -- American economic interests disguised as anti-Communist benevolence -- that, he argued, underpinned the Vietnam War.
''For all our official feeling for the millions who are enslaved to what we so self-righteously call the yoke of Communist tyranny,'' Mr. Oglesby said that day, ''we make no real effort at all to crack through the much more vicious right-wing tyrannies that our businessmen traffic with and our nation profits from every day.''
Yet unlike many of his compatriots on the left, Mr. Oglesby was, by his own account, a ''radical centrist.'' He proposed, for instance, that S.D.S. collaborate with the conservative group Young Americans for Freedom on antiwar demonstrations, a suggestion that only rankled the group's more radical members.
Mr. Oglesby, who over the years taught courses on politics and on the mystical writings of Carlos Castaneda at Antioch College, Dartmouth and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote many books. They include a memoir, ''Ravens in the Storm: A Personal History of the 1960s Antiwar Movement'' (2008), and several volumes analyzing the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Carl Preston Oglesby Jr. was born on July 30, 1935, in Akron, Ohio, where his father worked in a tire plant. His parents were poor Southerners who had come North seeking opportunity; Carl Junior was the first in the family to hold a white-collar job.
He studied at Kent State University before dropping out to pursue acting and playwriting in New York. Returning to the Midwest, he took a bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan.
By the mid-1960s, Mr. Oglesby was working in Ann Arbor, Mich., as a technical writer for the Bendix Corporation, an electronics concern involved in military work. He had a wife, three children and a red Alfa Romeo.
During this time, a paper he wrote advocating the immediate withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam was published, along with one of his plays, in the University of Michigan's literary magazine. As a result, Mr. Oglesby was recruited into S.D.S.
He soon quit his job and sold his house and car and within a year was elected president of the group, which had about 2,000 members. Under Mr. Oglesby's stewardship, S.D.S. helped galvanize public opposition to the war; by 1968, its membership had grown to about 100,000.
In 1969, with the group's radical-left faction in ascendance, Mr. Oglesby was expelled after an S.D.S. tribunal pronounced him insufficiently Marxist and more than sufficiently bourgeois.
S.D.S. dissolved that year. It was supplanted by the Weathermen, later called the Weather Underground, which advocated the violent overthrow of the United States government.
Mr. Oglesby's marriages, to Beth Rimanoczy, Anne Mueller and Sally Waters, ended in divorce. Besides his partner, Ms. Webster, he is survived by two daughters, Aron DiBacco and Shay Oglesby-Smith, and a son, Caleb, all from his first marriage; and five grandchildren.
His other books include ''Bob Vila's Guide to Buying Your Dream House'' (1990), written with Mr. Vila; and ''The New Left Reader'' (1969), which he edited.
Mr. Oglesby also recorded two albums of original folk music.
If he seemed at loose ends after his expulsion from S.D.S., there was reason, Mr. Gitlin said.
''He bet the ranch on the movement,'' he said. ''He transplanted his world, radically. I think part of his power as an orator was that you could sense that he was bringing his whole self into this. He was at stake. It wasn't a role; it was a life.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Scrambles to Avert Palestinian Vote at U.N.

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo. Heba Afify contributed reporting from Cairo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States is facing increasing pressure as the Palestinian quest for statehood gained support from Turkey and other countries, even as the Obama administration sought an 11th-hour compromise that would avoid a confrontation at the United Nations next week.
With only days to go before world leaders gather in New York, the maneuvering became an exercise in brinkmanship as the administration wrestles with roiling tensions in the region, including a sharp deterioration of relations between three of its closest allies in the region: Egypt, Israel and Turkey.
Nabil el-Araby, secretary general of the Arab League, said after meeting with the Palestinians that ''it is obvious that the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries are leaning towards going to the General Assembly,'' where a successful vote could elevate the status of the Palestinian Authority from nonvoting ''observer entity'' to ''observer state,'' a status equal to that of the Holy See.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey ratcheted up pressure on the United States and Israel by telling Arab League ministers that recognition of a Palestinian state was ''not a choice but an obligation.'' 
In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that American negotiators would return to the region on Wednesday to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in a final effort to avert a vote on the matter.
The administration, working with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, and Tony Blair, who serves as a special envoy to the region, continued to seek international support for what Mrs. Clinton described as ''a sustainable platform for negotiations'' between the Israelis and the Palestinians to create a Palestinian state.
She did not elaborate, but the administration hopes that a negotiated agreement on a prospective deal could avert a vote at the United Nations -- or even be submitted for approval by the Security Council or the General Assembly in lieu of a Palestinian request for either membership or status as an observer state, administration officials said.
''We all know that no matter what happens or doesn't happen at the U.N., the next day is not going to result in the kind of changes that the United States wishes to see that will move us toward the two-state solution that we strongly support,'' Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday. ''The only way of getting a lasting solution is through direct negotiations between the parties, and the route to that lies in Jerusalem and Ramallah, not in New York.''
The administration has spent months trying to avoid casting its veto in the Security Council to block membership of a Palestinian state. It also hopes to avert a vote for the more symbolic change in status in the General Assembly, which senior officials, echoing the Israelis, have warned would be harmful to Israeli-Palestinian peace and could foment violence.
But with negotiations long stalled, the Palestinians and their allies say that such a vote would preserve the idea of a two-state solution.
The timing of the confrontation has created a diplomatic quandary for President Obama, putting him in the position of opposing Palestinian aspirations for self-determination even as his administration has championed Arabs who have overthrown leaders in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya or who seek to in Syria. At the same time, he faces pressure from Israel's vocal supporters in Congress to block the vote or cut off military and economic assistance the United States has given to the Palestinians.
Internationally, however, the United States and Israel appeared increasingly isolated, with even some European nations, from Russia to France, signaling support for at least a General Assembly vote for the Palestinians.
The support for the Palestinians from the Turkish prime minister was not a surprise, but the commanding tone of his endorsement -- coupled with Turkey's souring relations with Israel, once a close ally -- underscored the growing sympathy for Palestinian aspirations for sovereignty and statehood.
''Let's raise the Palestinian flag, and let that flag be the symbol of peace and justice in the Middle East,'' said Mr. Erdogan, the increasingly influential leader of a NATO ally. He also took a harsh tone toward Israel, saying it is ''the West's spoiled child.''
The Arab League signaled that it would press the Palestinians to seek a General Assembly vote to elevate the status of the Palestinian Authority from nonvoting ''observer entity'' to ''observer state.'' Some Palestinian leaders, though, continued to press for a Security Council vote.
Although a vote in the General Assembly would not formally recognize a state of Palestine, it would give the Palestinians rights to observe and submit resolutions and join other United Nations bodies and conventions. It could also strengthen their ability to pursue legal cases in the International Criminal Court, something that alarms Israel and the United States in particular.
But the Palestinians also seemed open to the compromise being brokered by Mr. Blair and the American envoys, David M. Hale from the State Department and Dennis B. Ross from the National Security Council.
A top negotiator for the Palestinian Authority said Tuesday night that its leadership was considering strong appeals by the Arab states and the Europeans to turn to the General Assembly, where it is certain to have majority support, and not the Security Council, where the United States can veto any resolution.
The negotiator, Saeb Erekat, added that Mr. Abbas told Arab ministers that the Palestinian Authority had not yet decided, suggesting that it was still considering its options. Mr. Abbas is expected to go to Amman, Jordan, on Wednesday to discuss the issue with Mr. Blair. Mr. Blair and the Europeans ''said they have some ideas, and we are waiting to see the ideas formulated,'' Mr. Erekat said.
''We don't intend to confront the U.S., or anyone else for that matter,'' he added. ''We want to present the United Nations vote as an opportunity for all of us to preserve the two-state solution.''
Mr. Abbas and his Arab allies argue that Israel's unwillingness to take sufficient steps to create a state of Palestine had obviated the path laid out in the Oslo peace accords of 1993. Mr. Araby said that a United Nations vote would ''change the Israel-Palestinian conflict'' and become an important step toward a resolution. ''It will turn from a conflict about existence to a conflict about borders,'' he said.
Some European diplomats have agreed, but urged the Palestinians to turn to the General Assembly because they argued that its approval was more likely to facilitate negotiations rather than a vetoed bid at the Security Council. Mr. Araby said that Ms. Ashton, the European Union's chief diplomat, expected strong European support for an elevation of the Palestinians' status to ''observer state.''
The consequences of that, however, remained unclear. In Congress, senior Republican lawmakers have introduced language in an appropriations bill that would sever American aid to the Palestinians if they proceeded with the vote. Representative Kay Granger, a Republican from Texas who is the chairwoman of the House appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign aid, said she had explained that view personally to the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, during a visit to Israel and the West Bank last month.
''It's very bad,'' Ms. Granger said of the Palestinian bid at the United Nations. ''If they take that step, then we no longer fund. We stop our funding because our position is that it stops the peace process -- because they are going outside the peace process.''
She called the expected confrontation in New York next week ''a train wreck coming.''

HEADLINE: Notable Entry in Massachusetts Senate Race

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
BOSTON - Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law professor who has battled the financial industry as a consumer advocate, will announce her candidacy Wednesday for what will probably be a high-profile race against Senator Scott P. Brown. 
A senior adviser to Ms. Warren said she would spend the day greeting voters in Boston, Springfield, Worcester and other heavily Democratic cities around Massachusetts. Ms. Warren, 62, started an exploratory committee last month and for weeks has been meeting quietly with Democratic activists while mulling whether to join an already crowded field of Democrats hoping to unseat Mr. Brown.
''The pressures on middle-class families are worse than ever, but it is the big corporations that get their way in Washington,'' Ms. Warren said in a statement Tuesday. ''I want to change that. I will work my heart out to earn the trust of the people of Massachusetts.''
Democrats salivate at the thought of unseating Mr. Brown, a popular freshman who shocked them in 2010 by winning the seat that Edward M. Kennedy held for 47 years. National Democrats, in particular, have been eager for Ms. Warren to join the race after deciding that the field lacked a standout.
Mr. Brown has already raised nearly $10 million for his re-election race, but many Democrats say Ms. Warren could easily match him in fund-raising by tapping into national networks.
Ms. Warren's attacks on the banking industry after the economic collapse won her acclaim among liberal Democrats. She helped create the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington, but President Obama decided against tapping her to run it after Senate Republicans threatened to block her nomination.
Republicans have already branded Ms. Warren a Harvard elitist and an outsider, stressing that she was born and raised in Oklahoma. But Ms. Warren has stressed her upbringing on ''the ragged edge of the middle class.'' The daughter of a maintenance man, she has said that she began waiting tables when she was 13.
Other Democrats in the race include Alan Khazei, who co-founded a national service program and finished third in a field of four candidates in the Democratic primary in 2009, and Setti Warren, the mayor of suburban Newton. The other declared candidates are Thomas Conroy, a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives; Marisa DeFranco, a lawyer in Salem; Robert Massie, a former candidate for lieutenant governor; Jim King, a lawyer in Boston; and Herb Robinson, an engineer from Newton.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Inaction

 BODY:
The latest figures from the Census Bureau show the devastating cost of the recession and why putting Americans back to work must be Washington's top priority.
The bureau reported on Tuesday that the number of people living in poverty swelled by 2.6 million between 2009 and 2010 to 46.2 million. That is a shocking 15.1 percent of the population -- the highest share since 1993. 
The middle class is also hurting. Last year, the income of the typical American household fell 2.3 percent to $49,445 -- it's third consecutive annual decline -- capping a lost decade of stagnating earnings. Median household income hit its lowest level since 1996 -- $3,800 a year less than its peak in 1999.
The poverty numbers are even bleaker for minorities. According to the bureau, 26.6 percent of Hispanic households and 27.4 percent of black households lived below the poverty line last year, compared with 13 percent for white households. Almost a third of families led by a single mother were below the poverty line, while 22 percent of children subsisted in poverty.
Poverty levels are even worse by historical standards. The government considers a family of four to be poor if it earned less than $22,314 in 2010 -- about 30 percent of the median income. The original poverty line, introduced in the 1960s, was almost 50 percent of median incomes. Using that formula, 22 percent of Americans are now poor, about the same share as a half-century ago.
These numbers should jolt Washington into addressing the real economic crisis. The deficit must be addressed over time. But right now the problem is too few jobs, not too much government spending. Indeed, government safety-net programs -- so often sneered at by Republicans -- are all that is keeping millions from falling into complete despair. Food stamps helped feed 40 million families in 2010, 50 percent more than in 2007. Slashing such spending now will only put more people out of work and drive more families below the poverty line.
It took too long, but President Obama is now pushing back. His new proposals to extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of people, invest in public infrastructure and provide incentives for employers to increase their payrolls should add jobs and help the jobless make ends meet. Congressional Republicans, predictably, are complaining about the cost and about raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for it.
With 14 million Americans out of work and 46 million living in poverty, the real human cost of more obstruction and inaction is undeniable and inexcusable.

HEADLINE: Democrats See Perils on Path To Health Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Congress opens a politically charged exploration of ways to pare the deficit, President Obama is expected to seek hundreds of billions of dollars in savings in Medicare and Medicaid, delighting Republicans and dismaying many Democrats who fear that his proposals will become a starting point for bigger cuts in the popular health programs.
The president made clear his intentions in his speech to a joint session of Congress last week when, setting forth a plan to create jobs and revive the economy, he said he disagreed with members of his party ''who don't think we should make any changes at all to Medicare and Medicaid.''
Few Democrats fit that description. But many say that if, as expected, Mr. Obama next week proposes $300 billion to $500 billion of savings over 10 years in entitlement programs, he will provide political cover for a new bipartisan Congressional committee to cut just as much or more. 
And, they say, such proposals from the White House will hamstring Democrats who had been hoping to employ Medicare as a potent issue against Republicans in 2012 campaigns after many Congressional Republicans backed a budget that would have substantially altered Medicare by providing future beneficiaries with a subsidy to enroll in private health care plans.
Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said: ''Ninety-eight percent of the president's speech was excellent. The Democratic caucus and the black caucus are fired up. But you will find that we have some differences with the president's plan as it relates to Medicare and Medicaid. We would rather see some kind of increase in revenue as opposed to cutting these programs.''
By offering such proposals, Mr. Cleaver said, the president ''cancels out any bludgeoning that Democrats might give the Republicans over Medicare and Medicaid.''
Health policy experts and lobbyists see the situation in a similar way. Julius W. Hobson Jr., a lobbyist who used to work at the American Medical Association, said he viewed the savings to be proposed by Mr. Obama as ''an opening bid, the floor, the foundation for the kind of cuts Republicans want to make.''
''Republicans will give a political answer: the president's plan is not enough,'' Mr. Hobson said. ''It may not be enough in their eyes, but they will take it and build on it.''
The prospect of further cuts worries health care providers because it comes on top of the new health care law, which reduced payments to most providers to help offset the cost of extending coverage to millions of uninsured Americans.
While Mr. Obama has signaled a willingness to make health spending a top source of budget savings in the current debate, he has not sent a similar message on Social Security, even though in budget talks with Republicans this year he entertained the idea of changing the way annual increases in payments are calculated. The president did not mention changes to Social Security in his latest speech, a fact that could bolster Democrats who believe they may have a new political opening on that program, given that Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a top Republican presidential candidate, has attacked the program as a government-sponsored Ponzi scheme.
But Mr. Obama has said that ''health care cuts'' need to be part of any deal, and he has already given a preview of the cuts he is likely to propose next week. In April, he unveiled a framework for deficit reduction that he said would save $480 billion in Medicare and Medicaid by 2023.
In negotiations with Congressional Republicans in July, Mr. Obama went further. He indicated that he was willing to consider a gradual increase in the age of eligibility for Medicare and cuts in federal payments to states for Medicaid.
Medicare and Medicaid account for 23 percent of federal spending this year, and their costs are growing faster than the rest of the budget because of increasing enrollment and medical inflation. Under current law, the Congressional Budget Office says, the two programs will account for 28 percent of federal spending in 2021.
Controlling these costs is a goal for Republicans on the powerful House-Senate committee on deficit reduction, whose proposals are supposed to receive up-or-down votes in both chambers before the end of the year.
''I give the president credit for identifying and recognizing the problem,'' Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and co-chairman of the deficit reduction committee, said in an interview. ''It's a very, very hopeful sign that the president would say this -- that Medicare and Medicaid are the major drivers of our long-term liabilities, and nothing else comes close.''
By contrast, Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is nervous about further health care savings to be proposed by the White House. ''Medicare and Medicaid cannot sustain additional cuts, whether in benefits or provider payments,'' Mr. Pallone said.
Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said now might not be the best time to consider changes in the health program. ''We ought to let the innovations in the new health care law take hold,'' Ms. Schwartz said. ''They can save significant dollars in the long term by reducing medical errors and complications and improving the quality of care.''
Democrats' concerns are evident in a list of deficit reduction options circulated in the last few days by Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.
The document criticizes the idea of raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67, from 65, and notes, ''This policy idea was floated by the president near the end of the debt ceiling debate'' in July. ''This policy does nothing to control costs,'' the document says; ''it simply shifts substantial costs from Medicare to other parts of government and to private and public employers.''
In a separate memorandum, Mr. Levin said Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee would soon have a private meeting to discuss ''the case we will make against cuts to entitlement programs.''
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said that further cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid would not only impair access to care, but also lead to job loss in the health care industry, directly contravening the president's goal of job creation.
''Health care could be sacrificed in favor of construction jobs,'' Mr. Raske said.
Nursing homes and teaching hospitals are making a pre-emptive strike to forestall further cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.
''I understand the need for sacrifice,'' says a nurse in a television advertisement run by the American Health Care Association, a trade group for nursing homes. ''We've given our fair share, and more. As a nurse who cares for her patients, I can tell you another round of deep cuts that target nursing homes simply goes too far.''

HEADLINE: Tax Plan for Jobs Bill Has Familiar Ring

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
To pay for his $447 billion jobs bill, President Obama is once again proposing an assortment of tax increases on wealthy individuals and corporations.
But the White House also says its plan should be viewed as a rough framework, because its top priority is to get the jobs bill enacted. If Congress approves the president's jobs plan, it could instead pay for it with other spending cuts or tax increases if that is what the Congressional committee on deficit reduction recommends later this fall.
The bulk of the additional tax revenue under Mr. Obama's proposal would come from the wealthiest 1.5 percent of taxpayers -- individuals with adjusted gross income over $200,000, families with more than $250,000 -- who would face new limits on their itemized deductions for such things as charitable contributions and state and local taxes. The initiative is similar to one made by the president during the debt ceiling negotiations two months ago and rebuffed by Congressional Republicans. 
In its new incarnation, however, the measure would raise an additional $80 billion in taxes over 10 years by restricting ''above the line'' deductions, which allow taxpayers to exclude items like foreign earnings and earnings from municipal bonds from their taxable income. The proposal would also require wealthy taxpayers to count some employer health benefits as income.
Other elements of the proposal would end tax breaks for hedge fund managers and other investment partnerships, for corporate jets and for oil companies.
Most of the measures have been pitched by the Obama administration in some form or other since 2009, yet none generated enough support to pass Congress -- even when Democrats controlled both houses.
Judging from the reaction Republicans gave Mr. Obama's initiatives, they will also re-ignite the debate over the role tax increases play in job creation.
House Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, pointed out that tax increases had already been rejected by both parties because of concerns they would squelch growth and discourage companies and business owners from hiring.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, called the administration's tax initiative ''dead on arrival,'' and accused the president of suggesting politically provocative tax breaks to stoke Democratic voters. But administration officials brushed aside those complaints, saying that they believed the proposals would raise money while making the tax system more fair.
''We've got to make sure that everybody pays their fair share including the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. We've got to decide what our priorities are,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday outside the Fort Hayes Arts and Academic High School in Columbus, Ohio.
Administration officials said that most of the $400 billion in additional taxes on individuals would come from people whose annual income exceeds $1 million, a group whose tax rates have fallen significantly over the last decade.
Previous efforts to limit deductions on high earners were blocked by nonprofit groups, which warned they would curtail charitable donations, and residents of states like New York that have high income taxes and would have been adversely affected. The president's new plan was also criticized by securities brokers, who warned that restricting tax deductions for municipal bond earnings would rattle an already shaky market.
''It's going to mean higher borrowing costs for local governments, state governments,'' said Mike Nicholas, chief executive of the Bond Dealers of America. ''And the burden is ultimately going to end up hitting the taxpayers.''
The three other tax breaks Mr. Obama hopes to eliminate would raise comparatively small amounts of money for the Treasury.
The tax break for corporate jets, which would raise an estimated $3 billion over 10 years, has been a populist symbol for the administration. Companies can now write off the cost of jet purchases in just five years; the Obama Administration would extend that to seven years, the same period now used for commercial airliners.
Raising taxes on venture capitalists, fund managers and private equity partners is projected to generate $18 billion over 10 years. Under current law, investment partners can classify most of their earnings as ''carried interest,'' rather than ordinary income, meaning it is taxed at a top rate of 15 percent instead of the top federal rate of 35 percent.
Many labor unions and liberal groups call that a loophole and say it unfairly favors investment managers over wage earners. But on Wall Street, investors say it is appropriate to tax those earnings at rates similar to capital gains because those investments entail risk. They also warn that eliminating carried interest would deter investment at a pivotal moment.
''Raising taxes on investments would only sideline employers and investors and create further uncertainty in an already struggling economy,'' said Steve Judge, interim president and chief executive of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council.
Tax lawyers caution that changing the carried interest rules may not raise as much tax revenue as the administration forecast because investors can use accounting strategies to shelter their earnings and effectively count them as capital gains.
Aside from hedge funds, the only industry targeted by the administration is the oil business. Mr. Obama's plan would end the tax rule that classifies oil drilling as ''manufacturing'' and that allowed those companies to deduct 9 percent of their production costs this year. That measure, expected to raise $40 billion over 10 years, would also reduce the generous write-offs for drilling expenses and the tax credit for royalties paid to foreign governments.
A similar effort to end subsidies to oil companies died in the Senate this summer, after industry officials, led by the American Petroleum Institute, said it would lead to higher gasoline prices, deter hiring and increase the nation's dependence on imported oil.
But administration officials say there is growing public support for tax policies that raise the contributions from wealthy Americans and the most profitable industries.
''There's been an increasing awareness among the public that at a time of shared sacrifice needed to get our economy moving again and create jobs, you can't hold harmless hedge fund managers, corporate jets and oil companies,'' said Jason Furman, principal deputy director of the National Economic Council.

HEADLINE: Is It Weird Enough Yet?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Every time I listen to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota talk about how climate change is some fraud perpetrated by scientists trying to gin up money for research, I'm always reminded of one of my favorite movie lines that Jack Nicholson delivers to his needy neighbor who knocks on his door in the film ''As Good As It Gets.'' ''Where do they teach you to talk like this?'' asks Nicholson. ''Sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here.''
Thanks Mr. Perry and Mrs. Bachmann, but we really are all stocked up on crazy right now. I mean, here is the Texas governor rejecting the science of climate change while his own state is on fire -- after the worst droughts on record have propelled wildfires to devour an area the size of Connecticut. As a statement by the Texas Forest Service said last week: ''No one on the face of this earth has ever fought fires in these extreme conditions.'' 
Remember the first rule of global warming. The way it unfolds is really ''global weirding.'' The weather gets weird: the hots get hotter; the wets wetter; and the dries get drier. This is not a hoax. This is high school physics, as Katharine Hayhoe, a climatologist in Texas, explained on Joe Romm's invaluable Climateprogress.org blog: ''As our atmosphere becomes warmer, it can hold more water vapor. Atmospheric circulation patterns shift, bringing more rain to some places and less to others. For example, when a storm comes, in many cases there is more water available in the atmosphere and rainfall is heavier. When a drought comes, often temperatures are already higher than they would have been 50 years ago, and so the effects of the drought are magnified by higher evaporation rates.''
CNN reported on Sept. 9 that ''Texas had the distinction of experiencing the warmest summer on record of any state in America, with an average of 86.8 degrees. Dallas residents sweltered for 40 consecutive days of grueling 100-plus degree temperatures. ... Temperature-related energy demands soared more than 22 percent above the norm this summer, the largest increase since record-keeping of energy demands began more than a century ago.''
There is still much we don't know about how climate change will unfold, but it is no hoax. We need to start taking steps, as our scientists urge, ''to manage the unavoidable and avoid the unmanageable.'' If you want a quick primer on the latest climate science, tune into ''24 Hours of Reality.'' It is a worldwide live, online update that can be found at climaterealityproject.org and will be going on from Sept. 14-15, over 24 hours, with contributors from 24 time zones.
Not only has the science of climate change come under attack lately, so has the economics of green jobs. Here the critics have a point -- sort of. I wasn't surprised to read that the solar panel company Solyndra, which got $535 million in loan guarantees from the Department of Energy to make solar panels in America, filed for bankruptcy protection two weeks ago and laid off 1,100 workers. This story is an embarrassment to the green jobs movement, but the death by bankruptcy was a collaboration of the worst Democratic and Republican impulses.
How so? There is only one effective, sustainable way to produce ''green jobs,'' and that is with a fixed, durable, long-term price signal that raises the price of dirty fuels and thereby creates sustained consumer demand for, and sustained private sector investment in, renewables. Without a carbon tax or gasoline tax or cap-and-trade system that makes renewable energies competitive with dirty fuels, while they achieve scale and move down the cost curve, green jobs will remain a hobby.
President Obama has chosen not to push for a price signal for political reasons. He has opted for using regulations and government funding. In the area of regulation, he deserves great credit for just pushing through new fuel economy standards that will ensure that by 2025 the average U.S. car will get the mileage (and have the emissions) of today's Prius hybrid. But elsewhere, Obama has relied on green subsidies rather than a price signal. Some of this has really helped start-ups leverage private capital, but you also get Solyndras. The G.O.P. has blocked any price signal and fought every regulation. The result too often is taxpayer money subsidizing wonderful green innovation, but with no sustainable market within which these companies can scale.
Let's fix that. We need revenue to balance the budget. We need sustainable clean-tech jobs. We need less dependence on Mideast oil. And we need to take steps to mitigate climate change -- just in case Governor Perry is wrong. The easiest way to do all of this at once is with a gasoline tax or price on carbon. Would you rather cut Social Security and Medicare or pay a little more per gallon of gas and make the country stronger, safer and healthier? It still amazes me that our politicians have the courage to send our citizens to war but not to ask the public that question.

HEADLINE: A good jobs program and the right way to pay for it

 BODY:
President Obama has often trimmed his ideas to what he thinks he might possibly get from an opposition that intends to give him nothing. So it is a relief to see him demanding that Congress do what the country really needs.
On Sept. 8, Mr. Obama proposed a $447 billion job-creation initiative, and on Monday, he proposed a sensible package of tax increases to pay for it -- saying, in essence, that a sane fiscal policy requires more careful government spending now and eventually higher taxes. 
Congressional Republicans initially offered a cautious reaction to the jobs bill. But once Mr. Obama talked about taxes, they lost all restraint. For all the caterwauling from Republicans about the budget deficit, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, said paying for the plan would amount to a tax on ''job creators.'' The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the tax proposals were dead on arrival -- his reaction to anything Mr. Obama has proposed since Inauguration Day.
Now it is up to Mr. Obama to sell the public on his approach, something the White House has not done well. It will be a test of whether Mr. Obama will aggressively take on his opposition as the 2012 elections approach.
The president is offering job-creation policies to take effect as soon as Congress passes the bill, paired with tax increases, mostly on the top 2 percent of households that make more than $250,000 a year, starting in 2013.
Broadly, the package offers a weak economy stimulus in the short run and deficit reduction in the longer run. It is also sound in its particulars. By targeting the tax increases on high-end earners, any hit to economic growth can be offset by using the new revenue to pay for programs that have a bigger impact on economic activity than leaving the money in richer Americans' pockets.
When he laid out his jobs plan last week, Mr. Obama powerfully presented a series of choices -- a status quo of high unemployment, deteriorating human capital and crumbling infrastructure or a renewed push for recovery and relief measures to get the economy moving again.
That means choosing between a tax system that coddles the rich or reorienting the code in favor of the middle class. The tax increases Mr. Obama has recommended are a step in the direction of middle-class prosperity.
The largest part would raise some $400 billion over 10 years by capping the value of itemized deductions and other tax breaks at 28 percent. That would mean higher taxes for the minority of taxpayers who will be paying 36 percent and 39.6 percent when the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2012. The majority of taxpayers, who pay a top rate of 28 percent or less, would be unaffected.
Republicans can object all they want. But the proposed cap is much less stringent than the ones proposed by prominent deficit reduction panels, including the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson committee.
It is also fair tax policy. Under current law, the largest subsidies go to people who need them least -- for such things as mortgage interest and charitable giving -- because the value of tax breaks rises as income and tax rates rise. Capping such breaks helps to ensure that subsidies are focused on Americans who need them most.
The other parts of Mr. Obama's proposed tax increases would raise money while making the code more fair: $41 billion by ending tax breaks for oil and gas companies; $18 billion by not letting private equity partners pay tax on most earnings at about the lowest rate in the code; and $3 billion by curbing breaks for corporate jets.
Mr. Obama's proposals, including the taxes to pay for them, could not be more urgent. There is a crater in the economy where the job market used to be.

HEADLINE: G.M. Looks To Shepherd U.A.W. Pact

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors is aiming to set the framework of a new labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union that would increase entry-level wages and establish a new profit-sharing formula for workers at all three Detroit car companies.
Both G.M. and Chrysler have been holding around-the-clock talks with the union for several days, hoping to reach a new deal before their current four-year contracts expire at the end of the night on Wednesday. 
The third Detroit automaker, the Ford Motor Company, agreed with the U.A.W. on Tuesday to extend its contract until settlements were reached at the other two companies.
With its stock price lagging 33 percent below its initial public offering price of a year ago, G.M. needs a deal that bolsters confidence in its comeback from its government bailout and bankruptcy.
And with the strongest balance sheet of the Big Three, G.M. is in position to sweeten worker bonuses and raise the pay of second-tier workers in exchange for flexibility in its plants and profit-sharing tied to quality and productivity.
''With a vastly improved balance sheet, G.M. has a distinct advantage in negotiation its U.A.W. contract,'' said Mike Jackson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Automotive. ''It is working hard to set terms that are more favorable to its own cause.''
Historically, the union reaches an agreement with one automaker first and expects the other two to follow the framework for wages, benefits and work rules.
Recently, G.M. has stepped up its efforts to devise a competitive cost structure that both the companies and the union can live with for the next four years.
Underscoring G.M.'s aggressive approach has been the presence of its chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, at the bargaining table. In years past, it was rare for any Detroit chief executive to be directly involved in the talks until the end of the process.
The U.A.W. agreed not to strike G.M. or Chrysler as conditions of the Obama administration's bailouts of the companies. But G.M. is still 26 percent owned by the American taxpayers, and its executives are eager to avoid a prolonged arbitration process if a deal cannot be reached.
''A failure to reach a settlement would be looked at as almost a repudiation of the government funding,'' said Gary N. Chaison, professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
Among the top issues to be reconciled is how much workers should gain now that the companies have greatly improved their finances. G.M. earned $5.7 billion in the first half of 2011, and Ford's profit for the same period was nearly $5 billion. G.M. also has a cash stockpile of more than $30 billion, which it has been using to pay down debt and create what it calls a ''fortress balance sheet.''
A deal that investors see as favorable for G.M. could help reverse the slide in the company's stock price. Shares of G.M. closed at $22 on Tuesday, one-third lower than the price for its initial public offering last November.
Instead of increasing wages -- which have been frozen since 2003 -- analysts expect the carmakers to offer workers large bonuses that they would receive as lump sums after the contract is ratified. That avoids permanently increasing the companies' annual labor costs, and the signing bonuses most likely would amount to considerably less than four consecutive years of small raises.
The bonuses will probably be $5,000 to $7,500 at G.M. and Chrysler, and slightly more at Ford, predicted Arthur Schwartz, a former G.M. negotiator who is now president of the consulting firm Labor and Economic Associates in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Ford would pay more because it is healthier and thousands of its workers have filed a grievance against the company over executive bonuses. A hearing on that matter is scheduled for Thursday.
''Their pay rates are already competitive, so why they're entitled to a pay increase by definition is certainly debatable,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''A nice-size signing bonus would go a long way.''
A U.A.W. spokeswoman, Michele Martin, said reports that the union had asked for bonuses of as much as $10,000 were ''inaccurate'' and creating ''false expectations'' among workers.
The bonuses are meant to increase the chances of ratification by rank-and-file members, but a large amount would undoubtedly draw criticism from opponents of G.M.'s government bailout and could even cause workers to think they are being taken.
''Most workers could see a large signing bonus almost as a sign of a bribe,'' Mr. Chaison said. ''If it's too large then they'll get suspicious about what they're being asked to accept.''
The companies are expected to slightly increase pay for workers on the entry-level pay scale, which currently starts at $14 an hour, or half as much as most autoworkers earn.
Workers said that they expected the new second-tier pay scale to top out at about $18 an hour. U.A.W. and company officials, however, have not confirmed an amount they are discussing.
The union also is seeking to protect as many jobs as possible, and specifically wants to persuade G.M. to reopen closed plants in Tennessee and Wisconsin. But G.M. officials have said they will need to restart those plants only if market demand is sufficient, asserting that they do not need additional capacity yet.

HEADLINE: Republicans Gain Seat in Congress Weiner Vacated

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Colin Moynihan, Jim Rutenberg, Jennifer Steinhauer and Tim Stelloh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A little-known Republican businessman from Queens, channeling voter discontent with President Obama into an upset, won election to Congress on Tuesday from the heavily Democratic district in New York City last represented by Anthony D. Weiner.
The Republican, Bob Turner, a retired cable television executive, defeated Assemblyman David I. Weprin, the scion of a prominent Democratic family in Queens, in a nationally watched special election.
With 84 percent of the precincts counted early Wednesday, Mr. Turner was leading Mr. Weprin by 54 percent to 46 percent, according to The Associated Press.
National Republican leaders immediately trumpeted the victory as a sign of trouble for Mr. Obama's re-election effort. ''An unpopular President Obama is now a liability for Democrats nationwide,'' Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement. 
But Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said the district's large concentration of Orthodox Jews made it unusual and meant the race had few national ramifications.
''In this district, there is a large number of people who went to the polls tonight who didn't support the president to begin with and don't support Democrats -- and it's nothing more than that,'' she said in a telephone interview.
As Mr. Turner declared that the election had been a referendum on the president, his buoyant supporters, gathered at a restaurant in Howard Beach, Queens, shouted ''Yes, we can,'' appropriating the galvanizing phrase of Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign. Mr. Turner predicted that voters elsewhere would also rebuke Mr. Obama in the elections next year.
''We have lit one candle today,'' he said. ''It's going to be a bonfire pretty soon.''
Mr. Weprin, however, did not concede defeat.
''This is not over yet; this is going to be a long night,'' he said in brief comments to his supporters at a pub in Forest Hills, Queens. ''Hopefully we can still pull this out.''
The unexpectedly tight race stirred anxiety among Democrats already worried about elections next year for president, the House and the Senate. The Turner campaign had eagerly courted disenchanted Democrats, and outside polling places around the district on Tuesday, multiple longtime Democrats confessed that despite concern about Mr. Turner's eagerness to slash federal spending, they chose him hoping that his election would get lawmakers' attention.
''I am a registered Democrat, I have always been a registered Democrat, I come from a family of Democrats -- and I hate to say this, I voted Republican,'' said Linda Goldberg, 61, after casting her ballot in Queens. ''I need to send a message to the president that he's not doing a very good job. Our economy is horrible. People are scared.''
Mr. Turner will become the first Republican since 1920 elected to represent the Ninth Congressional District, which now stretches from the Rockaways to Forest Hills and encompasses a swath of middle-class and working-class neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. The district is predominantly white and has long been known for its large Jewish population, though it has become increasingly diverse in recent years.
Mr. Weprin, 55, a former city councilman and son of an Assembly speaker, was nominated by local party leaders to run after Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, resigned in June following his admission that he had sent sexually explicit messages to women he had met online.
Mr. Turner, 70, ran against Mr. Weiner in the last election but has never held office. He mounted a surprisingly forceful campaign, painting Mr. Weprin as a party insider who would support the status quo.
Mr. Turner capitalized on discontent in some corners of the Jewish community with Mr. Obama's posture toward Israel and his handling of the Middle East peace process. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a Democrat, urged voters to rebuke the president by voting for Mr. Turner.
The emergence of Israel as an issue was a surprise, because Mr. Weprin is an observant Jew and strong supporter of Israel. But Mr. Weprin's support in the Orthodox community had already been weakened by his vote to legalize same-sex marriage, and several voters interviewed on Tuesday said the Israel issue was a major factor in their decision to support Mr. Turner, who is Roman Catholic. Mr. Turner repeatedly criticized Mr. Obama on Israel.
Mr. Weprin fought back by seeking to appeal to the district's many older voters, telling them that Mr. Turner was in sync with the Tea Party and would seek to weaken Social Security and Medicare.
Erik Huneke, 35, a history Ph.D. candidate who voted for Mr. Weprin, said that setting aside discussion of national symbolism, there was no question that Mr. Weprin's platform better suited the political leanings of most voters in the district.
''It's understandable for people to be upset,'' Mr. Huneke said. ''But it would be nice if people had a longer-term perspective in terms of why they're hurting now. It's not just Obama's fault.''
Mr. Weprin's campaign made a central issue out of the future of federal entitlement programs, persuading voters like John Doherty, 64, a Democrat from Middle Village, Queens, to worry about whether Mr. Turner would favor deep cuts.
But Mr. Doherty, a retired social worker, said his concern about entitlement programs had been overshadowed by the opportunity he saw to express his unhappiness about the economy in the special election.
''We need to deliver a message to Washington,'' he said. ''We need jobs, and we need to focus on the economy, and we need to stop fighting with one another.''
The campaign was short -- Mr. Weprin and Mr. Turner were chosen as nominees by their respective parties in early July -- and attracted little attention or money for many weeks. As it became clear, however, that Mr. Turner might win, Mr. Weprin received a cash infusion from national Democrats, who spent more than $600,000 on television advertisements criticizing Mr. Turner. Mr. Weprin had also raised significantly more money than Mr. Turner and had the assistance of labor unions and strong local party organizations.
Both campaigns enlisted senior party figures to bolster their candidates. Mr. Turner trumpeted endorsements not only from Mr. Koch, but also from former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former Gov. George E. Pataki. Both made appearances with Mr. Turner and urged New Yorkers to vote for him as a way to admonish the president, for whom they did not have kind words.
On the Democratic side, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and former President Bill Clinton recorded automated phone calls to voters for Mr. Weprin, and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who formerly represented the Ninth District, campaigned with him, as did the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn.
The upset in New York came the same day that, in a special election in Nevada's Second District, an open seat was won by Mark Amodei, a Republican, over Kate Marshall, a Democrat. While Mr. Amodei's victory was hardly a surprise, as the district has been held by a Republican since it was created in the 1980s, his defeat in the more Democratic leaning parts of the district demonstrated the challenge Democrats face in a country frustrated with high levels of joblessness and no near end in sight to economic woes.
The New York loss is an embarrassment to Representative Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Israel just a few months ago had expressed hope that the Democrats could move to take back control of the House; now his party appears to be facing a challenge defending seats it already holds.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Mounting Pressure

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Kulish and Judy Dempsey in Berlin, Matthew Saltmarsh in London, Elisabetta Povoledo in Rome and Graham Bowley in New York.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Facing market pressure to resolve the Greek debt crisis once and for all, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will hold a video conference call Wednesday evening with the embattled Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, French officials announced on Tuesday.
The announcement could portend yet another restructuring of Greek debt to stave off a default. A stopgap bailout plan announced on July 21 has yet to be approved by all 17 nations that share the euro currency, and in recent weeks a renewed sense of crisis has engulfed the euro region.
In the latest sign of turmoil, Italy -- the euro region's most indebted member, after Greece -- was forced to pay record-high interest rates in order to complete an auction of its five-year bonds on Tuesday, despite continuing purchases by the European Central Bank. Spain, which plans a bond sale on Thursday, could be subjected to similar investor wariness. 
Plans were clearly being laid Tuesday for a serious conversation with Mr. Papandreou. His government has proved incapable so far of making the kinds of legal changes and budget cuts in the middle of a deep recession that Athens has promised its European partners and the International Monetary Fund.
France, where shares of the biggest banks have plummeted recently on fears of exposure to Greece's debt, is pressing for a stronger signal from Germany that Europe will act to resolve the Greek matter before it spreads further contagion.
Despite the stepped-up pace of economic diplomacy, Europe's response to the debt crisis still appeared to be behind the curve. That was underscored by the announcement that Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, will make a rare appearance at an informal meeting of European finance ministers to be held Friday in Wroclaw, Poland. The trip will be Mr. Geithner's second across the Atlantic in a week, following the Group of 7 session in Marseille, France, last weekend.
''Clearly the U.S. Treasury is disappointed with the direction of the European debt crisis and is looking for action, before further sections of the banking system are drawn in and a global financial crisis is revisited,'' Chris Turner and Tom Levinson, strategists at ING, said in a research note.
Growing concern in Washington about the euro crisis and the damage it is doing to the markets and the global economy was also expressed by President Obama, meeting with Spanish-speaking journalists in Washington.
Mr. Obama urged European leaders to step up their efforts. ''In the end the big countries in Europe, the leaders in Europe, must meet and take a decision on how to coordinate monetary integration with more effective coordinated fiscal policy,'' Mr. Obama said, according to the Spanish news agency EFE.
Mr. Sarkozy met Tuesday evening at the Elysee Palace with Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the 27-nation European Council, to discuss the euro crisis, but neither man spoke afterward to the press. Mr. Van Rompuy has been asked by Germany and France to head a similar council of the 17 euro zone nations.
France and Germany are pressing to put into place the decisions made at the last euro zone summit meeting on July 21, which called for raising the total bailout fund to 440 billion euros ($598 billion). Germany, whose participation would be the most crucial financially and politically, is among the many countries that have yet to ratify that agreement.
Mrs. Merkel, who is working to win a ratification vote in the Parliament this month, said on Tuesday that Germany would ensure there would be no ''uncontrolled default'' of Greece that could pull down the euro zone. An uncontrolled default would be the equivalent of Greece's simply walking away from its debts, whatever the consequences, rather than undergoing the equivalent of supervised bankruptcy proceedings.
''It is our top priority to avoid an uncontrolled default,'' Mrs. Merkel said, ''because it would hit not only Greece. The danger would be very high that it would hit many other countries.''
Mrs. Merkel's mention of default was significant, because there is increasing skepticism that even the second bailout of Greece would be enough to bring it to a sustainable level of debt.
The Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, said on Tuesday that he was studying the possible consequences of a Greek default.
''We're currently preparing for many scenarios and possible shock effects,'' Mr. De Jager said in an interview with the broadcaster RTLZ. He declined to comment when asked whether euro zone officials were preparing for a default of Greece.
''I can't do that in public,'' he said. ''I'm not denying it, but I can't confirm it either.'' Markets have already priced in the near-certainty of a Greek debt default. Credit-default swap prices -- the cost to insure Greece's debt against default -- suggest a probability of default of as much as 98 percent in the next five years, according to pricing data provider Markit.
For European banks, the cost to insure their debt of European banks against default remained high, but slightly off Monday's record levels. For Societe Generale, one of France's most beleaguered banks, the credit-default rate hit a new high Tuesday, at 4.29 percent. At the end of June, it was 1.3 percent.
The aim of European leaders is to isolate Greece's problems as much as possible, even if that means the kind of debt restructuring -- and steeper losses for Greek bondholders -- that the leaders denied they would ever contemplate six months ago. Officials hoped to reassure the financial markets that other weak members of the euro zone could work out their problems without formal debt restructurings.
Portugal and Ireland, with subsidized loans under a European Union and I.M.F. program, look as if they might be able to make sufficient economic adjustments. And the Spanish and Italians have been working -- more successfully in Spain than Italy -- to cut their deficits and debt to try to appease the markets.
In the meantime, the European Central Bank has been buying Spanish and Italian bonds to try to hold the yields down -- purchases that an expanded bailout program could continue if it is ratified.
So far, the central bank's efforts have not been consistently successful.
On Tuesday, the Italian treasury sold $5.3 billion worth of a five-year bond at an average yield of 5.6 percent -- the highest interest on such bonds Italy has been forced to pay since the formation of the euro union in 1999.
Meanwhile, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds, while down slightly at 5.63 percent on Tuesday, was still uncomfortably close to the 6 percent level that is considered to be unsustainable.
One obstacle to ratification of the expanded bailout fund has been Finland's demand for collateral.
Mrs. Merkel met on Tuesday with Finland's prime minister, Jyrki Katainen, and said afterward that she believed a solution would be reached. ''All of us want to find and will find a path that is open to the principles of all partners but still fulfills the Finnish requirements,'' Mrs. Merkel said.
She also expressed confidence that Greece was back on the right path and would get its loans.
France and Germany agree with Mr. Obama that more fiscal coordination is vital across the euro zone. But getting there will take longer than markets would prefer, because a serious integration would require a treaty change. And there has been little from European leaders, especially Mrs. Merkel, to indicate a deep grasp of the crisis and how to fix it.
''Politicians don't understand the language of markets, and it's becoming more of a problem,'' said Kurt Hubner, head of the Institute for European Studies at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ''They have to speak with one tongue, not 17 or so.''

HEADLINE: Does Your Homework Help You Learn?

BYLINE: HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: How would you characterize your school assignments?

 BODY:
In the Sunday Review article "The Trouble With Homework," Annie Murphy Paul reviews the research on homework:
The quantity of students' homework is a lot less important than its quality. And evidence suggests that as of now, homework isn't making the grade. Although surveys show that the amount of time our children spend on homework has risen over the last three decades, American students are mired in the middle of international academic rankings: 17th in reading, 23rd in science and 31st in math, according to results from the Program for International Student Assessment released last December.
In a 2008 survey, one-third of parents polled rated the quality of their children's homework assignments as fair or poor, and 4 in 10 said they believed that some or a great deal of homework was busywork. A new study, coming in the Economics of Education Review, reports that homework in science, English and history has "little to no impact" on student test scores. (The authors did note a positive effect for math homework.) Enriching children's classroom learning requires making homework not shorter or longer, but smarter.
She goes on to enumerate some of the aspects of effective independent assignments, like "retrieval practice," which basically means doing practice tests to reinforce learning and commit it to memory, and "interleaving," in which problems are not grouped into sets by type, but rather scattered throughout an assignment, which makes the brain work harder to grasp the material.
Students: Tell us how effective you think your homework is. What kinds of assignments seem pointless? Which ones are confusing or frustrating? Which ones are most engaging and interesting? Which ones are you fairly sure help you learn and grow?

HEADLINE: The Slump Before The Slump

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The naughties were a bad time, even before the recession.

 BODY:
Busy day, so I won't have much time to post. But I should weigh in on the Census report, many of whose key findings are summarized in this CBPP post.
Crucially, of course, the report documents the vast human damage being inflicted by a weak economy. It also documents the ways in which safety-net programs have at least mitigated that damage -- notably, uninsurance among children has actually fallen thanks to SCHIP and Medicaid, unemployment insurance has literally kept millions above the poverty line, and the early features of the Affordable Care Act have helped hundreds of thousands of young adults retain insurance. We'll have a fuller read on this, with the effects of food stamps and other in-kind benefits, next month.
But what struck me is the extent to which the suffering didn't begin with the slump -- many measures of pain were rising right through the "Bush boom", and have merely continued that rise.
Exhibit 1 is "deep poverty", people living below 50 percent of the poverty line:
Exhibit 2 is real income of non-elderly households:
And Exhibit 3 is employment-based health insurance, whose decline has luckily been offset by public provision:
Things were getting worse for lots of Americans even before the slump. Now they're getting worse faster.

HEADLINE: Some Banks Hang On to Bailout Billions

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Almost three years after Washington bailed out the banks, nearly 500 financial institutions are still clinging to $19 billion in taxpayer money.

 BODY:
While it has been nearly three years since Washington bailed out the banks, the financial industry is still clinging to $19 billion in taxpayer money. 
Nearly 500 banks, ranging from beleaguered regional powerhouses to obscure community banks, owe roughly 8 percent of the $245 billion doled out at the peak of the financial crisis, according to Treasury Departmentdata released this week. Regions Financial, a large lender based in Alabama, owes $3.5 billion, the most of any bank. 
Even as bailout money has slowly returned to the government's coffers throughout the year, many banks still refuse to part with their lifelines. Some institutions, well-positioned to reimburse taxpayers through fresh stock offerings, are choosing instead to wait for brighter days when their stock prices are not so depressed. 
Other stragglers desperately need the money. Nearly one-third of the remaining debtors have missed their recent dividend payments to the government, according to an analysis by Linus Wilson, professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. 
"The percent of deadbeats," Mr. Wilson said, "will almost surely rise in the short term."
Next month will be the three-year anniversary of the highly contentious Troubled Asset Relief Program. At the time, as the economy teetered on the brink, the government injected much-needed capital into the banking industry, charging the banks 5 percent annual interest. There is no deadline for repayment, although a steeper 9 percent dividend payment kicks in after five years. 
Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, eager to shed the stigma of TARP and its caps on executive bonuses, quickly repaid the bailout money. Over the last two years, other big banks followed suit.
The Obama administration now expects to turn a roughly $20 billion profit on the bank bailouts, programs once seen as a major drain on the government's bottom line. Still, the overall TARP payouts -- which included lifelines to the American International Group, the automotive industry and embattled homeowners -- will likely cost taxpayers up to $37 billion. 
The $19 billion owed by banks is down 14 percent from May. The decline is partially a result of dozens of banks repaying their debts using a separate pool of government funds. Under a new program intended to encourage small-business lending, smaller banks can exchange their rescue money for cheaper capital, provided they meet certain lending targets. 
"Unfortunately, this means that taxpayers will see less money from their risky investments," Mr. Wilson said. 
Only 10 banks have fully repaid their bailout funds over the last few months, Treasury Department data shows. And now, roughly 160 of the 500 debtors are behind on their dividend payments to the government, according to Mr. Wilson. 
More than 70 banks have failed to keep up with at least six dividend payments, his research shows, allowing the Treasury Department to appoint directors to the boards of the firms. Some banks are in even deeper. Saigon National Bank in Westminster, Calif., has missed 11 payments, Mr. Wilson said. 
Another 12 institutions have a good reason for not paying up: They have filed for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Financial Regulators May Get Bigger Budgets

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: A Senate subcommittee approved a bill to increase funding by about 19 percent for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 BODY:
Financial regulators clamoring for bigger budgets notched a rare victory on Wednesday, as a Senate subcommittee approved a measure to increase the budgets for cops on the Wall Street beat. 
The bill, offered by the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on financial services, would raise spending by about 19 percent at both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, both recently charged with writing dozens of new rules for Wall Street. 
Over the last year, feeding the coffers of financial regulators has become a thorny partisan issue. While the Senate, run by Democrats, is seeking to ratchet up regulatory spending, House Republicans want to cut back their budgets. 
"My top priority again this year is to continue to address the resource needs of two of our nation's premier financial regulatory agencies," the Senate subcommittee's chairman, Richard J. Durbin, said on Wednesday. "Both the C.F.T.C. and the S.E.C. occupy pivotal positions at the forefront of stimulating and sustaining economic growth and prosperity in our country - and in protecting investors," said Mr. Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois. 
The spending debate unfolds at a crucial time for both agencies. The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul significantly widened their mandates, calling for a crackdown on everything from the derivatives industry to executive compensation. The agencies are struggling to keep pace with the deadlines set by the Dodd-Frank Act, delaying several derivatives rules until 2012. 
The delay, regulators say, is in part a result of budget shortfalls. As DealBook has previously reported, the agencies have been slow to fill crucial jobs, upgrade market surveillance technology and churn out the new rules. 
But the Senate subcommittee's plan brightens the picture for both agencies, freeing up money to dig out from their Dodd-Frank backlog. 
Under the plan, the S.E.C.'s 2012 budget would climb to $1.4 billion, up $222 million from this year. The agency's spending is entirely offset by fees assessed on securities transactions.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission funding would jump $37.7 million, to $240 million. Although it received a 20 percent funding increase in April, that fell short of what President Obama had requested for the agency. 
Some agency officials praised the subcommittee's proposed higher funding. "The increase approved today is a critical and positive step forward," Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner at the C.F.T.C., said in a statement. He added, however, that the change was not a panacea. "This funding echelon is a bare minimum of resources essential for the agency to be able to carry out our significant mandates under Dodd-Frank," he said. 
Republicans, contending that the C.F.T.C.'s rules threaten to crimp an already-frail economy, have pushed to reduce the agency's budget. In June, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives agreed to cut spending at the agency by $30 million.

BYLINE: LYDIA POLGREEN


HIGHLIGHT: The latest news from the press across India.

 BODY:
The police charged (Expresstwo high school students with criminal conspiracy in connection with the bombing of the Delhi High Court last week, the first criminal charges to be filed in the blast, which killed 12 people and injured dozens more. The police say the young men had sent an e-mail claiming that the militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad Islami was responsible for the attack.
Will Narendra Modi, the controversial but popular chief minister of Gujarat, duke it out with Rahul Gandhi () to be the next prime minister of India? Newspapers quote from a report () by the United States Congressional Research Service that purportedly praises Mr. Modi despite concerns about his role in the riots that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, in Gujarat in 2002, saying "perhaps India's best example of effective governance and impressive development is found in Gujarat."

 Columnist Samar Halanrnkar, citing the Gandhi family's response to the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 that killed thousands, argues that a race between Mr. Modi and Mr. Gandhi could be bad news for India's minorities.
"A tussle between the two in today's polarized times will probably lead to a race where regardless of who wins, India's minorities may suffer," he writes. "Both Gandhi and Modi, after all, represent and lead legacies of blood in an era of a new, often ugly, nationalism."
As inflation nears double digits, () the Asian Development Bank has downgraded India's growth prospects to 7.9 percent. Options for tackling inflation, which is driven in part by serious supply bottlenecks, are limited. The Reserve Bank of India has raised interest rates 11 times since March 2010, and analysts worry any further increase will throttle growth. But in an editorial, argues that the RBI has little choice but to raise rates.
A driver's license in a day, and an electricity connection within a little more than a month? These are not distant dreams () for Delhi's denizens, reports say. Under an act that became law today, bureaucrats who fail to deliver crucial government services within the stated deadline will face fines and other penalties.

HEADLINE: Housing Project Feud Cited in Killing of Basketball Star

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: Some of the people who live in two nearby housing projects in Manhattan say the shooting death of a teen-aged basketball star was related to a long-running feud between the two projects.

 BODY:
As soon as Tayshana Murphy, 18, was shot early Sunday in the Grant Houses, a public housing project in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, her friends and neighbors declared that they knew, immediately, who had killed her.
"Manhattanville killed her, it's a fact," said Calvin Spencer, 30, who lives in the same building as Ms. Murphy did: 3170 Broadway at West 125th Street, where Morningside Heights meets West Harlem.
Mr. Spencer was referring to the Manhattanville Houses, another public housing complex just across 125th Street from the Grant Houses. Residents of both housing complexes said there had been a running feud between the projects for years, and that fights among young residents had increased before the shooting.
"It's a senseless beef and it goes back before I was born," Mr. Spencer said. "I remember growing up with it in the '90s. Things were escalating the last couple weeks and these guys came here to hurt a Grant person, didn't matter who it was. And now this is going to make it worse."
Police officials also said the shooting might have been connected to the dispute between the projects.
"It's stupid stuff; these two groups don't even know each other," said Krisy Reyes, 18, a friend of Ms. Murphy's. "All they knew was, 'We're Manhattanville, they're Grant. So they're the enemy.'"
Manny Cerrutty, 42, another longtime resident of the Grant Houses, stared at the makeshift shrine Ms. Murphy's friends had made, with hundreds of handwritten messages scrawled on a bedsheet duct-taped to the building's facade. On the ground were more than 100 candles, and empty bottles of liquor, apparently consumed in tribute.
"They killed Grant's star," Mr. Cerrutty said. "It's all going to start back up now."
Several teenagers sitting on a railing nearby, agreed, and perhaps indulged in a bit of bravado.
"There's going to be bodies dropping in the 'Ville now, for real," one said, referring to the Manhattanville Houses.
Ms. Murphy, who was known as Chicken, lived in a 15th-floor apartment at 3170 Broadway. She moved to the Grant Houses five years ago with her mother and two brothers.
There, she developed into a high school basketball star, playing competitive games on the projects' courts and in tournaments in summer. She also practiced her dribbling incessantly in front of the building, in between dancing and holding court among groups of friends.
On Sunday, police officials and neighbors said, Ms. Murphy was in a group of young people outside the Grant Houses when some men walked up to them on a short walkway from Broadway. The Grant group scattered and Ms. Murphy fled into her building and ran up the stairs. She was shot several times in a stairwell on a fourth-floor landing; her blood remained on the wall on Wednesday. Nearby walls were covered with graffiti tributes.
The police said three men were captured on surveillance cameras approaching Ms. Murphy's building carrying guns. On Tuesday, the police announced that one of them, Terique Collins, 24, had been arrested in the Manhattanville Houses and charged with weapons possession. The police identified the other two suspects as Tyshawn Brockington, 21, and Robert Cartagena, 20, but did not provide information on Wednesday about where they lived.
Ms. Murphy began playing basketball at age 5 - usually with boys - while growing up in the Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City, Queens. She had been ranked by an ESPN Web site as one of the best female point guards in the country, and was starting her senior year at Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers, a New York City basketball powerhouse.
Ms. Murphy was known for her ball-handling and her ability to drive hard to the hoop, but she also enjoyed a sometimes raucous social life outside her building, friends said.
Some of Ms. Murphy's friends insisted that she was not involved in any rivalry between the projects. But others said that she, or her 17-year-old brother, known as Bam-Bam - might have been involved in a fight the night before the shooting. (Ms. Murphy and her brother were strikingly similar in appearance.)
On Saturday night, some said, a young man from the Manhattanville Houses was beaten and slammed over the head with a bicycle outside the C-Town supermarket, on 125th Street on the edge of the Grant Houses. Her killing, several hours later, was retribution, they said.
Feuds between nearby housing projects are not uncommon. There have been longstanding, recurring rivalries among complexes in the Rockaways, including Beach 41st Street Houses, the Ocean Bay Houses and Ocean Village.
"It's common, the feuds, but Chicken was only involved in basketball, nothing else," said Zanobia Rivera, 18, who described herself as Ms. Murphy's girlfriend.
Ms. Rivera, a senior at the Global Learning Collective school in Manhattan, was standing by the shrine for Ms. Murphy, clutching a pair of her red basketball shorts.
In the Manhattanville Houses, a young couple pushing their baby in a stroller said there had been constant fights between groups of young men from the two projects in recent weeks.
"They learn this stupidity at a young age," said the mother, who would not give her name for fear of retribution. "My little brother just started seventh grade at the local school, which has mostly Manhattanville kids. They've already started bullying him, asking him, 'You from Grant, huh? You from Grant?' Where do they learn this?"
Near the shrine, Mr. Spencer, a fledgling rapper known as Babyface, said, "The only thing we can do is try to stop the violence because violence ain't going to bring Chicken back."

HEADLINE: Madison Avenue Says Ho! Ho! Halloween!

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Marketers, retailers and media companies are continuing their efforts to fast-forward annual shopping seasons over concerns about consumers' willingness to spend money because of the economy.

 BODY:
For several years, it has been the practice of marketers, retailers and media companies to start making their pitches earlier and earlier for the important Christmas shopping season.
More recently, they have been moving up the calendar for Halloween. And in the last couple of years, it has become apparent that Madison Avenue is trying to start the back-to-school shopping season earlier, too.
In all instances, the efforts to fast-forward time have the same genesis: concerns about consumers' willingness to spend money because of the economy. A dollar in hand now, the theory goes, is worth a prospective pair of dollars later - dollars that may not be spent if consumer confidence weakens.
The result is situations that prompt double takes like Halloween candy turning up on the shelves of Duane Reade drug stores in Manhattan two weeks before Labor Day. It used to be that trick-or-treat candy was not stocked by stores until after children returned to school, or at least until the day after Labor Day.

What follows is a look at some additional attempts to get consumers in the mood for fall and Christmas shopping well ahead of traditional timetables. As more examples are found, Media Decoder will share them, too.
*The Sept. 12 issue of People magazine, which came out on Sept. 2, included advertisements for the "Febreze fall collection" of air fresheners, being sold at Wal-Mart stores by Procter & Gamble, and the return of Pumpkin Spice Lattes to Starbucks stores as of Sept. 6.
"Fall is in the air," the headline on the Febreze ad read. "Breathe happy."
*The Sept. 8 issue of Parade magazine carried an ad for M&M's White Chocolate Candy Corn, being sold at Wal-Mart. The ad showed a red M&M's candy dressed in a candy-corn costume for trick-or-treating.
*Two Meredith magazines with pumpkin-filled Halloween covers - Family Circle and Midwest Living - came out last week. They were followed this week by an issue of All You magazine, from the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner, with a front cover that is covered with pumpkins.
*The New York City Ballet and American Express began this week to run ads in newspapers encouraging Amex cardholders to order tickets to the ballet's production of "George Balanchine's The Nutcracker," to be performed from Nov. 25 through Dec. 31.
*Retailers like Home Depot, Kmart, J.C. Penney, Sears and Wal-Mart plan to begin carrying Christmas merchandise by the end of the month. Some, like Costco, have begun selling such items already.
*Advancing the holiday calendar, it turns out, is not limited to this side of the Atlantic. In Britain, according to the trade publication Marketing Magazine, Reckitt Benckiser is introducing a Christmas campaign for a color-changing candle sold as part of its Air Wick line.

HEADLINE: How Payroll Tax Cuts Can Create Jobs

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: A cut in the employer share of payroll tax could promote hiring, but making it contingent on increasing payroll could be counterproductive, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Last week President Obama proposed a collection of policy changes, including payroll tax cuts, unemployment benefit extensions and new infrastructure projects. The latter do not have much job-creation potential, because they reduce private-sector activity in the short run. But they can be desirable for the infrastructure they produce, and because doing some of those projects now would be cheaper than doing them later. 
Unemployment compensation may be compassionate, and for that reason alone might be the "right thing to do." But an unfortunate side effect of unemployment compensation is that it reduces employment by discouraging people from seeking and retaining jobs.
The real job-creating potential in the president's proposals comes from one of its payroll tax cuts.

The payroll tax is the second most important tax in the United States, normally bringing in almost $900 billion a year through a combination of taxes on employers and employees - about 15 percent of payroll. Although workers may not realize it, most of them pay more payroll tax than they pay in federal income tax.
The president proposes cutting the employer portion of the payroll tax by 3.1 percentage points (bringing the combined total down to about 12 percent) for employers with less than $5 million in payroll. Unfortunately, this last condition is business-distorting. Why encourage a $10 million business to split into two $5 million businesses?
Nevertheless, the 3.1-percentage-point part of the president's proposal could raise employment by at least a million, albeit the duration of job creation is related to how long the tax cut lasts. I expect that every percentage-point reduction in employers' costs raises employment by about a percentage point and real gross domestic product by about 0.7 percentage point. 
That means employment could be roughly three million greater during the period of the tax cut than it would otherwise.
The tax cut is proposed to last a year, and some of the estimated three million incremental job-years - a job that lasts a year, or 12 jobs that last a month - could be spread over time. So we might see only two million in the first year of the cut, with another one million after the cut expires. But still that's a lot of jobs.
The other part of Mr. Obama's payroll tax cut proposal is more complicated - and counterproductive. It would reduce the employer's proportion of the payroll tax by 6.2 percentage points for increases in its payroll spending. Assuming that this payroll tax change would be in place in 2012, the payroll spending subject to the reduction would be the difference between the 2012 payroll and the 2011 payroll.
Because this part of the cut is based on the payroll difference, it makes expanding the 2012 payroll cheaper - presumably the intention of the law - but it makes it cheaper to contract the 2011 payroll. 
That could be part of the reason why employment so far in 2011 has been so low; if you think that tax credits for new hires will catch employers completely by surprise, remember that the Obama administration has been floating ideas like this for threeyears.
To see this, consider an employer that would have a $1 million payroll in both 2011 and 2012. With the normal rates in place, that employer and its employees would owe a combined $150,000 in payroll taxes in each of the two years (15 percent of payroll; for simplicity I have put to the side payroll tax caps and a employee-side cut that has been in place since Jan. 1), or a total of $300,000.
If this employer decided to increase its 2012 payroll by $100,000, that would add a total of about $15,000 to the tax bills under the normal rates, but only about $9,000 under the proposed cut. In other words, as intended, the proposal makes 2012 payroll expansion about 6 percent cheaper than it would be under the normal rates.
However, if the same employer decided to cut its 2011 payroll by $100,000, that would subtract a total of about $15,000 from the tax bills under the normal rates, but subtract a total of $21,000 from the tax bills under the proposed rates - if the payroll cut was restored in 2012, since that part of the payroll would benefit from the reduced payroll tax rate. Contrary to the policy's intentions, it makes cheaper certain types of payroll reductions, namely those reductions that occur before the law goes into effect.
While President Obama's proposals have some real job creation potential, it remains to be seen whether any of them become law and whether the job-creating policies are packaged with too many job-destroying policies.

HEADLINE: Waste Not, Biden Tells Cabinet

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: The vice president announced a new waste-cutting initiative for federal agencies that he said would save $2 billion.

 BODY:
The White House wants to make sure voters know that administration officials are doing everything they can to cut waste in these hard economic times. Towards that end, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday convened the first Cabinet meeting dedicated solely to looking at how to reduce waste at federal agencies.
Mr. Biden announced a new waste-cutting initiative that he said would save $2 billion, and tasked the assembled Cabinet secretaries to mount reviews focusing on unnecessary and inefficient federal spending in their agencies.
"We can make our government more efficient and responsible to the American people," Mr. Biden said in a statement. "If we're going to spur jobs and economic growth and restore long-term fiscal solvency, we need to make sure hard-earned tax dollars don't go to waste."

HEADLINE: Is It All Obama's Fault?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS AND GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: A stagnant economy, high unemployment, a ballooning deficit; the United States is a mess.

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, I'm so happy to be back conversing with you again! When I left in May you were very depressed about the way the country was going, but I see that things have changed and now you're really, really, really depressed about the way the country is going.
David Brooks: It's so great to have you back. You went to Texas, where Governor Perry's free-market policies have led to the creation of 23 billion jobs, most of them involve cleaning up the roadkill from his exercise runs. I went to Kenya, where I was a resident scholar at the Barack Obama Birthplace and Presidential Library. 
Gail Collins: Ah, the birther debate. You know, there are days when I really miss the Donald Trump presidential candidacy.
David Brooks: Meanwhile, in our absence Mitt Romney has: a.) lost ground in the polls and b.) turned into a polished, confident supercampaigner. I wonder's if he's on some authenticity hormone. 
Gail Collins: My question today is - if the country's a mess, how much do you blame the president? I know in the past you've at times been a fan, and I think the White House regards you as the kind of Republican that would make bipartisanship work. If only there were a few hundred more of you in Congress.
David Brooks: I'm sort of on a fatalism kick these days. Financial crises stink. They typically lead to five or six years of crappy growth and high unemployment. Governments in this fix inevitably ramp up their spending to try to reverse the slide and it basically doesn't work. You can ameliorate the terribleness, but you can't reverse it. The problems are just too big. 
I blame Obama a bit for not learning from history, for believing, overconfidently, that he could do something about the stagnation. I think he could have developed an effective strategy to tell the country: Hey, it's going to be rough. We'll do what we can but our main task is to address the structural problems that will turn this temporary stagnation into long-term decline: debt, tax reform, labor market reform, human capital.
Gail Collins: I'm sorry, I can't deal with the here's-a-recession-let's-cut-spending thing. Putting hands over ears and making loud, irritating humming sounds.
David Brooks: Obama wasn't alone in believing he had more control over the economy than he really did. But he's made things a bit worse for himself by trying to take advantage of the crisis to tackle ancillary problems and drive moderates into the other camp. 
Gail Collins: I keep thinking back on the 2008 campaign. Boy, was that a long time ago. John Edwards was a champion of the poor. Feminists were all excited about the first woman president. Here in New York, Charles Rangel was the Lion of Lenox Avenue and Anthony Weiner was the most promising up-and-comer. Please, stop me before I fling myself out of a window.
David Brooks: I remember that year too. Wasn't that the year Ron Paul ran for president? I wonder what happened to that guy. I think he tried to escape to Mexico and was stymied by the immigration fence. 
Gail Collins: Anyhow, Barack Obama won the nomination by promising to end the brain-dead politicization of Washington. And he got elected! Then two years later, the country turned around and elected a House Republican majority that has absolutely sworn not to work with the Democrats on anything. I realize this was not generally the work of the same voters, but there must be a couple of people out there who voted for Obama in '08 and the Tea Party in '10 and I want an explanation.
David Brooks: They fear the country is going down the toilet and they want some big fundamental change but they are not quite sure what it is. Obama promised change but in office he has tried to be Mr. Long Term and also Mr. Short Term, Mr. Liberal but also Mr. Hamiltonian Centrist. Mr. Post-Partisan Transcendence and Mr. Partisan Streetfighter. There are only so many divides any leader can fudge. 
Gail Collins: A lot of people - especially people on the left - are unhappy with Obama for not yelling at the Republicans more, flinging down more gauntlets, drawing more lines in the sand, and doing all the other stuff you're supposed to do when you're really determined to show you're not a political wimp. I don't think he's a wimp - he's been pretty steely when it comes to foreign affairs. But I do think he's a person who was specifically elected not to play hyper-partisan politics. How can we expect him to be good at something we picked him to avoid?
David Brooks: This has been one of those periods when I'm so glad I'm no longer on the left. For 50 years liberals have dominated Hollywood, the media, the universities, publishing and every mode of communication with the possible exception of talk radio and Ted Nugent concerts. In all this time they have tried to get the country to think more like them. They have failed. The country has swung to the right. Distrust of government is at an all-time high. And now they want Barack Obama to come in and promulgate the Great Society II on a center-right country. 
That's crazy. Liberals who wish Obama were more forthright should look in the mirror and ask: Why have we been unable to win more converts to our side?
Gail Collins: It's true that Americans don't like government. Until they need it. Or until they get used to it and then somebody comes along and tries to take away their Social Security. Obama's speech to Congress was good. Maybe he can remake himself into a different kind of politician. Although we did elect him because we thought he was genuine.
David Brooks: The speech was good. Like our colleague Ross Douthat, I wish this had been the first stimulus package, although maybe double in size. The political world would be different today if he'd started off with these policies.
I'm curious about how he pays for it. The leaks so far have come in two tranches. First there was the story he would pay for it by closing loopholes for the rich, like the charitable giving loophole. If that's the main source then I consider the whole exercise to be nothing but cynicism. That idea couldn't even get a vote when both houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats. 
The second tranche of leaks suggests he's willing to touch Medicare. That would be politically courageous and a sign that like during the debt-ceiling fight, he is willing to be bold and serious.
Gail Collins: Bold and serious didn't get him very far then. Although it might be a good title for a politics-based soap opera. 
David Brooks: As always, I hover between the hope that Obama will emerge as a great leader, who will break through the logjam, and the despair that somehow it's just not going to work out and we'll all revert to the trenches.

HEADLINE: Separating Issues from Myths in Obama's Solyndra Situation

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Real issues and plentiful mythology surround a failed solar company.

 BODY:
Bradley Plumer of the Washington Post has filed a really nice, tight deconstruction of five myths being propagated in the wake of the failure of Solyndra, a solar company that received more than $500 million in fast-tracked loan guarantees from the Department of Energy and became a photo opp for President Obama last year. (A House committee held a hearing on the company and the administration this morning.)
Here are the myths inspected by Plumer. I'm not a fan of purloining page views, so I'll only include Plumer's assessment of the first one and encourage you to read the rest on his blog, then return here to consider next steps:
1) This scandal is no big deal. 
To the contrary, evidence is mounting that there something irregular about the way the Solyndra deal got greenlighted. My colleagues Joe Stephens and Carol D. Leonnig have obtained e-mails showing that the White House pressed the Office of Management and Budget to approve the guarantee before a big public rollout, even as OMB officials voiced concern about being rushed.
Now, does that prove the White House engaged in cronyism, shoveling cash toward a political ally? Not necessarily. Democrats have pointed out that Solyndra's loan process was initiated by the Bush administration and that many key investors were Republicans. Still, there could have been other reasons the deal was hastened. As a former Clinton energy aide stressed to me, it was arguably a mistake to sell the loan guarantees as job-creating stimulus (the program was expanded as part of the 2009 stimulus bill). "It means you try to force huge amounts of money quickly through processes that aren't quite ready yet," the aide said. "It'd be better to have a calmer, steadier source of funding."
2) Solyndra proves that energy loan guarantees are a flop. 
3) The government should leave energy R&D to the private sector. 
4) Solar is a doomed industry. 
5) It's all China's fault. 
Read the rest of the post here and come on back.
One grand, overarching myth not discussed by Plumer is that the kind of solar technology produced by companies like Solyndra can play a substantial role in blunting the buildup of greenhouse gases driven largely by burning coal and oil.
That remains a myth, given the dominance of coal for generating electricity and trends in its use in Asia, particularly. Don't rely on me to pop that myth. James Hansen of NASA, who installed costly solar panels on his rural rooftop in Pennsylvania, does a good job:
Can renewable energies provide all of society's energy needs in the foreseeable future? It is conceivable in a few places, such as New Zealand and Norway. But suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy. This Easter Bunny fable is the basis of 'policy' thinking of many liberal politicians. Yet when such people are elected to the executive branch and must make real world decisions, they end up approving expanded off-shore drilling and allowing continued mountaintop removal, long-wall coal mining, hydro-fracking, etc. - maybe even a tar sands pipeline.
Why the inconsistency? Because they realize that renewable energies are grossly inadequate for our energy needs now and in the foreseeable future and they have no real plan. They pay homage to the Easter Bunny fantasy, because it is the easy thing to do in politics. They are reluctant to explain what is actually needed to phase out our need for fossil fuels.
I encourage you to read Hansen's full essay, "Baby Lauren and the Kool-Aid."
His prescription for addressing the issue honestly and effectively is very different than mine (mainly, I think, because of different perceptions of what's politically possible in America these days). But that's a discussion for another day.

HEADLINE: White House Rankles Wall Street With Enterprise Value Tax

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The tax plan for jobs bill has a provision that would tax the profits from the sale of an investment-management partnership at ordinary income rates of 35 percent.

 BODY:
8:00 p.m. | Updated 
Private equity executives and hedge fund managers are apoplectic that President Obama has included a provision in his jobs bill that they are calling punitive and discriminatory.
Buried on Page 139 of the American Jobs Act is a measure that would tax profits on the sale of an investment management partnership - like a private equity, venture capital or hedge fund firm - at ordinary income rates of 35 percent. Proceeds from the sales of these and other United States businesses are now taxed at a 15 percent capital gains rate.
 Critics say that if this so-called enterprise value tax proposal becomes law, investment management partnerships would be the only businesses in the United States where proceeds from the sale of the business would be taxed at ordinary income rates.
"The enterprise value provision that the administration has included as part of an already flawed carried-interest proposal violates basic tax fairness policy and seems to single out the private equity, venture capital and real estate industries in a punitive fashion," said Steve Judge, interim chief executive of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, the industry's trade group.
 Until now, much of the conversation surrounding tax increases on Wall Street has focused on "carried interest" income, or the cut of profits that fund managers earn as part of their compensation. That income is currently taxed at capital gains rates; the administration's proposal would tax it at higher ordinary income rates.
 Though an increase in the carried-interest tax rate would raise a relatively small amount of money - the White House budget office estimates $18 billion - the issue in recent years has become a flash point in the debate over how to pay for programs that will create jobs and stimulate the economy. Private equity and hedge fund firms have exploded over the last decade, and their executives have become among the most powerful and wealthiest players on Wall Street.
But since President Obama announced his jobs plan last week, the industry has not focused its ire on carried interest. Some Wall Street executives even privately concede that there are legitimate arguments for increasing their taxes on carried-interest compensation, especially as the economy continues to struggle.
Instead, they are angry over the enterprise value tax. When the provision first emerged from the House Ways and Means Committee, lobbyists and lawyers representing Wall Street thought it was a drafting error.
 It was not. Proponents of the tax said it was necessary to prevent industry players from circumventing new rules on carried interest. In other words, tax policy makers feared that investment management executives would sell their businesses to avoid paying higher tax rates on future carried interest income.
But cashing out has become more common in private equity and hedge fund land. A number of hedge funds have sold themselves to large banks, including Highbridge Capital Management to JPMorgan Chase and Old Lane Partners to Citigroup. The country's most senior buyout executives, including Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, recently descended on Capitol Hill to protest the tax. 
Here is what has them so angry: It is widely understood that when a business is sold, the owners' proceeds are taxed at a capital gains rate. For instance, if two entrepreneurs built a chain of tattoo parlors and then sold that business, their profits would be taxed at the capital gains rate.
But under the White House's proposal, two entrepreneurs who built a private equity or a hedge fund firm and then sold it would pay ordinary income tax rates on the profits from the sale. Some policy makers say they believe the measure could raise billions of dollars in revenue for the government.
 "It's like a bill of attainder," said one senior buyout executive who requested anonymity because he did not want to alienate the administration. A bill of attainder, which is banned by the Constitution, is a law that has a negative effect on a single person or group.
 Last week, a paper written by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee suggested increasing only the carried-interest tax rate, but not adopting the enterprise value tax.

HEADLINE: Making the Grade? Perry Says He Didn't

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Perry told students at Liberty University that bad grades prevented him from fulfilling his dream of becoming a veterinarian.

 BODY:
LYNCHBURG, Va. -- As a child, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was dead set on being a veterinarian. "That was my heart's content. It's what I always wanted to do," he said.
Then came a day of reckoning, during the second semester of his sophomore year at Texas A&M University, when he went to see the dean of the veterinary school. His advice: switch to an easier major.
"He said, `Son, I'm looking at your transcript,'" Mr. Perry said. "'You want to be an animal science major.'"
Mr. Perry told the anecdote here Wednesday morning to students at Liberty University in a speech that seemed to go to great lengths to explain and rationalize his poor academic performance in college, something that has already been an issue in the race for the G.O.P. presidential nomination.
Liberty University, established 40 years ago by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell -- the founder of the Moral Majority -- has become a whistle-stop for many aspiring G.O.P. contenders. In his 20-minute address, Mr. Perry almost totally avoided discussing politics and policy, a breather, perhaps, after he was attacked by Republican rivals in a debate Monday on everything from immigration policy to social security. 
Instead, the governor delivered a much more personal speech about his Christian faith and his view that "God uses broken people to reach a broken world."
But first, he tackled those bad grades. He described how being a member of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets was like attending a military academy, and how he had to keep his shoes perfectly shined and avoid scratches on his belt buckle, otherwise upperclassmen would tell him to "drop down and give them 72" push-ups, a number chosen because Mr. Perry was a member of the class of 1972.
 
 "They made sure we understood at Texas A&M that being a freshman in the Corps of Cadets was not going to be one big fraternity party," he said. "They wore us out so much that not a single member of my freshman class managed to stay awake in class for the first few weeks." That, he added to ripples of laughter from the audience, was "kind of the start of why my grades were what they were."
At least at the start of college, Mr. Perry did not make any F's, turning in mostly C's along with a smattering of B's and one A as well as one D, which he received for a class in plane trigonometry during the spring semester of 1969, according toa copy of his transcript obtained by The Huffington Post.
The grades did not improve as his college career went on, as Mr. Perry pushed ahead with some of the more difficult science courses including organic chemistry, in which he made a D one semester and an F in another. 
His other D's included courses in the principles of economics, Shakespeare, "Feeds & Feeding," veterinary anatomy, and what appears to be a course called "Meats," though the quality of the copy of the transcript makes it hard to tell for certain.
"Four semesters of organic chemistry made a pilot out of me," he joked, suggesting his experience in what is traditionally a weeding-out class for doctors and other medical professionals focused his immediate career aspirations toward the military. Mr. Perry was a pilot in the United States Air Force in his 20s. His transcript shows two semesters of organic chemistry and two organic chemistry lab courses.
On the other hand, he also scored B's in introductory literature, government, soil science, algebra, business law, and a course on the marketing of livestock.
It was difficult, he said, "preparing for that life in the military while trying to keep a focus on a variety of subjects that would prepare me for a life after the military."
"Quite frankly, I struggled with it. I fully admit that."
He added that at high school in the town of Paint Creek, Tex., "I graduated in the top 10 of my graduating class -- of 13." The crowd laughed and applauded.
Drawing on his youth in a small farming town, he described Texas A&M, in College Station, Tex., as an experience that "broadened that perspective for me, as much as an all-male military institution could do in the late 60s and early 70s."
He said his time in the Air Force also taught him "about a world incredibly more diverse and complex than Paint Creek or College Station."
Later, he said, he turned to God at age 27, when he was an Air Force officer, a journey "that is not the story of someone who turned to God because I wanted
to."
"It was because I had nowhere else to turn," Mr. Perry said. "I was lost spiritually and emotionally, and I didn't know how to fix it."
After quoting some scripture, the governor shifted briefly to politics, exhorting the Liberty students to "tell the people in power that you will not have your inheritance spent or your future mortgaged."
He added: "Don't leave it to a bunch of Washington politicians to tell you how to live your life."
Before the speech, Mr. Perry got some support from the chancellor and president of Liberty, Jerry Falwell Jr., who has run the school since the death of his father in 2007.
In comments to reporters, Mr. Falwell emphasized that the university could not endorse a candidate. But he made it clear that he felt an affinity with the Texas governor, while saying that two of Mr. Perry's rivals for the G.O.P. nomination -- Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, and Representative Ron Paul of Texas -- were "unelectable."
However, any of the Republican contenders "would be much better" than President Obama, he added.
Mr. Falwell also defended Mr. Perry against criticism from rivals during Monday's debate, when the governor admitted he had made a mistake with an executive order requiring sixth-grade girls in Texas to be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus.
"I don't think you'll find a candidate in the world who hasn't made a mistake," Mr. Falwell said. Echoing a Bible verse, he suggested that critics ought to remove the speck from their "own eye before judging someone for the splinter" in theirs. 
In his introduction, Mr. Falwell also called Mr. Perry "one of the most pro-life governors in American history" and spoke approvingly of policies he has backed in Texas.

HEADLINE: Perry Sees Message in New York; Faults Bachmann HPV Claim

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Perry told more than 1,000 Republican activists that the results in New York City's Ninth Congressional District "sent signals that President Obama will be a one-term president."

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. - Gov. Rick Perry of Texas told an audience of more than 1,000 Republican activists here that the results in New York City's Ninth Congressional District "sent signals that President Obama will be a one-term president."
Speaking at the annual fund-raising lunch for the Republican Party of Virginia, Mr. Perry quipped that "voters in New York sure got the message." And he told reporters later that the special elections on Tuesday in New York and Nevada sent a "powerful message" about Mr. Obama.
"This is an administration, and frankly a political party, that's on the ropes," he said in brief remarks after his speech. "The American people understand that."
He said the election in New York "tells you that this job-killing, tax-raising, regulatory-burdensome administration is headed down the wrong road."
In his first visit to Virginia since becoming a presidential candidate, Mr. Perry offered himself as the best Republican to draw contrasts with Mr. Obama, and he specifically dismissed Mitt Romney's ability to do the same.
"Lets face it, Michael Dukakis created jobs at three times the rate annually that Mitt did while he was governor," Mr. Perry said, reprising a line from his last debate. He said Mr. Romney's time as governor of Massachusetts was "substantially less than quality work."
M. Perry criticized comments by his opponent, Michelle Bachmann, who cited the case of a mother who had approached her and said her daughter had suffered "mental retardation" after being vaccinated against human papillomavirus, a vaccine Mr. Perry required sixth-grade girls to have in Texas.
"I think that was a statement that had no truth in it, no basis in fact," Mr. Perry said.
In fact, Mrs. Bachmann's former campaign chief, Ed Rollins, said on MSNBC of Mrs. Bachmann's encounter with the woman: "She made a mistake."
"There's no empirical data other than one individual woman coming up to her," he said of the claimed link between the vaccine and mental retardation.
In his appearance here, Mr. Perry also took a swipe at Mr. Romney by telling the crowd of Republicans that "our current crop of Republicans get it" when it comes to the economy. That reference pointedly leaves out Mr. Romney, who left office years ago.
And he joined in the building criticism of Mr. Obama's support for a solar company that has since gone out of business. To a question about financing for disaster relief, he said, "this is a question of prioritization. Is $500 million for a solar company the right priority rather than helping the people of Virginia? I gotta say probably not."
Mr. Perry was scheduled to head to Iowa on Thursday after a stopover in New York City for fund-raisers and a chat with Donald Trump, the billionaire real estate mogul and reality television star who toyed with the idea of a presidential bid of his own.
Asked what they will talk about, Mr. Perry said they would "just be talking about how to create jobs in America. Donald Trump's pretty good about creating jobs."
He added: "I gotta think Donald's got some advice for me."

HEADLINE: Scientists With Different Politics Speak With One Voice on Climate

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Scientists with different politics press politicians to talk straight on greenhouse risks.

 BODY:
I encourage you to read a Miami Herald Op-Ed article written by Kerry Emanuel, a veteran climate and hurricane researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Peter C. Frumhoff, an ecologist who directs science and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists.
The core theme is simple enough:
One of us is a Republican [Emanuel], the other a Democrat. We hold different views on many issues. But as scientists, we share a deep conviction that leaders of both parties must speak to the reality and risks of human-caused climate change, and commit themselves to finding bipartisan solutions.
The piece takes several Republican presidential candidates to task for rejecting science pointing to a growing risk from unabated greenhouse-gas emissions but also criticizes President Obama for ducking and covering on climate. Give it a read and weigh in.
Emanuel weighed in on his conservatism and climate concerns on Science Friday awhile back, as well.
Richard Alley, a masterful climate scientist and communicator and author at Pennsylvania State University, is also a Republican with climate concerns.

HEADLINE: For Democrats, It's 2010 All Over Again

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: With special elections, any one race may or may not be representative of a national trend. 

 BODY:
The outcome of any individual election to the United States House, even in a highly partisan era where Congressional elections have a relatively strong correlation with presidential voting and national trends, is going to be determined based on a combination of local and national factors. One congressional district's outcome may diverge significantly from another's - even if they seem similar on the surface -- based on the quality of the candidates, the demographics of the region and issues highly pertinent to the district but not to the nation at large. Any one race may or may not be representative.
There are good reasons to think that local issues may have loomed especially large in New York's 9th Congressional District, where the Republican Bob Turner won on Tuesday. President Obama had significantly underperformed his Democratic predecessors in the district in 2008, and the large split in voting between the Brooklyn and Queens portions of the district -- the Brooklyn parts are more heavily Jewish -- implies that Israel-related issues may have played a role. 
There were other local factors as well: influential endorsements for Mr. Turner by Democratic leaders like former Mayor Ed Koch and the Assemblyman Dov Hikind, and local rabbis; the close timing of the election with the Sept. 11 anniversary; the fact that the district had been vacated by a Democrat, Anthony Weiner, in a scandal; and perhaps gay marriage in a district that is economically liberal but fairly religious, with pockets of social conservatism.
Still, even if those issues played a role, even if they swung the result, the Democrat David Weprin would likely have performed better had the national environment been stronger for his party.
And when paired with the results in Nevada's Second Congressional District, where the Democrat Kate Marshall was blown out on Tuesday, the special election scorecard is starting to look pretty ominous for Democrats. 
One crude way to forecast the results you might expect to see out of a House race is through its Partisan Voting Index, or P.V.I., a measure of how the district voted relative to others in the past two presidential elections. 
The Nevada Second, for instance, has a P.V.I. of Republican plus-5, meaning that the Republican candidate would be expected to perform 5 points better there than a Republican might nationally. Since a vote for the Republican is (usually) a vote against the Democrat, you need to double that number to project the margin of victory. In this case, that would imply a Republican win by 10 points given average candidates and a neutral overall political environment.
The Republican Mark Amodei, however, leads by 22 points as of this writing, an easy victory, meaning that he overperformed the P.V.I. by 12 points. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Turner's winning margin in the New York district, 8 percentage points as of this writing, represents a 18-point G.O.P. swing from the P.V.I.-projected results.
These numbers contrast with a May special election in New York's upstate 26th Congressional District, a Republican-leaning seat where the Democrat, Kathy Hochul, won. Her 5-point victory margin represented a 17-point Democratic swing from what would be expected from the district under average circumstances.
Ms. Hochul's victory should not be forgotten about, as it's a sign of how volatile the results in individual elections can be, and how rapidly the political climate can shift. That election was held at a time when Mr. Obama's standing was relatively strong in national polls, following the news that Osama bin Laden had been killed.
Even if you include it, however -- as well as a July special election in California, where Democrats won but by an underwhelming margin -- Republicans have overperformed the P.V.I. baseline by an average of 7 percentage points across the four races. That squares with what we saw in 2010, when Republicans won the popular vote for the House by an aggregate of 7 percentage points.
In other words, the four special elections, taken as a whole, suggest that Democrats may still be locked in a 2010-type political environment. Democrats might not lose many more seats in the House if that were the case, since most of their vulnerable targets have already been picked off, but it would limit their potential for any gains. And it could produce dire results for the Democrats in the U.S. Senate, where they have twice as many seats up for re-election.
It's certainly possible to read too much into special elections to the House. Over the long run, they have had a statistically significant correlation to the outcome of the next general election. But the relationship is weak and frequently runs in the wrong direction, as it did in 2010.
Moreover, special elections aren't a good barometer of the degree of anti-incumbent sentiment, since by definition they don't feature incumbents on the ballot.
So these are just four waves in an ocean of data. Among other signs, the outcome in the recall elections in Wisconsin last month -- where Democrats failed to flip the state senate, but picked off two Republican incumbents in six attempts -- are a bit more favorable for Democrats. So are the results of generic ballot polls, which show a roughly tied race for the U.S. House. There are also a broad variety of indicators showing extreme dissatisfaction with the Congress, which could harm Democrats in the Senate but help them in the House.
Nevertheless, these are waves that portend trouble. 
At the very minimum, they imply a reduction in the odds that after three consecutive "wave" elections, 2012 will show a tidal shift back toward Democrats.

HEADLINE: Poor Are Still Getting Poorer, but Downturn's Punch Varies, Census Data Show

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLEand SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The discouraging numbers spilling from the Census Bureau's poverty report this week were a disquieting reminder that a weak economy continues to spread broad and deep pain.
And so it does. But not evenly.
The Midwest is battered, but the Northeast escaped with a lighter knock. The incomes of young adults have plunged -- but those of older Americans have actually risen. On the whole, immigrants have weathered the storm a bit better than people born here. In rural areas, poverty remained unchanged last year, while in suburbs it reached the highest level since 1967, when the Census Bureau first tracked it.
Yet one old problem has not changed: the poor have rapidly gotten poorer.
The report, an annual gauge of prosperity and pain, is sure to be cited in coming months as lawmakers make difficult decisions about how to balance the competing goals of cutting deficits and preserving safety nets. 
Its overall findings -- income down, poverty up -- are hardly surprising in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Of equal interest, with fiscal knives in the air, are the looks at who has suffered the most and who has largely escaped.
''Certainly in a recession we want to put resources where they're most needed,'' said Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, who served as a Treasury official under Democratic and Republican presidents. ''And in a recession, needs change dramatically from group to group.''
Perhaps no households have weathered the downturn better than those headed by people 65 and older, whose incomes rose 5.5 percent from 2007 to 2010. By contrast, household income for every other age group fell. Among people ages 15 to 24, it plunged 15.3 percent.
Partly that is because older Americans get more of their income from pensions and investments, so a job shortage hurts them less. Also, the generation now retiring has been the most prosperous in history, so as poorer Americans die off, the income of the age group grows.
Such data is likely to feed longstanding debates about generational equity, since the largest portion of safety net spending goes to those 65 and older, through Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
''We are spending too much of our limited resources on the elderly, and not investing enough in programs for younger Americans, such as job training and education,'' said Isabel V. Sawhill, a budget expert at the Brookings Institution.
Another noteworthy finding comes from the suburbs, which have traditionally had the lowest rates of poverty. Suburban dwellers experienced a sharp increase toward the end of the past decade. Nearly 12 percent of them were living in poverty in 2010, the highest level ever recorded, up from just 8 percent in 2001. (The rate in cities was 19 percent, but rose less sharply.)
''There's been a suburbanization of poverty,'' said Alan Berube, a Brookings demographer, who cited the growth of service, retail and construction jobs that lured low-income Americans to the suburbs before the recession. ''The notion of poverty being only in inner cities and isolated rural areas is increasingly out of step with reality.''
Household income fell in every region of the country from 2007 to 2010. But it fell much less in the Northeast (3.1 percent) than in the South (6.3 percent), the West (6.7 percent) or the Midwest (8.4 percent). And the Northeast was the only region where household income did not fall last year.
The declines in the West have been fueled in part by the collapse of the housing industry, especially in Arizona and Nevada. And the Midwest has suffered idled factories. Its status as the hardest-hit region is likely to come into play next year as presidential candidates hunt such big Electoral College prizes as Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio.
''The big hurt has been in the manufacturing and construction industries, which were big in the Midwest and West,'' said Timothy Smeeding, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
The census findings present two competing stories of immigrants -- a reminder of just how economically diverse that group has become. From 2007 to 2010, they have fared both better and worse than the native born.
Among people born in the United States, household incomes declined 6.1 percent. Among non-citizens, the decline was steeper -- 8 percent. But for immigrants who had attained citizenship, the decline was only 3.9 percent.
That latter group may disproportionately include the highly educated professionals who increasingly fill the new Americans' ranks. A recent study by Audrey Singer, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, found that the number of immigrants with college degrees now exceeds those who lack a high school education.
''The high-skilled people are starting to dominate,'' she said
Two worrisome numbers in the report raise questions about the recent response of the safety net. Poverty has risen especially fast among single mothers. More than 40 percent of households headed by women now live in poverty, which is defined as $17,568 for a family of three.
That is the first time since 1997 that figure has been so high. Analysts attribute the rise in part to changes in the welfare system, enacted in the mid-1990s, which make cash aid much harder to get. Those changes were credited with encouraging recipients to work in good times, but may leave them with less protection when jobs disappear.
''The business cycle is going to hurt them a lot more than it used to,'' said Robert Moffitt, a Johns Hopkins University economist.
Poor people not only grew more numerous -- 46.2 million -- but also poorer. Among the poor, the share in deep poverty (defined as having less than half the income to escape poverty) rose to the highest level in 36 years: 44.3 percent.
The census data may overstate hardship by failing to count some benefits the needy receive, like tax credits and food stamps. But it also may also understate their needs by failing to adjust for health care expenses and variations in the cost of living.
About 20.5 million people are in deep poverty, with food stamps increasingly replacing cash aid as the safety net of last resort. More than 45 million people get food stamps, an increase of 64 percent since January 2008. About one in eight Americans, and one in four children, receives aid. Using an alternative definition of income, the Census Bureau found that food stamps lifted 3.9 million people above the poverty line.
''Given that poverty and hardship are likely to continue for some time, it's imperative that we protect the program,'' said Stacy Dean, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which aids in food stamp outreach campaigns.

HEADLINE: Consortium Views Arts As Engines Of Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
In the two years since he became chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, Rocco Landesman has been trying to make the case that art is an effective linchpin to economic development. Now in a broad effort to build on that thesis, he has helped to enlist an unusual consortium of foundations, corporations and federal agencies that will use cultural enterprises to anchor and enliven 34 projects around the country, from a struggling city block in Detroit to a vacant school in East Harlem.
The projects will receive $11.5 million in grants from the foundations and another $12 million in loans from the corporations under the program that is to be financed through the private sector but coordinated in part by federal agencies. The program, to be announced on Thursday and called ArtPlace, aims to integrate artists and arts groups into local efforts in transportation, housing, community development and job creation as an important tool of economic recovery. 
''We really need to scale up the resources in the field,'' Mr. Landesman said. ''It is not going to be through Congressional appropriation.''
''We felt,'' he added, ''if we worked together and coordinated our efforts, it would have a multiplier effect.''
So in St. Paul the program will help underwrite efforts to stage more than 100 arts projects along a new light-rail line. In Detroit a stretch of Woodward Avenue will gain a music center, pedestrian greenways, improved museum space and a new building for start-up companies. And P.S. 109 in East Harlem will become a home for 90 artists and their families as well as 13,000 square feet of space for community and cultural groups.
Mr. Landesman helped to hatch the program just over a year ago with Luis A. Ubinas, the president of the Ford Foundation, who is serving as the chairman of the ArtPlace Presidents Council.
''We need to communicate that the arts are as important as ever, that they can't be left behind, that they can't be dropped to the cutting-room floor,'' Mr. Ubinas said. ''Too many people think of the arts as luxuries, as jewels, things that may not be necessary in times of need, things that can be put off. The arts are inherently valuable, and they're also part of what's going to get us out of this economic problem we're in.''
The projects were selected by an independent review board after a request for proposals.
In Seattle, for example, a grant will help finance activities at the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience as part of a larger effort to help the Chinatown-International District.
''We're in an urban, ethnic neighborhood, with a high crime rate,'' said Beth Takekawa, the executive director of the museum, which was founded two years ago. ''It's hard for all the businesses down here. We kind of live and die together.''
In San Francisco the real estate developer Forest City -- together with Intersection for the Arts, an alternative nonprofit art space -- is redeveloping four downtown acres in the Yerba Buena, Tenderloin and Market districts, converting properties like the old San Francisco Chronicle building, parking lots and vacant warehouses into film and digital-media businesses, artists' workshops and cultural event spaces.
''Art is a critical component of what makes cities thrive,'' said Alexa Arena, the Forest City executive overseeing the effort. ''This is about looking at the life of the project rather than just the physicality of it.''
The foundations involved are the Ford Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the James Irvine Foundation, The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Kresge Foundation, the McKnight Foundation, the Rasmuson Foundation and the Robina Foundation as well as an anonymous donor.
It is unusual for foundations to join forces in this way to back a single cause. ''It seemed too important not to do,'' said Don Michael Randel, president of the Mellon Foundation. ''The support for the arts and humanities is fairly frail.''
The federal partners besides the National Endowment are the departments of Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education, and Transportation, along with the White House's Office of Management and Budget and its Domestic Policy Council.
While they do not provide financing, the federal agencies participate in the ArtPlace Presidents Council and its operating committee meetings.
The $12 million loan fund is being supplied by Bank of America, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Chase, MetLife and Morgan Stanley. The amount of the average grant is about $350,000.
Funds for the program are overseen by the Nonprofit Finance Fund, a nonprofit lender and financial consulting organization. A second financing cycle starts on Thursday, with submissions invited through Nov. 15 on the program's Web site.
ArtPlace likens its role to providing venture capital, seeding projects that already enjoy strong local support and connecting with an area's development strategy to attract more private and public dollars. The endowment calls this approach ''creative placemaking,'' and has been promoting it for 20 years.
''We're doubling down on the investments a city has already made,'' said Carol Coletta, the president of ArtPlace.
