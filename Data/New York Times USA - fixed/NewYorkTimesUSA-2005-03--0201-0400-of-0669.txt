Republican Budget Plan Reins In Bush Tax Cuts
President Bush's plan to extend his tax cuts over the next five years ran into resistance in the Senate as Republican leaders, uneasy about the potential impact on the ballooning federal deficit, offered a budget for 2006 that would undo more than a fourth of the cuts that Mr. Bush has requested.
 The Senate's budget plan calls for $70.2 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, as opposed to the $100 billion the White House is seeking. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Bush Makes Renewed Push For Strategy On Energy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 9 

 BODY:
President Bush tried on Wednesday to reinvigorate his administration's energy strategy, promising to overcome the obstacles Democrats and environmental groups have mounted to drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge and saying it was time to start building more nuclear power plants.
 Mr. Bush's renewed push, during a one-day visit to the Battelle Memorial Institute here to view an array of new energy technologies, was a rare departure from his almost daily lobbying for his No.1 domestic priority: remaking the Social Security system. But his energy and environmental initiatives have suffered several setbacks in Congress, including the defeat on Wednesday by a Senate committee of Mr. Bush's antipollution legislation, which critics argued did not go far enough. 
 The White House said Wednesday afternoon that it planned to announce regulations on Thursday that would effectively put part of the defeated legislation into place. And Senate Republicans are moving this week to maneuver a vote on drilling in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, that would not be subject to a Democratic filibuster.
 ''We could recover move than $10 billion of oil from a small corner of ANWR that was reserved specifically for energy development,'' Mr. Bush said to applause. ''That's the same amount of new oil we could get from 41 states combined.'' 
 Many of those 41 states, officials later acknowledged, have no known oil reserves.
 Mr. Bush argued that the drilling operation would involve 2,000 acres of the vast refuge, or ''the size of the Columbus airport.'' He said the project would have ''almost no impact on land or local wildlife,'' a point that environmental groups sharply dispute. The president was introduced by Samuel W. Bodman, the new secretary of energy, who toured the Alaska refuge last weekend with some Senate Republicans and Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton.
 Mr. Bush's visit to Battelle, whose work includes new energy technologies and top-secret Defense Department contracts on ways to defend against germ weapons, was intended to demonstrate his commitment to energy conservation. In the past, the president has taken prototypes of hydrogen-powered cars onto the South Lawn of the White House, and he mentioned the promise of that technology again at Battelle. He said he saw technology ''so that we can build the world's first coal-fueled zero-emission power plant,'' and he pointed to federally financed efforts to convert coal into a clean-burning gas.
 Politically, White House aides say, such visits help defend Mr. Bush against accusations that his administration is more interested in drilling than conserving. Mr. Bush argued anew on Wednesday that he needed to do both, though many of his administration's plans to exploit new sources of energy are immediate and the new conservation technologies will take years. He also talked about producing ethanol and biodiesel fuels, subjects that usually get the most attention during primaries in the Midwest. 
 Mr. Bush rarely discussed nuclear power in last year's campaign, but he noted on Wednesday that ''America hasn't ordered a nuclear power plant since the 1970's, and it's time to start building again.''
 He has several proposals under way, supported by the nuclear industry, to encourage new plants, and the administration is supporting an International Themonuclear Experimental Reactor that has become a source of competition between France and Japan, both of which want to be the site of the multi-billion-dollar project.
 The driving force behind a national energy policy in the White House has been Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed the panel that initially set the administration's course -- and became the first source of arguments about the secrecy of the Bush White House. There is still some mystery about industry's role in developing the proposals Mr. Cheney's group endorsed. But there has been little mystery about the direction the administration wants to head.
 Mr. Bush tried during his visit to Ohio to draw on the main arguments he employs in selling a consistent tax policy to promote his energy plan. Companies and financial markets, he said, would be reluctant to invest if they feared that energy supplies could run short.
 ''All these uncertainties about energy supply are a drag on our economy,'' he said. ''It is difficult for entrepreneurs to risk capital when they cannot predict the size of next month's energy bill.''
 Referring to the blackout in the summer of 2003, Mr. Bush added, ''It's hard to plan with confidence if you're not sure the lights are going to stay on.''

HEADLINE: Bush-Backed Emissions Bill Fails to Reach Senate Floor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9 

 BODY:
Efforts to pass a bill to control power-plant emissions crumbled in the Senate on Wednesday amid charges of partisan intransigence. The day's developments sidelined -- and possibly doomed -- action this year on the legislative centerpiece of President Bush's environmental policy.
 As a result of a 9-to-9 vote by the Environment and Public Works Committee, the bill, which deals with sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury, will not advance to the full Senate. Committee leaders have been trying for more than a month to break the deadlock on the measure, known as the Clear Skies Act of 2005, which generally reflected a split along party lines. 
 Much of the debate over the bill conveyed stark differences between Republicans and Democrats over how to balance environmental improvement and economic stability. The complicated measure would affect 1,300 power plants across the country, the fuels they use, the number of workers they hire and consumer costs -- not to mention air quality.
 On environmental issues, the sides differed on two major points: whether or even how the first significant overhaul of the Clean Air Act in 15 years should address carbon dioxide and whether the goals of the bill represented a weakening or enhancement of the Clear Air Act.
 Supporters said the bill, which they said would have cut power-plant emissions by 70 percent, would help bring most of the country into compliance with federal air quality standards by 2016. They also said that by setting specific standards, the measure would end costly lawsuits that inevitably test any new environmental initiative.
 Opponents argued that the measure did not go far enough or fast enough to cut emissions. They also said the bill would ultimately prove inadequate if it did not also curb emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that many scientists say accounts for global warming.
 President Bush made passage of this legislation a priority when it was first introduced in 2002. Speaking Wednesday on energy policy in Columbus, Ohio, he did not mention the vote, saying, ''To protect the environment, to protect jobs here in Ohio and around our country, Congress needs to get a good Clear Skies bill to my desk now.''
 He did allude to new emission-reduction regulations for the eastern half of the country that the Environmental Protection Agency is about to issue, saying, ''This'll help you.'' Rules covering sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are to be released Thursday and those for mercury are expected next Thursday. 
 ''These rules provide some of the same benefits as Clear Skies,'' he added. ''But they are not a substitute for effective legislation.''
 Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the environment committee, said the bill was ''killed by the environmental extremists who care more about continuing the litigation-friendly status quo and making a political statement on CO2 than they do about reducing air pollution.''
 Mr. Inhofe, who considers global warming ''a hoax,'' predicted that the full Senate would not support caps on carbon dioxide, asserting that Democrats were determined not to allow a Republican president a major environmental victory. 
 Democrats, he said, were ''putting a far-left political fund-raising effort over the health and well-being of America's children and our nation's environment.'' 
 Mr. Inhofe was joined by the eight other Republicans on the committee in voting for the bill.
 But Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who is the committee's ranking member, said that the Clear Skies bill ''is no compromise; it's a giant step backward.''
 Mr. Jeffords, who joined seven Democrats and Senator Lincoln Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, in opposing the bill, added, ''This bill allows giant corporate utilities to avoid compliance and stops the enforcement of our existing clean air laws.''
 This was Mr. Inhofe's fourth bid to move the Clear Skies bill to the full Senate. Three previous committee votes were postponed when a tie seemed certain and committee members expressed a willingness to negotiate a compromise. Leading the efforts were two friends from their days as governors, Senator George V. Voinovich, an Ohio Republican who co-sponsored the bill with Mr. Inhofe, and Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware. They met nine times since early February to narrow differences.
 The talks ended after Mr. Voinovich said Republican compromises received no Democratic response, and Mr. Carper said his requests for more timely data from the Environmental Protection Agency were ignored.
 ''How would you like to find yourself in the ring with nobody to box?'' Mr. Voinovich asked after the vote. ''We've spent hours in conversations, and all I get is silence. If they're sincere, they should come back and say, 'Here's what we'll do.'''
 Mr. Carper, as well as other committee Democrats, said they sought more information, including a detailed environmental and economic analysis of the Clear Skies bill and several competing bills, before they would address Republican concerns.
 ''I love George like a brother,'' Mr. Carper said. ''But this is a steeper learning curve for me, and it's more complicated when E.P.A. doesn't respond.''
 Mr. Carper and others expressed optimism that a compromise might be reached later this year, but Mr. Voinovich said it could happen only if Democrats acknowledged the Republican compromises and softened their stance.
 ''As far as I'm concerned, we're nowhere,'' Mr. Voinovich said. ''Until something comes back, I'm not going to spend any more time on it.''

HEADLINE: When the King of New York Was the King of Corruption

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

'Boss Tweed'
'The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'
By Kenneth D. Ackerman
Illustrated. 464 pages. Carroll & Graf Publishers. $27.
 The imposing marble building at 52 Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan, recently converted into the headquarters for the Department of Education, has long been one of the city's great marvels, and not for its architecture. Built as a courthouse, it was budgeted at $250,000 in 1858, when the first plans were drawn up, but between 1862 and 1870 the city poured as much as $12 million into its construction, or something like $240 million in current dollars.
 Officially, the building was the New York County Courthouse, but New Yorkers then and now know it as the Tweed Courthouse, in honor of William M. Tweed, the political boss of bosses, who turned its construction into a private enrichment scheme for himself and his cronies and who, in the years after the Civil War, made New York politics a byword for shameless corruption. As the head of Tammany Hall, the Democratic political machine, and commissioner of public works, he dispensed patronage, bought and sold political appointments, rigged elections, controlled judges, paid off the press and looted the city treasury. He had a high old time doing it, too. 
 In ''Boss Tweed,'' Kenneth D. Ackerman, a freelance historian who has written two books on the Gilded Age, chronicles Tweed's rise and fall, from his early days as the head of a volunteer fire company to his reign as the city's undisputed political overlord, a position that he abused with gusto until chronic overreaching finally brought him down, undone by a disgruntled former associate who turned over incriminating documents to The New York Times. 
 ''Boss Tweed,'' although erratically narrated and poorly organized, manages to get the job done, in large part because Mr. Ackerman has his hands on a terrific story with compelling characters. Tweed, of course, is worth his weight in gold. He was a natural politician, a gregarious, good-natured backslapper who, by handing out jobs and charity, earned the love and loyalty of the lower orders, especially the Irish immigrants despised by the city's establishment. He was, in one description, ''a hearty boon companion, a lover of his friends and generous to 'the boys.'''
 He stole shamelessly and flaunted his wealth, setting up multiple, richly decorated residences and traveling by private yacht or private railway car. At six feet and nearly 300 pounds, he was physically imposing and a cartoonist's dream. Thomas Nast, whose caricatures in Harper's Weekly helped turn the tide against Tweed, depicted him with an enormous stomach, an oversize diamond pinned to his shirt, and, in one cartoon, a moneybag instead of a head.
 Mr. Ackerman draws vivid portraits of the inner circle known as the Tweed Ring, a grasping, venal crew led by the mayor, A. Oakey Hall, a man fond of stylish clothes and execrable puns. (After breaking a leg, he wrote in a letter, ''In every way I realize I am like poor France -- disordered -- and especially in the Bonapartes.'') ''Elegant Oakey,'' as his friends called him, was a lightweight. The truly dirty work went to Richard (Slippery Dick) Connolly, the city comptroller, and the sullen, publicity-shy parks commissioner, Peter B. Sweeny. 
 The Tweed Ring siphoned off millions from public-works projects and sales of city bonds. Favored contractors kicked back a hefty percentage of the inflated bills that they submitted, often for work that was never done or for materials never purchased. Tweed himself made several fortunes buying real estate on streets scheduled for improvements and by making his own company the city's official printer.
 The city tolerated Tweed, for a time, because the economy was booming. Manufacturing was up, Wall Street was on a roll and property values, in part because of the city's ambitious public works projects, were soaring. ''It seemed like a great free ride, especially for the banks and brokerage houses making huge commissions on the bond sales,'' Mr. Ackerman writes. ''Tweed economics -- borrow, spend and keep some for yourself -- made sense to New Yorkers. Even the poor benefited.''
 Leo Hershkowitz, in his 1977 revisionist history, ''Tweed's New York: A Closer Look,'' argued that Tweed was in fact a kind of hero who enfranchised the working man, helped create some of the city's greatest public works and institutions and, in the end, took the fall for the crimes of others. It is one of the weaknesses of ''Boss Tweed'' that Mr. Ackerman, who clearly disagrees with this view, never addresses the argument directly (or, for that matter, ever explains in what way Tweed ''conceived the soul of modern New York,'' as the book's subtitle has it). 
 Eventually, as the Ring grew ever greedier, the city's economy felt the pinch. Between 1869 and 1871, New York's debt tripled, to $97 million from $36.3 million, with interest payments alone approaching $10 million a year. Foreign investors began looking askance at New York bonds, especially when The New York Times, in 1870, began a relentless campaign attacking Tweed and the Ring.
 Just why the newspaper chose to take on the Ring remains unclear. Initially, it had no damning evidence, only deep suspicions. That changed in July 1871 when a Tammany insider with a grudge dropped off a sheaf of documents at the newspaper's offices on Park Row. They contained the paper trail linking Tweed and his cronies to phony bills and vouchers totaling $6.3 million. The Times presented the information in loving detail, while Nast turned out one acid-etched cartoon after another. The days of the Boss were numbered. Indictment, conviction and prison followed.
 Even as his cronies fled to foreign parts or cut deals with the prosecution, Tweed remained good-humored and unrepentant. He played the game of New York politics fair and square, which is to say, he stole with both hands but always kept his word when it came time to spread the money around to his followers and flunkies. ''The fact is New York politics were always dishonest -- long before my time,'' he said in a jailhouse interview. ''There never was a time you couldn't buy the Board of Aldermen.'' A politician, he added, ''takes things as they are.''
 Tweed and his well-oiled political machine provided the model for big-city bosses for generations to come, and, crooked though he was, he remains in many ways a tremendously appealing figure. Mr. Ackerman has it right when he writes, ''Except for his stealing, Tweed would have been a great man; but then had he been honest, he wouldn't have been Tweed and would not have left nearly so great a mark.''

HEADLINE: Talk in Japan Shakes Dollar And Treasuries

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER; Todd Zaun contributed reporting from Tokyo for this article.

 BODY:
The dollar fell and Treasury yields rose yesterday after the Japanese prime minister made remarks that suggested the country's central bank could be shifting some of its huge reserves out of dollars and Treasury securities.
 Japan's Ministry of Finance quickly denied there was any change, a statement that limited the fall of the dollar and bolstered Treasury prices. But the volatile reactions in the markets underscore that the dollar, already under pressure from the drag of the United States' record current-account deficit, has another issue that could weigh on it in the future.
 ''There is a heightened sensitivity to anything that smacks of reserve reallocation,'' said Robert Sinche, global head of currency strategy at Bank of America. 
 Indeed, the comments from the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, came less than a month after reports, later denied, that the central bank of South Korea was planning to move some of its reserve holdings out of dollars and into other currencies. Even after the denial, those reports roiled the currency markets, and the dollar fell 1.5 percent against the euro and 1.4 percent against the yen on Feb. 22. 
 Yesterday, the dollar slipped as much as 0.4 percent against the euro and 0.1 percent against the yen. Late in trading, the euro was valued at $1.3424, with the dollar down 0.1 percent, and the dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen, at 104.02 yen. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which jumped to 4.56 percent, finished the day at 4.50 percent, down from 4.52 percent on Wednesday.
 The suggestion of diversification from dollars has put the focus on the role of Asian central banks in the performance of the dollar and Treasury securities.
 China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan together hold 56 percent of the Treasury securities owned by foreigners. Many of those securities are held by their central banks. So any significant shift of their reserves out of dollars could spell trouble for both the American currency and the bond market.
 Steven Englander, chief foreign exchange strategist for the Americas at Barclays Capital, said he did not expect such a shift ''in a dramatic way'' by these Asian central banks. But, he said, ''everyone is thinking about it and that will weigh on the foreign exchange and bond markets.''
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said a shift out of dollars by foreign central banks and foreign private investors should be expected at some time, although he has not said it would necessarily be disruptive.
 In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations yesterday, Mr. Greenspan said that official and private foreign investors ''will at some point choose greater balance in their asset accumulation.'' 
 Another emerging issue is what happens when China, which is being pressured by the United States and other countries to allow its currency to trade freely, moves away from pegging the yuan to the dollar.
 To maintain the present peg, China has to sell yuan for dollars as the American currency weakens, building up huge dollar reserves, most of which are invested in Treasuries. Other Asian countries, including Japan and South Korea, have done the same so that their currencies stay competitive with the yuan.
 Many analysts expect a small move toward delinking in the next 12 months that would allow for an increase of 3 percent to 5 percent in the value of the yuan. This could mean that China and other Asian countries would have less need to build up dollar reserves and, therefore, less need to invest in United States Treasury securities.
 If this led to lower dollar reserves and a decline in central bank investments in the Treasury market, some analysts argue that the impact on the American market would depend on how attractive it would be at that time to invest in the United States.
 If inflation was contained, economic growth was steady and the current-account and federal budget deficits were improving, attracting private money to replace a slowdown in investment by central banks would not be difficult. That would reduce any downward pressure on the dollar and upward pressure on Treasury yields.
 Mr. Englander said that ''a lot depends on how China delinks.''
 ''The odds are it's going to be a mini-delink, rather than a maxi-delink,'' he said, which would minimize the impact on the dollar and the Treasury market.
 Others argue that central banks would not want to do anything precipitous because that would be bad for global financial markets and could hurt the competitiveness of their own currencies. 
 ''They don't want to disrupt the markets,'' said William Davison, head of the Hartford's fixed-income mutual funds.
 Mr. Sinche at Bank of America said it was in China's interest to move slowly in ending the yuan's link to the dollar, and that would mean that any other central banks in Asia that want to shift reserves out of the dollar would have to move slowly. 
 Mr. Sinche also played down Mr. Koizumi's remarks as an indication of a new plan for reserves.
 He said the comments, which were made before a parliamentary committee, were not an answer to a question on whether central bank reserves should be shifted, but regarded what should be done about the unrealized loss Japan's central bank has on its reserves. Since the loss is a result of a decline in the value of the dollar, an obvious political answer is to mention moving reserves out of dollars.
 Mr. Koizumi told Japanese lawmakers that as a general rule ''it's necessary to diversify the investment destinations,'' according to Bloomberg News. He added that he also believed it was important to consider ''what's profitable and what's stable'' when deciding where to hold foreign reserves. 
 Finance Ministry officials responded quickly to counter Mr. Koizumi's remarks, saying they had no plans to shift the reserves into other currencies. ''At present, we have no plans to change the currency makeup'' of Japan's foreign exchange reserves, Koichi Hosokawa, a vice minister of finance, told reporters.
 Kamal Sharma, senior currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London, said, ''I personally don't believe we'll ever get to a point where Asian central banks will not hold the dollar as the major international reserve currency.''

HEADLINE: Sign of Growth As Inventories Surge Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Wholesale inventories rose 1.1 percent in January, almost twice as much as expected, led by increased supplies of metals and cars, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
 The increase, which followed a gain of 0.4 percent in December, brought the value of inventories to $331.9 billion.
 Wholesale sales in January rose for a record 20th consecutive month, and the ratio of inventory to sales was near historic lows. A buildup in stockpiles is likely to reinforce expectations that the economy will grow faster this quarter than at the end of 2004. 
 ''I view the solid growth in inventories and sales in January and the low ratio of inventories to sales as a sign that this is an intentional buildup,'' said Mike Englund, chief economist with Action Economics in Boulder, Colo. ''It says firms know that their sales are increasing.''
 Wholesalers account for about one-fourth of business inventories. Retailers and factories hold the rest.
 Wholesalers' inventories of durable goods, which include cars and computers, rose 1.3 percent in January after rising 0.3 percent the previous month. The increase was led by gains of 2.2 percent for automobiles and parts and for metals.
 Inventories of nondurable goods rose 0.7 percent in January, led by farm products, paper, oil and chemicals, after rising 0.5 percent in December. Sales of nondurable goods rose 1.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent.
 Higher prices for oil may have contributed to the rise in the value of inventories.
 Peter Schaffer, chief executive of the Case Paper Company in Harrison, N.Y., said his inventory was up 10 percent from a year ago. He said he bought glossy paper at the end of the year when prices were favorable, while the commercial printers and publishers who buy from him prefer to keep supplies lean.
 Also yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing first-time unemployment compensation claims rose by 17,000 for the week that ended March 5, reaching 327,000, the highest since Jan. 8.
 The four-week average of claims, a less volatile measure, increased to 312,500 from 306,750, which was the lowest in more than four years.
 ''The labor market's not tight but it's tightening,'' said Roger Kubarych, a former Federal Reserve economist who is now a senior economic adviser at HVB America Inc. in New York. ''The four-week moving average is a terrific number, and this report is not inconsistent with the gradual-improvement story in the labor market.''

HEADLINE: Behind Scenes, Israelis Press for Syria to Leave Lebanon

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 10 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has asked Israeli officials, including the foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to restrict public comments on the politics of Lebanon in order not to give ammunition to Syria and its main supporter there, Hezbollah, in their struggle with the Lebanese opposition, Israeli officials said Thursday. 
 But in private, Israeli officials are making no secret of their desire to see Syria out of Lebanon, and there is a new note of optimism here about the fresh problems that Syria's weakness causes for Hezbollah.
 A consensus has emerged among the Israeli political and strategic elite that the days of Syrian-sponsored stability in Lebanon are over. The Israeli view is that Hezbollah, which is financed and supplied by Iran and Syria, would be more weakened by a Syrian withdrawal than restrained by a continuing Syrian presence. 
 Hezbollah is Israel's main concern. Not only does the group represent Shiite interests opposed to Israel's existence and to a possible peace treaty with the Palestinians; Hezbollah forces, with more than 10,000 Syrian-supplied rockets, line Israel's northern border and, Israeli intelligence believes, finance suicide bombers in the West Bank.
 Until the last year or so, Israeli officials say, the consensus was different. Syria, with its reputation for keeping its treaties, was viewed as an agent for stability, especially in southern Lebanon, which Hezbollah controls, often from fortifications built by Israel before the former prime minister Ehud Barak pulled out of Lebanon completely in 2000.
 ''The idea was that the Syrians are awful, but they provide an address if something goes wrong and represent the status quo,'' a senior Israeli official said. ''But the dominant paradigm has now changed. The status quo Syria represents is no longer a stable one.'' 
 Another official acknowledged there was ''some apprehension about Syria leaving Lebanon, but it's a calculated risk one has to take to weaken Hezbollah.'' Hezbollah has been forced to take a pro-Syrian -- and thus anti-Lebanese -- stand, the official said, adding: ''By distancing Syria from Lebanon, by loosening its grip to some extent, this will definitely hurt Hezbollah. It won't wither away, but it will lose potent support.''
 Israel sees Hezbollah and Iran ''as practically synonymous,'' the official said, while Syria served as an Iranian ally in the locality, able to supply Hezbollah with weapons and money. ''Syria was able to stop any activity of Hezbollah in Lebanon at will, which is why Israel trusted Syria,'' the official continued. ''But Syria used Hezbollah for its own purposes, to drive us out of Lebanon. And it was happy for Iran to supply Hezbollah for that purpose.'' 
 But Hezbollah's open support for Syria is likely to hurt it as a political party, the Israelis say. At the same time, given the group's close connections to Iran, there is little reason to believe Hezbollah is going to abandon militancy and terrorism for pure politics. 
 Iran is nervous, too, the officials said. Iran sees Israel as an ideological enemy and a regional rival that is pushing the United States and Europe to try to deny Iran nuclear weaponry and destroy the Iranian revolution. ''Iran's gun against Israel is Hezbollah in southern Lebanon,'' a military intelligence official said. 
 Eran Lehrman, a former Israeli intelligence officer who directs the Israel office of the American Jewish Committee, said the Israeli elite was traditionally divided along the same lines as Washington -- the stability-seekers versus those who seek profound change.
 ''You can find people who think that Syria is more or less handling Lebanon,'' he said, ''so we have an address if something goes wrong, and others who think that if Lebanon becomes Lebanon with a capital L, there is a chance for real change -- that it might be able to extend its control to its own borders, rather than being held hostage to Iranian-Syrian tactics versus Israel.''
 Israel blames Syria for the recent assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, Mr. Lehrman said. ''Hariri understood that prosperity meant stability and no longer being hostage to the agenda of Hezbollah, Iran and Syria,'' he said. ''To the Syrians, Hariri was a foreign agent working with the United States and France to create the U.N. resolution calling on Syria to leave Lebanon and forcing it on Syria's neighbors. That's enough to get you killed in Syria's neighborhood.''
 That the killing of Mr. Hariri served only to increase pressure on Syria to leave Lebanon misses the point, he added. ''Sometimes stupidity needs no other explanation,'' he said, and the new Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, is considered much weaker than his late father.
 But Syria has interests in Lebanon that will make it very difficult to leave, said Michael B. Oren, a historian with the conservative Shalem Center here. 
 ''Syria needs income from the Lebanese economy and drug-smuggling, which brings in as much as $4 billion a year,'' Mr. Oren said. ''Hezbollah allowed Syria to have a quiet border with us on the Golan Heights and an active, combative border with us in Lebanon. Until Barak, the assumption was that we had to give back the Golan to make peace with Lebanon. But now that syllogism is being deconstructed, which makes Syria and Hezbollah very anxious.''

HEADLINE: Who Owns the Views?

BYLINE: By ANN COLIN HERBST

 BODY:
WHEN Meryl and Sidney Schwartz, 71-year-old retirees, decided to develop the five-acre parcel of land next to their vacation home in Richmond, Mass., they never expected to become locked in a bitter two-year battle with the town's Conservation Commission. So far, the conflict over their project has cost the Schwartzes $25,000 by their own estimate, with their builder spending an additional $40,000. 
 Already, the Schwartzes' proposal has been scaled down from two homes to one; the designs have been redrawn at least a dozen times; and the storm-water management plan has reached such a level of complexity and expense that James M. Scalise II, the engineer who devised it, calls it ''the kind of thing I would normally design for a Wal-Mart, not a private home.'' 
 And the project is still awaiting approval by the Conservation Commission; a yes vote is expected at a hearing to be held on Tuesday night.
 The cause of all the controversy is a little-known environmental regulation called the Berkshire Scenic Mountain Act, a bill passed by the Massachusetts State Legislature and adopted by the town of Richmond in 1974 to protect its watershed resources and preserve the scenic qualities of the mountainous area. Towns are not required to comply with the act, and only 4 of the 31 towns in the Berkshires have adopted it. 
 In Richmond, landowners who hope to build in a protected mountainous zone must meet a number of guidelines: Their projects must not be visible above the ridge line, tree-cutting must be limited to one-quarter of an acre and it cannot cause erosion or flooding that would damage water quality. 
 Town officials said that the proposal by the Schwartzes failed on all three counts. The couple countered that the Conservation Commission has been overzealous in its enforcement. 
 Richmond is only one of a number of towns across the country with a large population of second-home owners where these kinds of conflicts are playing out. As land grows scarce in popular weekend communities, the forces of development are increasingly coming up against preservationists trying to protect the verdant hillsides, pristine streams and woodland vistas that drew vacationers in the first place. Although there is no tally of similar zoning restrictions nationwide, ordinances that restrict hillside building are fairly common, particularly in western ski towns like Sun Valley, Idaho; Park City, Utah; and Jackson Hole, Wyo. 
 But unlike the Berkshire Scenic Mountain Act, the regulations typically found in the West do not link mountaintop protection to wetlands conservation, a fact that makes those rules easier to interpret and thus to enforce.
 In Salt Lake City, for example, open space legislation put into effect in 1994 to limit urban sprawl restricts building in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains, citing the need to protect the visual qualities of the mountains themselves. The scenic views are considered an economic asset and a tourist attraction, said Deeda Seed, communications director for Mayor Rocky Anderson. 
 As second-home ownership continues to grow -- statistics released last week by the National Association of Realtors said 13 percent of all houses sold in 2004 were vacation homes, for a total of 1.02 million properties -- tensions are only likely to rise.
 ''The countryside is rife with conflicts over the use of land now that agricultural land is less productive,'' said Alexander von Hoffman, a senior fellow at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies in Cambridge, Mass. ''The other force is that with the affluence created over the last 20 years, Americans are willing and able to indulge their love of rural scenery.''
 Indeed, according to a study of second-home ownership by Professor von Hoffman's colleagues at Harvard, second homes account for about 5 percent of all residences in the United States. Their density in the Northeast is much higher. As of 1990, one-fifth of all second homes in the United States were concentrated in only 20 counties, most of which were in Florida or near the Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia or Phoenix metropolitan areas. Half of all second homes in the country were found in a mere 150 counties in those areas. Such a high concentration in such a small number of towns sets the stage for particularly ugly showdowns, like the one in Richmond, where nearly one-quarter of all homes are seasonal. 
 Although this is the first challenge to the Scenic Mountain Act in the Berkshires, these tensions are common all over the region as popular second-home communities strive to balance environmental and aesthetic concerns with the desire of new homeowners to build ever grander private residences. In Monterey, Mass., one letter writer complained to the local paper of trophy houses that ''hang from the hills like so many Dracula's castles.'' A bit farther south, in Lakeville, Conn., plans to build a large lakeside home on the site of a much smaller structure led to cries of ''Hamptonization'' on the part of town residents, although the house was eventually built. 
 In Richmond, the dispute has matched neighbor against neighbor; town meetings have been reduced to shouting matches; and the Scenic Mountain Act itself has become a political lightning rod.
 It has also served to reveal the fault line that has long run invisibly between the town's full- and part-time residents. Mr. Schwartz says that the seven-member commission is biased against second-home owners. ''It's a clear case of nimby-ism,'' he said. ''They have a stake, and they don't want anyone else to have one.'' 
 For her part, Holly Stover, the chairwoman of the Conservation Commission, has suggested that native Richmond residents are better stewards of the land than newcomers. ''The owners are part-time, with not the same interest as the town,'' she said, speaking of the Schwartzes. ''Their neighbors are full-timers who were brought up in Richmond. Their grandparents and grandparents' grandparents lived here all their lives.''
 The Schwartzes and Kurt Hoelter, their builder, first applied to the commission for a building permit in July 2003. Their initial plan was to build two houses with a shared driveway set into a plateau on the hillside. This plan was immediately unpopular with the Schwartzes' neighbors, because of the placement of the driveway. For that reason, in 2004, the project site was moved closer to Osceola Road and reduced to a single house on 2.5 acres, with the other plot to be donated to a local land-conservation group for tax purposes, a solution that muted most of the community opposition. 
 BUT the Conservation Commission still refused to grant a building permit, citing concerns about drainage and flooding from storm water runoff that might damage wells and springs below the site. The committee also suspected that the plan would require more clear-cutting on the site than Mr. Hoelter originally contended and that the blasting might disturb the water table, which is unusually shallow in that area of Richmond.
 ''We didn't think the heavy machinery could even come down the hill safely to dig the trench,'' Ms. Stover said. At the next meeting, the Hoelter-Scalise team proposed new plans: one to deal with runoff during construction, another to address landscaping issues previously raised by the committee in earlier meetings. But they were still refused.
 After nearly a year of fruitless negotiation with the town, Mr. Hoelter appealed to the state, the first time a challenge has been filed since the Scenic Mountain Act took effect. The case went to the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, which last fall ordered another round of talks between the sides. The commission's most recent conditions, sent to Mr. Hoelter in January after a tense public hearing in December, place 15 restrictions on the project, including the length of time that soil can be exposed at the construction site, the height and placement of outdoor lighting, and even the color paint that must be used on the finished house in perpetuity (earthy tones of brown, gray or green are specified). It also lays out 60 general conditions for mountainside developments. Ms. Stover said that the guidelines would prevent erosion and make the finished house less visible. 
 And even though Mr. Hoelter and the Schwartzes are expected to accept the restrictions at the coming meeting, Mr. Hoelter worried that some of the provisions exceeded the purview of the Scenic Mountain Act. ''It becomes a land-taking issue,'' he said, noting that the Schwartzes have paid taxes on their property as a buildable lot for the last 30 years. 
 The case has highlighted several unforeseen consequences of this kind of environmental law. In Monterey, Mass., where the legislation was adopted two years ago, clear-cutting accelerated in the months before the law took effect, as developers raced to prepare lots while they still could. And as buildable land becomes scarcer in areas protected by this kind of law, the cost of housing rises substantially, forcing many local families out of the housing market entirely. 
 Indeed, across the country, opposition to environmental regulations like the Scenic Mountain Act is growing. The Colorado Northern Front Range Mountain Backdrop Protection Study Act, a bill introduced by Rep. Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, that would have prohibited development in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, failed to pass in the 108th Congress. In November in Oregon, a state that has some of the strictest environmental protection in the nation, voters passed Ballot Measure 37, which provides compensation or exemptions to property owners whose investments have been hurt by restrictive zoning. 
 Even though Richmond is already one of the most expensive towns in the Berkshires, Mr. Hoelter says that the opposition to his project may backfire on Osceola Road. With all the costs associated with getting the project approved, the house that will eventually be built there is more likely to look like ''cheeseburger than filet mignon,'' he said.
 And Ms. Stover agreed that a house at that site would be much less visible to neighbors if it were set back on a plateau, as in Mr. Hoelter's quickly rejected original plan. 
 But whatever the final aesthetics of the place, along with the Scenic Mountain Act, it's something the neighbors will have to live with for a very long time.

HEADLINE: Five Years After the Bubble, Have Its Lessons Been Forgotten?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
FIVE years later, the great bubble of 2000 does not look so bad. The conventional wisdom now is that it was not all that important, certainly nothing like the great bubbles of 20th-century stock market history, those of the United States in 1929 and Japan in 1989.
 But there are similarities indicating that it could be a very long time before technology stocks as a group become good long-term investments again.
 First, look at the differences. In 1929, the world economy entered the Great Depression. In 1990, Japan began a long period of poor economic performance. It was not a depression, but there has yet to be a period of sustained growth there since the end of the bubble. 
 The United States bubble in 2000 was different both in breadth and in economic impact. That bubble did not infect the entire stock market, but instead was concentrated in technology stocks, with a lesser bubble in the largest stocks, the ones that dominated the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks. The economic aftermath included only a mild recession and a slow recovery.
 When the bubble was at its peak, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, turned aside advice, some of it from this column, that he should do something to restrain the speculation. He offered a confident forecast that if and when the bubble did burst, he would know what to do to minimize the damage. And he seems to have been right, even if some fear that superlow interest rates simply created another bubble, this one in home prices.
 The image of a bubble bursting is not a perfect one. Any child knows that soap bubbles blown into the air seem to float along, and then suddenly vanish. They do not shrink, and they do not reinflate. 
 But the history of stock market bubbles is different. Charles P. Kindleberger, the M.I.T. economist whose book ''Manias, Panics and Crashes'' remains the best work on the subject, notes that the path down from a peak is neither sudden nor straight. Instead, investors come back to be disappointed time and again. When all are dismayed, prices can be low enough to prompt another great bull market. But that can take a very long time.
 How long? Adjusted for inflation, the Dow Jones industrial average was below its 1929 peak in the early 1990's. (That calculation uses the consumer price index, which is by no means a perfect measure of inflation and is not adjusted to reflect dividend payments. But it provides a rough approximation of the purchasing power of a basket of stocks in different eras.)
 While many American stocks are higher than they were in 2000, the area where the frenzy was greatest remains low. Adjusted for inflation, the Nasdaq 100 is off about 70 percent from its peak. That performance is quite similar to the one turned in by the Dow industrials in the first five years after 1929, and worse than the performance of the Nikkei 225 after 1989. 
 When the stock market fell to its post-bubble lows in late 2002, there was much talk that the lesson was that even if a technology is revolutionizing the world, the profits are more likely to go to those who use the technology than to those who develop it. Now investors are back buying hot technology stocks, and that lesson appears to be forgotten.
 That is perfectly consistent with the history of previous bubbles. The second five years after a historic high can produce some big gains, but they can also produce losses that wipe out those gains. Technology investing in the next five years may be more exciting than profitable.

HEADLINE: Collisions On Canvas That Still Make Noise

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Jean-Michel Basquiat's bristling, ugly-elegant, stream-of-consciousness art looked good in its 1992 retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art. It looks even stronger right now at the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition is not necessarily better; it may even be slightly weaker in selection and display. 
 But Basquiat's achievement, produced during a truncated but astoundingly prolific career, has the almost too classic prerequisites of greatness: an indelible yet infinitely flexible visual style that cannibalizes and extends the past, reflects its own time and stays fresh and relevant as it moves into the future. His achievement is especially pertinent in a moment when drawing rules the art mediums and graffiti variants are rampant; when figuration and Expressionism are part of the stylistic mix that younger artists take for granted, as they do political attitude; and when language and sound (thanks only partly to video) are as ubiquitous in art as paint on canvas.
 Basquiat, who flamed to the center of the overheated 1980's art scene with his first shows in 1981 and '82, was born in Brooklyn in 1960. His father was Haitian, his mother, Puerto Rican; he had a comfortably middle-class upbringing and determined early that he wanted to be famous. 
 He painted and drew from childhood, and was riveted by ''Gray's Anatomy,'' which his mother gave him when he was 7 and injured in a car accident. Labeled renderings of the human body, almost invariably black and male, became a staple of his art. He turned first to poetry; after leaving home at 17, his initial artistic forays, begun with a high school friend, Al Diaz, consisted of spray-painting buildings around SoHo and the Lower East Side with cryptic poems and aphorisms signed Samo (a compression of ''same old, same old''). He soon took to painting on scavenged surfaces: doors, windows, old boxes, football helmets.
 Basquiat quickly displayed precocious gifts for color, line, language and composition, bolstered by an underlying urgency. He made, in effect, elaborate loquacious ''letters to the world,'' in Emily Dickinson's words. In them, images and script, abstraction and representation, precision and incoherence, are improvised with dazzling speed into chattering, chanting, excoriating fields of competing ideas, information and emotions. 
 Like many artists of his generation -- among them, Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Tim Rollins and K.O.S., and Philip Taaffe -- he invented his own form of collage. He papered canvases with his drawings and, later, photocopies of drawings, before adding further layers of painting or more drawing. Unlike most, he had his own burning subject: blackness -- its glories, histories and pain -- and the gnawing burden of colonialism, slavery and discrimination.
 Possessed of an omnivorous curiosity and an unusual ability to absorb and condense information, Basquiat traced these themes across different cultures and times. African griots and masklike faces, like the furious visage in ''Melting Point of Ice''; Renaissance madonnas; Egyptian pharaohs; economic statistics -- all stream through his art. Most of all, his surfaces teem with references to black athletes, poets and jazz musicians, as suggested by titles like ''Hollywood Africans,'' ''Irony of the Negro Policeman'' and ''St. Joe Louis Surrounded by Snakes.''
 Charlie Parker, the jazz giant and Basquiat's signal hero, is repeatedly evoked. In ''Charles the First,'' a contrapuntal composition in black, white and blue, Basquiat lists ''Cherokee,'' one of Parker's recordings; outlines crude hands and a Superman logo; pays tribute to the brief life of Pree, Parker's daughter; gives a prominent place to his signature crown symbol (really just an extended W); and then faces facts: ''Most Young Kings Get Their Head Cut Off.'' On second thought, he draws a line through young, acting on a conviction that crossing out words made people look harder. 
 When he collaged drawings to his canvases, new layers of meaning and sudden jumps in scale became possible. ''Jesse,'' for example, is a field of seven mostly anatomical drawings with a big brusque open circle and intersecting bar painted on top. As we examine the background noise -- references to Parker, the Olympic runner Jesse Owens, and Crispus Attucks, the runaway slave who is considered the first casualty of the American Revolution, as well as tiny swastikas and phrases like ''a place to move Negroes'' -- the seemingly abstract circle turns sinister. It echoes a small but stark rendering of an esophagus, turning the bar into a violent, obstructing thing. 
 One of the least familiar works in the Brooklyn show is all circle: a thick disc of wood nearly nine feet across. Its matte-black surface is interrupted only by spare script and double concentric circles, in white chalk, that identify it as a monumental LP, specifically Parker's ''Now's the Time.''
 And it was. Basquiat worked like a demon for seven years and then died in 1988 from a drug habit, which was exacerbated by his success and by the death of his mentor, Andy Warhol. He was only 27. In both life and death he became a symbol of the 1980's accelerated cycle of success, excess and burnout.
 But his work is less emblematic of the period's evils than of the important changes brought about by the art of the 1980's.
 On different fronts and in several mediums, the young artists of the 80's sought to reshape 1970's Post-Minimalism for their own purposes. They sorted through its attenuated strategies for texts, photographs, narrative, performance, politics and process; many of them redirected its practices back into more robust art objects, most prominently painting.
 Basquiat accomplished this with rare power, physically rebuilding painting while keeping Post-Minimalism's tactics unusually intact. He proposed painting as a kind of total artwork. It wasn't literally environmental, but it forced the viewer into the hybrid experience of looking, reading, listening (with your inner ear) and at times even muttering under the breath to catch all the sights, references, rhythms and implicit sounds encompassed by his best works.
 In this, Basquiat followed the examples of Jackson Pollock and Cy Twombly in particular: he expanded the experience of painting into real time and space, rarely leaving the surface. Basquiat, too, made engrossing, consuming webs. Looking at his paintings, we sense the intense performance of making them, not as an Expressionistic process, but as a notational, seismographic record of the dodging feints his mind made in this, that and the other direction.
 Such mental remaking on the viewer's part is an element in the experience of all artworks, but Basquiat drew it out, making it extravagantly visible while maintaining its balance.
 The Brooklyn show opens with a Samo-style work executed on white board that exposes the spine of Basquiat's art: language and handwriting, specifically a blocky concise script so elegantly consistent it amounted to a personal typeface. ''Jimmy Best on His Back to the Suckerpunch of His Childhood Files,'' he writes, referring to a man laid low by his record as a juvenile offender. All the E's have been reduced to three short parallel bars that seem almost digital, yet also presage the staccato marks, grids and crosshatchings that would make Basquiat's brand of Expressionism seem implicitly angular and Cubist. 
 The centrality of language and writing is stated in undiluted terms at the Cheim & Read Gallery in Chelsea, in an excellent show of Basquiat drawings and paintings whose only images are words, names, lists and phrases. One nine-sheet work is simply a rewriting of the prolonged table of contents of ''Moby-Dick,'' suggesting a kind of poem.
 The Brooklyn show has a refreshing clarity: a chronological installation, white walls and so much space that the array of works sometimes looks stretched thin. The text panels in English, Spanish and French are helpful, audience-conscious and appropriate (Basquiat spoke or read all three languages), but also feel like padding. The inclusion of a few more of the paintings reproduced in the show's catalog would have made a big difference, but the openness encourages concentration.
 The show has been organized by four curators: Marc Mayer, a former deputy director at the museum and now director of the Musee d'Art Contemporain de Montreal; Franklin Sirmans, a critic and independent curator; Fred Hoffman, a former dealer who is a curatorial fellow at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles; and Kellie Jones, an assistant professor of art history and African-American studies at Yale.
 It's not clear why so many were required, but all contribute capably to the exhibition's catalog. Mr. Mayer sees Basquiat as the last modernist painter, an artist who reiterated its styles, sources and innovations in a final blaze of glory. Mr. Sirmans argues that Basquiat was a visual prophet of hip-hop, further amplifying the resonances of Basquiat's samplings, stuttering words and piled-up phrases. They suggest a D.J. hitting the same grooves again and again, as do the surfaces collaged with multiple photocopies of one drawing.
 Like hip-hop artists, Basquiat dealt with the social inequities of American society in ways that were vehemently engaged and available yet adamantly formal, and concerned with sensation and sheer, often irresistible aesthetic force. The inequities are still with us, but thankfully, so is the example of his force, and it feels stronger than ever.

''Basquiat'' is at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000, through June 5. ''Jean-Michel Basquiat: In Word Only'' is at Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-7727, through March 26.

HEADLINE: Dow and S.&P. Move Higher As Crude Oil Prices Fall

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks gained yesterday as a drop in oil prices relieved concerns about corporate profit margins. 
 Earnings from National Semiconductor exceeded expectations and lifted sentiment in the technology sector. 
 The outlook for technology stocks improved sharply after the closing bell, when Intel raised the midpoint of its first-quarter revenue forecast and lifted its target for profit margins. Shares of Intel ended regular trading at $24.85, up a penny. They jumped as high as $25.28 in after-hours trading. 
 ''This is great news for tech and the personal computer industry as a whole,'' said Steve Neimeth, portfolio manager at AIG SunAmerica, who oversees funds owning 200,000 shares of Intel. 
 ''I'd expect to see a rally in PC-related companies as well as semiconductor equipment companies.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 45.89 points, or 0.4 percent, to end regular trading at 10,851.51. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.24 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,209.25.
 The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.57 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,059.72. 
 National Semiconductor, which is in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, jumped $1.13, or 5.6 percent, to $21.12, after cost-cutting and a move to more profitable products helped its results come in ahead of Wall Street's expectations. 
 That gave a lift to chip stocks and helped limit the declines in the Nasdaq.
 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index rose 1.4 percent. 
 A drop in oil futures helped the wider market recover from a lackluster start. High oil prices crimp consumer spending and corporate profits, so a fall in the cost of crude generally helps stocks. 
 The April contract for crude oil settled down $1.23, to $53.54 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 ''No matter what oil does in terms of moves up and down during the day, I think we're seeing more people talk more about the potential economic impact of high oil prices,'' said John Caldwell, chief investment strategist at the McDonald Financial Group. ''Rising energy prices are a consumer problem.'' 
 Among gainers, General Motors was up 53 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $34.61. 
 G.M., the world's biggest automaker, unveiled a new incentive program that includes an extra $1,000 cash rebate on most vehicles that have been in inventory for 125 days or more, and $1,500 on most Cadillacs. 
 As oil prices slipped, ChevronTexaco fell $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.49; Exxon Mobil decreased 42 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $60.37; and ConocoPhillips declined $1.04, or 1 percent, to $105.56. 
 Among declining technology shares, EchoStar Communications, the satellite television service, fell $1.87, or 6 percent, to $28.72, after a report that it had started an internal accounting investigation and was the subject of a federal inquiry. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 14/32, to a price of 96 9/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.47 percent from 4.52 percent on Wednesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: China Reports Trade Surplus Of $11 Billion In 2 Months

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 10 

 BODY:
China reported a trade surplus of $11 billion in the first two months of this year, according to data released by the commerce ministry Thursday. 
 China's exports swelled to $95 billion in January and February, up 36 percent from the period a year earlier. Imports grew by 8 percent, to $84 billion. 
 ''The numbers suggest that this year's surplus will be a lot bigger,'' said Arthur Kroeber, managing editor of The China Economic Quarterly, referring to China's trade surplus of $32 billion last year.
 In recent years China has run trade deficits at the start of the year that turned into surpluses by the end of the year as factories turned imported raw materials and components into finished goods for export, he said.
 ''This year it seems to be different, and the surplus could be more than double last year's,'' Mr. Kroeber said. In the first two months of last year, China had a trade deficit of $8 billion.
 The prospect of growing trade imbalances with China is likely to heighten calls from the United States and other countries for Beijing to move more quickly to loosen its currency peg against the dollar. That policy makes China's goods cheaper compared with its competitors as the dollar falls in value.
 The Chinese government has repeatedly signaled it will not make any sudden moves on the currency. On Wednesday, China's finance minister, Jin Renqing, reinforced the point. 
 ''I think currently the yuan exchange rate is basically in tune with our level of economic development and export growth,'' he said.
 Despite continued high prices for oil, oil imports fell in the first two months of the year, suggesting that the government's policies to lower investment are having an effect, according to several economists.
 Since last year, China's central government has sought to cool overheating in industrial and commercial growth by restricting land, credit and administrative approvals for new factories and commercial buildings. 
 ''It's clear the central government macroeconomic measures have been having an impact,'' said an economist at the State Council Information Center, a government research group, who declined to be identified. ''But we also have to bear in mind that imports this time last year were really huge, especially with the rise in oil prices, so today's import numbers are a little unrepresentative.''
 In the first two months of 2004, China's imports grew 42 percent, fed by strong demand for oil, steel and minerals.
 But this January, China's crude oil import volumes were down 24 percent from the year earlier, and rolled steel was down 41 percent, he noted.
 While domestic investment has cooled, China's exports have continued to surge.
 Details of the February trade figures were unavailable, but recent data suggest much of that export growth has been in textiles and garments, shoes, plastic products, electronic goods, computers and mobile telephones. 
 China's overall exports of garments in January grew 33 percent, compared with January 2004, according to China's garment trade association.

HEADLINE: Vieques, Far From the Lounge-Chair Crowd

BYLINE: By PABLEAUX JOHNSON

DATELINE: VIEQUES, P.R. 

 BODY:
THE iguana looked up from the asphalt but didn't seem to be in much of a hurry. As the jeep idled at the rural intersection, the five-foot lizard licked the wind and seemed to weigh its options. On the one hand, it had a familiar patch of perfectly warmed pavement; on the other, a gigantic machine threatened quick destruction as it blocked out the sun. 
 In the mind of this lizard, the only appropriate response to imminent death seemed to be a profound, abiding indifference. 
 This was not a demonstration of razor-sharp survival instincts you see on the nature shows, the quick ''fight or flight'' reaction destined to save a species. The iguana weighed its options with all the urgency of an overweight cabbie on a smoking break. 
 The classic confrontation of nature versus machine lasted about 10 seconds, with the frill-backed reptile eventually yielding the roadway. With a roll of the eyes and lethargic waddle, the iguana disappeared into the roadside mesquite thicket where it probably stashed its pack of cigarettes and beanbag ashtray. 
 On the tiny Puerto Rican island of Vieques, the roadside fauna are constant reminders of the island's slow, steady tempo. Wild horses graze for hours in the shade of beachside coconut palms. Thin Brahma cattle plod between pastures on the paved roads, refusing to dignify honking automobiles with a glance. In the beachside town of Esperanza, dogs roam freely but rarely bother to chase or bark at passing traffic. Instead, they watch mud-splattered trucks amble past, looking bleary-eyed and sluggish. 
 Modern-day Vieques feels more like a border town than an emerging tourist destination. For years it managed to keep a low-key image, known mostly to veteran Caribbean travelers and others willing to keep a secret. But the last two years, glossy travel magazines have lavished attention on Vieques, cooing over its pristine, secluded white-sand beaches and proclaiming the island to be the season's ''undiscovered jewel.'' 
 The timing of the attention is no real surprise. Vieques officially entered the tourist spotlight on May 1, 2003, when the Navy, the island's largest landowner, withdrew from its holdings and turned over control to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. This sudden power shift transformed nearly 80 percent of Vieques from a limited-access military enclave to the Caribbean's largest wildlife refuge. 
 Unlike its nearest Caribbean neighbors -- the main island of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands of St. John and St. Croix -- Vieques isn't packed with the high-rise hotels, chain restaurants or duty-free malls that often accompany large-scale tourist development. Instead, the local economy is dominated by small, locally owned businesses, including a handful of small hotels, a few guest houses and scattered restaurants, jeep rental companies and tour operations that serve the island's trickle of tourist traffic. 
 ''It used to be that if tourists found Vieques, they were actively pursuing it,'' says Sharon Grasso, a biologist and owner of Island Adventures, a local tour company. ''With the departure of the Navy, we're an everyday word. It's pretty hard to keep it secret now.''
 FIVE minutes with a simple tourist map can tell you volumes about the island's recent history. Like Puerto Rico's main island, Vieques sits between the open Atlantic and the more sheltered Caribbean. It is about 21 miles long, east to west, and its two largest coastal towns -- Isabel Segunda on the north shore and Esperanza to the south -- are separated by four miles of hilly subtropical forestland. The few paved roads wind through the western half of the island, far from swaths of land still labeled ''Restricted Area.'' Vestiges of the Navy's presence are scattered across the map: a radar installation sits near hacienda ruins at Playa Grande, an abandoned airstrip crumbles near Bahia Corcho, and bunker complexes dot the foothills leading to Monte Pirata, the island's highest point. 
 With the exception of a few south coast beach roads, the eastern half of Vieques has been off limits to the public since the early days of World War II. For much of that time, the land near the island's eastern tip was a ''live fire'' training facility - a Navy bombing range - which sparked protests in the late 1990's, resulting in considerable news coverage and the Navy's eventual departure in 2003. To protect the island's civilian population from the possible danger of unexploded ordnance, eastern Vieques was, and continues to be, fenced off. 
 Six decades of military restrictions insulated Vieques from change, including a regional boom in Caribbean commercial development. Bombs have paradoxically preserved much of the island's natural beauty and delicate tropical ecosystems by preventing the unchecked land speculation and slowing the pace of modernization. 
 As its island neighbors play host to cruise ship passengers and charter-trip vacationers, Vieques is still best known for the natural attractions that inspired the island's newfound fame -- secluded beaches, crystal-clear snorkeling waters and stunning forest vistas. They are open to any traveler willing to work a bit for the experience and adapt to the island's relaxed pace. 
 The biggest draws are three remote beaches known to visitors by their Navy-era color codes -- Red Beach, Blue Beach and Green Beach -- and to locals by their Spanish names, Bahia Corcho, Bahia de la Chiva and Punta Arenas.
 Access to any of these isolated beachfronts requires an off-road vehicle, a fair amount of patience and, at times, buttocks of iron. On any map, the beach roads are marked with a dotted line and labeled camino de tierra, or dirt road, a term which is accurate only during times of extreme drought. The caminos are rustic roadways cut through the coastal forest, car-width alleys that seem one rainy season away from returning to jungle. Dry sections of the roadbed are either lined with half-buried boulders or eroded to a jaw-rattling washboard surface. Rainstorms reduce low-lying stretches to muddy bogs and deceptively deep water-filled craters capable of swallowing a vehicle to midgrille. Short of renting a sea kayak and taking a more watery route, slow and steady is the only way to make it to the beach. 
 Rough roads turn out to be effective gatekeepers, weeding out the ''lounge chair and umbrella drink'' set and keeping the white sand beaches free of crowds and T-shirt vendors. Vieques's immaculate beachfronts seem like they were lifted straight from a tourist brochure: sugary sand massaged by lapping white waves, crystal-clear waters turning a pale turquoise at waist level then deep sapphire at the end of the beach's sandbar. 
 The island's Caribbean beaches are all exceptional, but differ a bit in character depending on their removal from civilization. Red Beach, an accessible stretch of Bahia Corcho, attracts a family crowd with its wide beachfront and a handful of convenient shoreside gazebos. Blue Beach, a few miles farther east, has a few concrete structures hidden among the palms and a soothing view of open blue sea. Closer to Esperanza, the intimate cove at Navio makes for the perfect morning ramble and a feeling of accomplishment before the sun clears the palms. 
 From any spot on the Caribbean shore, the trek to Punta Arenas (Green Beach) requires a drive over the hilly backbone of Vieques. The curving road through the settlement of Pilon leads through the tropical highlands at the island's center. Low coastal vegetation gives way to a lush rain-forest atmosphere. Fence rows of curvaceous turpentine trees separate dense thickets of vegetation from roadways glossed by afternoon showers. Sea winds give way to humid air blasting through the open windows of a jeep. Dogs lie motionless on mountain house porches. A startled mongoose might cross the road in search of a hiding place. At Punta Arenas, you can gaze at the Puerto Rican mainland and bask on the aptly named sandy point where the pounding Atlantic meets the placid Caribbean. 
 Under the watchful eye of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the beaches officially close at sunset, leaving the evenings free for beachcombers to explore the more civilized areas of Vieques. 
 The poetically named Isabel Segunda is the island's largest town, with a population of about 9,000. Travelers arriving by ferry from the Puerto Rican port of Fajardo experience the bustling dockside district near the Punta Mulas lighthouse. On the whole, Isabel Segunda is a typical Caribbean port, more utilitarian than picturesque; a business center instead of a tourist hub. Bakeries and bars mostly cater to locals, making the town the best place on Vieques to sample pork-centric Puerto Rican cuisine. 
 A few miles east of town, Martineau Bay is home to Vieques's only sizable resort hotel -- the 156-room Wyndham, which effectively doubled the island's hotel capacity when it opened in 2003. While small by hotel standards, the plantation-style resort is a case study in balancing the needs of the island's native population with the amenities expected by resort guests. Only steps from sandy ocean shores, the development has raised serious questions about scale and beach access for future developments. 
 The hotel's opening set off a flurry of new construction just beyond its gates, including the stylish, open-air MBar that brings a South Beach vibe to the island. Closer to town, the Viequense chef Wanda Rivera at Bayaonda adapts local influences to eclectic techniques in what she calls ''artisan Caribbean'' cuisine. 
 On the southern side of the island, the seaside hamlet of Esperanza starts its evenings as weekend travelers stroll the waterfront, perusing the menus of the half dozen bars and restaurants clustered by the harbor. Many of Vieques's tourist businesses -- guesthouses, diving rental shops, galleries and eco-tour companies -- have storefronts in this quiet Caribbean town, making it a good choice for a day's break from the rump-rattling caminos de tierra. 
 During the day, the town's tiny municipal beach teems with local teenagers flirting in groups and with snorkelers exploring the harbor's slow-waving seagrass beds. At night, the open-air bars fill with well-tanned tourists fresh from the beaches or leather-skinned locals who left their native New England years ago for an island that was a good sight slower than it is these days. Sun-browned young bartenders operate throughly modern colada-making contraptions between surfing stories and rounds of rum punches. 
 EVEN die-hard fans of the latter will want to save one evening for one of Vieques's biggest natural tourist attractions -- the bioluminescent bay at Puerto Mosquito. 
 In this shallow Caribbean bay, any underwater movement causes a momentary flash of muted gray-blue light. Waves slap against the aluminum pontoons of the tour boat Luminosa and glow on impact. Darting schools of fish leave telltale luminescent trails. Warm January raindrops hit the ink-black water, their splashes like sparks on the surface. 
 The scientific explanation is straightforward: a species of phytoplankton called Pyrodinium bahamense thrives in the shallow waters of Mosquito Bay. These one-cell plants are invisible to the naked eye until they're agitated. Any sudden motion -- a strong current, a fleeing fish -- causes the plankton to glow like microscopic fireflies. If the concentration of plankton is high enough, a single swimmer can create sheets of underwater light with a sweep of the arm. Step off a swimming ladder dangling into the bay's bathtub-calm waters and you can throw a trail of cool liquid fire with a simple scissor kick. 
 ''This bay is the perfect broth for this type of creature,'' says Mark Martin, a guide with Island Adventures. Cruising to the literal jumping-off point, he trained his laser pointer on the dense forests at the water's edge. ''These mangroves growing on the shoreline are the only trees that can desalinate sea water. They shed, and when the leaves decompose, it provides the perfect mix of nutrients.'' Mr. Martin gives a brief natural history of the bay and the island as the Luminosa's electric motors churn away, leaving 20-foot plumes of light behind their twin propellers. 
 On the ride to and from the bay, he rattles off the many species that run wild in Vieques. Endangered leatherback turtles nest on the beaches of Sun Bay. Great blue herons pick through the mangrove swamps for fish, and brown pelicans skim the sea in tight formation. After nightfall, tiny tree frogs called coqui sing in a constant nocturnal serenade. 
 And the iguanas, the island's reptilian speed bumps, warm themselves wherever they can find a wide spot in the road.

IF YOU GO
Unhurried, Unspoiled, Underdeveloped. For Now.
 VIEQUES is less than 10 miles off the east coast of Puerto Rico and is an easy flight from San Juan. Several regional carriers fly to Vieques Airport, including Air Sunshine (800-327-8900, www.airsunshine.com), Cape Air (800-352-0714, www.flycapeair.com) and Vieques Air Link, (888-901-9247, www.viequesairlink.com). A one-way flight takes about 20 minutes and is about $70. 
 Another option is to take a long-distance taxi to the ferry at Fajardo, about $65 for up to 5 passengers. The Vieques ferry makes four round trips a day during the week and three on the weekend, and costs $2 a person each way. It takes about 70 minutes, depending on weather and dock availability in the town of Isabel Segunda on Vieques. Call (787)741-0800 for current conditions and information.

Where to Stay
 Most of Vieques's tourist amenities are clustered in Isabel Segunda on the island's northern shore and in the Caribbean hamlet of Esperanza on the southern coast. Small inns and bed-and-breakfasts are scattered throughout the island. 
 Hacienda Tamarindo (Route 996, kilometer 4.5, Barrio Puerto Real; 787-741-0420; www.enchanted-isle.com/tamarindo) has 16 rooms, sweeping hilltop views of the Caribbean and an informal tropical ambience. Rooms are $135 to $275 and include breakfast in the hotel's open-air dining room. High season bookings require a multinight stay. 
 The Inn on the Blue Horizon (Route 996, kilometer 4.3, Barrio Puerto Real; 787-741-3318; www.innonthebluehorizon.com) sits near a bluff overlooking the Caribbean a mile west of Esperanza. Balancing modern atmosphere with antique decor, the inn exudes a sense of minimal chic. Its open-air restaurant and bar, the Blue Macaw, bustles most nights with local expatriates and rum-sipping travelers, but it's currently closed because of a fire. There are 10 rooms at $110 to $370.
 Vieques's only resort hotel is the Wyndham Martineau Bay Resort & Spa (Route 200, kilometer 3.2; 787-741-4100; www.wyndham.com) on the north coast. Designed with a plantation layout -- a great house surrounded by smaller cottages -- the resort has 156 rooms and suites, some facing the Atlantic. With its semiprivate beaches within a gated compound, it is the most typical Caribbean resort on the island. Rooms are $179 to $1,000.

What to Do
 Access to the island's best beaches requires driving on unpaved, often washed-out roadways, so renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended. There are many local rental companies, but Maritza's Rental Car (Route 201, Barrio Florida; 787-741-0078) offers drop-off service at some hotels, so your vehicle will be waiting when you check in. Rental rates are $40 to $60 a day. 
 Beaches are free but those managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service are closed from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
 Tours of the island's bioluminescent bay are available through several local tour operators. Island Adventures (787-741-0720, www.biobay.com) uses a motorized boat to take sightseers into Mosquito Bay for $25 a person. Golden Heron Ecotours (787-615-1625, www.golden-heron.com) offers several guided kayak trips to the island's bioluminescent bay, mangrove canals and snorkeling areas. Prices are $25 to $90. 
 Blue Caribe Kayaks (149 Calle Flamboyan, Esperanza; 787-741-2522) rents sea kayaks, starting at $10 an hour, and snorkeling equipment, $10 a day. PABLEAUX JOHNSON

HEADLINE: Teaching Some New Samba Steps to G.M. Brazil

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 10 

 BODY:
Since taking over at General Motors in Brazil just over a year ago, Ray G. Young has given the country's automobile industry a lot to talk about.
 In October, Mr. Young became the impromptu star of Sao Paulo's auto show when he danced enthusiastically to the Paul Rodgers song ''All Right Now'' as G.M. showcased its latest vehicles. And last month, the Brazilian media published pictures of him trying out some samba steps at a celebration of G.M.'s 80th anniversary in the country.
 But his penchant for dancing is not the only thing attracting attention. With his youthful energy and hands-on management style, the 43-year-old managing director has helped breathe new life into a downtrodden, money-losing operation. 
 Last year, though the unit did not manage a profit, it did claw its way to the top of Brazil's volatile auto market in sales volume for the first time, increased exports aggressively and moved closer to turning a profit -- all while adding jobs.
 For G.M., the world's No.1 automaker, this rebound in Brazil, its sixth-largest market, has been a bright spot as the company extricates itself from a soured alliance with Fiat of Italy and continues to atrophy in its biggest markets, the United States and Europe. 
 Still, sales numbers in Brazil sank in January, and G.M. abruptly fell back into third place, behind Volkswagen and Fiat, respectively. The Ford Motor Company, traditionally in fourth place in Brazil, held steady in that slot.
 ''Clearly the January market share is disappointing,'' Mr. Young said. ''It puts us in a bit of a hole right now in 2005, but I'm confident we're going to come back.'' Sales numbers for February showed G.M. already closing the gap again on its rivals.
 Part of G.M.'s success here in 2004 was driven by Brazil's strong economic rebound, which helped woo consumers into showrooms for the first time in years. Auto sales in the country shot up 10.5 percent, to 1.6 million vehicles, with all major manufacturers chalking up hefty gains.
 Nevertheless, many industry analysts say that Mr. Young also deserves lots of credit for the turnaround at General Motors do Brasil.
 ''He has brought a sense of purpose to General Motors that they didn't seem to have before,'' said Ricardo Durazzo, a vice president at the consulting firm A.T. Kearney in Sao Paulo. ''He is charismatic and he's a likable person,'' Mr. Durazzo added, important qualities in Brazil.
 In an interview at the company's headquarters in Sao Caetano do Sul, an industrial hub outside Sao Paulo, Mr. Young said: ''When I arrived here, it was an organization that was a little tired. It went through so many years of retrenchment, cost-cutting, in order to stop the financial bleeding. So one of my first priorities when I came here was to try to rebuild morale.''
 He came to Brazil with 18 G.M. years under his belt, his entire professional career. The son of Chinese emigres to Canada, Mr. Young joined G.M.'s Canadian unit in 1986 after receiving his M.B.A. from the University of Chicago, and quickly climbed the corporate ladder. Over the years, he held posts on three continents, spending much of his time on the financial side, crunching numbers most recently in Detroit as G.M. North America's chief financial officer.
 Here in Brazil, where he succeeded Walter Wieland, a more somber executive whose tenure coincided with a slumping auto market, Mr. Young set out to rally his troops around two objectives: achieving market leadership and becoming profitable.
 He started distributing monthly assessments to all employees, including factory workers, so everyone could keep track of the company's performance. He also began holding ceremonies to thank employees publicly for their work. The work force has responded in kind; on a recent stroll through a factory, workers stopped him to ask for an autograph.
 ''I've had the chance to work around the world, but one thing about Brazil is you've got to appeal to the emotions,'' Mr. Young said. ''It's amazing what happens when people feel proud working for the company.''
 Volkswagen and Fiat have long battled for the top spot in Brazil. But in Mr. Young's first year on the job, G.M. edged out both to finish 2004 as the market leader, with 23.1 percent of Brazil's auto market. G.M.'s exports from Brazil, a growing part of its business here, also surged in 2004, to $1.6 billion, from $1.2 billion in 2003 and just $900 million in 2002. Like other major multinational automakers, which make up the entire auto market here, G.M. is increasingly using Brazil to make low-cost vehicles for other emerging markets, including Argentina, Mexico and South Africa.
 Though the company does not break out financial results by country in Latin America, Mr. Young said G.M. cut its losses in Brazil by more than 60 percent in 2004 and made an operating profit in the fourth quarter. That helped G.M.'s Latin America, Africa and Middle East division earn $85 million last year after losing $331 million in 2003. This year, Mr. Young expects G.M. to make its first net profit in Brazil since 1997.
 Still, the resurgence in Brazil has not been without controversy. Some industry analysts say the automaker won market leadership last year only because G.M. dealers preregistered new cars in December before they had actually been sold, a common practice among dealers in Brazil. G.M. sold a mere 15,796 vehicles in January 2005, down from 44,557 in December and from 23,833 in January 2004, according to the Brazilian automakers' association. (By comparison, Volkswagen's sales dropped to 25,927 in January from 36,120 in December, while Fiat's slipped to 24,647 from 37,468.)
 ''Why did the numbers drop so much?'' said Joel Leite, who owns a Web site called Autoinforme that tracks Brazil's auto sector. ''Because G.M. dealers sold cars in January that they had already registered as sold in December.'' He added that the practice, while frowned upon, is not illegal.
 Mr. Young denied any preregistration or year-end sales inflation, saying, ''We don't do that.'' He attributed the company's poor performance in January, in the slow summer season here, to a miscalculation that led to a drop in Internet and direct-from-the-factory fleet sales.
 G.M. shifted almost all its vehicles to dealer lots in December, he said, leaving too few to be sold over the Web and to fleet customers the next month.
 G.M.'s sales bounced back in February, jumping by 6,823 vehicles from the previous month, to 22,619. Fiat and Volkswagen, meanwhile, increased sales by just 2,446 and 854 autos from January, respectively.
 The parent company appears confident that 2004 was not a fluke. It is spending $240 million to increase capacity at the G.M. plant in Gravatai, in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, where it intends to create 1,500 new jobs by the end of 2006. And recently it announced plans to invest about $192 million to develop a new version of its Chevrolet Vectra sedan at its Sao Caetano plant for the domestic and export markets. Already, G.M. is the only automaker in Brazil offering models in all market segments, from its big-selling Celta compact to the popular Meriva minivan.
 Still, obstacles lie ahead for all carmakers here. The sales tax on vehicles in Brazil, about 30 percent, is twice that of other emerging markets, like China, forcing up the price on new cars in a country where the minimum wage is less than $100 a month. 
 Interest rates are among the world's highest, making consumer financing largely unaffordable. Parts makers also have limited access to credit, and that interferes with production each year. And the Brazilian currency, the real, has rallied in the last few months to its strongest level in almost three years, gnawing away at profit margins for exporters.
 Mr. Young and his competitors are lobbying the government to reduce auto taxes and lower interest rates, and to create special credit lines for small-scale parts manufacturers.
 ''It's a tough place to sell cars and make money,'' Mr. Young said. ''You have to be nimble on your feet.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Are Divided, As Some Back G.O.P. Bills

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10 

 BODY:
Rapid-fire victories by Republicans on business-friendly legislation are exposing fissures among Democrats who are upset by their party's response to bills that sailed through in the early days of the Congressional session, with the latest example being the bankruptcy measure approved on Thursday. 
 Members of the party's more liberal wing were openly frustrated that Republicans had ample Democratic help passing the bankruptcy bill on a 74-to-25 vote in the Senate. Eighteen Democrats and one independent joined with the Republicans. The legislation, which will make it harder for Americans to erase their debts, followed the approval last month of changes in class action laws intended to reduce the number of lawsuits against companies. 
 ''This is not where we as Democrats ought to be, for crying out loud,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, after Republicans beat back amendment after amendment offered by Democrats in their efforts to soften the bankruptcy measure. ''We are making a terrible mistake by thinking that we can have it both ways. We have to remember where our base is.''
 Democratic supporters of the legislation say that the party has to demonstrate a commitment to personal financial responsibility and that the final measure, which is expected to be considered quickly by the House, is not substantially different from past bankruptcy proposals that drew broad party backing.
 ''I think we can all agree on a basic principle, and that is when people incur a debt and have the ability to repay some or all of them, they should repay some or all of them,'' said Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, whose state is home to large credit-card issuers that have been clamoring for tighter bankruptcy laws.
 The latest infighting among Democrats illustrates the party's continuing search for an identity in the wake of November's election losses, with lawmakers torn between moving closer to Republicans on some economic and social issues or trying to separate themselves.
 Republicans, meanwhile, are reveling in their early success. ''This bankruptcy bill has been a long time coming,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, as the Senate adopted the bill.
 While they may be struggling off the floor to advance President Bush's proposal to revamp Social Security, they are more than happy to spend their days on the floor pushing through bills that have rested near the top of businesses' agenda for years.
 ''I came to the U.S. Senate to get things done -- and so far we are delivering,'' said Senator John Thune, newly elected Republican from South Dakota. 
 But it could get harder from here. Mr. Bush's clean air proposal, for example, is stalled in a Senate committee. The coming budget and spending fights promise to be difficult, as would a Social Security battle should legislation eventually materialize. And rancorous floor fights over judicial nominations could bring the Senate to a standstill. 
 With that in mind, the Republican leadership is trying to speed through some of its priority legislation before any impasse develops. Some Democrats also believe that Republicans are taking advantage of the intense Democratic focus on Social Security and federal judges to score victories on lower profile bills that nonetheless have big consequences. 
 As the bankruptcy bill emerged, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, sought to rally members of his party around a series of amendments that would offer special protection for those whose bankruptcy was attributed to health care costs or other unexpected expenses. But on that and nearly every other attempted change, solid Republican opposition, bolstered by a handful of Democrats, prevailed. 
 On the call to cut off debate on the bill, 13 Democrats joined Republicans, some of whom said privately that they were astonished that Democratic opponents of the bill were losing so many from their own party. 
 The support drew a scolding from John Podesta, a top Clinton administration official who now leads the Center for American Progress, a Washington research group. In a memo widely circulated on Capitol Hill, Mr. Podesta said lawmakers who viewed the bankruptcy bill as an easy probusiness vote were overlooking the impact it could have on the middle-class Americans who are being sought after by both parties. 
 In an interview, Mr. Podesta said the support by some Democrats for legislation like the bankruptcy bill contributed to the party's continuing erosion among working-class voters.
 ''You have got poll after poll saying there is no distinction between the parties on these core economic issues and one has to say, no wonder,'' Mr. Podesta said.
 Democrats who backed the bankruptcy measure said that it gave the courts flexibility to consider special circumstances and that there was nothing wrong with siding with Republicans when warranted.
 ''There is a benefit in being involved in something that puts more fiscal discipline in the lives of individuals,'' said Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska. ''My opinion from the very beginning has been: you support the president when the president is right, you oppose when you need to and, in every case you can, you look for compromise.''

HEADLINE: 2 Fed Officials Offer Different but Upbeat Views on Debt

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10 

 BODY:
Two top Federal Reserve officials argued on Thursday that the United States' record level of foreign indebtedness was unlikely to pose a major risk to the nation.
 ''The resolution of our current-account deficit and household debt burdens does not strike me as overly worrisome,'' said Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, according to a transcript of a speech he gave to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. 
 In his most sanguine remarks yet on the subject, Mr. Greenspan repeated many of his previous arguments that increased globalization of trade and finance allows the United States to borrow much more today than it could comfortably have done two decades ago. 
 While cautioning that ''the free lunch has yet to be invented,'' Mr. Greenspan nonetheless said the world was undergoing a ''one-time shift in the degree of globalization and innovation that has temporarily altered the specific calibrations'' for evaluating economic imbalances.
 A member of the Fed board of governors, Ben S. Bernanke, went even further than Mr. Greenspan by attributing the United States' huge and rising foreign indebtedness to a ''savings glut'' in Asia and most other parts of the world, according to a transcript of his speech to the Virginia Association of Economists in Richmond. 
 The fairly upbeat Fed assessments ran counter to those of some outside analysts, who warn that the nation's soaring trade and financial deficits could lead to a severe drop in the value of the dollar and perhaps to higher interest rates.
 Investors have become extraordinarily nervous about the dollar in recent weeks, selling at any hint that Asian central banks might be ready to reduce the huge supplies of dollar-denominated securities that they built up to keep their own currencies from rising too rapidly.
 Analysts estimate that the nation's trade deficit soared to more than $600 billion last year, or nearly 6 percent of gross domestic product. The nation's aggregate foreign indebtedness is now equal to more than one-fifth of the total economy.
 Most economists expect the trade deficit and the broader current-account deficit, which includes capital flows as well as trade, to widen further because the American economy is growing faster than those of Europe and Japan.
 Mr. Greenspan said the imbalance could not keep widening indefinitely. But he said the United States could now attract far more money than in the past because globalization had greatly reduced ''home bias'' -- the tendency of people to invest primarily in their own countries.
 ''Globalization -- the extension of the division of labor and specialization beyond national borders -- is patently a key to understanding much of our recent economic history,'' Mr. Greenspan said. 
 Though Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that globalization had its limits, he said it was impossible to know how long the trend could continue. ''The closing of our frontier at the end of the 19th century, for example, did not signal the onset of a new era of economic stagnation,'' he remarked.
 Mr. Bernanke, a former professor of economics at Princeton, offered a more unconventional view. Rather than ascribe the widening payments gap to the low rate of American savings or to booming competition from China, Mr. Bernanke attributed it to a huge pool of savings in developing nations around the world.
 ''Over the past decade, a combination of diverse forces has created a significant increase in the global supply of saving -- a global saving glut,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 He added that the ''glut'' was in part the result of the Asian and Latin American financial crises of the mid-1990's. Many countries became net exporters of capital at that time, as investors looked for better places to put their money and central banks built up ''war chests'' to buffer themselves against future shocks.
 Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that this shift could pose problems for the United States at some point. The flood of foreign imports has led to a ''shrinkage'' of American manufacturing and its potential for exports, he said. But like the Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke said the imbalances would gradually readjust on their own, and added, ''I see no reason the process should not proceed smoothly.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Allies Agree on Steps In Iran Dispute

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and STEVEN R. WEISMAN; David E. Sanger reported from Washington for this article and Steven R. Weisman from Mexico City.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10 

 BODY:
Europe and the United States have agreed on a joint approach to negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program after months of dispute, with the Bush administration agreeing to offer modest economic incentives and the Europeans agreeing to take the issue to the United Nations Security Council if negotiations fail, senior American officials said Thursday.
 The American incentives would go into effect only if Iran agreed to halt the enrichment of uranium permanently. The agreement represents a major shift in strategy for both the Bush administration, which has refused for years to offer Iran incentives to give up its program, and for Europe, which had been reluctant to discuss penalties. 
 The agreement, which has been widely anticipated since President Bush returned from Europe late last month, is expected to be announced on Friday. The United States will agree to support Iran's entry into the World Trade Organization, a process that usually takes years, and the sale of critical spare parts for the country's aging commercial airliners. 
 ''We're in support of what the Europeans are doing, but we had to find a way to demonstrate it,'' a senior American official deeply involved in the debate within the administration said about the pending announcement. ''This is our way of making clear that we will join the Europeans in giving Iran positive reasons to give up its program.''
 Though Mr. Bush will not announce the change himself, just as he did not announce a similar offer to North Korea last June, he has been closely involved in the administration's change of direction. But while the United States is a party to negotiations with North Korea, it does not plan to join the talks with Iran directly, officials said, leaving that to the Europeans.
 Until now, the president has insisted he would never ''reward'' Iran for giving up activities that he has insisted are a cover for a weapons program. That position hardened after Iran admitted that it had hidden facilities and enrichment activities from international inspectors for 18 years.
 Iran has voluntarily halted its enrichment activities while it is engaged in negotiations with Britain, France and Germany. But its leaders have repeatedly declared that it will never give up its right to enrich uranium for what it insists are peaceful purposes. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iran has ratified, gives all signers the right to enrich uranium as long as the work is peaceful, declared and fully monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The monitoring is intended to assure that a country is only producing low-enriched uranium capable of fueling commercial nuclear reactors, rather than high-enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.
 Iran's senior negotiator, Hassan Rowhani, told a conference in Tehran last weekend that the country would never agree to a permanent cessation of enrichment. But the senior American official involved in the administration's negotiations with Europe said that, after some heated internal debate, ''the Europeans are now with us in the view that we could never monitor their enrichment activity reliably enough'' to ensure that Iran was not producing bomb-grade uranium.
 Some European diplomats have argued that point in recent weeks, saying that Iran cannot be prohibited from enrichment while other signers of the treaty are permitted to produce nuclear fuel. But the American official insisted ''that argument is now over.''
 Some officials in the Bush administration have said they believe that Iran will not agree to give up enrichment, no matter what incentives Mr. Bush offers. They see the president's decision to dangle what amount to modest American economic incentives as part of an effort to speed along the negotiating process so that Iran's intentions become clear.
 At that point, in the view of hawks on the issue inside the White House and the Pentagon, the Europeans will be bound to take the issue to the Security Council. These officials would only speak anonymously because such delicate negotiations hang in the balance.
 When she served as national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice often said that the question of stopping Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon should be put before the Security Council, but the Untied States could never muster the votes among the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog.
 The Europeans, in contrast, have argued that unless the United States joined in the incentives they offered, Iran would never seriously consider giving up control of what is called the ''nuclear fuel cycle,'' the ability to produce nuclear fuel itself.
 American officials have said they will insist on a timetable so that talks do not drag on for months or years. Whether the Europeans will announce such a timetable is unclear. Several weeks ago, the new director of central intelligence, Porter J. Goss, said that Iran was judged to be several years away from producing an actual weapon.
 Iran could see benefits from the offer of aircraft parts relatively soon, officials said. Its aging craft are in need of parts for engines and American-made avionic equipment. But entry into the World Trade Organization is far more complex, requiring huge changes in a nation's economy and vast openings to foreign investors. The United States offered to help Russia along that path eight years ago, but it has still not joined the W.T.O. China took years to negotiate its entry.
 With Friday's announcement, the administration will have changed course in dealing with both of the leading aspirants for nuclear technology, North Korea and Iran. Mr. Bush came to office refusing to deal with either nation until each first gave up its weapons program. In North Korea's case, that approach was judged no longer tenable last June, and the administration offered a similar road map of incentives. But North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, has yet to respond to that offer. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 16, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on March 11 about an agreement between Europe and the United States on ways to deal with Iran's nuclear program misidentified the American intelligence official who had testified before Congress that Iran was believed to be several years away from producing an actual weapon. He was Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. (Porter J. Goss, the director of central intelligence, testified at the same time but did not address that point.) A reporter discovered the error this week while reviewing a transcript of the testimony for a related article.

PERSON: Chad Clanton

HEADLINE: Trying for the Mayoralty With Dr Pepper and Twang

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
DOUBLE doggone it. Chad Clanton left his signature Tony Lama cowboy boots back at his bachelor pad near Union Square, so the only proof that he's a terminal Texan toiling as a temporary New York City political operative for the mayoral candidate Fernando Ferrer hails from his barbed-wire body -- he's a tad bowlegged inside those broken-in blue jeans -- and hard-wired twang. Yep, he says git for get. Repeatedly. Endearingly. As in, ''We need a mayor who gits it, and Mayor Bloomberg just doesn't git it.''
 Oh, and there's one other giveaway. His fist is soldered to a can of Dr Pepper, a beverage to which he is shamelessly addicted and with which, he announces with reverence, he shares a hometown: good ole Waco. 
 ''Back in Waco, we used to say that if the Lord made anything better than Dr Pepper, he must have kept it to himself,'' drawls Mr. Clanton, 33, whose mama was a Baptist minister while Dad did public relations for Baylor University (so this ease with anecdote and oratory runs in the genes on both sides of the family, as does being a rock-solid Democrat). He grew up attending church twice weekly but was not particularly pious; he does recall being parentally rewarded for good deeds by, what else, a cold can of homegrown soda pop. 
 He still rewards himself with it. Politics and Dr Pepper go back a long way with Mr. Clanton. He conducted his first poll in the fourth grade, canvassing fellow students on their preference between Reagan and Carter. A precocious passion became a career choice after he took a course on the interplay of politics and the news media from Paul Begala at the University of Texas. Mr. Clanton received his undergraduate and graduate degrees, the latter in public policy, at the Austin campus. 
 ''The intersection of politics and the press is maybe the most vital part of a democracy, and I tried to get myself in the middle of it,'' he says. ''Didn't know what a War Room was, but knew I wanted to work in one.''
 He already knows political message-making is a fraught, and occasionally flawed, process. He is finding out that the New York news media, if agitated into rattlesnake mode, makes the process even more fraught: this week one tabloid merrily quoted a typo-ridden release from Ferrer headquarters, ignoring the corrected release reissued minutes later. Lesson learned. 
 But after a lifetime of Dr Pepper he has yet to check its calorie count. Hmmm, 150. 
 ''IS that a lot?'' he asks, boyishly cocking an eyebrow. Not that he worries about accumulating flab. He gestures toward the well-worn sneakers in a gym bag on the floor of his exceedingly bare office at Mr. Ferrer's unembellished Midtown campaign headquarters. Along with the thrill of discovering the subway (he and the boss, Mr. Ferrer, ride it all the time ''to save a nickel on car expenses''), and the corner deli (corned beef versus pastrami is his culinary dilemma), he runs hard and far in Central Park. 
 ''Burn, burn, burn, slip into Zen-ville, and forget the stresses of the campaign,'' he recites. Not that the Ferrer campaign is stressing him out. But it may if Mr. Ferrer fails to unseat Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. ''Campaigning is too hard, and it hurts too much when you lose, if you lose,'' he says. ''But I refuse to surrender to cynicism.''
 Mr. Clanton's hyperactive mentor, James Carville, didn't mastermind a winning race until he was 40, and he himself has yet to win a big political campaign in this country -- assisting Mr. Carville with a successful presidential campaign in the Dominican Republic five years ago was nice but doesn't cut it. ''The odds are about to kick in,'' he vows. 
 Mr. Clanton was barely done licking his wounds from the failed presidential campaign of John Kerry, for whom he served as a senior aide and spokesman, before being recruited in January as communications director for Mr. Ferrer's mayoral bid. Strong medicine, maybe, for what ailed him. 
 He admits the Bush camp did a better job than his in getting its message out. He paraphrases Mark Twain by way of critiquing his camp for its sluggish rebuttal to the Swift Boat veterans' attacks on Mr. Kerry: ''A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth catches up to rip its boots off.''
 That was then. This is a chance for retribution.
 ''Freddy Ferrer's economic populism is something I believe in and something our party should stand for and at its best does: We want to make sure New York City is a place that works for everybody, not just the fat cats. Should we be fortunate enough to win the primary, and face Bloomberg, well, it's a classic David and Goliath battle. It's Seabiscuit against War Admiral.'' 
 Mr. Clanton is getting pumped up. His feet, clad in suede desert boots, are tapping against the floor. His brown forelock bounces against his forehead. He throws on some mood music -- Gavin DeGraw's ''Chariot'' -- and spews out a quotation from Dale Earnhardt, the Nascar legend. 
 ''He was in this race he really needed to win, so he took a risk, passed on the outside, crashed, and got nothing. A reporter asked him why he took such a big risk and he said, 'Because second place is nothing but the first loser.'''

HEADLINE: How Long Can G.M. Tread Water?

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 10 

 BODY:
Since the Depression, General Motors has reigned as the world's largest automaker and a pillar of American economic might. But now the company is broadly struggling and facing the humbling possibility that it will be displaced by Toyota at the top of the auto industry within a few years.
 General Motors, which controlled nearly half the American market as recently as the late 1970's, held about one-quarter in February. Last week, the company said that it would produce 300,000 fewer cars and trucks in North America in the first half of this year, a 10 percent drop from a year ago. 
 Its European operations have lost money for five consecutive years and rising interest rates are expected to cool its lending division. With its shrinking profits dwarfed by those of Nissan and Toyota, G.M.'s debt is threatened with a downgrade to a junk bond rating, a move that could force it to pay more to borrow money. 
 The company's financial health is no trivial matter. With 7,600 dealers across the country, its eight brands, from Chevrolet to Cadillac, have long been American icons. The company has operations in 32 states; in Michigan and Ohio, both G.M. and Delphi, its struggling former parts subsidiary, are top 10 employers. G.M. is also the nation's largest private health care payer, giving coverage to 1.1 million Americans. Hundreds of thousands of retirees depend on the company's pension checks.
 G.M. might be in better shape than it was when it lost $23 billion in 1992 and was on the brink of bankruptcy, but many analysts say it will be treading water for years to come and extending economic distress across the industrial heartland around the Great Lakes. 
 Company executives, while acknowledging that G.M. faces serious problems, say they are confident they can weather any storm. ''We've been ahead for 73 years in a row,'' Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said in response to a question at a January news conference about Toyota's looming presence. ''I think the betting is we'll be ahead for the next 73 years.''
 ''Is it a birthright?'' he added. ''Absolutely not. Could we blow it next year? I doubt it. Could we blow it in 10 years? For sure. We could do anything in 10 years.''
 Mr. Wagoner declined to be interviewed for this article. With the company's stock down about 50 percent on his watch, his legacy is on the line, as is the company's. 
 Five years ago, at 47, Mr. Wagoner became G.M.'s youngest chief executive. He was a protege of John F. Smith Jr., who became chief executive after a boardroom coup in 1992. Mr. Smith pulled the company from record losses to a record profit by 1999. 
 Mr. Wagoner did not promise to reinvent G.M. 
 ''The state of business at General Motors Corporation is strong,'' he told shareholders in 2000, adding later that the company's success ''gives us a great chance to build off what we're doing.''
 Today, however, many analysts say G.M. is still unable to solve some of the problems it had in 1992, namely the seemingly unstoppable surge of efficient foreign competitors like Toyota. 
 The strategy of Mr. Wagoner, now also G.M.'s chairman, has been to continue his predecessor's work of pushing global expansion even as he is now moving to shrink G.M.'s disparate global operations into a single manufacturing, design and engineering organization.
 Few industry analysts call him a visionary leader, but many see him as a skilled executive who has held the company together despite being dealt a difficult hand. Others say G.M. needs a more radical approach to ensure its survival.
 ''It's not like this tide can't turn,'' Mr. Wagoner said in January. ''It's not going to turn by cheerleading or me convincing you here; it's going to be great products. It's going to be helped if exchange rates get in line with what they should be so companies that don't need to get subsidies aren't getting them.'' 
 At 6-foot-4, Mr. Wagoner briefly played college basketball while attending Duke University and remains an avid Blue Devil fan. He has approached his job more like a coach than an authoritarian chief, assembling a management team of prominent industry executives.
 Mr. Wagoner is a career G.M. employee who came up through the company's huge finance operations and is not considered one of Detroit's ''car guy'' executives. Filling that role is Robert A. Lutz, the 73-year-old former Chrysler president Mr. Wagoner hired in 2001 to shake up G.M.'s product development. Mr. Lutz, a former Marine who commutes to work in a copter, commands most of the company's spotlight.
 Far from undermining his authority, Mr. Wagoner's willingness to delegate has earned him praise.
 ''What's remarkable about Rick's leadership is the strength of the team that he has been able to attract,'' said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation, the largest G.M. dealer.
 Gerald Meyers, a University of Michigan professor and the former head of American Motors, now part of DaimlerChrysler, called Mr. Wagoner ''superb,'' adding that his drive to globalize could not be accomplished quickly. 
 ''That's a long tough road and it takes almost a generation of executive teams to make that happen,'' he said. The problem, he added, is ''no matter how much they are improved, there are a couple guys out there running faster.''
 Others are less charitable in their assessment. Sean Egan, managing director of the independent debt rating firm Egan Jones, said Mr. Wagoner was performing ''miserably,'' adding that ''some drastic action is needed in the very near future to even have a chance of turning around this slow slide to irrelevance.''
 The prevailing view among financial analysts is that G.M. is not close to bankruptcy because it is still clinging to profitability and has more than $23 billion in cash in its automotive operations. While it has roughly $30 billion in debt, those payments are stretched out over decades.
 Mr. Egan thinks bankruptcy is a real possibility because, he says, G.M. can burn through large amounts of cash quickly; he does not recommend buying G.M. bonds with maturities of more than two and a half years. 
 But Craig Hutson, an analyst at another independent bond rating firm, Gimme Credit, thinks G.M. has ''the liquidity to withstand even a worst-case draconian scenario.'' 
 Mary Ann Keller, a longtime analyst and author, said, ''they're careening from one mess to another,'' adding, ''the only thing that could make things better is a major restructuring.'' 
 She says that G.M.'s management lacks urgency and cites the fact that G.M. continues to pay more than $1 billion in annual dividends, as opposed to reinvesting that money in the business. She and other analysts also say G.M.'s recent agreement to pay $2 billion to extract itself from a soured alliance with Fiat does not reflect well on management. As part of the deal in 2000, Fiat won the right to sell its troubled auto business to G.M. at any time over a period of five years. In the end, G.M. paid $4.5 billion to begin and end that bargain and largely abandon its partnership. 
 John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the Fiat deal ''came at a large cost with little benefit.'' 
 While sales globally increased last year, in G.M.'s crucial home market they continue to decline even though G.M. spends more on incentives than any other company and is adding rebates, most about $1,000, on models that have sat on dealer lots for four months. Nearly half of G.M.'s North American production capacity is either idled or being used to produce cars and trucks sold on the cheap to rental car companies, business fleets or employees and their friends and family, according to a recent Morgan Stanley report. 
 Labor contracts forbid the company to simply close plants to address this stark inefficiency. The company also has to maintain its size so it can generate enough cash to pay for its health care and pension benefits, which cost more than $1,800 for each vehicle produced in the United States annually. Automakers based in countries with more socialized systems are not similarly burdened. 
 In recent speeches, Mr. Wagoner has emphasized this problem, stressed the need for tort reform and criticized the Japanese government for intervening in the currency market. 
 But critics say that many of G.M.'s biggest problems are self-inflicted and that too many of its vehicles lack the verve that once characterized American cars. To them, the revival of G.M.'s Cadillac brand after years of cultural dormancy only demonstrates that the company can do better. 
 While G.M. has made huge strides on quality surveys by J.D. Power & Associates, the surveys also show that most of its brands lag in appeal. Only three of eight had sales growth last year -- Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC. 
 The company has tried advertising gimmicks and brand revivals. G.M. paid to place its new Buick LaCrosse sedan on ''Desperate Housewives'' and to feature Aerosmith's ''Dream On'' in LaCrosse commercials, but sales of Buicks still continue to dive. 
 Saturn, Saab, Pontiac? Revivals for all three are in various stages. 
 Both G.M. and Ford Motor have made huge bets on sales of large sport utilities and pickup trucks in the United States, a wager that some analysts say is at risk as gas prices rise. G.M. has upped the ante by creating a new brand around Hummer, the least fuel-efficient brand in the industry. Still, G.M. executives say their fortunes will improve considerably in 2006 and 2007 as a new generation of large sport utility vehicles and large pickup trucks hits the market. 
 In Detroit, the unfortunate measure of success is not which of the Big Three automakers is doing best, but which is doing the least badly. Three years ago, that was clearly G.M., if for no other reason than that Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler were losing billions of dollars. Three years later, Chrysler is on the upswing and Ford has returned to profitability, though it is hardly a picture of health.
 One thing Mr. Wagoner is not betting on is a government bailout, given that steel companies and airlines have been left to fend for themselves.
 ''That has not gone unnoticed by me and therefore motivated us to think about, well, maybe we shouldn't just wait for somebody else to fix this problem for us,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Apple Backs Sony Format For DVD's

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Apple Computer is backing the Sony Corporation's Blu-ray format for the next generation of digital videodiscs, bolstering Sony's effort to dominate the $26 billion United States market for DVD's and players. 
 Apple, whose computers run software to create DVD's, joined the Blu-ray Disc Association's board, a statement by Blu-ray said yesterday. Sony is fighting to win support for its standard over one called HD-DVD that is backed by Toshiba and NEC. 
 Blu-ray said Apple would support the new high-definition DVD format in its iMovie and Final Cut video-editing software programs. 
 ''Apple is pleased to join the Blu-ray Disc Association board as part of our efforts to drive consumer adoption of HD,'' Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said in a statement on the Blu-ray Web site. 
 The competing formats promise high-definition pictures, better sound quality, more storage capacity and better copyright protection than standard DVD's. The backing of film studios and computer makers like Apple will help determine the dominant standard. Blu-ray has five times the capacity of current discs and more than the HD-DVD standard. 
 Ted Schadler, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said, ''Capacity is everything'' for personal computer makers, adding, ''In capacity, Blu-ray is much better.'' 
 Blu-Ray's backers include the two big PC makers, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, in addition to Sony, Walt Disney and Thomson, the largest supplier of recorded DVD's. Film studios including Warner Brothers, New Line Cinema, Universal and Paramount have said they will adopt HD-DVD. The studios may agree later to release movies on Blu-ray discs. 
 The Blu-ray Disc Association, with more than 100 members, develops specifications, including compatibility, for the format as well as promoting it. Blu-ray refers to a blue laser that reads and records the format, according to the Blu-ray Web site.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Fall Silences Africa's Garment Factories

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MAPUTSOE, Lesotho 

 BODY:
Buy a T-shirt at Wal-Mart, fleece sweats at J.C. Penney or Hanes panties anywhere in the United States, and there's a halfway decent chance that they were stitched together here, in an acre-size garment factory crammed with thousands of frantically clacking sewing machines. Virtually its entire output, 25,000 items of clothing daily, is America-bound. 
 These days, that is a disaster. ''Two thousand people work here, and unfortunately last week I had to retrench 500 people, because there are no orders,'' Boodia Heman, director of the Ever Unison Garments factory, said in a recent interview. ''The American buyer is not coming to Lesotho to buy.'' 
 Actually, the problem is not so much the buyers from America. It is the American dollar, and its headlong plunge in value. Three years ago, Lesotho's garment factories had to sell only $56 worth of clothes to stores in the United States to cover the monthly wage of 650 maloti for a sewing-machine operator. Today, that same salary consumes $109 in sales. 
 When the dollar is worth 8.5 maloti or more, Mr. Heman said, ''we break even and we are satisfied.'' Right now, the weak dollar fetches less than 6 maloti. 
 The dollar could not have shrunk at a worse time for southern Africa. In January, China's powerful apparel industry was freed from the so-called multifiber arrangement, which for decades set nation-by-nation quotas and capped its garment exports to the developed world. Now China, which keeps its currency tightly pegged to the dollar, has begun to pursue the American market much more avidly. 
 American shoppers may register the dollar's fall, if at all, as an irritating uptick in the prices of imported goods. In tiny, dirt-poor Lesotho, it is more than an irritation; it is potentially fatal. Since December, 6 of the nation's 50 clothes factories have shut down, unable to match the prices of foreign competitors and still make a profit. That has eliminated 5,800 of the 50,000 garment-making jobs here. Layoffs have claimed at least 6,000 more. 
 Garment makers who might otherwise decide to ride out the dollar's slide ''are starting to realize that they're losing their shirts,'' said Mark Bennett, who advises the government on textile issues for the nonprofit ComMark Trust, based in South Africa, which aims to foster development.
 The government has stepped in, seeking to resurrect three of the closed factories and offering incentives for others. And for good reason: garment makers represent more than 9 in 10 manufacturing jobs in this impoverished nation. 
 Those efforts largely depend, however, on the vagaries of the dollar. Garment makers here, most of them foreign-owned, say that if the dollar drops another 20 percent against the South African rand, as some economists predict, a new wave of factory closings will be inevitable. 
 Across southern Africa, industries that depend on American customers or compete with American producers are feeling the effects of the dollar's fall. South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho, has lost an estimated 30,000 textile jobs since 2002. In neighboring Swaziland, nearly three in four textile factories say they have no firm orders beyond March. 
 South Africa's fabled gold-mining industry lost 11,000 jobs from January 2003 to June 2004, in part because income from its dollar-denominated exports fell sharply. Botswana's budget tipped from a surplus to a $325 million deficit last year as its dollar income from diamond sales was diluted by a 10 percent rise in its currency, the pula. 
 All these nations, and nearby Namibia, share a common problem: their currencies are pegged one-to-one to South Africa's rand, which has recorded a big rise against the dollar (Botswana's pula is pegged to a basket of currencies dominated by the rand.) The euro has risen 52 percent against the dollar since February 2002, but the rand, driven by a boom in commodities like gold, has nearly doubled in value. 
 ''The weak dollar is bad economic news for countries that are not on a dollar-parity system,'' said Anthony Twine, a senior economist at Econometrix, a Johannesburg consultant.
 In places like Lesotho, a nation of 1.8 million that is already wrestling with AIDS and drought, the news is perhaps most wrenching. Lesotho's garment industry -- and therefore its manufacturing base -- rests on the faltering premise that Americans will buy all the clothes that it can sew. 
 That premise originates in a law, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which Congress enacted in 2000 in an effort to help sub-Saharan nations lift themselves from poverty. Nations meeting the law's criteria, which range from political pluralism to support for free markets, are allowed to export any of 1,600 products to the United States duty-free. 
 With a progressive government and extremely low tax rates, Lesotho was one of the biggest winners: clothing exports to the United States ballooned to $500 million last year, from just $100 million in 2001 -- nearly a third of all clothing exports by the 37 nations given duty-free status. 
 The textile boom was a salvation to Lesotho, which lost 60,000 jobs in the 1990's as South Africa reduced migrant labor at its gold and coal mines. Textile factory employment rose from 20,000 jobs before the law to more than 50,000 last year. 
 When the dollar was more robust, some companies from Taiwan built projects -- modern, efficient factories and a mill to produce denim fabric -- that is vital to the industry's long-term health. By late 2007, garment makers must make or buy their fabrics in sub-Saharan Africa or lose their right to ship goods duty-free to the United States.
 That denim mill probably assures that Lesotho's blue-jeans makers, who turn out 26 million pairs a year, will survive in some form. But the dollar's slide has damped prospects for a knitted-fabric mill.
 In Maputsoe, a dog-eared settlement of about 10,000, two of nine garment factories closed in December and January, leaving their workers stunned and, often, penniless. 
 Itumeleng Khasane was in her fourth month of sewing Old Navy T-shirts at TW Garments in Maputsoe when she went to collect her paycheck on Dec. 17 during the factory's Christmas break. At her last payday in mid-November, it was clear that the factory was struggling: she received only about $54, half the wages due for a month's work. 
 But when she arrived at the factory that day, she said recently, nobody was there. ''We didn't get our money,'' she said. ''We didn't get a salary; we didn't get a holiday bonus; we didn't get a termination payment.'' 
 More recently, Ms. Khasane was standing in a crowd of women, along with a few men, outside Johnson Work Wear, a uniform maker that hired a handful of workers in January. It was, they said, their only prospect for another job. Many had arrived at dawn, carrying umbrellas to ward off the midday sun. 
 At 21, with a seventh-grade education, Ms. Khasane had been the sole wage-earner for a family of five -- two sisters, a brother and her jobless father. Her mother died in 2002 at age 38. The family gets by now on handouts. 
 The second Maputsoe factory, Vogue Landmark Garments, shut down even more unexpectedly; workers say there was no hint of financial problems until they returned after the holiday break on Jan. 12 and found the doors locked. 
 Masello Motsosi, a 27-year-old sewing machine repairman, was supporting his wife and two boys, his parents and his in-laws on his $135-a-month salary. He used his last savings in January to pay the boys' school fees. ''Now, there's nothing,'' he said. 
 Lesotho garment factories have closed before, and been snapped up quickly by other producers. But with the American market increasingly unprofitable, few expect that to happen this time. Nor is it easy to diversify away from United States buyers: Canada and Australia, among others, offer American-style tariff breaks, but their markets are too small to replace American orders. And the Chinese, with lower shipping costs and quicker turnaround times, loom ever larger as a competitor. 
 In response, the nation's biggest garment makers are slashing costs -- and praying for an exchange-rate turnaround. ''Denim isn't profitable right now,'' said Oliver Li, the manager of the Global Textiles factory owned by the Nien Hsing Textile Company. It is one of three factories that still churn out up to 70,000 pairs of jeans daily.
 ''It's not only the appreciation of the rand, but other things like electricity and water,'' Mr. Li said. ''They're all more expensive than before because we pay for them with our dollar income.'' 
 At its three factories in Maseru, the Taiwan-based Nien Hsing has dimmed lights, switched from cellphones to two-way radios for communications between plants and even told its staff to carpool to save gasoline. 
 Not long ago, Lesotho government officials and textile factory managers blitzed Congress, the White House, major retailers in New York and San Francisco and a trade show in Las Vegas with a well-honed argument: Lesotho may not always be cheapest, but it is dependable, honest and squeaky clean on human rights and sweatshop issues that have embarrassed American retailers like Nike in the past. 
 That, the nation's trade minister, Mpho Malie, says bluntly, may not always be true of certain competitors. ''We're not only talking about the quality of garments, but also the quality of workers' conditions on the factory floors -- labor issues, environmental issues,'' he said in an interview in his Maseru office. ''Because in the future, a client will come to you and say, Where are you sourcing from, and what are you doing about the welfare of the people you are sourcing from?'' 
 That argument seems to have won over some of the more socially conscious garment buyers in the United States, like Levi Strauss and Gap, which have maintained or increased their orders here.
 Whether it will play with mainstream American retailers for whom price is the bottom line is more problematic. ''As a country, we think that we are doing something right,'' Mr. Malie said. ''We're saying that tomorrow, there will be questionable things about China -- things that are not only a government question, but that your consumers in the long run are going to question.'' 
 He said that when the honeymoon with Chinese suppliers was over, ''those questions will have to be answered.''

HEADLINE: As Purse Strings Tighten, Let's Make a Stadium Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 11 

 BODY:
He has ordered across-the-board spending cuts and plans to reduce the size of the New Jersey's state payroll.
 He has told legislators to forget about their expensive pet projects and told homeowners they will have to do without their coveted property tax rebates.
 He has resisted the kind of ill-advised borrowing and budget gimmicks that his predecessors used to the put New Jersey's finances into their current precarious state.
 During his four months in office, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey has been such a paragon of fiscal rectitude that many state officials are startled to see him in what has historically been one of the least cost-effective government projects -- a stadium deal with a professional sports franchise. 
 Yet Mr. Codey's aides have been in intense negotiations for months with the New York Giants football team, whose current lease at the Meadowlands does not expire until 2026. Until the talks unexpectedly collapsed this week, the two sides were tantalizingly close to an agreement.
 Mr. Codey argues that the stadium proposal is a bargain for New Jersey taxpayers because the Giants have agreed to pay to demolish the current stadium and foot the entire $700 million bill for building a new one. In addition, Mr. Codey says, the stadium plan would relieve the state of its obligation to perform as much as $300 million in renovations to make the current stadium ''state of the art,'' as its lease requires.
 Not everyone agrees. Critics, including some members of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, point out that the project would have hidden costs for the state. New Jersey has agreed to pay $30 million to build additional sewer and power lines for the project, and the $6.3 million in annual rent the team had agreed to pay is about $10 million less than the state now takes in from operations at Giants Stadium. Mr. Codey and Giants officials contend that the project would generate so much new business that the state would collect at least an additional $10 million in sales taxes.
 But there is a long history of stadium projects that fail to deliver on such projections, according to Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College professor who has studied public financing of sports facilities. That is why many political observers are puzzled that Mr. Codey, who has taken an eat-your-peas approach to state finances, would enter into any such arrangement at a time when the state is facing a budget gap.
 Many Democrats have privately grumbled about Mr. Codey working to accommodate the wealthy owners of the Giants at a time when lawmakers in the Assembly who face re-election this year must confront constituents who are likely to lose some or all of their property tax rebates. Republicans, who have found few reasons to criticize the acting governor's fiscal discipline, have also questioned why the stadium is such a priority.
 ''Governor Codey has finally acknowledged that the state is on the brink of bankruptcy,'' said Douglas Forrester, a Republican candidate for governor. ''As such, I do not believe the state should assume any further commitments that will drive us to it.''
 Even critics of the plan, though, concede that the Giants' proposal asks far less of taxpayers than do many other stadium deals. In New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has proposed that the city completely finance a stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan; in many other communities, sports franchises have exacted expensive giveaways from government officials.
 But some state officials believe it would be unwise of New Jersey to let the Giants operate the stadium and reap the profits from other events there, as the proposal calls for. Others question why New Jersey is negotiating now -- when it already has a lease with 21 years remaining.
 ''This is not the act of someone consumed with fiscal austerity,'' said Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers. ''It almost makes you wonder whether Governor Codey has caught that stadium disease that afflicts so many politicians. They see these grand projects that employ a lot of people and leave behind towering monuments, and they can't help thinking about their own legacy.''
 Mr. Codey dismisses such theories -- and to those who suspect that his better judgment might have been clouded by his unabashed enthusiasm for sports, he has this simple reply: ''I like roundball, not football.''
 In describing his plans for the stadium, however, Mr. Codey does makes it clear that he views the Meadowlands as more than a mere economic issue. He sees it as a symbolic part of New Jersey's psyche. During the past two years, as the Devils and the Nets both announced plans to leave the complex and the Jets began negotiations to move to Manhattan, Mr. Codey said that the Meadowlands appeared to be veering toward obsolescence.
 ''There are polls that show that the thing people are most proud of in New Jersey is the Meadowlands,'' he said. ''Clearly it needed a new vision. And I think we're providing that.''
 Despite the breakdown of the stadium talks this week, Mr. Codey said he still believed that the state and the Giants wouldl reach an agreement that gets a new stadium built by the team. While some may question whether a financially troubled state like New Jersey can afford the image improvement that a new stadium may provide, Mr. Codey said he was confident that history would look kindly upon the project.
 ''There are a lot of people who have doubts,'' he said, ''but this is one of those things that makes sense for the team and for the state. Just wait and see.''

HEADLINE: Mayoral Rival Is on Island to Win Dominicans at Home

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, March 11 

 BODY:
She came bearing vitamins, toys and good will from the borough of Manhattan, home to thousands of relatives of the people of this island nation.
 But the visit Friday by C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, comes as she prepares a run for mayor and joins the jockeying already under way for support in a community that is considered more in play in this year's race for City Hall.
 Ms. Fields kept a whirlwind schedule here in the Dominican Republic, dispensing prenatal vitamin pills at health clinics and hospitals, meeting business and community leaders and attending a reception at the largest university here. 
 With cameras rolling, she hugged several babies, posed for pictures and praised the bonds between Santo Domingo and New York.
 ''This not only allows us to provide pills to women with the hope they will deliver healthy babies but it is important in terms of what we learn not only about the needs but of the strong relations between the Dominican community in Washington Heights and all of New York City and Santo Domingo,'' she said at a local pediatric hospital.
 Though she did not publicly mention her candidacy for mayor during her third trip here in seven years, she allowed that Dominicans would get the message.
 ''Am I building on relationships here that I have had with the Dominican community? Absolutely,'' she said, adding that she would reach out to all Latinos.
 Months ahead of the election, the candidates are making their interest in Dominicans clear. According to the Census Bureau, there are more than 530,000 people of Dominican ancestry in New York. Although many do not vote, they still represent one of the fastest-growing voting blocs in the city.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has visited three times since his election in 2001 and on Sunday he met with the president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, during his trip to New York; Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker and one of four Democrats running for mayor, came here last month. A spokesman for Representative Anthony D. Weiner of Brooklyn and Queens said he visited last April and has not scheduled a visit in the near future, though the spokesman took the opportunity to mention Mr. Weiner's efforts to help the families of the Dominican victims of Flight 587, which crashed in Queens in November 2001 shortly after taking off for Santo Domingo.
 But Ms. Fields's visit underscored the extent to which she could complicate the plans of Fernando Ferrer, a Puerto Rican and former Bronx borough president who is trying to become the city's first Latino mayor.
 In an interview, Ms. Fields acknowledged that she and Mr. Ferrer had met last week and, although no formal agreement was signed, she said with a laugh, they agreed that attacking each other could divide Democrats and could jeopardize the party's chances of retaking City Hall.
 But that, she said, does not stop her from chasing his potential supporters. 
 While Mr. Ferrer is expected to count on support from Puerto Ricans, who make up the majority of Latino voters, some of his rivals are trying to chip away at his support by courting Dominicans.
 Mr. Ferrer is unfazed by his rivals' attempts to appeal to Dominicans, said Chad Clanton, a spokesman for Mr. Ferrer.
 ''Freddy Ferrer is gratified by the support of the Dominican community in the past and he looks forward to their support in this election,'' he said. Mr. Ferrer has visited the Dominican Republic many times, Mr. Clanton said, and maintains close ties with leaders here and in New York. He said his last trip there was several years ago.
 Mr. Ferrer did indeed enjoy overwhelmingly Latino support in both the primary and runoff elections in 2001, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls, which showed that Latinos made up 24 percent of the electorate in the runoff. That support included heavily Dominican neighborhoods, said John Mollenkopf, who analyzes voting data at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
 ''They were pretty excited by him and my guess is it's going to stay that way,'' Mr. Mollenkopf said. ''Even though she represents Washington Heights, she is going to have a hard time breaking through that vote with Ferrer in the race.''
 But Mr. Ferrer was the only candidate in 2001 who directly represented heavily Dominican neighborhoods, and this year Ms. Fields, as Manhattan borough president, has claimed Washington Heights as her turf.
 Some analysts said they believed Ms. Fields's overtures to Dominicans could pose a threat to Mr. Ferrer.
 ''She is well known and liked,'' said Ramona Hernandez, the director of the Dominican Studies Institute at CUNY, noting that over the years Ms. Fields has hired several Dominican advocates.
 Ms. Fields, she said, has won admiration for her efforts to find a building for the Luperon High School, a school for recent immigrants in Washington Heights, and has worked closely with community-based organizations, particularly those directed at Dominican women. Ms. Hernandez said she believed Ms. Fields's being black might also help her, as many Dominicans are black or of mixed race.
 Councilman Miguel Martinez, who accompanied Ms. Fields here and who has not chosen a candidate to support in the primary, said her gender was particularly important because women outnumber men substantially among Dominicans registered to vote.
 Still, he said Mr. Ferrer is popular and his ability to speak Spanish with voters -- Ms. Fields is not fluent -- and his Hispanic heritage is significant. Ultimately, he said, Dominicans want to see who would do the most to improve education and health care and combat unemployment.
 ''It's not good to be fast-growing and the most poor,'' he said, referring to studies showing that Dominicans are among the poorest immigrants. ''Everybody talks about how great the merengue is but we want more than merengue.''
 Whatever the political advantages they offer, Dominicans here seem grateful for the attention and the aid. Ms. Fields, part of a 55-person delegation organized by the Washington Heights Business Improvement District and Friends of Lead-Free Children, helped distribute 6 million lead-free calcium pills, which help prevent pregnant women from passing on lead contamination to their fetuses. The Friends of Lead-Free Children, a nonprofit organization here, paid for the trip, said Carlos Rodriguez, a spokesman for Ms. Fields.

HEADLINE: 'I Have a Nightmare'

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When environmentalists are writing tracts like ''The Death of Environmentalism,'' you know the movement is in deep trouble.
 That essay by two young environmentalists has been whirling around the Internet since last fall, provoking a civil war among tree-huggers for its assertion that ''modern environmentalism, with all of its unexamined assumptions, outdated concepts and exhausted strategies, must die so that something new can live.'' Sadly, the authors, Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, are right.
 The U.S. environmental movement is unable to win on even its very top priorities, even though it has the advantage of mostly being right. Oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge may be approved soon, and there's been no progress whatsoever in the U.S. on what may be the single most important issue to Earth in the long run: climate change. 
 The fundamental problem, as I see it, is that environmental groups are too often alarmists. They have an awful track record, so they've lost credibility with the public. Some do great work, but others can be the left's equivalents of the neocons: brimming with moral clarity and ideological zeal, but empty of nuance. (Industry has also hyped risks with wildly exaggerated warnings that environmental protections will entail a terrible economic cost.) 
 ''The Death of Environmentalism'' resonated with me. I was once an environmental groupie, and I still share the movement's broad aims, but I'm now skeptical of the movement's ''I Have a Nightmare'' speeches. 
 In the 1970's, the environmental movement was convinced that the Alaska oil pipeline would devastate the Central Arctic caribou herd. Since then, it has quintupled.
 When I first began to worry about climate change, global cooling and nuclear winter seemed the main risks. As Newsweek said in 1975: ''Meteorologists disagree about the cause and extent of the cooling trend but they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century.''
 This record should teach environmentalists some humility. The problems are real, but so is the uncertainty. Environmentalists were right about DDT's threat to bald eagles, for example, but blocking all spraying in the third world has led to hundreds of thousands of malaria deaths.
 Likewise, environmentalists were right to warn about population pressures, but they overestimated wildly. Paul Ehrlich warned in ''The Population Bomb'' that ''the battle to feed humanity is over. Hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.'' On my bookshelf is an even earlier book, ''Too Many Asians,'' with a photo of a mass of Indians on the cover. The book warns that the threat from relentlessly multiplying Asians is ''even more grave than that of nuclear warfare.''
 Jared Diamond, author of the fascinating new book ''Collapse,'' which shows how some civilizations in effect committed suicide by plundering their environments, says false alarms aren't a bad thing. Professor Diamond argues that if we accept false alarms for fires, then why not for the health of our planet? But environmental alarms have been screeching for so long that, like car alarms, they are now just an irritating background noise.
 At one level, we're all environmentalists now. The Pew Research Center found that more than three-quarters of Americans agree that ''this country should do whatever it takes to protect the environment.'' Yet support for the environment is coupled with a suspicion of environmental groups. ''The Death of Environmentalism'' notes that a poll in 2000 found that 41 percent of Americans considered environmental activists to be ''extremists.'' There are many sensible environmentalists, of course, but overzealous ones have tarred the entire field.
 The loss of credibility is tragic because reasonable environmentalists -- without alarmism or exaggerations -- are urgently needed.
 Given the uncertainties and trade-offs, priority should go to avoiding environmental damage that is irreversible, like extinctions, climate change and loss of wilderness. And irreversible changes are precisely what are at stake with the Bush administration's plans to drill in the Arctic wildlife refuge, to allow roads in virgin wilderness and to do essentially nothing on global warming. That's an agenda that will disgrace us before our grandchildren.
 So it's critical to have a credible, nuanced, highly respected environmental movement. And right now, I'm afraid we don't have one.

HEADLINE: The Journey of Majestic Mapp

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

DATELINE: CARROLLTON, Ga. 

 BODY:
The quintessential New York City basketball dream began in the perfect place, amid the salty breeze of Coney Island. 
 Edward Mapp took his 6-year-old son, Majestic, down to the carnival booths, propped him up on a box and let him shoot baskets. Majestic swished all five through the net, winning a giant teddy bear. 
 From then on, Edward Mapp took little Majestic out every day to the playgrounds near the Douglass Houses on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where he shot 500 jumpers a day. His form was perfect, just like the dream. 
 Mapp blossomed into the best player in New York, starring for four seasons at St. Raymond's in the Bronx. He was selected for the McDonald's All-American team.
 After being recruited by several colleges, Mapp chose the University of Virginia. He planned to play there for three years, earn his degree and then complete his dream by shaking David Stern's hand at the National Basketball Association draft and signing a multimillion-dollar contract. 
 But Mapp's journey involved a major detour when he injured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the summer of 2000. Instead of driving a tricked-out sport utility vehicle and hopscotching the country on charter flights, Mapp tools around tiny Carrollton in a maroon 1997 Buick Century with a cracked windshield. In his sixth year of college, Mapp plays for the University of West Georgia, and his team weaves through sleepy Southern towns on a bus. 
 It took five operations before Mapp's knee finally healed. But his story is not the conventional melodrama of an athlete who falls apart after his dream is dashed. Instead, his is a tale of an opportunity exploited: Mapp, now 23, earned two degrees from Virginia, an undergraduate degree in economics and a graduate degree in education. 
 And now he is living in a one-bedroom apartment with bare walls, giving college basketball one final shot so he can avoid a nagging question. ''I didn't want to end up,'' he said, ''with everyone saying, 'What ever happened to Majestic?'''
 I jump stop, pause, 
 like a DVD
 Silence as if I was sleeping like a baby
 hear a loud pop; gun shot
 it was my knee
 -- From Majestic Mapp's poem, ''My Downfall,'' 1/17/02
 The spiral began just days before Mapp planned to return to Virginia for his sophomore year in the summer of 2000. He was playing pickup ball at St. Raymond's. He drove to the basket and went into his trademark move, a baseline jump stop. He crumpled to the floor. 
 Mapp had torn the A.C.L. in his right knee. He went to Virginia for surgery to repair the tear. 
 But the injury did not heal properly after the surgery. An infection in the knee forced a second operation. Mapp's knee still did not feel right, so he went for a second opinion and eventually decided to have surgery yet again, this time in California. After that, Mapp required two more operations to clean out scar tissue. 
 Dr. Frank McCue, who performed the first operation, said he stood strongly behind the surgery. ''He had a bad injury,'' McCue said. ''A certain number of them lose something. Lose speed. Lose range of motion. I didn't see anything wrong with the operation.'' 
 But Dr. Arthur Ting, a surgeon in the San Francisco Bay area who performed the third operation, said the first surgery had not fixed the problem. ''The surgery failed,'' Ting said. ''It happens. For whatever reason, it failed. It didn't take. He didn't have a re-injury. He never got back to injure it again.''
 Ting said that instead of grafting tissue from Mapp's body to repair the ligament, as McCue had done, he used tendon tissue from a cadaver to repair the torn A.C.L. 
 ''I have found that in very high-level athletes where speed is the utmost importance,'' Ting said, ''you don't want to take his hamstring or patella if you don't have to.''
 Mapp still grimaces when he talks about his struggles with his knee. He and his family briefly considered filing a lawsuit against Virginia over the first operation, but they never pursued it. Mapp said he grew up in a poor, hard-working family that believed in earning everything they got. So he pressed on. 
 ''Basically, I had one surgery, and from there it went downhill,'' he said. ''I rehabbed and it never got better. I don't know what the cause was, but it was just bad. I don't know. I don't like to point fingers. I just say that God made me have five surgeries.'' 

Leaving Bad Luck Behind
 The black notebook in which Mapp writes his poetry had not come out of his safe since he arrived in Carrollton last summer. He used poetry as an outlet while at Virginia, during the difficult two and a half years of rehab and the subsequent season and a half of lackluster play. 
 At West Georgia, a Division II university that specializes in hard-luck transfers, he has been reunited with a high school teammate, Darnell Miller, and has fallen in love again with basketball. Mapp is taking 12 credits of courses at West Georgia, but he acknowledged that he was here entirely because of basketball. 
 He would have preferred to play out his career at Virginia. But after Mapp had been there for five years, Coach Pete Gillen told him that he was not being invited to return for his final season of eligibility. 
 After missing two seasons because of the knee injury, Mapp applied for a medical hardship and was granted one more year of eligibility. But Gillen said Mapp had not shown that he could play at the level of the Atlantic Coast Conference after the injury, and he had already earned two degrees. 
 ''We love you,'' Gillen said he told Mapp, ''but scholarships are valuable.''
 Gillen said he would be honored if his own son grew up to be like Mapp, whose toughness and determination are widely admired. 
 ''It just boggled your mind, his ability to endure and push forward when he kept getting kicked in the teeth time after time,'' said Tom Herrion, a former Virginia assistant who is now the coach at the College of Charleston. 
 Until this season, Gillen had struggled to recruit a point guard to replace Mapp; potential recruits were reluctant to commit to Virginia because of the prospect of Mapp returning. 
 ''That poor kid didn't have any luck.'' Gillen said. ''We've had some bad luck. That's the way it is. Injuries are part of the business.'' 
 Discipline, Determination and Dedication
 will lead me to my Final Destination
 because it's my Destiny that I'm destined to be
 -- ''The Process,'' 1/18/02
 It was not until December that the swagger returned to Mapp's game. He hit two 3-pointers in the final minute of a game with Clayton State, forcing overtime. West Georgia won the game, and Mapp finished with 26 points. 
 He had played so poorly in the team's opening exhibition game that West Georgia Coach Ed Murphy questioned whether Mapp should even be in the rotation. But Mapp has evolved into the team's leading scorer, averaging 18.2 points a game. He has also won over his coach; Murphy said Mapp was the epitome of humility. 
 ''If someone tells me in 10 years that Majestic is a senator or a congressman, I won't be surprised at all,'' Murphy said. ''His story is amazing, a kid from Harlem who gets two degrees and goes through what he does. Then you meet him and you're not surprised at all.''
 The Braves (23-6) are seeded No. 3 in the South Regional of the N.C.A.A. Division II tournament. They play a first-round game today against Central Arkansas in Montevallo, Ala. 
 Mapp and Miller, who transferred from George Washington, have played so well that some N.B.A. scouts have made the trip to Carrollton. More have come to see Miller, a 6-foot-5 point guard who is considered the better professional prospect of the two. 
 But Ryan Blake, the N.B.A.'s assistant director of scouting, said that Mapp looked healthy, had a textbook jump shot and should be able to play at a high level overseas or in the N.B.A.'s Development League. 
 ''I think they can both make some money playing basketball,'' Blake said. 
 As Mapp's circuitous journey through college basketball comes to a close, his dream is still in sight. 
 ''I don't even want to think about getting another job,'' he said. ''I want to play at the next level. All I want is someone to give me a chance.''

HEADLINE: Harbingers of Harder Times

 BODY:
At $58.3 billion, the United States' trade deficit for January exceeded everyone's worst expectations. The huge mismatch reported yesterday between imports and exports just missed breaking the monthly record, set last November, and is all the more remarkable for occurring in a month when the price of oil actually declined.
 The trade deficit is the single most important factor in measuring the extent to which the nation lives beyond its means. As such, it should force us to own up to the dangers of rampant deficit spending. But the White House is showing no sign of action, as if doing nothing might make the problem smaller. 
 In response to yesterday's trade deficit figure, the dollar weakened against the euro and the yen, and traders predicted further declines in the weeks and months ahead. That, in turn, contributed to a drop in stock and bond prices. Such gyrations are certainly not unprecedented. The dollar has been on a downward trajectory for three straight years and was going into a fresh skid even before the latest trade deficit figure was released. 
 That slump was largely in response to recent reports, some later denied, that Asian central bankers may begin moving their huge dollar holdings into other currencies. That would mean higher interest rates in the United States because the government would need to sweeten Treasury yields, and higher interest rates imply further declines in stock and bond prices. A declining dollar also risks higher inflation; more expensive imports give domestic producers an excuse to raise prices.
 There may be more trouble to come. Next week, the government will release figures showing how much capital flowed into the United States from abroad in January. Those numbers were down by nearly one-third in December. If next week's report is disappointing, the logical response from the currency markets would be to sell dollars -- again raising the threat of all the possible side effects. 
 Since the trade deficit is intimately connected to the federal budget deficit, the best way to reduce the trade imbalance is to reduce the budget gap. But President Bush is calling for more tax cuts, politically implausible spending cuts and costly Social Security privatization. Both parties in Congress must address the twin trade and budget deficits -- or risk being forced to do so by events beyond their control.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widens on Record Imports

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
America's appetite for foreign imports broke all records in January, reaching $159.1 billion and contributing to a monthly trade deficit that is the second highest on record. The $58.3 billion trade deficit defied predictions that a weakened dollar and lower oil prices would narrow the United States' trade gap.
 Instead, the Commerce Department said on Friday that American consumers continued to buy foreign-made goods at an avid pace, raising the trade deficit 4.5 percent from $55.7 billion in December. January's trade figures included a 75 percent surge in Chinese textile and apparel shipments, reflecting the end to global quotas and the beginning of what some experts see as a future of China supplying as much as 70 percent of the United States textile and apparel market. 
 The Bush administration said on Friday that the latest trade figures should be seen as testimony to the strength of the American economy and its role as an engine of global growth.
 ''We view these figures as an affirmation that we're growing faster than our trading partners by as much as 2 percent, and we need them to take steps so they can grow and buy our products,'' Rob Nichols, the spokesman for Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, said in an interview.
 But Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, was far less sanguine. He said he would push for immediate action in Congress, beginning with safeguards to limit imports of textile goods from China. The limits, which had been approved by the administration, were blocked by a court injunction.
 ''We are obviously in a free fall here, with deficit after deficit, and it just cries out for action,'' Mr. Cardin said in an interview.
 China, however, is also pushing along the global economy, spurring growth especially in Asia.
 Yet while most other industrialized countries enjoy a trade surplus with China, the United States had a deficit of $15.3 billion in January, the largest with a single country on record. China accounted for a fourth of the trade shortfall in January. Among other major trading partners, the United States had a $6.2 billion deficit with Japan and $6.1 billion with Canada. 
 The imbalance with China has led to increasingly loud accusations that Beijing engages in unfair trading practices, from hidden subsidies to undervaluing its currency. 
 Representative Clay Shaw, the Republican from Florida who heads the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he planned to hold hearings on the trading practices of China.
 As bad as the trade figures were for January, some analysts say the imbalance will grow.
 ''Most ominously, matters should get worse because of the jump in oil prices in February,'' said Ashraf Laidi, the chief currency analyst at the M.G. Financial Group in New York, who predicted that next month's deficit could hit $62 billion.
 Analysts had hoped that a drop in the price of imported oil in January would help diminish the trade imbalance. The Commerce Department said the average price of imported oil was $35.35 a barrel in January, the lowest since July.
 The weakened dollar was also expected to spur export growth, which it did by 0.4 percent, but not enough to offset the import growth of 1.9 percent.
 The dollar continued to weaken on Friday, initially falling against the euro and the yen after the January trade figures were announced. It later recovered, and the dollar closed down 0.2 percent with the euro valued at $1.3453, compared with $1.3424 Thursday. Against the yen, the dollar was off 0.1 percent for the day, at 103.88 yen.
 News of the deficit also weighed on the bond markets, where investors are worried that a weaker dollar might discourage foreign investment in Treasury securities. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.54 percent, from 4.47 percent Thursday. That is the highest yield since July. The price of the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 19/32, to 95 22/32. 
 Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers, said there were several reasons the export figures were disappointing. Like the administration, he cited the fact that Europe and Japan were buying fewer goods because of slow economic growth. But Mr. Naroff said American companies seemed to be raising the prices of their goods for exports rather than taking advantage of the weaker dollar to make their products more attractive to foreign buyers.
 With no relief in sight, some analysts are suggesting there are deeper problems behind the trade deficit.
 Thea M. Lea, the senior trade adviser for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that the administration should develop policies that encourage and reward companies for producing in the United States, as does China, Japan, and European nations.
 ''To be a cutting-edge nation in this global economy,'' Ms. Lea said, ''we need to take steps to shape taxes, improve research, examine trade policy and improve education to make it possible for our companies and our workers to succeed in the global marketplace.''

HEADLINE: In New Book, Professor Sees a 'Mania' in U.S. for Possessions and Status

BYLINE: By IRENE LACHER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Aldous Huxley long ago warned of a future in which love was beside the point and happiness a simple matter of consuming mass-produced goods and plenty of soma, a drug engineered for pleasure. More than 70 years later, Dr. Peter C. Whybrow, the director of the Semel Institute of Neuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, Los Angeles, has seen the future, and the society he describes isn't all that distant from Huxley's brave new world, although the soma, it seems, is in ourselves.
 In his new book, ''American Mania: When More Is Not Enough'' (W.W. Norton & Company), Dr. Whybrow argues that in the age of globalization, Americans are addictively driven by the brain's pleasure centers to live turbocharged lives in pursuit of status and possessions at the expense of the only things that can truly make us happy: relationships with other people. 
 ''In our compulsive drive for more,'' writes Dr. Whybrow, 64, a professor of psychiatry and bio-behavioral science, ''we are making ourselves sick.'' 
 His book is part of a new critical genre that likens society to a mental patient. The prognosis is grim. In ''American Mania,'' he argues that the country is on the downswing of a manic episode set off by the Internet bubble of the 1990's.
 ''It's a metaphor that helps guide us,'' he said, perched on a chair in the study of his rambling high-rise apartment near U.C.L.A. ''I think we've shot through happiness as one does in hypomania and come out the other end, and we're not quite sure where we are.
 ''In fact, I think happiness lies somewhere behind us. This frenzy we've adopted in search of what we hope is happiness and perfection is in fact a distraction, like mania is a distraction.''
 ''American Mania'' is his fourth book for the general public about meaty psychiatric matters. An expert in manic depression and the endocrinology of the central nervous system, he has dissected depression and its relatives (''A Mood Apart'' and ''Mood Disorders'') as well as the winter blahs (''The Hibernation Response''). 
 Educating the public has been an abiding concern in a long career that began with training in psychiatry and endocrinology in his native London and in North Carolina. In 1970, Dr. Whybrow became chairman of the psychiatry department at Dartmouth Medical School and at the University of Pennsylvania. He moved to U.C.L.A. in 1997. 
 While the Gordon Gekkos of the world have long had their critics, Dr. Whybrow sees the Enrons and the Worldcoms -- the mess left by unfettered capitalism -- not as a moral problem, but as a behavioral one. 
 ''The outbreak of greed we've seen, especially in business, is partly a function of the changing contingencies we've given businessmen,'' he said. ''If I say to you, 'You can make yourself extremely rich by holding up the share price until such time that you cash out your shares, which are coming due in another six months,' it takes an incredibly unusual person who'll say: 'The share price is going down? I'm afraid I lost that one.' There is an offer of affluence there which the person cannot refuse. They don't need that extra money, but they want that extra money.'' 
 People are biologically wired to want it, he contends. We seek more than we need because consumption activates the neurotransmitter dopamine, which rewards us with pleasure, traveling along the same brain pathways as do drugs like caffeine and cocaine. Historically, he says, built-in social brakes reined in our acquisitive instincts. In the capitalist utopia envisioned by Adam Smith in the 18th century, self-interest was tempered by the competing demands of the marketplace and community. But with globalization, the idea of doing business with neighbors one must face the next day is a quaint memory, and all bets are off.
 Other countries are prey to the same forces, Dr. Whybrow says, but the problem is worse here because we are a nation of immigrants, genetically self-selected to favor individualism and novelty. Americans are competitive, restless and driven to succeed. And we have succeeded. 
 But the paradox of prosperity is that we are too busy to enjoy it. And the competitiveness that gooses the economy, coupled with the decline of social constraints, has conspired to make the rich much richer, he asserts, leaving most of the country behind while government safety nets get skimpier. 
 Dr. Whybrow cites United States government statistics that are sobering. Thirty percent of the population is anxious, double the percentage of a decade ago. Depression is rising too, especially among people born after 1966, with 10 percent more reporting depression than did people born before that year.
 With the rise of the information age in the 1990's, when the global marketplace began staying open 24 hours a day, American mania reached full flower, Dr. Whybrow said. And now that the nation has retreated from that manic peak, we should stop and survey the damage. 
 ''Neurobiology teaches us that we're reward-driven creatures on the one side, which is great,'' he said. ''It's a fun part of life. But we also love each other and we want to be tied together in a social context. So if you know that, why aren't we thinking about a civil society that looks at both sides of the balance rather than just fostering individualism? Because fostering individualism will be great for us and it will last a little bit longer, but I believe it's a powerful negative influence upon this country and it's not what was originally intended. Should we be thinking about whether this is the society we had in mind when we started this experiment 200 years ago or are we perhaps moving too fast for our own good?''
 Dr. Whybrow's analysis of the mania afflicting contemporary society has been praised as acute, but he has been faulted for failing to prescribe any political or economic action as an antidote.
 ''Whybrow does offer an interesting version of the social and cultural contradictions of capitalism,'' Michael Roth, president of the California College of the Arts, wrote in a review last month in The San Francisco Chronicle, ''but it is one that leaves us without much sense of how we might reconstruct the social and political system to create more meaningful work and a more equitable distribution of wealth and of hope.'' 
 But for Dr. Whybrow, with globalization here to stay, the solution lies with the individual: It's up to each of us to ruminate on our lives and slow down enough so that we can limit our appetites and find a better balance between work and family.
 He suggested following the example of a man his friend saw running along the beach: ''A high tide washed all the little fish onto the beach where they were all gasping for breath. So here's this fellow scooping up each fish and throwing them back into the sea, and my friend goes up to the fellow and says: 'This is a fruitless task. It's not going to make any difference.' And the fellow picks up a fish, throws it into the sea and says, 'To this one it does.'''

HEADLINE: Europe and U.S. Agree on Carrot-and-Stick Approach to Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
Europe's leading nations, yielding to American demands for a tougher stance on Iran, warned Friday that any failure by the Iranian government to give up its suspected nuclear arms program would leave them ''no choice'' but to seek punishments at the United Nations Security Council.
 The European warning came as a diplomatic counterpart to a statement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice confirming that the United States, too, had shifted its position on Iran -- in its case toward a more conciliatory approach of offering limited economic incentives if Iran cooperated on nuclear matters.
 Ms. Rice said Mr. Bush would drop his objections to Iran's application to the World Trade Organization and would ''consider, on a case-by-case basis, the licensing of spare parts of Iranian civilian aircraft.'' 
 ''We share the desire of European governments to secure Iran's adherence to its obligations through peaceful and diplomatic means,'' she said in the statement. ''Today's announcement demonstrates that we are prepared to take practical steps to support European efforts to this end.''
 Taken together, the statements, issued in an orchestrated fashion in Washington and Brussels, opened a new phase in efforts to defuse the crisis over Iran's nuclear program.
 Now that Europe and the United States are in harmony on specific incentives and threats, there is an expectation that talks can move forward. In the last two years Iran's nuclear program has moved up on the agenda for the United States and Europe, but there has been a gulf over how sternly to deal with it.
 European officials said the agreement's importance went beyond Iran, because it showed that President Bush had decided to throw his support behind the effort. What that also represented, some in the administration acknowledged, was a White House move to restrain administration hawks for now.
 Ms. Rice and other officials acknowledged that Mr. Bush moved only after becoming convinced that he was in danger of being blamed if the talks failed because he had repeatedly rebuffed European demands to join in the incentives.
 The administration has been sensitive to the charge by conservatives and others that going too far to placate the Europeans could put the administration in the position of legitimizing Iran's government, overlooking its links to terrorism and rewarding it for bad behavior.
 But Ms. Rice and other officials said the administration's view of Iran as a rogue state was unchanged. All that had changed, she said, was the way of dealing with Iran.
 No timetable was set for negotiations. Ms. Rice and other officials hinted that a quick deadline might force Iran to walk away and resume suspended uranium enrichment.
 A European official, endorsing that view, said: ''Iran right now has suspended its activities, verified by inspections. That means we don't have to be in such a hurry. If the Iranians try to cheat, we're in a position to know it.''
 American and European officials also emphasized Friday that their joint agreement meant that, at some point in talks, the West would raise concerns about Iran's support of Hezbollah and other groups.
 The announcements, a culmination of weeks of negotiations led by Ms. Rice, clarified aspects of her talks. For example, American and European officials said the statements made clear that the West would not tolerate Iran's enriching uranium for civilian nuclear energy, despite international accords that allow it.
 A senior administration official said in a telephone briefing that Iran's record of hiding an arms program in the guise of a civilian enrichment program, an allegation that Iran denies, meant that the West had to impose a much tighter rein.
 European and American experts say, in addition, that there is no technical means for inspectors to keep Iran from expanding a low-level enrichment program for civilian purposes to a program for weapons.
 The announcement was the second time in a week that the United States had softened its approach toward a longstanding adversary while insisting that its basic view had not changed. Earlier in the week, the administration toned down demands on Hezbollah in an effort to concentrate on getting Shiite backing for a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon.
 ''Nobody is blind to Hezbollah's past activities,'' said a senior administration official involved at the highest level on Middle East policy, asking not to be identified because he did not want to be seen as undercutting administration approaches.
 ''The question is whether it pays for us to play into the hands of those who want to set us up in a confrontation with them,'' he added. ''If we want to increase pressure on Hezbollah to move away from terrorism, and support a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, it's important for us to be careful about our rhetoric.''
 Sometimes, awkward-looking tactical adjustments are necessary, the official said. ''We are not changing our fundamental views about Iran or Hezbollah,'' he added. ''Our strategy is clear. What we're looking at is how you adapt your diplomacy to fit the needs of the moment. It's what diplomacy is all about.''

HEADLINE: Rail Link to J.F.K. Airport Falls Short in the Financing

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA and SEWELL CHAN; Ian Urbina reported from Washington for this article and Sewell Chan from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
Plans for a new rail link connecting Lower Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport hit a snag on Thursday as Congressional tax analysts estimated that the federal tax credits that New York City and state officials want to use for the project are worth about $1.3 billion less than the officials had hoped.
 Though the Congressional estimate does not jeopardize the $6 billion project, it will force New York lawmakers to scramble for other sources of federal money to make up the $1.3 billion at a time when federal transportation money is in short supply, especially in the Northeast.
 ''The numbers aren't what we had wanted, though it's better than it could have been,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, explaining that the tax incentives could have been valued even lower. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton concurred, saying that ''$700 million is a significant start, but it is not the commitment the White House gave the governor and the people of New York.'' 
 Mr. Schumer added, ''In the end, I think the funding will fall in place because we are simply asking for money that was already promised to us.''
 Proponents of the rail link had argued that the project would not require new federal money since city and state officials are willing to use federal tax incentives that they estimate are worth $2 billion. President Bush supported those estimates in numbers included in his budget last month.
 But the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan Congressional panel that reviews budget and tax figures to ensure their accuracy, disagreed. The committee determined that the city's federal tax credits were worth only about $727 million in aid and that taking these into account, the overall cost to the federal government for the project would be about $1.27 billion.
 After the committee's decision, Gov. George E. Pataki said: ''The president has indicated clearly in his budget and other statements that he agrees that Congress should send us $2 billion for the rail link project. I look forward to working with our delegation to meet that goal.'' 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg referred to the decision as ''a positive development and another step forward in the revitalization of Lower Manhattan.''
 On Wednesday, Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, will testify in Washington before the Senate Finance Committee on behalf of the link.
 Though disappointed, advocates for the rail link said they were not surprised by the Congressional estimates.
 Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a major trade association, said it was never clear that the $2 billion in unused tax credits was worth nearly the same amount in real terms.
 ''I would have guessed the first numbers coming in would be lower than we'd hoped for,'' Mr. Spinola said. ''Hopefully we -- the city and the state -- will have an opportunity to respond and get that number up a bit.''
 Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, said he had feared that the tax committee would find even more of the $2 billion in unused credits to be worthless and that the project would have even less than $727 million in credits to start with. ''I think this is a major step forward,'' said Mr. Weisbrod, whose organization is a business improvement district that is financed through property taxes on local companies.
 The proposed link is to include a tunnel to be built under the East River, linking a transit center planned for Fulton Street in Manhattan to the Atlantic Avenue subway and commuter rail terminal in Brooklyn. From there, the service would use existing Long Island Rail Road tracks to connect to the AirTrain terminal in Jamaica, Queens.
 The AirTrain, which makes an eight-minute trip between the Jamaica terminal and the airport, opened in 2003 and was built with specifications similar to those used by the subway and railroad, so its track could extend into Manhattan. A so-called ''one-seat'' ride between the airport and Manhattan has been a goal of transportation planners for decades.
 A feasibility study completed last May by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and three other agencies projected that the tunnel would serve 4,000 to 6,000 airport travelers and 100,000 Long Island Rail Road commuters a day.
 The study estimated that link would reduce the travel time between the airport and Lower Manhattan to 36 minutes from 55 and between Jamaica and Fulton Street to 21 or 22 minutes from 36.
 Even if Senators Schumer and Clinton, Representative Charles B. Rangel and other New York leaders managed to secure the full $2 billion in federal aid, that would be only one-third the cost of the project, which could be completed by 2013, according to official estimates.
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has proposed contributing $400 million toward the project as part of its new five-year capital program, which has not yet been approved by Albany. 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the region's three major airports, has committed $560 million to the project.

HEADLINE: Interpublic Group Hires 17 Who Resigned From Saatchi

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The struggling Interpublic Group of Companies, which owns agencies in fields like advertising and public relations, gained and lost ground yesterday in its effort to overcome operational and financial difficulties.
 On the plus side, Interpublic hired 17 people who resigned en masse last month from the New York office of Saatchi & Saatchi, owned by an Interpublic competitor, the Publicis Groupe, where they had worked on the General Mills account.
 Although the ''Saatchi 17,'' as trade publications have labeled the executives, are not bringing the General Mills account with them, they will work at an agency Interpublic opened this week, specializing in advertising for products sold to children and families -- like the cereal, dairy and snack brands they handled at Saatchi New York. 
 On the minus side, Interpublic disclosed that it had delayed filing financial data scheduled to be released this month after discovering problems related to hundreds of acquisitions made under previous management from 1996 to 2001.
 Because previous results may need to be restated as Interpublic continues addressing ''material weakness in internal control,'' the chief executive, Michael I. Roth, said Interpublic would defer filing results for the fourth quarter and 2004 as well as the annual report.
 ''Although painful at times,'' Mr. Roth said in a memorandum to employees, ''it is the right thing to do.'' 
 Painful it was. Standard & Poor's reduced its rating of Interpublic debt by two notches, to BB- from BB+, while Fitch Ratings put Interpublic's credit rating on negative watch and cut it by three notches, to B+ from BB+.
 Interpublic shares, which closed Thursday at $12.35, fell yesterday by as much as 3 percent, to $11.98, before closing up 1.3 percent, or 16 cents, at $12.51.
 The ''Saatchi 17'' all left Feb. 14, three days after the agency announced that their boss, Mike Burns, global General Mills account director, would depart in mid-March. They soon signed letters of intent to join Interpublic, which led trade publications to speculate that the General Mills account would follow them there.
 But on Feb. 17, General Mills, based in Minneapolis, said it was ''looking forward to continuing'' to work with Saatchi & Saatchi, then declined further comment, which it did again yesterday. 
 The agency said it filed a lawsuit yesterday against Mr. Burns in New York State Supreme Court on grounds including breach of fiduciary duty, seeking ''damages and other relief,'' declining further comment. Mr. Burns did not respond to a message left on his home answering machine.

HEADLINE: Commission on Poverty in Africa Seeks a Doubling of Aid

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
A commission on Africa led by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain called on rich countries yesterday to double aid to Africa and simultaneously challenged African nations to root out pervasive corruption. 
 At a news conference in London, Mr. Blair said the impoverishment of Africa and the needless deaths of millions of young children there each year presented ''the fundamental moral challenge of our time.''
 The commission, which includes President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia among its members, contends that many African governments are already improving their practices and noted that democracy was on the rise. 
 Africa could effectively spend an additional $25 billion a year on health, education, rural roads, small-scale irrigation, railways and a raft of other needs, roughly doubling current levels of aid, the commission says.
 Its members come down firmly in the camp of those who believe foreign aid works, but their report also warns that donor nations will have to pool resources and simplify reporting requirements to avoid overloading African governments whose ranks of skilled managers are thin. 
 The commission also said Britain, the United States and European nations should abolish the huge agricultural subsidies that give their farmers an unfair advantage over Africans. The amount that rich countries spent on such subsidies in 2002 was the equivalent of the income of all the people in sub-Saharan Africa combined, the report said. 
 The commission's report arrives when global poverty is rising on the international agenda. Advocates and development experts alike say there is both a new sense of the possibilities and risks as billions more dollars in aid come available. 
 ''It doesn't take many high-profile examples of aid going astray to undermine the case for aid,'' said Kevin Watkins, director of the Human Development Report Office at the United Nations Development Program.
 The commission's support for a dramatic ratcheting up of aid echoes the recommendation earlier this year of a team of experts sponsored by the United Nations and led by Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs: that aid to poor countries should be doubled.
 At the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, business executives, politicians and academics put poverty at the top of their list of priorities. Last month, the world's wealthiest nations agreed to raise contributions to the World Bank's international development program to $34 billion, from $23 billion.
 This year, Britain is the leader of the Group of 8 industrialized nations. In that role, Mr. Blair will push for a sweeping plan to diminish poverty in Africa when the leaders of those nations meet in Scotland in July, and the commission's report will serve as the basis for his pitch. 
 Like the United Nations team, the commission said rich nations should set clear timetables to give seven-tenths of 1 percent of their national income in aid -- a step that Britain, France, Spain, Ireland, Belgium and Finland have taken, but not the United States, which gives less than two-tenths of 1 percent in aid, the smallest percentage of any major donor. 
 The leaders of many nations, including President Bush, supported a declaration in 2002 promising to ''make concrete efforts'' toward the target of seven-tenths of 1 percent. The Bush administration has increased aid to 15-hundredths of 1 percent, and its new budget proposals would increase it to levels near the two-tenths mark. 
 But a spokesman at the National Security Council said yesterday that the United States had no intention of committing itself to a specific timetable to reach the seven-tenths target, even as he praised the commission for stressing the importance of improved governance and private sector investment, among other things.
 ''We disagree with the global quantitative aid targets,'' said the spokesman, who declined to be quoted by name. ''They bear no relation to recipient countries' ability to use these resources effectively. And they incorrectly imply that foreign aid alone can eradicate poverty.''
 The poverty debate will likely peak in September, when world leaders will gather at the United Nations to measure progress toward the so-called millennium development goals to reduce poverty, which were set in 2000.
 Lately, the British leadership on global poverty has been center stage.
 ''There's a little friendly competition, and I think the United States does notice the British are getting a lot of attention,'' said Steven Radelet, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank. ''That may provide some impetus for the United States to increase spending.'' 
 While the report of the Blair-led commission says Africa is ready for a huge new infusion of aid, it also sharply defined corruption and ineffective governance as critical issues. ''What is clear is that if Africa does not create the right conditions for development, then any amount of outside support will fail,'' the report says.
 At a news conference yesterday in London, Sir Bob Geldof, the rock musician and organizer and a member of the commission, singled out two African leaders for sharp criticism. 
 He said the Ugandan leader, Yoweri Museveni, was trying to stay in power for life. ''Get a grip, Museveni,'' he said. ''Your time's up -- go away!'' And he called President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe an ''aging creep,'' demanding that he leave in order to ''let Africa breathe.'' 
 Mr. Blair was more diplomatic, but blunt nonetheless. ''We have told the truth about Africa,'' he said. ''We've been frank about corruption and conflict. But we are also frank in criticizing rich countries about how they've failed to fulfill their promises on aid and trade.''
 And he returned to the idea that Africa's plight is a moral issue. 
 ''I fear my own conscience on Africa,'' he said, ''and I fear the judgment of future generations when history properly calculates the gravity of the suffering around us. I fear those generations asking this question: How could wealthy people so aware of such suffering and capable of acting simply turn away and busy themselves with other things?''

 BODY:

METROPOLIS
By Elizabeth Gaffney.
461 pp. Random House. $24.95.
 THERE are only two basic plots in fiction, novelists occasionally say -- someone goes on a journey or (its mirror) a stranger comes to town. In ''Metropolis,'' her long, slow-moving first novel, Elizabeth Gaffney opts for plot No. 2. The stranger is a young German immigrant who dreams of becoming a stonemason on a cathedral. The town is New York in the 1860's and 70's. And the action is kaleidoscopic, immersing us in the world of Lower Manhattan's post-Civil War slums, tenements and gangs.
 It's a world already made familiar by Herbert Asbury's ''Gangs of New York,'' famously filmed by Martin Scorsese. Gaffney draws on Asbury's book for names (Piker Ryan, Maggie the Dove), for historical episodes like the murder of the Greenwich Street brush manufacturer James Noe and for irresistibly colorful details like Dandy Johnny Dolan's personal thumb-fitted copper eye-gouger. But then, with considerable originality, she ensnares her fictional immigrant hero in Dolan's infamous Whyo gang and invents for that notoriously vicious group a female auxiliary known as the Why Nots -- whose members all communicate by means of a highly artistic (if largely implausible) secret language of songs, whistles and animal calls devised by Dolan's ingenious mother.
 This kind of urban crime novel was born in the 18th century with ''Moll Flanders,'' and its themes have changed very little in nearly 300 years: the metropolis is always a place for anonymity and alienation, liberating disguises and vast impersonal economic forces. Gaffney takes full advantage of these conventions. Her hero begins as a German-speaking stableman in P. T. Barnum's museum, switches names at least twice to evade the police and ends as Irish Frank Harris, with an inheritance and a brogue. (Moll Flanders meets Horatio Alger.) In the course of these metamorphoses, he works at a number of backbreaking jobs, moving literally and metaphorically up from the city sewers, which he cleans, to the wind-swept and cathedral-like towers of the Brooklyn Bridge, which he helps build. It's a deft way to create an urban panorama, and Gaffney's lovingly precise descriptions of Victorian engineering, underground ''dirt-catchers'' and cooked-gravel street paving will fascinate most readers.
 Inevitably, Harris has a female counterpart, the splendidly named ''hot-corn girl'' Beanie O'Gamhna, who is also an immigrant and a dreamer. (In fictional, if not Euclidean, geometry parallels always meet.) Like the other women in the story, Beanie is less passive and more interesting than the men -- a cartoonish villain called Luther Undertoe should have been impaled on an editor's pencil -- and she bursts through the novel's stylized web of coincidences. Her wary encounters with a crusading doctor named Sarah Blacksall (a character based on Elizabeth Blackwell) are nicely understated, her visits to a Chinatown abortion clinic genuinely harrowing.
 BUT even Beanie's energy can't speed up the novel's pace or galvanize Gaffney's prose. She spends a paragraph just describing how someone opens a letter. And when there's a fire in the stable, it takes her hero a page and a half -- and a horseshoe falling on his shin -- to get up and run outside, and even then he pauses to remember one of Barnum's sayings. Too many times the author's voice jars us out of the 19th century. (''It really happened -- check and see.'') Anachronistic terms like ''weirdos'' and ''snafu'' play havoc with the impression of realism. Wordy sentences beg for the delete key. (''It might have been a coincidence, but it might not have.'')
 Serious historical fiction aims, among other things, to bring lost realities to mind. In the end, we see the realities of Elizabeth Gaffney's metropolis vividly but fitfully, too often at a distance and through a gauze of words.

BYLINE: By Mike Meyer. 
Mike Meyer went to China in 1995, via the Peace Corps. He is writing a book about the destruction of historic Beijing, where he lives.

 BODY:
Here is a red dinosaur that demands our attention. The cartoon character, named Gogo, bounces on a monitor inside China's largest bookstore. ''Do you like doughnuts? Do you like burgers? Do you like sandwiches?'' he sings in English.
 ''Yes I do!'' the subtitles prompt. But the audience misses its cue. Look at them ignoring Gogo: a seated bundle of green hand-knit sweaters, black pigtails and bowed heads . . . reading. They're poring over cartoons -- translations of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' and of Japanese manga -- and the locally drawn ''Legend of Nezha'' books, which held 10 of the top 11 places on a Chinese best-seller list last year. Others turn the pages of a Garfield English-Chinese dictionary, which contains no entry for lasagna, but one for tofu.
 Forty focused children crouch on Book City's fourth floor, and 40 more gather at the neighboring nook, and 40 after that. It's calming to reach this pool of prepubescence amid the chaos that is Book City, whose five floors hold 230,000 titles. 
 Downstairs, the crowds are dense and the juxtapositions jarring. ''Monica's Story'' lies between Bill Clinton's and Hillary Clinton's autobiographies. A box set of books about Hermann Goering rubs shoulders with ''What's Behind Jewish Excellence?'' American titles in Chinese translation range from the predictable -- ''The Da Vinci Code'' and the Atkins diet -- to the surprising: Henry Rollins's ''Get in the Van,'' a memoir of his punk years, and a collection of Woody Allen books whose Chinese title promises ''Mensa Whores.'' 
 But translations into Chinese make up only 6 percent of the 190,000 books printed in China in 2003. Instead, the world's fastest-growing book market -- adding an estimated $300 million in sales annually -- is fueled by textbooks, which account for nearly half of all purchases. (This is according to China's statistical yearbook and a definitive book on publishing, which offer the most reliable figures available on the Wild West atmosphere of the Chinese book market.) 
 At Book City, shoppers face an entire floor of English-learning materials. One, ''Love English,'' offers pick-up lines and pillow talk with cultural hints. Among its instructions: that '' 'I'm bored' really means: 'Do you want to have sex?' '' Practice cassettes are included.
 At the store's entrance, a red banner urges shoppers to ''Maintain Communist Party Members' Advanced Character.'' This is, after all, a state-owned shop. Eighty percent of China's 72,000 booksellers are private, but nationalized stores ring up two-thirds of sales. At Book City, the Communist Party tracts sit neglected. Instead, crowds jostle toward a nearby shelf with business titles like ''Confronting Reality,'' ''New Leadership'' and ''Change the Tape of China.''
 Book City is overwhelming. The din, the eager customers, the slippery stacks of oversized paperbacks -- hardcovers are less common -- whose covers call out: ''I Was an American Police Officer,'' ''I'm Only Raising You for 18 Years'' and ''Chinese-Style Divorce.'' There's also the 2000 hit ''Harvard Girl,'' the story of how two dedicated Chinese parents groomed their daughter to get into Harvard. The copyright page reads: 63rd edition, 1.76 million copies. It costs just $2.41, the average price for a general interest text, which illustrates the difficulties both foreign and Chinese publishers face in trying to make a profit.
 Chinese best sellers often see their themes repeated. ''Harvard Girl'' quickly gave rise to ''Harvard Boy,'' among others. A whole pack of lupine imitators followed the successful novel ''Wolf Totem.'' Even banned books get knocked off. The muckraking ''China Peasant Survey,'' about the plight of China's peasant farmers, has spawned a look-alike called ''China Migrant Worker Survey.''
 Outside Book City, the view is pure New Beijing: bigger, wider, flatter, more. The squat buildings still feel new; memories of the old neighborhood linger. A man reminds me that before one of the capital's 44 Starbucks opened across this square of brown grass, before Book City, this was the site of Democracy Wall, where Beijingers posted demands for openness and reform. Now, they shop for books. In fact, Book City has so many customers that it figures into the planning for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Plans call for doubling the existing building so it can accommodate 200,000 shoppers at once.
 After a decade in China, I thought I'd seen it all: murder, jail, aliens, rodeo. But nothing prepared me for its publishing industry, in puberty. 
 ''Doing business here is like playing ice hockey without referees,'' says Toby Eady, a London-based literary agent who represents several authors who have written on China. They include Jung Chang, who wrote the popular novel ''Wild Swans''; Ma Jian, a dissident who wrote the political travelogue ''Red Dust''; and Tim Clissold, the author of the business memoir ''Mr. China.'' In China, Eady says, ''a contract is good until you step 10 centimeters out of the office.''
 Adrian Zackheim, the publisher of the Penguin Group's business imprint, Portfolio, has a similar take. ''When I walked into a Beijing bookstore, I felt like a Russian emigre in New York, seeing his first supermarket,'' he says. ''Book publishing in China seems deliciously complicated. Though I might not be so charmed by it if I had to make my living there.''
 It's a constant struggle for many Chinese presses. ''My first concern is survival,'' says Yan Ping, publisher of the privately owned Lightbooks, whose catalog includes books by Paul Theroux and Dr. Phil. ''At this point, success is secondary.'' Yan has reason to worry. Technically, his press -- along with all of China's private publishers -- is illegal. 
 ''Chinese publishing is divided into three sectors: publishing, printing and distribution,'' explains Xin Guangwei, a director at the General Administration of Press and Publication, the regulatory body that oversees publishing. ''Printing and distribution are open to private and foreign investment, and beginning this month, so is retail. Publishing, however, remains under the control of the 568 state-owned presses.''
 As the author of ''Publishing in China: An Essential Guide'' (Thomson, 2004), Xin is the Chinese industry's foremost bridge to the West, and a sort of effusive Rosetta Stone. Over tea at the private bookstore attached to the national legislature, he did his ambassadorial best to show that the industry was as clean and clear as the diagrams he drew for me on the backs of his press clippings. 
 In reality, the situation is far less defined. At the heart of the state press's power is its control of the nation's market in International Standard Book Numbers, or ISBN's, the bar-code-like number that identifies a book for commercial consumption. Without one, a book can't be published in China, with the exception of party tracts and state-sanctioned religious texts. (Among the religious books on sale at the Xishiku Cathedral in Beijing are Bibles, the catechism and ''God, Country, Notre Dame,'' the autobiography of the university's former president).
 But as in so many other sectors of China's economy, a parallel, unofficial market in ISBN codes has mushroomed among China's estimated 30,000 private publishers. Known as ''culture houses'' or ''booksellers,'' they act like packagers: finding titles, buying rights, and shopping them to state-owned publishers, who will issue an ISBN for a fee ranging from $1,250 to $2,500, then publish the book under the state imprimatur. Agreements can also include the sharing of production costs, marketing and distribution.
 It's considered an openly illegal system, tolerated to a point. Officially, the buying and selling of ISBN's is forbidden. In a round of recent speeches aimed at culling pornography and other ''illegal publications jeopardizing social stability,'' government officials vowed to crack down on culture houses, calling them ''malignant tumors that must be excised.''
 The question is at what cost. ''Private publishers are doing an extremely valuable job,'' says Andrew Nurnberg, whose London-based literary agency specializes in foreign rights. In the West, packagers are often considered ''hired help,'' he says. But in China, it's the reverse. Although the state ostensibly controls publishing, it relies on the private culture houses to do the heavy lifting. 
 Paul Richardson, the founder of the Oxford International Center for Publishing Studies and a close watcher of the Chinese publishing scene, anticipates that one day the General Administration of Press and Publication will sell book numbers itself, and ''legitimize'' the entire process. There are ''clear messages from officials this is coming,'' he says.
 For now, culture houses provide private entrepreneurs the only door into the industry. Even then, it's a struggle. Gao Yun, a photographer, and his wife, Cheng Yanbin, an editor, poured their life savings into creating the ''China on Foot'' guidebooks. They found a willing partner in China's largest tourism press. ''We invested $50,000 in our ideas,'' Ms. Cheng says, proudly patting the book's cover. ''This is our car; this is our house.''
 The story of Yang Erche Namu, a Beijing author and onetime popular singer, is also telling. Namu has published 12 books in Chinese, and her memoir, ''Leaving Mother Lake,'' was released in 2003 by Little, Brown. After an editor commissioned her first book, Namu was handed a bag with $10,000 in cash -- and no rights. She estimates the book sold two million copies, not counting pirated editions. In China, authors and editors rarely forge a lasting bond. For each of her successive 11 books, Namu has worked with a different publisher. Now they pay advances against royalties, but, given unreliable sales data and piracy, she says she still can't support herself from writing. Instead, she relies on income from guesthouses she owns in her native village. She has also started a lingerie line, for which she is seeking backers. ''I am famous, everyone knows me, but I have no money!'' she says with a laugh. 
 These are the stories that make agents wince. Yet compared with the West, agents play a much smaller role in the Chinese industry. A few dozen cover the entire nation, and only three firms represent translation rights. 
 Agents and American publishers say the average amount they receive for Chinese rights is a paltry $2,500, which is what a Chinese publisher paid for the hugely successful business book ''Who Moved My Cheese?'' It became China's all-time best-selling translated work, with official sales of two million.
 ''Of our 30,000 contracts, 60 percent are paying,'' says Luc Kwanten, the head of the Big Apple Tuttle-Mori literary agency, which has branches on the mainland and Taiwan. ''Publishers are conscious of the fact that royalties have to be paid. And the publishers do have money,'' he says. ''There is still a trend to view this as a poor country. It's not a poor industry. It's still a wide-open market, like a dry sponge. It senses the water, but isn't there quite yet.''
 China's book sales totaled an estimated $5.6 billion in 2003, compared with $23.4 billion in the United States. Web sales are fledgling in China, due in part to a reliance on cash-on-delivery payments, but book-selling Web sites deeply discount the standard 40 percent markup over wholesale prices. Popular portals include dangdang.com and joyo.com, which Amazon bought for $75 million last year. There are also book clubs. The Bertelsmann Group runs one based in Shanghai with 1.5 million members. It has also invested in a bookstore chain.
 Tracking sales remains a challenge, although most publishers have made a gesture toward transparency by listing print runs on a book's copyright page. The Beijing OpenBook Market Consulting Center tabulates best sellers by genre in the weekly China Book Business Report, and tracks sales data for Chinese retail book purchases. ''I went to a bookstore in London once,'' Zhu Xiaoli, a manager at OpenBook, says. ''It was so calm, with so few people. I asked the saleswoman: 'How can you make any money?' ''
 Because of piracy, the same question is constantly asked of China. Not everyone answers eagerly. When I asked one publisher about piracy, he plunged into a polemic about my exterminating the American Indians, angrily stabbing his palm with his finger. Xin Guanwei, Chinese publishing's Rosetta Stone, compares the heightened campaign to protect intellectual property rights to America's war on drugs. ''Piracy is our drug problem,'' he says. 
 It's not going to be easy. On my desk sit a pack of fake Marlboros, a knockoff Allen Iverson silver medallion, a bootleg DVD of ''The Aviator'' and a copy of the best seller ''No Excuse!'' whose credited author is Ferrar Cape, West Point graduate and motivational speaker, but who is rumored to be a Chinese invention.
 Increasingly, however, infringement cases are being heard. In the last two months, the copyright holders of Peter Rabbit and Garfield won piracy suits. One of China's best-known novelists was found guilty of plagiarizing parts of the romance novel ''Falling Blossoms in Romantic Dreams.'' To top it off, last month a Chinese author won his case against a Web site that had illegally posted his material. Its subject? Protecting intellectual property rights. 
 The control of foreign content is also loosening, to a point. Last year, a Chinese publisher offered to buy the rights to ''River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze,'' by Peter Hessler, a Beijing-based writer who contributes to The New Yorker. Hessler passed after learning that unspecified parts would be cut. ''The point is to be honest to the people you write about,'' Hessler says. ''It's condescending to them to allow the material to get softened. I have faith that one day it will be translated directly.''
 Indeed, the government has become less restrictive of some genres, among them history and health -- that is, sex -- by Chinese writers, and law and political thought by foreigners. Lindsay Waters, an editor at Harvard University Press, recalls being approached by a former Red Guard in 1998: ''He said, 'Do you know that I used to destroy books? Now I'm helping to bring in John Rawls's 'A Theory of Justice.' '' Last year, Waters published ''China's New Order'' by the political scientist Wang Hui, which would probably never have seen the light of day in China.
 When it comes to exporting culture, not goods, America enjoys a ballooning trade surplus with China. Of the estimated 12,000 translations published here in 2003, nearly half were of American books, a ratio consistent over the past five years. Try naming more than a handful of books by Chinese authors published in America in that time. 
 Lauren Wein, the associate rights director for Grove Atlantic, says she has been surprised at the range of titles the Chinese have bought from Grove, including ''The Hungry Gene,'' about obesity, and a book by the experimental gay writer Dennis Cooper. But for the most part, ''China wants the heavy hitters, like 'Sex and the City' and 'Cold Mountain.' '' After all, she says, ''They still have 'On the Road' to publish.''
 In fact, the first Chinese edition of Kerouac's classic appeared in 1989. For years, I had been looking for its translator, the Beats' sole messenger to China. I finally tried Google.
 Wen Chu'an answered his phone at Sichuan University, where he teaches, among other subjects, Beat Studies. The photo on the jacket of his translation of ''Howl'' -- ''Hao jiao'' -- shows a wan, middle-aged man with a comb-over. 
 Before I phoned, I'd spent the day sifting through all my notes on Chinese publishing, and my eyes were glazing over at the statistics. All this talk about the book business -- potential growth and infrastructure flaws -- had turned texts into a commodity, no different from cars or socks.
 Then I asked Wen the obvious. Yes, he had seen the best minds of his generation destroyed by madness. But why translate Kerouac and Ginsberg? ''Because the impact of these Beat editions on readers is great,'' he said. ''Chinese young people can find something inspiring and encouraging in the Beat lifestyle: the ardent love of freedom in action and speech, the firm stand against everything inhuman, the giving priority to the spiritual life and denying the attitude that money-seeking is everything.''
 Both of Wen's Ginsberg titles have an official print run of 20,000. ''On the Road,'' which Wen says is available free online in China, had sold 30,000 copies by 2002. Small potatoes next to Chinese sales of management guides like ''The West Point Way of Leadership.''
 But wait. ''I believe there are pirate editions by unofficial private publishers,'' Wen continued. ''So actually, the numbers are much more than that.'' 
 He didn't sound at all upset.

LIKE A LAMPSHADE
IN A WHOREHOUSE
My Life in Comedy.
By Phyllis Diller
with Richard Buskin.
Illustrated. 266 pp.
Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin.
$24.95.
 PHYLLIS DILLER was first thought to be a tumor. Upon discovering that the mass in her mother's uterus was a fetus, the doctor declared her an ''ugly-looking little thing!'' Her father said, ''Leave it in,'' and on July 17, 1917, she was born at home on newspapers. Growing up, she never got hugs or kisses from her parents, who were so old that her memories of family life are attending aunts' and uncles' funerals. She felt wanted only by her dolls. Decades later, she would joke onstage: ''My parents had to tie a pork chop around my neck to make the dog play with me. . . . When I was kidnapped they wouldn't pay the ransom -- they didn't want to break a ten.''
 Like so many comedians, Phyllis Diller found a way to turn anguish into jokes, and her autobiography, ''Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse,'' written with Richard Buskin, contains plenty of both. She married a ne'er-do-well from a family of losers, and although her husband was ''lousy at sex, the world's worst,'' they had six children (''I felt like a trampoline''). She does credit him with pushing her toward a career in show business, but only because he wanted her to be his cash cow. His meanness and stupidity were wellsprings of her humor when she started writing in the early 1950's; and while she denies he was ''Fang,'' the recurring rotten husband in her stand-up routine, it's impossible not to hear echoes of the marriage in such lines as, ''He once tried to run out on me, but the police arrested him for leaving the scene of an accident.''
 While writing ads for a San Francisco radio station, Diller began performing in church halls and hospitals, then made her professional debut in 1955 at the Purple Onion. ''I quit my job at KSFO in order to become an unemployed comic,'' she recalls, and her early years were indeed a struggle. She recounts one evening playing to an audience of four people in a Manhattan club, then ''going home at night to a miserable, miserable room in Hell's Kitchen.'' Her break came in 1958 with a dazzling performance on ''The Jack Paar Show,'' during which she cracked up the host by tugging on her short green-dyed hair and saying, ''This isn't hair, these are nerve ends.'' She perfected the persona of a crazed housewife, and in 1962 she played Carnegie Hall in a show titled ''Just Phyllis Diller.''
 With professional success came more personal misery. Her husband began regularly to fake heart attacks for attention; he stopped bathing; he pretended to manage her career, which, she says, ''made absolutely no sense'' because he was someone who ''couldn't sell Windex to a Peeping Tom.'' Finally, in 1965, she filed for divorce, after which her ex's family sued her (unsuccessfully) to stop making fun of them.
 Having grown up thinking of herself as hopelessly ugly, a perception abetted by her husband's disrespect, Diller credits her resilience to a motivational book she read in 1951. '' 'The Magic of Believing' became a system of thought for me as well as a way of life,'' she says, offering the author Claude M. Bristol's theories of tapping the subconscious as ''a shield against all of the negative vibes.'' Believe in yourself and give yourself the power became her mantra. ''From here on it was straight up, all the way. I had a whole different slant. I believed that everything was going to work out, so even the setbacks that I'd experience wouldn't matter. Everything I'd touch would turn to gold.''
 She became a pop culture icon in the 1960's, during which she honed her image as a wild woman with electrified hair, psychedelic minidresses, rhinestone-studded boots and AK-47 delivery; she enjoyed three decades of success in nightclubs, movies and television; then, slowed by heart problems, she did her last stand-up show at 84, in Las Vegas. Her life today? ''I'm out for dinner every night, the eternal guest, and I always have a new beau on my arm.''
 It is fascinating to read her scrupulous analysis of stage technique, where she notes that the name Fang is funny because it ends abruptly with a hard consonant, and that joke delivery is all about pace. Rapid-fire one-liners were her stock in trade. ''I'd deliver one setup and then tag-tag-tag-tag-tag. That's economy,'' she writes. ''I didn't want giggles . . . I wanted boffs.'' Her early education in music (and sideline career as a concert pianist) informs her comedy: ''One joke followed the other with a flow and a rhythm. . . . Everything had a natural feel to it. I never rehearsed and I never, ever practiced in front of a mirror -- the reflection alone would be enough to finish me. Talk about looking straight at the enemy.''
 DILLER eventually did something about her looks with a face-lift in 1971, after which she became a poster girl for cosmetic self-enhancement. ''There was no stopping me,'' she writes. ''I underwent another 14 surgical procedures over the next 15 years.'' The operations became such a big theme in her routine that she received an award from the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery for having ''the courage to proclaim her surgery and show her results publicly.'' She had her breasts reduced, teeth straightened, tummy tucked, forehead lifted, cheeks implanted, nose fixed and fat removed from around her navel and shot into her face to smooth it out. ''I had to do something. I was so wrinkled, I could screw my hats on,'' she says. ''I told Fang, 'I'm gonna have my face lifted,' and he said, 'Who the hell would steal it?' '' Imperfect physiognomy, like the torment of her private life, turned out to be Phyllis Diller's gift.

HEADLINE: Can a Virus Hitch a Ride in Your Car?

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr. and NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
A VIRUS can wreak havoc on computer files, hard drives and networks, but its malicious effects tend to be measured in wasted time, lost sales and the occasional unfinished novel that evaporates into the digital ozone. But what if viruses, worms or other forms of malware penetrated the computers that control ever more crucial functions in the car? 
 Could you find yourself at the wheel of two tons of rolling steel that has malevolent code coursing through its electronic veins?
 That frightening prospect has had Internet message boards buzzing this year, amid rumors that a virus had infected Lexus cars and S.U.V.'s. The virus supposedly entered the cars over the Bluetooth wireless link that lets drivers use their cellphones to carry on hands-free conversations through the cars' microphones and speakers.
 The prospect is not so implausible. A handful of real if fairly benign cellphone viruses have already been observed, in antivirus industry parlance, ''in the wild.'' 
 Still, a virus in a cellphone might muck up an address book or, at worst, quietly dial Vanuatu during peak hours. But malicious code in cars, which rely on computers for functions as benign as seat adjustment and as crucial as antiskid systems that seize control of the brakes and throttle to prevent a crash, could do far more harm. 
 The Lexus tale, based on murky reporting and a speculative statement by Kaspersky Labs, a Moscow antivirus company, seems to have been unfounded. ''Lexus and its parent companies, Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. and Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan, have investigated this rumor,'' the carmaker said in a statement last month, ''and have determined it to be without foundation.'' 
 But the question lingers: Could a car be infected by a virus passed along from, say, your cellphone or hand-held computer? Or worse, by a hacker with a Bluetooth device within range of the car's antennas? 
 The short answer is, not yet.
 ''Right now this is a lot of hype rather than reality, the idea that cars could be turning against us,'' said Thilo Koslowski, a vice president and lead analyst for auto-based information and communication technologies at Gartner G2, a technology research firm. ''We won't see John Carpenter's 'Christine' becoming a reality anytime soon.'' 
 But Mr. Koslowski and others are quick to point out that the elements for mischief are slowly falling into place: 
 First, vehicles are increasingly controlled by electronics -- to the point that even the simple mechanical link between the gas pedal and engine throttle is giving way to ''drive by wire'' systems. 
 Second, more data is being exchanged with outside sources, including cellphones and real-time traffic reports. 
 Finally, the interlinking of car electronics opens up the possibility that automotive worms could burrow into a memory storage area in ways that engineers never imagined.
 Since the early 1990's, the various computers that manage a car's engine, transmission, brakes, air bags and entertainment systems have been increasingly linked in networks much like the ones that offices use to let workers share printers, scanners and backup storage drives. Benefits of interconnecting the electronic devices include less wiring -- a luxury car can contain miles of copper cables -- and reduced weight, an important factor in improving performance and fuel economy. 
 Less obvious are the advantages of having the components communicate: an antiskid system, designed to help keep a car from spinning out of control, links sensors in the steering, brakes and throttle, and can effectively seize control from the driver. 
 Other systems in which computers essentially take over, if only for a second, include emergency-brake assist, which provides maximum braking force when sensors detect the need for a panic stop, and ''active steering,'' a feature now exclusive to BMW in which computers can compensate for a driver's recklessness.
 The latest versions of in-car information systems, known as telematics, include the ability to diagnose vehicle maladies. General Motors' OnStar can forward readings from sensors throughout the car for troubleshooting, a process called remote diagnostics. (All G.M. cars will include OnStar by the end of 2007.)
 The data, read from the engine-control computer, is transmitted over the OnStar cellphone link. Several automakers have discussed plans to use this conduit to update a vehicle's software or even perform electronic repairs, though no automaker is currently doing this regularly. Microsoft has entered this business, too, having recently signed a deal to provide software for a telematics and diagnostics system to be installed in all Fiats, starting this year.
 By design, the various controls are not isolated from other in-car processors, since they need to share information to operate effectively and avoid the need for redundant sensors, wiring and microprocessors. Also, automakers have begun to share in-car processing power and memory capacity over the network, said Paul Hansen, the publisher of an industry newsletter, The Hansen Report on Automotive Electronics.
 In a car with a stand-alone cellphone installation there would be no pathway for pernicious computer code to enter the vital electronic systems. But as automakers work to take advantage of linked processors, ready exchanges of data -- and malware -- become possible. 
 Possible does not, however, mean easy. Unlike the anonymous and remote world of PC viruses delivered over the Internet, a ne'er-do-well would need, in most cases, a few moments alone with a car to impregnate it with malware -- for now. 
 Marko Wolf, a research associate at Ruhr-Universitat in Bochum, Germany, and co-author of a recent study of security in automotive networks, said a rogue mechanic with under-the-hood access could make short work of planting malicious code. And as internal networking reaches the exposed extremities of a car -- its side mirrors, say, or its lights -- the number of potential access points increases. 
 ''Cars have extended their bus wires and controllers even into their electronic mirrors'' and to receivers for global-positioning signals, Mr. Wolf said, conjuring a ''Mission: Impossible'' plot: ''One can easily hack into the internal communication system just by breaking away that outside part and connecting the bare bus wires with a P.D.A. or laptop.'' (A bus is essentially a collection of wires linking one part of a computer -- or a car -- to another.)
 Looking ahead, a proliferation of remote access points -- OnStar-type services, for instance, or short-range Bluetooth connections -- will raise the odds that virus writers will eventually try to beam a bug across the ether. Just as such services let the car send data to the outside world, malware writers could try to use those wireless conduits to send destructive payloads into cars.
 Systems like OnStar, known for providing emergency assistance or concierge services (its operators will make restaurant reservations for you), in fact hold deep conversations with the car's networks. Besides the ability to provide engine diagnostics and unlock the doors by remote to rescue forgotten keys, an advanced level of OnStar -- now on about a dozen G.M. models -- will report detailed data about a collision to emergency medical personnel. 
 Navigation systems, which have used only a time signal from satellites to determine a car's location, are adding traffic information. The Acura RL is the first with this service; updates about congestion or construction delays are sent to the car and displayed on the navigation screen.
 Despite these potential pathways, creating a virus that would spread within the car would be no small feat. In the Windows-dominated PC universe, ''the programmer only has to know the PC processor'' to do damage, said Egil Juliussen of Telematics Research Group of Minnetonka, Minn., a firm that tracks the rise of in-car networking. 
 ''The auto is a very different environment,'' he said. ''The infotainment system may have multiple processors and operating systems. The navigation system has one processor or operating system, the telematics system may have another one and the radio may have a third one.''
 Getting a virus to propagate from one system to another would be akin to designing malware that could pass from a Windows environment to a Macintosh system and on to a Linux machine -- infecting them all. 
 ''The point is that the virus writer needs to expand his knowledge by a factor of 10 or more over the PC world,'' Mr. Juliussen said. Even then, he said, with operating systems -- particularly those that control crucial mechanical systems -- remaining varied and proprietary, a successful virus could function in only a small fraction of cars. 
 ''It's feasible,'' Mr. Juliussen said, ''just a lot harder.'' 
 Whether virus writers can overcome the hurdles remains an open question, but evidence from the PC world suggests that as on-board networking becomes more widespread and standardized, they will certainly try. Early speculation, like the Lexus rumors, may help focus attention on the potential problem before car malware has a chance to flourish. 
 ''I am very happy to see as many rumors of that sort as believable as possible as soon as possible,'' said Peter B. Ladkin, a professor of computer networks and distributed systems at the University of Bielefeld in Germany. ''Because it means that more automakers will pay attention to what they're doing.''

PERSON: Fred G. Burke

HEADLINE: Fred G. Burke, 79, Official Who Promoted Changes in Public School Financing, Dies 

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Fred G. Burke, who oversaw sweeping changes in the financing and accountability of public schools as the commissioner of education for Rhode Island and then New Jersey in the 1970's and early 1980's, died Friday at Newton Memorial Hospital in Newton, N.J. He was 79 and lived in Milford, Pa.
 The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said his wife, Carol Sterling. 
 A political scientist and African-affairs specialist with a reputation for getting things done, Dr. Burke had written books, taught in colleges, served as a United Nations consultant, directed the training of the first Peace Corps volunteers and been Rhode Island's top education official for more than three years when, in 1974, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed him commissioner of education in New Jersey. 
 It was like stepping into the center of a storm. Over the next eight years, Dr. Burke, a Democrat, became a target of teachers' unions, school boards, disgruntled taxpayers and political foes as he pushed for accountability by students, teachers and administrators, while New Jersey imposed its first income tax to reverse the slide of a school system that discriminated against children in poorer districts. 
 Standing his ground, Dr. Burke was instrumental in persuading the Legislature to pass a 1975 law calling for a ''thorough and efficient'' education for the state's 1.5 million students. It mandated testing and monitoring, annual evaluations for tenured teachers and yearly reviews for every school. Students squirmed, and the New Jersey Education Association, the 85,000-member teachers' union, objected.
 So did the State Board of Education, local school boards, legislative opponents and other critics, who said tests were no guarantee of learning, that central authority threatened academic freedom and the autonomy of school districts, and that teachers and schools might be unfairly penalized. But Dr. Burke won support among many parents, especially after the scores showed improvement late in his tenure.
 Beyond performance and accountability, the problems with schools in New Jersey -- and across the country -- included too little money, and wildly disparate budgets in the patchwork of rich and poor school districts, with money largely coming from local property taxes, supplemented by state aid. 
 In a landmark 1973 ruling, the State Supreme Court said the financing system violated New Jersey's constitutional mandate for a ''thorough and efficient'' education for all children, because poorer districts were unable to give their schools adequate support. The constitutional phrase -- bland and powerful and all but ignored -- provided the rationale, and in 1976, after a long and bitter fight, the Legislature and Governor Byrne pushed through the state's first income tax.
 It was to provide millions in ''equalization aid,'' to level the playing field for rich and poor districts. But much of the $800 million raised in the first year went not to schools but to homeowners as rebates to make the tax more palatable. Dr. Burke had no direct role in the adoption of the unpopular tax, but as the personification of the state school system he became a natural target of its critics.
 In 1982, the newly elected Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, appointed a replacement for Dr. Burke. In a departing interview, the commissioner said there had been dramatic improvements in the schools. But, citing a faltering economy and sharply rising teachers' pensions and other costs, he acknowledged that there had been too little money, and that the gap between rich and poor districts had only grown wider.
 In 1990, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered the state to ensure that the poorest cities spend as much on their children's education as wealthy suburbs spent. The suit, known as Abbott v. Burke, by 20 students in East Orange, Jersey City, Camden and Irvington, had been filed in 1981 against Dr. Burke as education commissioner, and though he was named as the defendant he regarded the outcome as a victory. 
 ''He was so happy to lose that,'' his wife recalled. ''It was the beginning of equitable financing for the schools of New Jersey.''
 Fred George Burke was born in Collins, N.Y., on Jan. 1, 1926. He was in the Army Air Forces in World War II and served in the Korean War. He graduated from Williams College in 1953, and at Princeton University received a master's in 1955 and a doctorate in 1958. Over the next 12 years, he taught political science at Ohio Wesleyan University, Syracuse University and the State University of New York at Buffalo.
 During that time, he traveled often to Africa, wrote six books on African affairs, was a consultant to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and directed the training of Peace Corps volunteers in East Africa. From 1971 to 1974, he was the commissioner of Education for Rhode Island, instituting innovations that included full state funding of public schools -- with money raised from the state's first income tax, adopted in 1972 -- and a statewide salary scale for teachers.
 After resigning as New Jersey education commissioner, he joined the University of Connecticut as vice president for graduate education and research and dean of the graduate school, and in 1992 became a senior fellow at the Phelps Stokes Fund. His last book, ''Public Education: Who's In Charge?'' (Praeger, 1991) argued for a national education policy.
 In addition to Ms. Sterling, his third wife, whom he married in 1985, Mr. Burke is survived by three sons, Fritz, of Union, Me., Daniel, of Bangor, Me., and Adam, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Rebecca Burke, of Washington; two sisters, Marlene Johnston, of Roopville, Ga., and Ellen Van Note, of Chapel Hill, N.C.; and four grandchildren. Two earlier marriages ended in divorce.

HEADLINE: Salvation in the Classroom

BYLINE: By PETER QUINN. 
Peter Quinn, Time Warner corporate editorial director, is the author of the forthcoming novel, ''Hour of the Cat.''

 BODY:
THE recent announcement of extensive closings of Catholic schools throughout the New York area has stirred sadness and resistance among the families directly affected. For me, a veteran of Catholic schooling in the Bronx from kindergarten through the last stages of graduate study, the closings are a reminder of what I owe to these schools and how much they have shaped my life.
 St. Raymond's, the grade school I attended (which is not among the schools to be closed), is still there, at the corner of Castle Hill and Metropolitan Avenues. The old school, which was reserved for boys and supplemented by a newer building for girls, is a square, red-brick edifice, typical of the frill-free structures that have been a part of almost every New York Catholic parish for the last century and a half. 
 The original impetus to build these schools came from Irish immigrants who, after a long and bitter struggle to preserve their religious identity in their homeland, encountered in America a Protestant-dominated public school system that regarded Catholicism as an alien and subversive superstition. In the years leading up to the Civil War, with religious tensions at white heat, Archbishop John Hughes initiated a construction program that made parish schools a priority.
 From that time on, if lack of funds presented a choice between building a school or a church, the school came first. Mass was said in the school basement or auditorium until there was money to erect a proper church. Teachers were for the most part members of religious orders of nuns and brothers whose mission was the education of Catholic children. Their unpaid labor was the fuel that made the system run and allowed it to operate tuition free. In my experience, they ran the gamut from those unsuited by temperament and training to be teachers to extraordinary educators who did a heroic job of not only instructing us in the basics but inculcating in us a love of learning. 
 There was usually neither space nor time for cosseting individual students. At St. Raymond's, the typical class included 45 to 55 students of wildly varying abilities, often from wildly different economic and ethnic backgrounds. With scant resources and no assistants or special support services, teachers concentrated on seeing to it that, at a minimum, every student mastered the skills needed to pass a civil service exam or qualify for an entry position at Con Edison or the telephone company.
 The use of corporal punishment has been covered to the point of parody. What's left out is that this was often of a piece with the immigrant cultures that looked to these schools to train their children. The use of physical punishment frequently reflected the wishes of parents and families intent on having their children gain the discipline and knowledge they needed to rise in the world, even if it required force and intimidation. At St. Raymond's most of us didn't report the punishments we received at school on the certainty our parents would repeat them. 
 Intellectually, while rote learning took precedence over the development of a capacity for creativity, the results weren't entirely regrettable. Few graduated without knowing the difference between adverbs or adjectives or the requirement of subject and verb agreement. My wife, for example, educated by Ursuline nuns in the South Bronx, had drilled into her a mastery of English grammar that, in my estimation, ranks her among the best copy editors I have ever encountered. I remain supremely grateful for the way the Christian brothers grounded me in proper usage.
 In the eighth grade at St. Raymond's, in 1961, I sat in the same desk my father had in 1918. The son of a seamstress and a union organizer, neither of whom had gone beyond grade school, my father went on from that desk to college and law school and was eventually elected to the United States Congress and the state judiciary. 
 The desk we shared had an oak top set in a cast-iron filigreed frame that was bolted to the floor. It had a solid, permanent feel. It might still be there, occupied by the child of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, or Belize, or Haiti who are in the process of making the leap from rural poverty through urban struggle to the middle class and beyond.
 There have been dramatic changes in the church and the world in the four decades since I left St. Raymond's. The ranks of brothers and nuns have thinned to the point where lay people do most of the teaching. Old immigrant communities have dissolved and been replaced by new ones. But the need for well-ordered schools, with a moral as well as educational mission, remains as strong as ever. The consequences of losing such schools entirely will be felt far beyond the Catholic community.

HEADLINE: Yes, There Are Apartments Out There for $1,000

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
THE exposed red-brick walls of the studio apartment in the five-story, corniced limestone town house on West 145th Street in Harlem are delicately muted by feathery white paint strokes. The newly finished hardwood floors glisten, as do the stainless-steel kitchenette and its marble countertops. And when the apartment's current lease expires in June, its rent will be $1,000 a month.
 It is possible to find something nice to rent in New York City for $1,000 to $1,200 -- the range considered affordable for most people in the five boroughs by the federal government and housing researchers -- but not easily.
 In that range, there are studios in town houses dotting Harlem's cross streets, renovated by investors in the community's most recent renaissance, and among the brownstones of Brooklyn. There are one-bedrooms in terraced high-rises in Riverdale; in six-story postwar buildings and newly constructed two-family homes scattered about other Bronx neighborhoods, like Pelham and Soundview, and along the leafy streets of Kew Gardens, Queens. And if someone is willing to take the A train to the eastern end of the line, it is even possible to find affordable two-bedrooms in the Rockaways. But not too many. 
 The search becomes particularly hair-rending the nearer one's rental aspirations focus on the more affluent enclaves of Manhattan and, for that matter, most of Staten Island. Andrew Heiberger, president of Citi Habitats, one of Manhattan's largest rental brokerage firms, attests to that. ''We currently have 6,158 apartments listed for rental below 96th Street,'' Mr. Heiberger said. ''Only 76 of those units are priced between $1,000 and $1,200. And, except for one, they are all studios.''
 Demand, of course, is far higher for the lower-priced listings. ''In all of 2004,'' Mr. Heiberger continued, ''6.4 percent of the 24,770 clients who registered for our services wanted listings between $1,000 and $1,200, more than 20 times the number of available apartments. In plain language, we need more lower-priced units in this city.''
 Rich Schulhoff, a spokesman for the Staten Island Board of Realtors, asked how many rental listings he could cite between $1,000 and $1,200, said: ''There are absolutely none now active on our multiple listing service. That doesn't mean there aren't any on the island, just none listed with us. I was shocked to see this myself. We don't deal much with rentals, and now I see why.''
 Theoretically, New Yorkers and newcomers to the city who earn a mid-range income should not have to spend more than $1,000 a month. ''The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development asks households to pay 30 percent of their income for rent in public housing,'' said Ingrid Gould Ellen, deputy director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law.
 ''That suggests that the federal government deems 30 percent of your income as a reasonable level of expenditure. And housing researchers typically use more than 30 percent of income as an indication of unaffordable rent levels.'' According to the Census Bureau's 2003 American Community Survey, the latest data available, the median household income for all of New York City was $39,937. By the federal government's 30 percent standard, Dr. Ellen noted, that would define an affordable rent for the entire city as $998 a month.
 Using a different data set, George W. McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation, said that, based on all the units surveyed in the city by HUD during 2003, the median rent for two-bedroom apartments was $1,222. Ten years ago, it was $932.
 Using the 30 percent standard, Dr. McCarthy said, ''In order to afford that $1,222 apartment, you would need to make $48,976 a year.'' And speaking from experience, he said: ''It's hard to find a nice two-bedroom apartment for $1,200 a month in the city. I just gave up a one-bedroom rental on Worth Street for $2,600 a month. I'm living upstate.''
 Curious as to what sort of jobholder could afford a $1,222-a-month apartment, Dr. McCarthy turned to the 2003 ''Paycheck to Paycheck'' study of 540 occupations in the city conducted by the National Housing Conference. Of those 540 occupations, he calculated, only 192 could afford $1,222 a month.
 ''The top occupations they have listed -- security traders, commodity and financial service agents -- could afford to pay, on average, $3,400 a month for rent,'' Dr. McCarthy said. ''Their median wage is $136,000 a year.'' Psychiatrists, whose median wage is about $125,000, he said, can afford $3,100 a month. 
 ''Interestingly enough,'' Dr. McCarthy continued, ''the first occupation that can afford to rent the median apartment at $1,222 is real estate brokers, whose median income is $51,000'' -- throughout the five boroughs.
 Among those who theoretically cannot afford $1,222 a month are police detectives, bus drivers, librarians and construction workers, who make $45,000 to $48,000 a year. They can afford about $1,125 in rent. And at the bottom of the list are manicurists, dishwashers, cashiers, service station attendants, counter clerks, home health aides, retail sales people and parking lot attendants, whose incomes of $14,000 to $18,000 a year allow them to afford rents of $350 to $450 a month. 
 ''What that means, of course, is that they need multiple earners to afford an apartment,'' Dr. McCarthy said. ''That's why a lot of people live with roommates, or live in overcrowded apartments.'' Professor Ellen at N.Y.U. pointed out that 22.7 percent of renter households in the city spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing. 
 And yet, perhaps surprisingly, New York City is not among the top 10 most rent-burdensome cities in the nation -- it's 11th. The median rent for all rental units in the United States, according to the American Community Survey, was $679. In New York, it was $816 -- taking into account all five boroughs, of course. ''In fact,'' Professor Ellen said, ''the six most expensive cities are all in California, all with median rents topping $940.''
 Don't tell Amanda Simpkins it's easy to find an affordable apartment in the city. 
 In what she described as ''an ordeal,'' Ms. Simpkins, 22, researched perhaps 50 apartments on the Internet, ''trying to figure out what I could afford, if it was someplace I wanted to live.'' She worked with five brokers, visiting ''maybe 10 apartments,'' she said, most of them ''completely out of my price range.''
 A native of Austin, Tex., Ms. Simpkins said: ''It was a shock to be told that I needed to make 40 times the rent just to be considered. Some people told me that I should have a roommate, that I needed a guarantor.'' She earns $44,000 as an auditor for an accounting firm. 
 Finally, in a brownstone on tree-lined Clark Street in Brooklyn Heights, Ms. Simpkins found a studio, for $1,000 a month. She considers herself lucky. ''Where I come from, this is a ridiculous amount to pay for an apartment this small,'' she said of her 250-square-foot home. ''In Austin, my friend has a one-bedroom for $900. A studio might be $450, depending on where it is.''
 Depending on where, and certainly with some difficulty, brokers and building managers say, the search for that affordable rental can be fruitful.
 ''Absolutely, in the boroughs, something is available,'' said Ronni Lynn Arougheti, president of Heron, which manages 25 rental buildings with about 2,000 units citywide -- in places like Bensonhurst, Brooklyn; Hollis and Kew Gardens, Queens; Harlem; and Pelham in the Bronx. ''I would say 70 percent can be rented for between $800 and $1,200,'' Ms. Arougheti said, with one or two units in each of the 25 buildings available at any given time.
 All the apartments in those buildings are rent-stabilized with designated legal rents, and more than $800 to $1,200 could be charged for most of them, Ms. Arougheti said, ''but there's a big differential between the legal rent and what the market will bear.''
 ''We might have an apartment whose legal rent is $1,100 and actually rent it for $950,'' she said, ''because that's what people in that area can afford and are willing to pay.''
 There are -- a few -- market-rate apartments in highly appointed buildings around the city in the $1,000-to-$1,200 range. 
 On a winding road leading to one of the hilltops of Riverdale in the Bronx stands the 31-story Century, a 24-hour doorman building on Netherland Avenue with a health club, a pool, six indoor tennis courts and concierge services. And on the seventh floor, with expansive windows offering views of Spuyten Duyvil Creek and the northern tip of Manhattan, a 730-square-foot one-bedroom recently rented for $1,208. 
 ''All the other one-bedrooms in the same building start at $1,230 and go up to about $1,600, '' said the listing agent, Susan E. Goldy, president of the Riverdale brokerage firm that bears her name. ''That's still a lot less than Manhattan.''
 Ms. Goldy said the least expensive studio she currently has listed in the area is in a high-rise overlooking Van Cortlandt Park. ''It has a terrace, nice-sized closets,'' she said, and is renting for $825. 
 ''This apartment actually came on in the fall, and it's still listed,'' Ms. Goldy said. ''And the landlord is willing to pay a half a month toward the fee. I think that's a reflection that the rental market is not that strong.'' Ms. Goldy's fee is 12 percent of one year's rent.
 Some slack in the rental market can also be found in communities enjoying construction booms in two-family homes and small apartment buildings -- like Astoria, Queens.
 ''We had a building boom during the 1920's with a huge amount of housing that's still very well maintained,'' said Charles Sciberras, a rental agent at Re/Max Today in Astoria. ''And there's a building boom now that's reminiscent of the 20's: two-families, six-families, 10-families. Almost every other block in Astoria has a new building going up.'' 
 Increased supply, of course, moderates prices. For $950 to $1,100, Mr. Sciberras said, ''you could get something with hardwood floors, an updated kitchen and bathrooms in an elevator building, or in a two- or three-family house or a small six-unit apartment building.'' Currently, Mr. Sciberras has about 20 listings for one-bedrooms in that range. ''For a two-bedroom, occasionally, you can get one for $1,200, if you look hard enough,'' he said.
 In a three-story, 12-unit walk-up on Crescent Street in Astoria -- near colonial-style row houses and a deli on the corner -- a one-bedroom, in need of some work, is on the market for $1,000. ''It's three blocks from the N or R train at the Broadway station,'' Mr. Sciberras said, ''15 minutes to 59th Street.''
 If an hour-plus commute is bearable -- soothed by a daily double-dose of marshes, dunes and the occasional soar of a harrier hawk while the elevated A train rumbles over Jamaica Bay, the spikes of Manhattan in the distance -- then it's possible to find even a two-bedroom in the Rockaways.
 ''On Beach 91st Street, two blocks from the Cross Bay Bridge,'' said Vincent S. Castellano, president of Picture Properties, ''I have a first-floor apartment with hardwood floors, high ceilings, new windows and two decent-sized bedrooms.''
 ''It's a block from the A train at Beach 90th Street,'' he added, and renting for $1,000.
 Apartments in the Rockaways remain vacant these days because of the volume of construction. ''They're building everywhere,'' Mr. Castellano said. ''There's two-families, town houses, a new 12-story elevator building at Beach 96th, with 75 or 80 apartments, that is about 30 percent full. It has one- or two-bedroom apartments starting at $970.''
 Across the street, completed about the same time, are two low-rise buildings of 10 to 12 units each. ''So on one corner you have 100 apartments available in the last six months,'' Mr. Castellano said. ''Tenants are in a good position; they can walk across the street and get a good deal.''
 It is far more difficult, however, to get a good deal in the affordable rental buildings of Manhattan, where vacancies tend to come in just a trickle. Part of the scarcity problem, Dr. McCarthy at the Ford Foundation points out, is that ''many lower-priced units are occupied by more affluent people.''
 ''I'm not against rent control,'' he said, ''but there's a tendency of people to sit on desirable affordable properties. And it's not unusual to see some people paying less than 10 percent of their income for rent while some others pay more than 50 percent.''
 The scarcity also derives from the fact that, under the state's rent laws, a vacant apartment can be deregulated if its rent rises above $2,000 a month. To begin with, landlords are entitled to a 20 percent rent increase when an apartment becomes vacant. And if improvements are made to that apartment, the landlord can add one-fortieth of the cost of those improvements onto the rent -- often enough to push the rent over $2,000. Thousands of apartments have been deregulated in that manner in recent years.
 Persistence can pay off for the resolute renter, says Willie Kathryn Suggs, owner of Willie Kathryn Suggs Licensed Real Estate Brokers in Harlem. Just ask brokers about newly renovated apartments in brownstones and smaller buildings, Ms. Suggs said. At larger complexes where there are likely to always be a few vacancies, she said: ''Dress nicely, stalk the super, give him $50, flirt shamelessly if necessary and ask him to let you know when an apartment is available. People may have to wait until someone keels over.''
 ''After you fill out the application,'' Ms. Suggs said, ''call on a daily basis, because these apartments do not last. Getting an affordable place to live in Manhattan is like war; you do what you have to do. And pray.''


GRAPHIC: Photos: Astoria -- This one-bedroom apartment on Crescent Street near Broadway in Astoria, Queens, recently rented for $1,000 a month, and similar ones are still available. The neighborhood has for many years had ample reasonably priced and well maintained housing, and new buildings are now being added at a rapid rate.
Riverdale -- Looking out over Spuyten Duyvil Creek and the northern tip of Manhattan, this seventh floor, 730-square-foot one-bedroom on Netherland Avenue recently rented for $1,208. There are other one-bedrooms in the same building that start at $1,230.
Rockaway -- On Beach 91st Street in Rockaway, a block from the A train, a two-bedroom, first-floor apartment with hardwood floors and high ceilings rents for $1,000. Tenants are in a good position in the neighborhood now because there is a building boom going on that is creating many new rentals. (Photographs by Frances Roberts for The New York Times)(pg. 1)
Harlem -- In the building at 416 West 145th Street in Harlem, left, the studio apartment above, with hardwood floors, a stainless-steel kitchenette and marble counters, will rent for $1,000 a month when the lease expires.
 Brooklyn -- After a grueling search, Amanda Simpkins found the studio below, for $1,000 a month in a brownstone on tree-lined Clark Street in Brooklyn Heights. She called it a ''ridiculous amount'' for a place that is only 250 square feet. (Photographs by Frances Roberts for The New York Times)(pg. 5)

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy, the American Morality Tale

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
WHAT could be more American than the idea of a second chance, a fresh start, Act Two? It is embedded in the culture, the notion that you can reinvent yourself in every way, by moving to a new city, buying a new car, getting a face lift -- or by filing for bankruptcy.
 For generations, Americans who found themselves drowning in debt have turned to the federal bankruptcy laws, which, as the Supreme Court wrote in 1915, are meant to give honest debtors a chance ''to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes.''
 In other words, if you give up most of what you own (assuming you own anything at all), you can start all over again.
 But that may be changing. Last week, the Senate passed a bill that its backers say will curb abuses and force those who can pay their debts to do so. Critics contend that Congress is, in effect, turning its back on the principle of a debtor's ability ''to start afresh,'' and punishing some victims of calamity. 
 The legislation is almost certain to be passed by the House of Representatives and signed by President Bush in the next month or two. It includes highly technical provisions and involves issues like the role of credit-card companies in causing the bankruptcies that they have now lobbied to curb.
 But at its broadest, the debate illustrates the clash between competing American values: the right to a fresh start versus the idea that people must be held responsible for their actions. 
 ''Except for those with evil motivations and a willingness to take advantage of the system, no one likes to be in debt,'' said Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican from Utah, which has the highest bankruptcy rate of any state.
 But once people borrow money, ''they need to take personal responsibility to pay it back,'' he said. ''Personal responsibility is a core American value.''
 Debt was an important and complicated subject for Americans long before there was a United States, said Ron Chernow, the biographer of Alexander Hamilton. As a founder of the new nation's banking system and a supporter of a federal bankruptcy law, Hamilton was naturally sympathetic to creditors, Mr. Chernow said. But he also helped friends who found themselves in debtors' prison.
 And like modern spendthrifts, some Founding Fathers ran up debts to pay for luxuries. ''Jefferson felt the great nightmare of his life was that he was in debt, and it preyed on his mind,'' Mr. Chernow said. 
 The tension between the views of bankruptcy as a moral failing and as an economic problem played out during the 19th century. Debtors' prisons eventually fell out of favor for humanitarian reasons -- and for the practical reason that imprisoned people could seldom pay their debts.
 Starting around 1800, Congress would ease the pain of economic crises by enacting bankruptcy protection laws, and then repeal them once the financial picture had improved. In 1898, the laws that became the foundation of the current bankruptcy system were enacted, and in 1915, the Supreme Court declared that one of the laws' purposes was to protect honest debtors. That view was reinforced in a 1934 Supreme Court case, Local Loan Company v. Hunt. The court declared that a man who had pledged his future wages to repay a $300 loan could not be forced to turn over those earnings once he declared bankruptcy. 
 The argument over new beginnings and personal responsibility has changed little, said David A. Skeel Jr., a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of ''Debt's Dominion: A History of Bankruptcy Law in America.'' (Princeton University Press, 2001). Even in the 1930's, ''there was the same debate,'' he said; people would remember that ''in the good old days, everyone paid back what they owed, and they are shameless now.''
 What has changed, he added, are the kinds of people who file for bankruptcy. In most of the last two centuries, bankrupts were usually farmers or owners of small businesses, because only they could borrow much money. ''One of the historical realities is that bankruptcy was not for the lower class,'' he said.
 Today, bankruptcy is for everyone. Last year, there were more than 1.1 million ''fresh start'' bankruptcy filings, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, which uses data from the court system. That is twice the number of such cases, known technically as Chapter 7's, that were filed in 1994. 
 How you explain the huge increase in filings tends to reflect where you come out in the broader moral debate. 
 Supporters of the bankruptcy bill cite the rise of borrowers who spend money they never intend to repay. During the Senate debate, Mr. Hatch spoke of a Wisconsin couple who deliberately ran up their bills before filing for bankruptcy, sticking their credit union with $3,000 in unpaid debt. In these stories, gamblers and greedy consumers are the main players. 
 Opponents of the bill maintain that most people who file for bankruptcy are honest but struggling; they've been laid low by some unavoidable catastrophe, like illness, divorce or unemployment.
 Elizabeth Warren, a law professor at Harvard, is the co-author of a study arguing that more than half of all bankruptcies are linked to medical costs (the study is controversial in part because its trigger for medical expenses is just $1,000). In Senate testimony, she said, ''Most debtors are filing for bankruptcy not because they had too many Rolex watches and Gameboys, but because they have no choice.''
 But Todd J. Zywicki, a professor at George Mason University School of Law, said that financial distress cannot explain the surge in personal bankruptcies in the 1990's. They were not preceded, he said, by equally steep increases in unemployment, divorce or health-care costs.
 Professor Zywicki has a number of theories on why bankruptcies have increased, but if asked to rank them, he said that the No. 1 would be ''the generosity of the bankruptcy code -- it makes it so easy.'' 
 Down in the trenches of the legal bureaucracy is George W. Liebmann, a bankruptcy trustee -- the court-appointed lawyer who scrutinizes ''fresh start'' filers for abuses. Most of the cases he has seen over 24 years, he said, are people who have gotten in over their heads on credit cards, sometimes with as many as 20 separate accounts.
 What he describes is a sick, symbiotic relationship between consumers hooked on credit and the card companies that charge them enormous fees -- at least, until they go bankrupt. ''It's a fundamentally corrupt situation, corrupt for both debtors and creditors,'' he said. ''Both get away with murder.''

HEADLINE: Mayor's Woes Reflect a City's Concern Over Legalized Gambling

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: ERIE, Pa., March 11 

 BODY:
The one-armed bandits have not arrived. The casino has not even been built. But with the prosecution of its dimple-chinned mayor, this industrial town on the bluffs of ice-clogged Lake Erie is at the center of a debate over Pennsylvania's newest legalized vice: slot machine gambling. 
 In a preliminary hearing this week, state prosecutors began outlining criminal charges against Mayor Richard E. Filippi, 38, asserting he conspired with friends and law partners to buy land around a shuttered paper plant in the expectation that it would become the site of a horse track and slot-machine parlor. 
 Mr. Filippi, the prosecutors say, planned to help the developers win approvals and tax breaks, then pressure them into buying his properties. The mayor and two other defendants have pleaded not guilty. 
 To gambling opponents, Mr. Filippi's case, which is not expected to be resolved before the Democratic primary on May 17, in which the mayor will face five challengers, has become a morality play about the corruptibility of elected officials and the seductive song of gambling.
 ''When they passed the slots bill, there was wagering in the Capitol about how soon the first municipal official would be indicted,'' said Michael Geer, president of the Pennsylvania Family Institute, a nonprofit policy group that opposes gambling. ''I'll bet you now that no one thought it would be this fast.'' 
 ''What people are witnessing in Erie,'' Mr. Geer said, ''will be business as usual in other jurisdictions that legalize casino gambling.''
 But for many in Erie, the mayor's case is just a backdrop to a broader debate about the spoils of gambling. Will slot machines deliver the tax revenues, jobs and property tax reduction its proponents have promised? And if they do, who will reap those benefits? 
 Local officials are already feuding over how to allocate $10 million in projected annual tax revenues from a proposed slot machine parlor and horse racing track in Summit Township, a suburb of Erie. 
 County officials want the money divided among the county, the city and other municipalities, while the township is proposing to return $5 million a year for five years to subsidize developers' costs. 
 There are also growing concerns about Gov. Edward G. Rendell's signature provision in the gaming law: property tax rebates financed by as much as $1 billion in slot machine revenues per year. To qualify, school boards must relinquish their powers to increase local property taxes, leaving future increases to voter referendums. 
 The plan was Mr. Rendell's major selling point for the gaming bill last July, but many school boards now say they may forgo the rebates because they will hamstring their abilities to raise money for crises or capital programs. 
 ''The school boards and superintendents don't know what to do,'' said Jacob A. Rouch, president of the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership.
 Mr. Rouch said that many business leaders viewed a slot machine parlor in Summit as a welcome tourist attraction. But they also question whether it will do much to revitalize the region's economy, which lost 4,000 manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2003. 
 ''I think most business leaders don't view this as a savior,'' he said. ''We may be just transferring money that was already here.''
 Proponents of gambling say it will help transform Erie from a blue-collar town of machine shops and plastic manufacturers into a major tourist destination. Already, they say, the city has one of the finest beaches in the Great Lakes, a seven-mile stretch of pebble-strewn sand along a peninsula known as Presque Isle.
 ''Manufacturing is fighting to stay important, corporations have left town,'' said Nick Scott Sr., president of a family-run business that operates hotels and restaurants in the region. ''But the resorts and service sector is growing.'' From its earliest days, Erie was a fishing and shipbuilding town, whose workers built the fleet with which Commodore Perry faced the British Navy during the War of 1812. It became a way station for European immigrants and Great Lakes commerce in Minnesota iron ore and Appalachian coal. But Erie never grew very large, holding its place as Pennsylvania's third-biggest city until the 2000 census showed it slipping to fourth, behind Allentown, with 103,700 residents. 
 Today, the city is a patchwork of blue-collar neighborhoods, dotted by wood-frame homes, corner taverns and churches. Its favorite son, Tom Ridge, the former governor and former secretary of homeland security, grew up in subsidized housing here. 
 This week, in a courtroom nestled amid snow-swept vineyards of Concord grapes east of Erie, prosecutors began outlining their case against Mr. Filippi.
 But the case was thrown into disarray when prosecutors requested that the judge, Frank Abate, withdraw, asserting that he improperly recommended that the parties reach a plea agreement. 
 With a hearing scheduled on the prosecutors' petition next week, Erie is consuming a daily diet of news about the case. Even some opponents of gambling express sympathy for the mayor. ''I feel bad for the guy,'' said Lee Coleman, a retired engineer. ''He's got a wife, children. It's just that the gambling promoters throw so much money around, it's corrupting.''
 To others, Mr. Filippi's travails have created wistful dismay about lost honor, both his and the city's.
 ''There's a lot of disappointment,'' said Mr. Rouch, a friend and former classmate of Mr. Filippi. ''But we're not going to be defined by one event. This is not how Erie does business.''

An article last Sunday about turmoil in Erie, Pa., over the legalization of slot machine gambling referred incompletely to a provision of state law that calls for machine revenues to be used for property tax rebates. To qualify, school boards must give up their power to increase property taxes above a state inflation index -- not their power to increase property taxes in general.

HEADLINE: Fliers Find That Mileage Points Go Only So Far

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
For two decades, travelers enjoyed a golden age of frequent-flier programs, hoarding miles and sometimes becoming intoxicated by them. It was a love affair at 30,000 feet: airlines enticed passengers with promises of free tickets and first-class upgrades, in return for their dollars and loyalty.
 To build up their accounts, some fliers zealously boarded flights at odd hours and endured connections even when there was a direct route home, expecting their miles to be valuable currency for vacations and comfort. But passengers are facing the prospect that like free meals and pillows, the golden age for frequent fliers is going away.
 Travelers, now ready to book trips for spring and summer, are increasingly complaining that the tight supply of free tickets on crowded planes means they cannot secure their first or second or even third choice of dates and destinations at the airlines' cheapest rates. Some are spending far more miles than they anticipated in a bid to evade complicated restrictions. Others must split up family groups and fly on different days, spoiling some of their holiday fun. 
 Passengers like Roger Nickel of Boca Raton, Fla., are abandoning their unused miles on big airlines and switching to low-fare carriers like Southwest that give free tickets based on the number of flights travelers take, not the miles they travel. 
 Credit card customers, once beholden to a single airline's frequent-flier program, are seeking other rewards, too. If the trend continues, it may deprive the airlines, which sell credit card issuers billions of dollars worth of miles each year, of an important revenue stream.
 The big airlines are in a bind. In the past, they simply piled on the miles to calm passengers down. But today, passengers in the United States are sitting on more than nine trillion frequent-flier miles, 50 percent more than just 5 years ago, according to WebFlyer.com. That is enough for 36 million free tickets, at the basic rate of 25,000 miles -- or enough to give almost everyone who flew out of Kennedy International Airport last year a free ticket. 
 To be sure, big airlines could revitalize the programs by making more seats available. But with planes chock-full of paying passengers, they would prefer not to give any more tickets away. And with $8.3 billion in collective losses last year, constant fare wars and rising jet fuel prices, they can't afford to.
 ''It's become such a double-edged sword,'' said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, which represents airline passengers.
 The result is a vicious cycle: more miles given, more miles unredeemed. To protect themselves in the event consumers started a run on miles, airlines would have no choice but to increase restrictions and blackout dates even more. Nobody expects them to do away with the mileage programs altogether. After all, analysts say, consumers might very well riot. In the meantime, no one seems happy. ''What the airlines have done,'' said Max H. Bazerman, a professor at the Harvard Business School, ''is devalue miles.'' 
 In 1994, airlines required only 20,000 miles for a free ticket. Coupled with higher airfares, that meant miles were worth about 2 cents apiece, according to IdeaWorks, a consulting firm in Shorewood, Wis. 
 Today, with airfares way down but the mileage requirement way up, miles are worth about 1.4 cents apiece, IdeaWorks says.
 And they could really be worth half that, said Tim Winship, the publisher of Frequentflier.com. The reason is what he calls ''the hassle factor,'' the inconvenience many travelers encounter when booking their tickets.
 For their part, the big airlines say they are fulfilling their basic promise of a free plane ticket, even if it requires that passengers be flexible. The airlines also argue there are multiple ways for travelers to redeem miles beyond simply plane tickets. 
 ''I don't know if it's as good as the good old days,'' said Dan Garton, senior vice president at American Airlines, ''but it sure isn't bad.''
 At least for the airlines, that is. They have total control over every aspect of their frequent-flier plans, from the number of tickets available, which they do not disclose, to the dates when customers can redeem their miles and the levels required to earn rewards. 
 Faced with a glut of demand, they could tighten the restrictions as they did in 2002, when the basic amount needed to redeem a ticket went up by 5,000 miles at the major airlines.
 And the adjustments haven't stopped. At the end of last year, US Airways, which is operating under bankruptcy court protection, said that frequent fliers were entitled to the equivalent of four million free trips, 37 percent fewer than in 2003. While travelers cashed in more miles, the airline added new programs that offered more flexibility but doubled the mileage requirements. US Airways also said that more fliers have been trading in miles for tickets on its partner airlines, most likely because of worries that US Airways might not be around to honor their miles.
 The difficulty in redeeming his miles was a reason that Mr. Nickel, the Boca Raton resident and an insurance company manager, has all but given up flying on US Airways and American.
 Instead, Mr. Nickel, 46, now primarily takes Southwest, where eight flights earn him a free trip. ''On all these other airlines, there are restrictions,'' he said. ''I have tens of thousands of miles I can't redeem.'' 
 While Southwest has 16 blackout days a year, most around Thanksgiving and Christmas, it does not limit the number of free seats on each flight. ''As long as the seat is available and the customer can get on the flight, they can have the ticket,'' said Debra Benton, Southwest's director for loyalty marketing.
 That is easier for Southwest to do, because its planes typically make more trips each day than those at the big airlines. And its flights average only about 65 percent full, versus as much as 80 percent for its rivals.
 But Southwest customers have to act fast: once earned, their flight credits are good only for a year, versus the three-year life of frequent-flier miles at the big airlines. That shelf life is the same at JetBlue, which awards a free ticket once passengers have accumulated 100 points, which are given out based on the distance traveled.
 Some travelers on the major carriers are now getting help. American, whose AAdvantage program kicked off the industry's rush toward miles in 1981, touts its Hot Spots page on its Web site as one answer.
 On a color-coded grid, where green means free seats are plentiful, and white means none are available, customers from New York were told this winter that free weekend tickets to Aruba and Orlando, Fla., were gone in April, but they had a good chance of flying to Cancun, Mexico, if they were willing to go on a weekday. 
 Even then, passengers were not guaranteed a seat: the site cautioned that free tickets ''may not be available on all flights.''
 With planes so full, ''I presume there are cases when a free seat is harder to find,'' Mr. Garton acknowledged. 
 Inke Bauder found that out this winter. She had more than 400,000 miles in her Northwest Airlines account by taking annual trips home to Finland from Detroit. So she tried to use some of those miles for a business trip to Las Vegas.
 Assuming the journey would cost a basic 25,000 miles, Ms. Bauder was shocked to learn she would have to redeem 90,000 miles, much more than she had used in the past to fly overseas.
 The reason, Northwest said, was that all the 25,000-mile tickets on the day she wanted to travel were gone. The only seat she could have was a first-class ticket available under the ''mileage buster'' program. Like those at other airlines, the plan lets passengers get past the restrictions, but at a big cost. 
 ''They're making it too difficult,'' said Mrs. Bauder, 59, who owns a skin-care salon in Ann Arbor, Mich. Though she decided to cash in her miles for the trip, she said, ''it has gotten to the point where it isn't even worth trying.''
 Behind recent developments are the airlines' shifting economics, which were built in part on cooperation with the credit card industry.
 For the first time last year, the majority of credit card offers were not for airline rewards programs but for those that offered a range of rewards, from plasma-screen televisions to books from Amazon.com. And the number of consumers who signed up online for airline-sponsored cards plummeted almost 40 percent, to 250,000, in the second half of last year, according to data from comScore Networks. Indeed, credit card issuers are finding that airline miles no longer are the only way to stimulate purchasing. High spenders have collected too many; low spenders cannot earn enough for a free trip; and those in the middle have other needs.
 For his part, Professor Bazerman of the Harvard Business School is using up his miles as fast as he can. ''Miles today are worth half of what they were five years ago. And they will be worth half again someday,'' he said.
 ''I'm telling all my friends: Use your miles.''


CORRECTION-DATE: March 17, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about a tightening in the supply of free tickets available through frequent flier programs misstated the number of tickets that could theoretically be bought with the total mileage credits currently outstanding. The nine trillion miles that passengers have not yet used could buy 360 million free tickets, not 36 million, at the basic rate of 25,000 miles. That is enough to give almost everyone who flew out of Kennedy International Airport last year 10 tickets, not 1 ticket.

HEADLINE: New Signs On the Arab Street

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
From Baghdad to Beirut, the Middle East has seen a series of unprecedented popular demonstrations for democracy. There were, however, two street protests in December that got virtually no coverage, but were just as important, if not more. One took place in the Egyptian Nile Delta town of Mahalla and the other in the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya. Both of these raucous Egyptian demonstrations, which involved marches, strikes, denunciations of the government and appeals to Parliament, were triggered by President Hosni Mubarak's decision to sign the first substantial trade agreement with Israel since Camp David. That decision brought Egyptian workers from both areas into the streets. They were furious. They were enraged. Why?
 They were not included in the new trade deal with Israel. 
 Now, that's a new Middle East. On Dec. 14, Egypt, Israel and the U.S. signed an accord setting up three Qualified Industrial Zones (Q.I.Z.'s) in Egypt. The deal stipulated the following: Any Egyptian company operating in one of these Q.I.Z.'s that imports from an Israeli company at least 11.7 percent of the parts, materials or services that go into the Egyptian company's final product can then export that finished product to the U.S. duty free. This is a big deal for Egypt, which, unlike Jordan and Israel, does not have a free-trade treaty with the U.S. As part of the accord, the U.S. named Greater Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said the three Q.I.Z.'s. It had to be limited to only three municipalities so that the U.S. would not be swamped with Egyptian exports -- hence the protests from the two big Egyptian manufacturing centers that were left out. 
 According to Rashid Mohamed Rashid, Egypt's impressive new minister of foreign trade, 397 Egyptian companies have already signed up to participate in the Q.I.Z. program, most of them small and medium-size firms. Many of these Egyptian companies have already gone to Israel to forge deals with Israeli suppliers or started work with Israeli partners to identify export markets in the U.S. Some Israeli companies are setting up shop in the Egyptian Q.I.Z.'s to provide services right on the spot. 
 There are a lot of messages in this bottle. One is that if you create a real opportunity for Israeli and Egyptian businesses to interact profitably, not only will Egyptians ignore the protests of the old Nasserites who want to boycott Israel, they will seize the opportunity and protest mightily if they are kept out.
 Another message: This ''Baghdad spring'' will not blossom into sustainable democracy in any of these Arab states without a broader middle class and civil society institutions to support it. For too long, U.S. foreign policy was based on buying stability in the Arab world by supporting dictators, who destroyed all the independent press, political parties, unions, real private sector and civil society in their countries -- everything except the mosque. Iraq is the starkest example of this, which is why democratization there will take time.
 Looking at Eastern Europe on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall, said Emanuele Ottolenghi, a lecturer on the Middle East at Oxford, ''we could have predicted which countries would have an easy transition to democracy and which ones not.'' Countries like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states, which had a history of liberal institutions and free markets that had been suppressed by communism, quickly flourished. Others farther east, which did not have such institutions in their past and were starting from scratch -- Bulgaria, Romania and the former Soviet republics -- have struggled since the fall of the wall.
 The same will be true in the Middle East, where democracy will not just spring up because autocrats fall down. It will arise only if these countries develop, among other things, export-oriented private sectors, which can be the foundation for a vibrant middle class that is not dependent upon the state for contracts and has a vital interest in an open economy, a free press and its own political parties. The development of such a private sector was crucial in democratizing Taiwan and South Korea.
 That is why, beyond Iraq, America's priorities should be to sign a free-trade agreement with Egypt -- which would help foster an export-oriented private sector there just when President Mubarak has signaled an end to 50 years of military rule -- and get Syria out of Lebanon, which would free the dynamic private sector that already exists there, but has been stifled by Syria. Free Lebanon and free Egypt's economy and they will change the rest of the Middle East for us -- for free.

HEADLINE: Well, Cheaper Tickets to Start With

 BODY:
VALLEJO GANTNER, the new artistic director of the avant-garde mecca P.S. 122 in the East Village, is a man of strong theatrical beliefs-- and a mighty to-do list. ''There's an advantage to having a fresh perspective in a city and a culture where you don't owe anyone any favors,'' said Mr. Gantner, who relocated from Dublin. ''You'll see and talk to anybody, and you don't know where any of the skeletons are, which makes falling over them much easier.'' 
 Mr. Gantner, 30 and originally from Australia, directed the Dublin Fringe Festival to great acclaim for the last three years. He is now settling in at P.S. 122, managing the current season, planning the fall season and working on ''big-picture, long-term dreams.'' Here's what he is hoping to see during his tenure in New York.
 Cheaper tickets. I'm shocked by the prices in New York. How can people see things?
 Theater and performance that isn't stuck in a conversation with itself, referring only to other work and playing to audiences comprised solely of other theater makers. Sometime in the 80's I feel like theater lost its sense of being able to change the world, and I fear audiences now agree. 
 I'd love to see how the economic ''trickle effect'' -- from Broadway to the experimental scene -- that I keep being told about really works, or indeed if it's there at all.
 We need performance and theater to stop copying TV and popular culture's pervasive mores, and start leading it. 
 A foyer at P.S. 122 to escape from the First Avenue winter winds.
 Plays written for performance, not for reading. Too many plays are written today that prevent interpretation by a director or company -- their intent is too literal, too predictable. They are written to be read, not performed. We need writers who question every idea of what a text can be, of how it can work with an audience, and who embrace the idea that an audience can leave a theater arguing about what the whole thing was about.
 Unpredictable and visceral ways of seeing theater grab onto the political fire that's in people of any persuasion's bellies at the moment. Too much theater is written about a problem but refuses to use the form itself as a tool. Dance that works with political ideas is far more interesting at the moment. 
 I'd love to see a big cheesy Broadway show. I've never caught one.

HEADLINE: The Two Faces Of Rising China

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
CHINA'S leaders announced last week at the annual National People's Congress that they will give themselves legal authority to attack Taiwan if they decide that the disputed territory has ventured too far toward independence. It was their boldest ultimatum to date, backed by China's rapidly modernizing military.
 But the banner headline in the next day's China Daily, the official English-language newspaper was: ''Peace Paramount in Anti-Secession Bill.''
 Rising China has two faces. Its leaders want -- arguably need -- to be viewed as managing a new kind of emerging superpower, one that will not threaten neighbors or the world. Only a gentle giant can attract $60 billion in foreign investment and rack up $160 billion annual trade surpluses with the United States, the thinking goes. 
 Yet the Communist Party has also concluded it would lose power if it cedes Taiwan. The bill introduced last Tuesday, and set for passage Monday, is just the latest attempt to prove that the party will pay any price, including a war that might well involve the United States, to preserve China's territorial integrity.
 ''Our elites know China will have difficulty rising if the world worries about a new military threat,'' says Jin Canrong, a foreign policy expert at People's University in Beijing. ''But China also cannot rise if Taiwan breaks away. And Taiwan will break away unless the threat of force is very real.''
 China has no immediate ambitions to shake the world order or challenge the United States, many analysts say. Washington wants to keep it that way. But Taiwan is bringing out China's aggressive instincts, with unpredictable results.
 ''I don't know which side is winning -- the side that wants to fight for national interests, or the side that accepts international norms,'' says Philip Yang, a cross-strait expert at National Taiwan University in Taipei.
 China has thrived because it devotes itself to economic development while letting the United States police the region and the world. Beijing sometimes decries American hegemony, but its leaders envision Pax Americana extending well into the 21st century, at least until China becomes a middle class society and, if present trends continue, the world's largest economy.
 China insists it has no fights to pick. Its evolving foreign policy maxims -- principles of peaceful co-existence, peaceful orientation, peaceful rise, peaceful development -- have the same emphasis.
 Beijing spends far more resources on domestic projects, like bridges, steel mills and office towers, than it does on the military. Its economic strategy depends more heavily on integration with the outside world than Germany or Japan did in the years before they asserted themselves in the first half of the 20th century.
 ''They want to have a peaceful rise because they have to,'' says Robert G. Sutter, a former National Security Council official who is now an Asia specialist at Georgetown University. ''They have done a cost-benefit analysis and they have found that it is much too costly to be antagonistic'' to the United States, he said.
 China is smoothing relations with most big countries. It recently settled border disputes with India and Russia, backed the American war on terror, soft-pedaled territorial claims in the South China Sea, lured Southeast Asian neighbors into a trade pact, even stepped up foreign aid.
 Taiwan is the big exception. Cross-strait relations have deteriorated since the mid-1990's. That is largely because Taiwan's independence movement has grown in popularity. Chen Shui-bian, the independence-leaning president, won two elections. But tensions have also risen because Beijing has shown little flexibility or creativity in accommodating Taiwan's democratically expressed wariness of the mainland.
 Its strategy often seems limited to reflecting the certainty of an attack if Taiwan tries creating a separate legal identity. The anti-secession bill may have been introduced precisely because it appears to tie the leadership's hands -- and make war seem inevitable -- if Taiwan changes its formal name or redrafts sensitive clauses in its Constitution.
 In a sense this is just more saber-rattling. China has long breathed fire about Taiwanese independence, so much so that Mr. Chen and many other politicians in Taiwan have discounted Chinese threats. 
 Their assumption is that China will not really attack because it ultimately cares more about domestic development, playing host to the 2008 Olympics, and avoiding a conflict with the United States than it does about securing its sovereignty over Taiwan.
 But Beijing's leaders have also concluded that the Communist Party needs to draw the line on Taiwan's ''splittists.'' The party has staked its reputation on restoring the Chinese nation to its rightful place in the world. 
 After the return of Hong Kong to the Chinese fold in 1997, Taiwan remains the most visible reminder of the dismemberment China suffered at the hands of foreign powers at the end of the Qing dynasty (though many Taiwanese claim the island did not belong to the mainland then any more than it does today).
 China treats Taiwan as sovereign territory. So it insists its belligerence should not be seen as infecting its approach to other nations. Even the draft bill introduced this week devotes three sections to peaceful overtures to Taiwan. Only the final, fourth section notes the conditions under which China would consider other means, which the bill refers to vaguely as ''nonpeaceful.''
 Yet there are signs that China cannot easily compartmentalize Taiwan. Military spending has surged in recent years, with the official budget rising to $30 billion in 2005. Western analysts say that actual spending may be two or three times higher. 
 The target is Taiwan. But China's new Russian-made Su-30MKK fighters and Kilo-class attack submarines could inflict plenty of damage on the United States Pacific fleet, and the build-up has alarmed Japan.
 ''Taiwan is a problem for America and Japan as much as it is for China because it is the excuse China has used to build up its military,'' said Mr. Jin of People's University. ''If there were not the Taiwan issue, China would find it harder to justify this kind of spending.''
 A European diplomat in Beijing said last week that the anti-secession bill, especially if it prompts a tit-for-tat response from Taiwan, could raise the risk of conflict and cause the European Union to delay the lifting of its arms embargo on China, one of Beijing's top priorities.
 Relations with Japan have grown testy. Historical animosity from Japan's occupation of China has played a role. But Japan recently discovered a Chinese submarine mapping the ocean floor in Japanese territorial waters, possibly preparing for a sea battle over Taiwan or contested energy resources. And Japan joined the United States in February in a public pledge to defend Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.
 In its quest for energy, China has also curried favor with Iran and Sudan, oil-rich nations that have rocky relations with the West. It has threatened to use its veto at the United Nations to prevent international sanctions to punish Iran for its nuclear program or Sudan for its alleged genocide.
 ''I see them as becoming less and less conciliatory on issues they consider to be vital interests,'' says Bonnie S. Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. She cited Japan and energy security as well as Taiwan as examples of China's more nationalist approach.
 Increasingly there are two Chinas on the world stage. One has 19th century notions of sovereignty and historical destiny. The other embraces 21st century notions of global integration. The anti-secession bill looks like a victory for the atavists.

HEADLINE: Battle Splits Conservative Magazine

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
FOR the decade since its founding by the neoconservative thinker Irving Kristol, The National Interest has been a central forum for the most influential conservative foreign policy thinkers of all stripes to hash out their differences. It launched ideas that entered the public policy vernacular, like ''the end of history,'' ''the West and the rest,'' and ''geo-economics,'' and for the last six months it has played host to a closely watched intramural conservative debate over the wisdom of the war in Iraq.
 Now, however, a philosophical disagreement within its editorial board has put its future in turmoil. On Friday, 10 well-known board members, including the conservatives Midge Decter, Samuel P. Huntington and Francis Fukuyama, announced their resignations, saying they disagreed with the narrowly realist foreign policy of its new owner, the Nixon Center. 
 At issue is the perspective laid out in the most recent issue by Robert F. Ellsworth, vice chairman of the Nixon Center, a ''realist'' foreign policy research group that acquired sole control of the journal last year, and Dimitri K. Simes, president of the center and co-publisher of the journal. In an editorial headlined ''Realism's Shining Morality,'' they wrote: ''Overzealousness in the cause of democracy (along with a corresponding underestimation of the costs and dangers) has led to a dangerous overstretch in Iraq,'' arguing that United States interests may sometimes require cooperation with undemocratic regimes.
 The mass resignation is the latest round in a fierce debate on the right over the invasion. It is also the latest high-profile fight picked by Mr. Fukuyama, a prominent neoconservative and the author of ''The End of History.'' 
 Last fall, he helped set off that debate with an essay in The National Interest calling his fellow neoconservatives ''strangely disconnected from reality'' for their continued celebration of the Iraq occupation as a success. Foreign policy realists, who question the necessity of the war, cheered his apparent defection.
 In leading the defections from The National Interest, however, Mr. Fukuyama is aiming in the other direction: he is accusing its publishers of squeezing out liberal or neoconservative arguments about the universal appeal of democracy and the importance of spreading democracy to America's self-interest. 
 ''What we liked about the old National Interest was the variety of viewpoints that it published,'' Mr. Fukuyama wrote in a letter signed by all 10 departing board members. ''We do not have confidence that this kind of editorial policy can long be retained by a magazine with a mandate to represent the interests of the Nixon Center.''
 Upon receiving the letter, the publishers of the journal sent their own letter dissolving the advisory board, which had two remaining members, the neoconservative columnists Charles Krauthammer and Daniel Pipes. ''I think this group, frankly, belongs to the past, and we wanted to have some changes,'' said Mr. Simes, adding that there was no plan to narrow the range of contributors.
 Mr. Simes accused Mr. Fukuyama of self-aggrandizement, saying he had previously offered to bring new financing to the journal if he could take control. ''To me, it looks like a failed takeover,'' Mr. Simes said.
 In an interview, Mr. Fukuyama said that, to carry on the debate about the war in Iraq and American foreign policy, he now planned to start another journal, The American Interest, with three others from the National Interest board: Zbigniew Brzezinski, a liberal and President Carter's former national security adviser; Eliot A. Cohen, a military scholar and neoconservative, and Josef Joffe, a leading German editor. 
 ''In the wake of Iraq, I think there is going to be this fight over what a certain conservative foreign policy is, and I personally don't want to see the realists walking about with a lot of moral authority at this point,'' Mr. Fukuyama said.
 But he said the new journal would not hew to any ideological line; instead, it will try to look at American actions in a global context. ''It's about America in the world, how it ought to behave and what the consequences of its actions are,'' he said. ''Everyone in the world is preoccupied with the United States, and they feel they don't understand it, and we want to help them with that.''
 He said the new journal, which will initially be financed by a Boston venture capitalist, will also publish perspectives on American policies from foreigners who may feel the effects of American actions.
 William Kristol, editor of the neoconservative Weekly Standard and son of Irving Kristol, said he welcomed the planned journal. ''My father said many times, the more journals, the better,'' he said. ''Soon there are going to be more neoconservative magazines than there are neoconservatives.''

HEADLINE: Union Labor, Squeezed From All Directions

BYLINE: By STACY ALBIN

 BODY:
TOM BRYANT of Bay Shore, a member of the Steamfitters Local 638, says he dreads having to leave Long Island again to find work. His last stint out of town -- in 1998 in California -- lasted seven months. Although the job put food on the table, it also put a strain on his marriage, he said.
 Now, Mr. Bryant, 47, finds his options dwindling. He hasn't had steady work since September, and he has already run through his savings and the fund he had set aside to pay for college for his daughter. 
 ''Very soon, I'll have to go,'' he said. ''I'll go wherever it takes to make money.'' 
 Jack Kennedy, the president of the Nassau-Suffolk Building Trades Council, said the problem is that there are not many construction projects currently under way on the Island, and unemployment in the unionized trades is high as a consequence. 
 The state doesn't keep statistics on union unemployment, but a brief survey of individual unions turned up figures at least double the Island-wide unemployment rate of 3.6 percent in December. 
 At Local 25 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, for instance, nearly 370 of its 2,800 members have been out of work since December, said Donald Fiore, the business agent. That's about 160 more members than last March, he said, and nearly 200 more than in 2002. 
 At Local 7 of the Empire State Regional Council of Carpenters, about 450 of the 3,000 members are out of work, said Michael Conroy, the director of organizing. And in Local 1486 of District Council 9 of the Painters and Allied Trades Union, about 75 of the 400 members are unemployed, said Jim Rogers, the business agent. 
 Desmond M. Ryan, the executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers' lobbying group, said that cost was a problem. ''When it comes to development projects, there are those in the development community that feel that dealing with unions drives up the cost of a project,'' he said. ''In some instances it can be up to a third more.''
 By his estimates, Mr. Kennedy said, nonunion wages are $10 to $12 an hour, compared with union scales that range from $38 to $60 an hour. He argues that higher wages bring in skilled workers who produce a superior job. In his view, priorities are out of line: Long Island's economy depends heavily on workers who earn a living wage, who shop locally and who pay taxes, but local businesses refuse to lay out the money to employ them. 
 Union members are fighting back, staging protests at two construction projects that have hired nonunion workers. At the Country Glen Shopping Center in Carle Place, where a new Stop & Shop supermarket and an addition to Barnes & Noble are going up, union members have handed out fliers and displayed a billboard that read: ''Boycott the Country Glen Mall. Unfair to Long Island's working families. Please shop at Roosevelt Field Mall.''
 Mr. Bryant, the Bay Shore steamfitter, was at a Country Glen protest and said changing jobs was not an option for him. ''I have 18 years invested now,'' he said. ''What am I going to do? I couldn't make enough money without the union.'' 
 A secretary answering the phone at the Murray H. Miller Management Corporation, which operates Country Glen, said the company had no comment. 
 Mr. Rogers of the Painters and Allied Trades' District Council 9, in Hauppauge, said the union had submitted a fire-sale bid to Continental Contractors of Annapolis, Md., the general contractor for refurbishing the 360 hotel rooms at the Hyatt Wind Watch, also in Hauppauge. Union paperhangers, who typically earn $32.25 an hour, had submitted a bid at 65 percent of their usual hourly wage, Mr. Rogers said, and the painters, who also earn $32.25 an hour, bid at a 50 percent discount. ''The general contractor said it's still double what these guys are going to do it for,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''God only knows what they're working for.'' 
 But Terry O'Leary, a senior vice president and the asset manager at Highland Hospitality of McLean, Va., which owns the Hyatt Wind Watch, said that the Painters and Allied Trades Union had missed the deadline on bids for refurbishing the rooms, although bids were still being received for the lobby and public rooms. ''They didn't even bid initially,'' he said.
 Mr. O'Leary took issue with the accusation that his company did not support local workers. ''We do support the community,'' he said, noting that the 200 hotel employees live on Long Island.
 Competition these days comes from many different places, Mr. Fiore of the electricians' Local 25 
 said, and gave this example. Last September, construction began on a $15 million project to install electronic signs on the Northern State and Meadowbrook Parkways to inform motorists of traffic conditions ahead. The general contractor was Liddell Brothers of Norwell, Mass. 
 ''Even New York State doesn't give work to New York contractors,'' Mr. Fiore said. But Liddell's lawyer, Robert Dyer of Thelen, Reid & Priest in Manhattan, said the company had hired some local union members. It had a choice between workers from Local 25 of the electrical workers or from Laborers Local 1298, based in Hempstead, and decided on Local 1298. Any jurisdictional dispute, he said, needs to be addressed by the unions, not Liddell.
 ''Liddell is a union shop,'' he said. ''All of the trades on the Informed System are union. We pay them proper wages.'' 
 Another trend that works against union labor is hiring workers as independent contractors, Mr. Conroy of the carpenters' Local 7. The employers do not pay benefits, are not responsible for contributions to Social Security and offer low hourly wages, he said. But when it comes time to bid on jobs, these employers have a substantial edge and are wrongly rewarded, Mr. Conroy contends. 
 ''The government has just taken a blind eye to it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Running on Empty

BYLINE: By NATALIE CANAVOR

 BODY:
IF the cost of energy skyrockets, are the suburbs doomed? Would Long Island, already paying among the highest fuel and electricity rates in the country, become an unsustainably expensive place to live?
 A way of thinking that says ''yes'' is circulating, and has assumed tangible form in a video called ''The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream.'' Made in Toronto by the independent producers Gregory Greene and Barry Silverthorn, it explores the idea that the world is running out of cheap petrofuels and predicts the utter ruin of North America's suburbs -- and not in the distant future, but somewhere between 5 and 25 years from now.
 The video was screened last month at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, under the sponsorship of Long Island Neighborhood Network, an environmental advocacy group, and Vision Long Island, an organization that promotes the ''new urbanism'' or ''smart growth'' philosophy, which favors high-density, mixed-use, work-where-you-live downtowns over the classic low-density, home-with-a-yard model of suburbia. 
 The video opens with nostalgic clips of the early days of suburbia -- excited young couples holding boxy little home models, families piling up their shopping carts, neat little back yards -- and asserts that the new sprawl pattern, totally dependent on the automobile, became synonymous with the American dream. It also represents, in the words of a featured commentator, James Howard Kunstler, ''the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. America took all its postwar wealth and invested it in a living arrangement that has no future.'' 
 In this view the 21st-century poison is peak oil theory, the idea that the world has reached its maximum oil production or soon will, and that we are entering a period when escalating energy costs will make the suburban lifestyle untenable. The case is made by assorted geologists, professors, writers and oil industry pundits, but most notably Mr. Kunstler, a new urbanist whose book ''Geography of Nowhere'' is a strident criticism of suburbia. 
 As envisioned by Messrs. Greene and Silverthorn, the consequences go way beyond violence at the gas pump to include: unending economic depression, with radical downsizing of everything from manufacturing to education; a slump in food production because of soil degradation, lack of oil-based fertilizers and skyrocketing shipping costs; political upheavals; the election of demagogues; and global conflict as the United States tries by military means to maintain its disproportionate consumption of the world's oil. The filmmakers see the American suburbs as the slums of the future where people are desperately relearning how to grow their own food.
 ''I do see a lot of potential for darkness,'' Mr. Kunstler comments. ''There'll be a great scramble to get out of the suburbs, a sort of fight over the table scraps of the 20th century.''
 The video's original footage was shot near Toronto and various areas of the United States, and in fact the suburbs all do look remarkably alike. Mr. Greene said in a telephone interview that no shooting was done on Long Island, but that he had heard of Levittown.
 Mr. Kunstler, whose ideas form the backbone of ''End of Suburbia,'' lived in Roslyn for three years as a child beginning in 1954 and visited regularly thereafter. ''Certainly my impressions were shaped there,'' he said. ''That part of the Island was only beginning to be destroyed and I actually watched the process vividly as the estate that ran behind my back yard was turned into a cul de sac subdivision. The experience stayed with me.''
 Following the screening was a discussion period. ''Is this where we get out the purple Kool-Aid?'' asked Eric Alexander, executive director of Vision Long Island. 
 The audience of about 50 in the auditorium in Rockville Centre, in the heart of what is often described as the first suburb, was enthusiastic, in a shell-shocked sort of way. Since most in attendance had gotten wind of the screening via environmentalist networking channels, they tended to find reinforcement for their own beliefs rather than reason to question the basic premises. There were comments about the need to grow our own food, create new lifestyle models on the Island, fight nimbyism and conserve energy in both large-scale and personal ways.
 In the bleak future projected by the film, the only glimpse of hope is new urbanism. This is the philosophy that drives Vision Long Island. 
 ''We were laughed at when we started in 1997,'' Mr. Alexander said. His group is engaged in half a dozen projects around the Island advancing a smart-growth agenda. But one of the barriers he sees is that too few people are ''aware of or thinking about alternatives in every form,'' so the film's value is in mobilizing people. 
 ''It's a little jolt to the system,'' he said, ''important because we can't get complacent intellectually or practically.''
 For some, a post-carbon age can't come soon enough. Gordian Raacke, executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island, said: ''It doesn't matter which comes first, running out of oil and other cheap fossil fuel sources, or out of places to dump our pollution. We have problems caused by our consuming patterns and addiction to polluting fossil fuels and have to immediately change our course, realizing we're affecting our own quality of life and changing the climate of the whole planet.''
 Mr. Raacke said that moving rapidly toward clean energy such as wind and solar is crucial. ''I think we are at a tipping point,'' he said. ''Renewable energy is moving into the spotlight as the obvious solution. It's a matter of political will.''
 Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, essentially agreed. ''Long Island and this region are clearly too dependent on oil not just to produce electricity but all types of activities,'' he said. ''Over 90 percent of our electricity is produced with oil and natural gas, and both are finite resources. I'm not sure I subscribe to the notion that we'll run out in two decades, but if we don't figure out a way -- not just Long Island but the whole country -- to reduce our dependence on oil, we will have long-term devastating consequences.''
 LIPA's investment in windmill energy and fuel cell technology reflects this viewpoint, Mr. Kessel said.
 But ''The End of Suburbia'' is dismissive of alternative energy source development. ''No combination of alternative energy systems will allow us to run what we are running,'' Mr. Kunstler said in a telephone interview. ''If by some miracle we developed an energy system as potent as our fossil fuels, at the very least it would not come about before we went through a punishing and prolonged period of economic hardship, and personally I think the losses would be so great we might not even be able to gear up a system like this again.''
 Not everyone agrees, of course, that we are actually in near danger of running out of relatively cheap petrofuels. ''The theory that suburbia will collapse because the era of inexpensive gas is over is a very premature and dark prediction,'' said Richard Guardino, the former Hempstead town supervisor who is now dean of the Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. ''I think people will be very creative and are already finding new alternatives, but you can debate whether things are happening at the urgency they must.'' 
 Matthew C. Cordaro, director of the C.W. Post/Long Island University Center for Management Analysis and a former Lilco executive, said that even projecting factors like the growth of China, there's still enough oil for 60 to 80 years, perhaps 100. We have almost unlimited amounts of energy around the earth, he said, when resources like coal (which can be converted to natural gas), hydrogen and uranium are taken into account. ''It's very difficult for me to conceive of skyrocketing unaffordability given this trend,'' he said, ''because you can produce electricity from a lot of sources of fuel and easily distribute it.'' 
 ''Prices will increase -- that you can count on, like death and taxes -- but not disproportionately,'' Dr. Cordaro said. ''Competitive forces will hold them in check.''
 David Manning, senior vice president for corporate affairs at Keyspan and formerly Canada's deputy energy minister, also said economic forces will protect us from disaster. ''What we're seeing is that the economy is continuing to run and grow even at $50 per barrel for oil,'' he said. ''At that price we're bringing along new resources that would have been unaffordable, such as the oil sands of western Canada.'' 
 But Mr. Manning had a warning. ''Knowing there's still an abundant supply of energy doesn't mean we're using it wisely,'' he said. ''So how can Long Island leadership make the right decisions about efficiency, invest dollars in the infrastructure?''
 That's a central question for Ernest Fazio, chairman of Long Island Mid-Suffolk Business Action, which involves itself in economic and transportation issues. He said the first responses to the oil shock of the early 1970's, including the switch to smaller cars, evolved into ''better methods in every area, because we became attuned to energy being a more costly product.'' That we have backslid to larger cars and bigger houses he finds ''an aggravating fact.''
 Significant efficiency could be achieved on Long Island, according to Dr. Cordaro's Center for Policy Analysis, by re-engineering the three largest of Long Island's aging generators -- Northport, Port Jefferson and Island Park. This could triple their electricity output while radically reducing harmful emissions, according to the center's analysis. 
 Governor Pataki's energy guidelines require the state to get almost 25 percent of its electric needs from renewable, environmentally friendly sources by 2013. Just last week, Nassau legislators passed a resolution that commits the county to meeting a similar 25 percent goal by 2010.
 A developer has been selected for the Offshore Wind Project, a wind generator farm to be located southwest of Robert Moses State Park, with the hope of generating 140 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 44,000 homes. ''This will be the first offshore wind project in North America,'' Mr. Kessel said, ''and there are real challenges with costs, with permitting. But we have to do it.''
 Also, a request for proposals has been issued for a 10-megawatt fuel cell plant. Fuel cells are devices that use the chemical energy of hydrogen to produce electricity, and may prove a superior way to power vehicles electrically, as well as for heating, cooling, and general electrical supply.
 ''We have to aggressively pursue renewable technology,'' Mr. Kessel said. ''Looked at in isolation, these projects are not economical. Powering homes through wind costs more now, but over the long term, if you subscribe to the notion that oil and gas won't be here forever, and will continue to jump in price, investing in renewables is critically important so we have enough energy to keep the economy humming and provide a cleaner environment too.''
 Mr. Manning said that even without a spike in energy costs, ''there is a conservation imperative coming, though the most immediate concerns are congestion and time and affordable housing. If we can make affordable housing in proximity to train stations, there'll be a huge demand. Energy costs will contribute to this realization down the line.''
 Does the Long Island Rail Road provide some insulation against the havoc that astronomical fuel prices could wreak? Opinions vary here too.
 ''We have a huge, efficient commuting system relative to other North American cities,'' Mr. Manning said, ''so New York and Long Island are probably better set up to withstand price increases. But the transportation doesn't always take you where you want to go.''
 Mr. Guardino elaborated. ''The issue is the railroad runs east to west,'' he said. ''What's happening is that suburban communities are becoming separate economic entities while their infrastructure was developed to provide transportation for commuters. So with the roads more and more crowded with people driving here and there and not going to the city, the whole system has to be creatively rethought.''
 Some think government mandates, incentives and subsidies are essential to move us in the right direction, others that natural response to a shifting landscape of costs will prod us to change.
 ''We don't leave the lights on, we put in more insulation,'' Dr. Cordaro said. ''But energy costs are not so high as to change trends. We still buy bigger houses and cars, more appliances.''
 Mr. Guardino agreed. ''The sense of urgency is not out there yet,'' he said. ''It will take a combination of government leadership, private-sector leadership and a sense of urgency from the general population to make it clear to government that these things are priorities. 
 ''I just have a positive outlook about the Island and its ability to adapt,'' he added. ''When you combine that with the positives -- a very vibrant economy, extraordinary education system, increasing property values, the emerging biotech industry -- I think even if we're faced with some extraordinary increases in oil prices, we're capable of adapting.''
 Mr. Kunstler doesn't agree. ''I am certainly pessimistic about the great megalopolis smudge from north of Boston to south of Washington,'' he said, ''and would certainly include Long Island in that assessment. It has the added geographic problem of being a dead end, a kind of cul de sac cut off from the rest of America.'' 
 He said the public has been ''stupendously resistant'' to thinking seriously about the issues raised in the video because it is so heavily invested in the status quo. ''The dirty secret of the American economy for the last decade or so,'' Mr. Kunstler said, ''is that it is largely based on the creation of suburban sprawl -- the furnishing and accessorizing it and servicing of it. If you challenge or stop that activity, you will be in effect questioning the whole American economy.''
 Mr. Fazio takes a middle ground. 
 ''The predictions that we're running out of oil never come true,'' he remarked, ''but still, if we don't change, it's doomsday! As dumb as we are, when pushed up against the wall with a two by four, we say 'Oh, I get it.' We're slow but we're trainable.''
 He has seen ''The End of Suburbia'' and hopes more people will. ''It's absolutely essential that people know what could happen and that things don't have to be that way,'' he said.
 More than 10,000 DVD's of ''The End of Suburbia'' have been sold. Meanwhile, the filmmakers are working on a sequel called ''Escape From Suburbia'' which, Mr. Greene said, ''will tell the stories of interesting initiatives that are being fought for around the world, to find scalable, affordable energy alternatives in time for the crisis.''
 Mr. Greene said he is an optimist, but reckoned that we have 10 years, and said that he's moving soon from Toronto to France because he's convinced that ''the European dream will speak to how things play out in the 21st century, more than the American, which was a 20th-century dream.'' His collaborator, Mr. Silverthorn, is moving to rural Ontario to learn his ancestors' farming skills.

HEADLINE: Fighting Shinnecocks' Alcohol Abuse

BYLINE: By TOM CLAVIN

DATELINE: SHINNECOCK INDIAN RESERVATION 

 BODY:
THE pastor of the Presbyterian church on the Shinnecock Indian Reservation, the Rev. Michael Smith, wants to tackle the tribe's problems with drug and alcohol abuse because they result in higher-than-average unemployment, below-average life expectancy, and unbearable medical bills. But there is another reason: he has been there himself.
 ''There was a time when I felt very lost, when I thought there was no way to get back up,'' said Mr. Smith, who is now in his 20th year as head of the only church on the 800-acre reservation. ''I look around the reservation now and see too many people like that, with another generation coming up behind them.'' 
 ''I see the insanity every day here,'' said Mr. Smith, a member of one of the tribe's most prominent families. ''I know of diabetics, even family members, who are diabetic and continue to drink. It's so self-destructive, and it needs to stop.''
 He contends that 10 to 20 percent of the tribe could be clinically diagnosed as alcoholics. ''Every single household here is touched by alcohol or drugs,'' he said. ''Crack and heroin are new forms of alcohol.'' 
 Mr. Smith has founded the Substance Abuse Motivation Project. (The acronym, SAMP, is also a cornmeal porridge that was a staple of the Shinnecocks' traditional diet.) Its goal is to create a substance-free environment for the 600 residents on the reservation and for the hundreds of other Shinnecocks who live elsewhere but regularly come to visit. The focus of its efforts will be on alcohol abuse, but also addressed will be such health issues as diabetes, hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular disease.
 Mr. Smith's plan was endorsed by Randy King, a member of the Shinnecock tribal council. ''Absolutely, having SAMP up and running is an advantage,'' he said. ''Hopefully, it will affect many people's lives in a positive way.''
 Higher-than-average rates of hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis C and alcohol and substance abuse are not unique to the Shinnecocks. According to information provided by American Indian and Minority Health, an advocacy group, among the two million Native Americans in the United States the death rate from diabetes is 249 percent greater than the national average and from alcohol-related illnesses or accidents it is 627 percent greater.
 The federal Department of Health and Human Services says 12.6 percent of Indians use illegal drugs, nearly double the rate among whites. 
 Mr. Smith cannot save Native Americans on a national scale. He can, however, have an impact on the residents of the reservation, some of whom receive help from no other source. A $5,000 grant for Mr. Smith's program has been secured by the local state assemblyman, Fred W. Thiele Jr., and a proposal for federal funds is being reviewed by the local congressman, Tim Bishop. Other funds will come from SAMP-sponsored events and, Mr. Smith hopes, individual donors on and off the reservation.
 Like many Indian tribes, the Shinnecocks are guarded in their contacts with the ''outside,'' and no group is eager to air its dirty laundry. But Mr. King wasn't concerned by the publicity Mr. Smith is seeking for SAMP. ''Every community has its ills,'' Mr. King said. 
 The Shinnecocks are in a court battle with state and local authorities over a proposal to build a casino on a parcel of tribal land in Hampton Bays, west of the reservation. Casinos have been bonanzas for scores of other tribes across the country, and presumably could bankroll Mr. Smith's project. But he said a casino is as much a threat as an opportunity. 
 ''All this talk about building a casino here has made me realize we might very well have a deadline confronting us,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I'm concerned we don't have in place an infrastructure to deal with the changes we will experience, especially if there is a sudden, large influx of dollars. If we don't take care of ourselves now and prepare for that possible upheaval, we're courting disaster.'' 
 Mr. Smith is one of four children born to Elmer Smith, the longtime superintendent of the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club a mile north of the reservation. His brothers continued in the golf industry. Michael went in a different direction. After graduating from Southampton High School in 1967, he earned a bachelor's degree from SUNY-Old Westbury and then a master's in divinity from Princeton. He worked with Native American congregations in Arizona and New Mexico. Along the way, he became an alcoholic.
 Recovery led him back home. He said that in 1985 he returned to the Shinnecock reservation, quit drinking and became pastor of its church.
 One of SAMP's first projects is converting a building where Mr. Smith and his family live now into transitional housing for up to 10 people who have returned to the reservation after undergoing alcohol rehab.
 ''We have to provide a safe and sober place because, quite frankly, this is a tough community to stay sober in,'' he said. ''We will surround them and love them to death until they are capable of loving themselves.'' Mr. Smith was an alcohol and drug counselor at the Seafield Center in Westhampton for 11 years. 
 He also wants to open a health clinic on the reservation that would not only treat illnesses but dispense information on the prevention of diabetes and other ailments, even though Southampton Hospital is less than three miles down the road.
 ''We want to help from the womb to the tomb,'' Mr. Smith said, with some emphasis on children. ''Nothing works better than prevention,'' he said. ''To accomplish that, we need a more constructive environment. The schools do what they can, which is a lot more than a generation ago, but still, a kid comes home and his father is drunk or his older brother is using drugs, that child begins to lose hope.''
 Hugh Wyatt, a Sag Harbor resident and magazine publisher, is a member of SAMP's board. ''Just think how this reservation would be improved both financially and psychologically if there was a strong majority of people here working and earning,'' he said. ''The Shinnecock Reservation is not in a sparsely populated corner of South Dakota or New Mexico but is in the middle of the Hamptons. Employers are begging for workers. But you can't hold a job if you're drunk or sick.
 ''But economic independence is only one part of it,'' Mr. Wyatt added. ''There doesn't have to be the suffering that goes on within families. Alcohol and substance abuse can be treated, and even better, can be prevented. We can help people with heart disease and diabetes. Through SAMP, we can reduce the risks.''

HEADLINE: Everything's Coming Up Kansas

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: WICHITA, Kan. 

 BODY:
ABOUT 18 months ago, government, economic and marketing officials from around the state of Kansas gathered in a series of meetings to address what a top tourism official called the ''volatile, emotionally charged subject'' of the state's national image.
 Their findings were exceptionally bland.
 ''The image of Kansas wasn't negative, it was blank,'' said Scott Allegrucci, the state's director of travel and tourism development, who had conducted some very polite focus groups. ''The biggest response to Kansas was no response. A lot of Kansans expect people to say Oz, or cowboys, or just being flat, but what it really boiled down to is that as far as image, we don't have one.'' 
 Well, that was then. For better or worse, Kansas has been claiming a much greater place in the national consciousness lately: through its association with conservative politics, documented in Thomas Frank's best-selling 2004 book ''What's the Matter With Kansas: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America,'' and through a bushel of headline-hogging news stories that came flying, twisterlike, out of the state over the last month. 
 One was the case of the B.T.K. killer, a chilling serial-murder mystery that reached its movie-of-the-week denouement in late February with the arrest of a part-time dogcatcher and Wichita suburbanite named Dennis L. Rader, who the police say has confessed to murdering 10 people over nearly three decades. 
 Just days before, however, the state attorney general, Phill Kline, made his own headlines when he announced that he would try to force abortion clinics throughout Kansas to turn over private medical records documenting any abortions performed on minors. Like the B.T.K. saga, news of Mr. Kline's efforts rocketed from local papers to cable news and front pages around the world.
 Then, while those two developments were still percolating, Steve Fossett landed a glider-like aircraft called the Global Flyer (sponsored by the attention-hungry billionaire Richard Branson) in Salina, Kan., and became the first pilot to circumnavigate the globe solo in a single nonstop flight. At the celebration afterward, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius tapped into the rising Kansas-as-the-center-of-the-universe spirit
 by saying that the world begins and ends in Kansas, a notion that probably alarmed geographers and biblical scholars alike. 
 All of which has left some native Kansans with the feeling that, well, they aren't in Kansas any more. 
 ''This time of year, the biggest news would probably be that tornado season is coming and, oh God, did the civil defense sirens get updated?'' said Ron Shively, a comic who performs as Mr. Biggs. ''But right now, people are really excited. They're like, 'Ooh, we made the big time; we made the national news.'''
 Of course, not all news is good news, as even Mr. Allegrucci, the tourism chief, concedes. ''It's tough to spin B.T.K.,'' he said, before trying anyway: ''At least they got their man.'' (Or so they say; Mr. Rader has yet to be convicted of anything.) 
 And while it has probably been good for circulation and ratings, the suddenly torrid news cycle here has left many local news people as beat as a cow patty after a rainstorm. 
 ''We keep getting calls from people around the country, saying 'What's going on out there?''' said Sherry Chisenhall, the editor of The Wichita Eagle, which broke the B.T.K. news a few days after Boeing announced a huge round of layoffs at the local plant. (Which somehow didn't make it past the CNN crawl.) So thinly stretched was The Eagle's staff, Ms. Chisenhall said, that when Mr. Fossett landed, the only person available to cover the event was the paper's food reporter. 
 For all the excitement, Mr. Frank, who grew up in an affluent suburb of Kansas City, Kan., says that what has traditionally made Kansas exceptional is its amazing ability to be unexceptional. 
 ''There is something in the state that creates real geniuses of averageness,'' said Mr. Frank, citing impressive but plain leaders like Dwight Eisenhower and Bob Dole. ''But it's also this weird kind of averageness,'' he added. ''It's definitely the place where test-marketers go, but it's not a normal kind of averageness; it's almost an outraged 'averageness,' an exceptionally determined will to be 'average.'''
 It's a trait, Mr. Frank said, that winds up undermining any argument that Kansas is an accurate barometer of the country as a whole, because the stereotypical ''average'' that Kansans pursue is likely to be a good distance to the right of the national average. ''It's a myth of the red staters,'' Mr. Frank said, adding that many Kansans have ''a visceral dislike'' of liberal politics. 
 Some of that, mind you, might just be a reaction to the nasty little remarks that outsiders sometimes direct at the Sunflower State -- even fictional ones like the James Bond movie villain Blofeld, who, learning that his orbiting death ray was currently over Kansas, said, ''Well, if we blow up Kansas, the world may not hear of it for years.'' 
 One coming Hollywood biography may not help. ''Capote'' is set in the time of the state's most infamous murder case, the slaughter of a family in Holcomb in 1959, which was the subject of Truman Capote's classic study, ''In Cold Blood.''
 It won't be the last Kansas murder movie. Film treatments for the B.T.K. case, with its elaborate cat-and-mouse game between the police and the killer, are surely making the Hollywood rounds already. And Mr. Rader's trial, with all its televised trimmings, is scheduled to begin later this year. 
 Until then, though, many Kansans say they'll be quite content to stay out of the public eye for a while, thank you very much.
 ''Between the killer and the abortion case, it's like we're Sin City down here,'' said Jane Luellen, a former history teacher and lifelong Wichitan. ''But it's just because it's all coming to light at the same time. Everything that happens here happens everywhere else.''

HEADLINE: In Niagara Falls, The City's Fortunes Finally Begin to Rise

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH this city is famous as the honeymoon capital of the nation, its fortunes, in reality, were long tied not to kissing couples but to chugging smokestacks. When manufacturing moved to other regions, it suffered the all-too-familiar Rust Belt fate of a nearly deserted downtown, shuttered factories and rows of neglected and abandoned houses.
 These days, houses in the city are so inexpensive that the median price is in the $60,000 range, and in the surrounding areas mansions sell for a fraction of what they would bring in the New York City suburbs. 
 For years residents have enviously looked across the river to its Canadian sister city, which has been booming, mostly with tourist business. But now, for the first time in several decades, the fortunes on the United States side have begun to rise. Whether this will finally inaugurate the blossoming of the city's tourist potential remains to be seen. But things look more promising than they have in a long time. Starting with the opening two years ago of a casino downtown, the city is seeing some development, including hotels, offices, loft apartments, and a growing bar and restaurant scene. 
 The Seneca Gaming Corporation, owned by the Seneca Nation, just finished the girders for a new $200 million, 26-floor, 600-room hotel that is scheduled to open in December and will be the tallest building in upstate New York. It is attached to the Seneca Niagara Casino, which was opened two years ago by the gambling corporation and in its second year earned $350 million. 
 Over the next six years the tribe plans to build two more hotels in the same complex, one with 800 rooms and another with 450. The casino and hotels are the largest construction projects in Niagara Falls since the Niagara Power Project in the late 1950's, which employed nearly 12,000 people.
 The gambling corporation also paid $4 million for the Carborundum Building, a five-story office building opposite the casino, for its headquarters. The Carborundum Company, which made abrasives, was once one of the city's largest manufacturers.
 All of these projects are on 26 acres that the Senecas bought in a mostly empty downtown. Because the land is considered part of the reservation, the tribe pays no property taxes on the casino or the new hotel. But the city does get a share of the profit from slot machines, which last year amounted to $9 million and will total $11 million this year, about 10 percent of the city's budget. 
 The casino has sparked nontribal activity in its vicinity, which, when the wind is right, is close enough to hear the roar of the falls, and feel the mist. 
 On April 1, Niagara Falls Redevelopment, a company whose general partner is the New York developer Howard Milstein, will break ground on a $12 million, 25,000-square-foot building. Roger Trevino, an executive vice president of the company, said it would be used for ''hospitality and entertainment,'' but he declined to be more specific. The company also bought the nearby Nabisco Shredded Wheat factory for $3.2 million, for a use it has not specified, and just finished a $1 million refurbishing of Niagara Splash, a water amusement park closed since 1991. It will reopen this year. 
 Several new bars have opened two blocks north of the casino along Third Street to cater to some of the 3,200 casino workers and patrons. At night, the city has an unfamiliar bustling feeling as card dealers, pit bosses and others come to drink. Using a portion of the gambling income, the city has begun a $3.7 million renovation of the street to add old-style lighting, wider sidewalks, trees and outdoor seating. The city is about to announce the awarding of a contract to build a $38 million development with a courthouse, police and fire headquarters, along with residential and retail components at an unnamed site. 
 Near the casino, the United Office Building, once the city's tallest building, is being converted into offices on the first six floors, and on the top 14, loft residences with expansive views. The building, a 71,000-square-foot Art Deco office building that opened the day after the stock market crashed in 1929, has been empty for years. ''You can see Niagara Falls, the rapids or the Niagara Gorge from the apartments,'' said Carl Paladino, owner of the Ellicott Development Company, the Buffalo firm that owns the structure. The $6 million renovation is scheduled to begin on April 1, he said. 
 Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which created the USA Niagara Development Corporation and is similar to the Times Square Redevelopment Corporation in New York City, sees a critical mass finally building in Niagara Falls after decades of collapsed deals. ''It's very different this time,'' Mr. Gargano said. ''We are not going to let absentee landlords sit on vacant properties and wait for a windfall. We are using our powers of eminent domain.'' 
 But while the casino has sparked some projects on the south end of the city, it may have hurt the economy in other places. Others who run hotels say that because the tribal-owned hotel pays no property, bed or sales taxes and is exempt from the New York State smoking ban, it has an unfair advantage and will take business away from them. 
 ''It has affected us negatively so far,'' said Dominic Colucci, president of the Como, an Italian restaurant several miles from the casino, where business is off about 15 percent since the casino opened. ''But it's early in the game,'' he said. ''We hope the casino will stimulate development that will make the tourists come back.''
 G. Michael Brown, president and chief executive of Seneca Gaming, says the problems are minor and the city is far better off with the casino. ''We've created an economic engine that brings in 15,000 to 20,000 people a day on the weekend and 10,000 to 15,000 on weekdays,'' he said. ''It created 3,000 jobs that did not exist before.''
 Officials of the gambling company expect to have a total of 5,500 workers in the next 14 to 16 months, and they believe that those workers will create a much stronger market for residential properties along Niagara Street, a depressed neighborhood behind the casino. 
 ''Niagara Falls is coming back,'' Mayor Vince Anello said. ''We have great potential. You can sense the energy.'' Right now, he said, ''Niagara Falls is a bargain.''

HEADLINE: Dust To Dust, With Trinkets

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

DATELINE: Princeton 

 BODY:
FOR some, belief in an afterlife is nothing more than a mental crutch we use to cope with the finality of death, or the anguish at the loss of a loved one. Maybe, but for thousands of years humans have built and filled tombs with all kinds of trinkets and provisions to provide for their occupants in the next world. Think of the regal splendor of Tutankhamen's tomb in Upper Egypt, or the richly appointed burial chambers of the Moche and Inca Indians in Peru.
 The ancient Chinese also believed in the afterlife, burying their loved ones with valuables, everyday objects, and even clay or bronze replicas of practical items and possessions like horse-drawn chariots, domestic animals and cooking and farming equipment. Entire armies of terracotta warriors have also been found at royal burial sites in central China. Historians generally refer to these funerary objects as mingqi, or ''brilliant artifacts.'' 
 ''Brilliant artifacts'' are the subject of two linked, complementary exhibitions, one at the Princeton University Art Museum here, and another at the China Institute Gallery in Manhattan. Both exhibitions are spearheaded by Cary Y. Liu, curator of Asian art at the Princeton museum, with the help of other Chinese art scholars, and focus on objects dating to the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220).
 The Han Dynasty is regarded by many historians as a defining period in early Chinese history. It was a time of relative peace, unity and prosperity, during which China's territories expanded, new trade routes (like the Silk Road) were opened up, while growing technological and scientific sophistication led to the invention and use of paper, water clocks and various astronomical instruments. Art, poetry, literature and philosophy also flourished.
 The Princeton exhibition, the larger of the two, centers on a single site, an important Han tomb complex known as the Wu Family Shrines, traditionally dated to the mid-second century A.D. Inscriptions and pictorial carvings covering the interior roof and stone walls of these tombs have yielded a wealth of information concerning the cultural, political and economic life of the era, and provide the accepted foundation for the study of Han art and culture.
 The exhibition and accompanying 600-page catalog have been prompted by the recent discovery at the site of new archeological materials, and related evidence that some of the inscriptions and pictures may have been added or recut over intervening centuries. Evidence of recutting centers on a series of paper rubbings of the tomb walls, steles and gates, which seem to differ in crucial aspects from designs on the stones. The curators, working on the project five years, seek to explain the discrepancies.
 Viewers interested in the labyrinthine mysteries of Chinese art history might like to read the weighty catalog, or attend a free, two-day symposium on Han culture, art and architecture at the museum in April. (The China Institute exhibition has its own symposium, too.) For more time-conscious viewers, however, the exhibition presents an unparalleled chance to learn about the importance of the Wu Family Shrines and contemplate their artistic beauty courtesy of the museum's set of 19th-century ink on paper rubbings of the pictorial carvings and inscriptions. 
 The rubbings have been installed on walls in two rooms, as if to mimic their architectural position. The museum has also assembled about 70 Han-era tomb objects from all over China, and similar to those that scholars believe were originally in the Wu Shrines, which were already looted before excavation in 1980 and 1981. Many of these objects are also depicted in the carvings.
 The objects in the China Institute Gallery exhibition are no less remarkable. All the exhibits are from Shandong Province in northeastern China, where the Wu Family Shrines are located, and many are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. Among them are gilded ornaments, a lovely jade mask, ceramic sculptures and various objects designed to provide for a laid-back afterlife. 
 It is hard to discriminate worth here, but some of the more unusual objects are a dark green glaze clay model of a chef and cooking stove, from the collection of the Shandong Provincial Museum. The stove, evidently, would have been used by the chef to prepare all kinds of delicious meals for the occupant of the tomb in the afterlife. Nearby is a green-glazed rooster, ready, no doubt, for the pot.

HEADLINE: Keeping Prices to Europe Low in High Season

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
AIRLINES have been offering rock-bottom fares for travel to Europe this winter, with prices dropping below $300 for flights to destinations like Paris, London or Rome. But, of course, more people choose to travel to Europe when it's warm enough to sit at an outdoor cafe or stroll through a piazza enjoying a cone of gelato.
 And when the mercury rises, so do air fares. 
 In late February, you could still buy a round-trip ticket from New York to London for travel in March or April for just under $400, or a ticket from Boston to Paris for about $50 more. But change to June, July or August and the lowest fares on those routes increase to $700 to $800; more, if you're picky about your airline or dates. 
 So if you're determined to cross the Atlantic this summer, it may take some strategic searching to snare some of the lower fares in the peak season price range. The good news? If you're willing to splurge on business class, some of those advance-purchase fares are (relatively) a bargain.
 Travel sellers say people started making their summer travel plans early this year, so many of the least expensive seats have already sold out. ''The cheaper fares are pretty much gone at this point or they will be soon,'' said Kathie Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for CheapTickets.com, a Web site where the cheapest flight from New York to Milan leaving June 18 and returning June 25 was $874 in late February (on Delta). For that same Delta itinerary, Travelocity, Expedia and Kayak.com all displayed roughly the same price.
 Neil Martin, a consultant who does research for the European Travel Commission (visiteurope.com), said that's about what travelers can expect to pay in June, July and August. ''As long as you can find an $800 fare sometime in the summer, we think that could be considered an attractive fare,'' Mr. Martin said. 
 You may be able to save a bit by flying in the midweek, usually cheaper than flying on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday. And there's generally more competition on flights to London, Amsterdam and Dublin, Mr. Martin said, so you may find better fares on those routes. (For travel on June 18 to 25, flights from New York to London on Aer Lingus were about $750, and Travelocity offered a special fare on Virgin Atlantic for $695.)
 Since Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, dropped its prices last fall, it has gained a reputation as the low-fare trans-Atlantic carrier, so its fares are worth checking if you're flying to Dublin or London or are willing to continue to your destination with a discount carrier flying within Europe.
 As for waiting for a last-minute sale, that could be a risky strategy this year, since demand has risen and the airlines have fewer empty seats to discount at the 11th hour. ''There's always going to be some last-minute inventory, but in order to make that work for their vacations, people need to be flexible,'' said Kari Swartz, a spokeswoman for Expedia. ''So it's a gamble.''
 Another option is to buy your ticket from a consolidator, a travel seller that negotiates contracts with the airlines to sell tickets below the lowest published price. (Many travel agencies also sell consolidator fares.) Although prices for consolidator tickets aren't always the lowest available, and the tickets have some drawbacks like higher change fees, and they don't always qualify for frequent-flier miles, they're worth investigating if the published fares you're finding elsewhere are high.
 Some consolidators advertise in newspapers and travel publications, but Chad Hartline, a manager with AirlineConsolidator.com in Chattanooga, Tenn., said most of its customers found the company through Internet searches. In late February, the agency's price for a ticket from New York to London from June 18 to 25 was $769, on British Airways, illustrating that even with consolidator tickets, the early bird gets the bargain. ''We get x number of seats at a certain price,'' Mr. Hartline said. ''Once those are gone, they're gone and then we have to go up to the next highest price.''
 If you're planning to stay in one city, buying a package may also save you money. For instance, CheapTickets.com has a seven-night package for travel from New York to Paris for $1,282 including Air France flights and accommodations at the Holiday Inn. Prices for similar packages to Rome, London, Amsterdam or Frankfurt are about $1,125 to $1,400 -- though with packages, prices may creep up if you're not flexible about dates or you choose a different hotel.
 Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity and most airlines offer packages these days. 
 You may also find it worth paying extra for business class, since the cost of a bigger, reclining seat has become more affordable if you plan ahead. With a 50-day advance purchase, the lowest round-trip business class fares across the Atlantic are $1,500 to $2,000, said Michael Bennett, publisher of FirstClassFlyer.com, which tracks prices and amenities at the front of the plane. 
 American and Continental have some of the best deals to Europe, Mr. Bennett said. (In late February, Continental had a round-trip flight from Newark to Paris for travel in late July for $1,637.) So buying a business class ticket is often a smarter option than buying in economy and trying to upgrade with frequent flier miles, Mr. Bennett said, since many carriers don't let passengers use miles to upgrade from the lowest fares, or charge a fee of $250 to $350 each way, in addition to the miles.
 But once again, the theme of the season is act fast. ''More people are catching on to these fares,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''So availability will increasingly be a challenge.''

HEADLINE: Here Comes the Mother-to-Be

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
FOR her wedding last year before 100 guests at the historic Mission Inn in Riverside, Calif., Neomi Padilla, 32, wore a sexy spaghetti-strap dress from L'ezu Atelier in Newport Beach and four-inch heels. 
 Then she held on for dear life.
 At the altar, she was unable to kneel comfortably. ''My husband held me because I thought I'd fall,'' she said. Making her way down a staircase to the reception things got more precarious. Being seven months pregnant, she couldn't see her feet. 
 Only a few years ago, women planning simultaneously for a wedding and a due date would beg designers and bridal stores for dresses that would camouflage their growing bellies and -- if they told anyone at all -- would insist on silence. These days, however, brides are not only not hiding their pregnancies, but they are showing them off, celebrating the upcoming birth in vows and toasts, wearing gowns that flatter their bump, and, in short, refusing to give up any elements of a traditional wedding just because there is a baby visibly on the way. 
 Some bridal gown manufacturers are rushing out maternity designs and officiants are blessing more and more unborn children. 
 ''It is a growing trend,'' said the Rev. Christopher Tuttle, a nondenominational minister who presides over the National Association of Wedding Officiants -- with about 200 members. ''It's all become, 'Hey, look at me. I'm pregnant!'''
 The Rev. Scott Carpenter, a Unity pastor who presides over another national group of officiants, the National Association of Wedding Ministers, said that eight years ago he never had a bride openly announce her pregnancy, but now those brides account for about 20 percent of the weddings he performs. 
 At a time when pregnancies are obsessively chronicled and celebrated in celebrity and fashion magazines, it is perhaps not surprising that they are being showcased even as women walk down the aisle. But there are larger cultural factors at work as well: women are getting married older, and many are living with their husbands-to-be for years before exchanging vows. 
 ''They're older, they're more confident,'' said Carley Roney, editor in chief of The Knot (www.theknot.com), a Web site devoted to wedding planning information. ''Oftentimes couples are paying for the wedding, so they don't worry about what people think.''
 Mrs. Padilla, who runs a family food business in the Los Angeles area and is now the mother of 8-month-old Sophia, said her attitude was, ''Why can't I have it all?''' She said she became pregnant after plans for a big wedding were under way, and she decided to stick to them. 
 ''I'm 32, my husband is 34,'' she said. ''We wanted a family, so we weren't embarrassed.'' 
 The timing of baby and wedding is not always coincidental. Even though increasing numbers of heterosexual couples live together without marrying, Americans still lean toward marriage once a baby comes because people think it will provide greater security for the child. 
 But if pregnancies have often led to marriage, they have not always paved the way for full-blown weddings if the bride was far along. 
 With today's pregnant brides, Ms. Roney said, ''It's the flaunting of it where things are taking a turn. We're talking about seven months pregnant.''
 Or eight. Laura Taylor, 21, of Terre Haute, Ind., said her only concern about her Feb. 12 wedding was that she was cutting it so close to her March due date that she feared she might have the baby before the husband.
 Ms. Taylor, who until recently worked as a cashier in a tanning salon, said she had been engaged for more than three years and, upon learning she was pregnant, debated for a week and a half whether to have a big wedding. She decided on ''this huge blowout,'' including a Baptist church ceremony and a reception for 125 guests.
 ''I just decided, what the heck,'' she said. ''I do things out of order anyway.'' ''I thought about an ivory dress and my mom was, no, you're getting white. It's 2005.''
 Those who shared the limelight with their unborn babies on their big day say the pregnancy made an emotional occasion even more intense. Jane E. Smith, 38, a director of training and development with InterContinental Hotels and Resorts in San Francisco, said even her guests cried at her wedding last November outside Palms Springs when the minister mentioned her yet-to-be-born son, Miller Michael (who was born Feb. 12). 
 ''It was so unique and so special,'' said one teary-eyed guest, Jeff Rogers, 38, an information specialist with Nike in Portland, Ore. ''I just sort of went, 'Oh, my gosh, there's so much more going on here than just two people getting married.'''
 But being pregnant for your wedding is not necessarily the easiest way to go, what with swollen feet, queasy stomachs and multiple dress fittings. Some brides wear fabulous gowns with white sneakers or slippers because they would be too unsteady on heels. Many avoid evening weddings so they do not tire out.
 The brides toast with apple juice and switch or postpone honeymoons because they cannot scuba dive or sit on a beach drinking pina coladas. They also don't want to be too far away from their doctors. 
 Trying to finding the dress, of course, can be a nightmare. 
 ''The most stressful thing I've ever gone through,'' Ms. Taylor said.
 She first went to the store where she had gotten her prom dresses and, she said: ''They told me there was no way they could put me in a dress. I felt they didn't want to help me.'' 
 At a second shop, ''the dresses looked terrible; they were five sizes bigger than what I wear.''
 Ms. Taylor said she finally found a satin dress with lace overlay that she loved from TeKay Designs (www.tk-designs.com), an online clothing retailer based in Houston that specializes in maternity wedding dresses in the $150 to $800 range.
 The company started out in 1998 selling wedding, bridesmaid and prom dresses, but in recent years maternity wedding gowns have sold so briskly that they have become TeKay Designs' specialty, accounting for 60 percent of all sales, or about 300 dresses a year, said Joseph Okyere, director of operations. He said the demand is largely because of the company's wide maternity bridal selection -- more than 100 designs -- and its relatively low prices.
 ''In 2000, we started getting calls from pregnant women saying, 'I saw this dress on your Web site, can you custom make it to fit a pregnant woman?''' he said, adding that now the company has ''orders coming from all over the world.''
 Ronald Rothstein, principal owner of Kleinfeld Bridal, the large bridal salon in Brooklyn that sells up to 8,000 wedding dresses a year in the $2,000 to $4,000 range, estimates that 6 to 7 brides out of every 100 who come to his salon are pregnant and will show when they marry.
 ''It used to be that the bride would call us in advance and say they wanted to talk to us privately,'' he said. ''Nowadays, the bride comes in and says, 'I'm pregnant. What am I going to look good in?' It's just an extra level of excitement.''
 While pregnant brides say they have found overwhelming support from bridegrooms, parents, friends, officiants and wedding industry vendors, some said social acceptance is not universal.
 Joy Lynn Leech, 31, who was seven months pregnant at her wedding last August, said most people were ''extremely supportive'' but among her 200 guests she noticed some people conspicuously ''quiet about the whole thing.''
 And when she called her Roman Catholic Church she was told that one priest would not marry her but another ''would most likely not have a problem.''
 Mrs. Leech, a volunteer firefighter who owns a pony ride business in New Jersey, got her church wedding -- along with a beaded, double-silk organza gown by Jane Wilson-Marquis, a New York designer; horse-drawn carriages; and a big party at Nanina's in the Park in Belleville, N.J. -- but she said she was ''slightly disappointed'' that the baby was not mentioned in the ceremony. She said she did not push it for fear that the accommodating priest would balk at marrying her altogether ''because Catholics are so strict.''
 Christian conservative groups that promote abstinence before marriage, like the Family Research Council and the Christian Defense Coalition in Washington, said that they found it positive that these pregnant brides were getting married, yet they objected to the message they may be sending.
 ''On one level it is sending the message that sexual activity before marriage doesn't have the kind of harmful emotional, social and economic consequences that can happen,'' said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, a Presbyterian minister who heads the Christian Defense Coalition.
 Carmela Pampillonia, a restaurant manager in Staten Island who was five months pregnant at her wedding Feb. 13, found her Catholic parish ''very accepting'' but waited three months for her priest to submit her request for review by his archdiocese. ''I couldn't plan anything until they accepted me,'' she said.
 But for brides like Ms. Pampillonia, however, etiquette was not on top of the priority list. ''Marriage is supposed to be a symbol of love and unity, and a child brings you more love and unity,'' she explained. ''I showed that belly off all night long and I felt great.''

HEADLINE: If Federal Transit Bill Is a Smorgasbord, the City Is in Line

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The federal transportation bill passed by the House of Representatives last week included more than $230 million for an assortment of New York City projects, including a parking garage in Harlem, a waterfront trail in Brooklyn and street repairs in Queens.
 At least 70 city projects were inserted into the six-year, $284 billion bill, which would still have to be approved by the Senate and President Bush to become law. The smorgasbord of improvements approved by the House shows the range of transportation needs -- both real and perceived -- throughout New York City.
 The number of projects financed by specific dollar amounts for bridges, roads and related transit projects -- as opposed to large-scale general allocations -- has exploded since the last two times the federal transportation program was reauthorized, in 1991 and 1998. The bill passed last week included more than 4,000 individual projects, at a cost of more than $12 billion. 
 Earmarking, as the process is known, is driven by lawmakers, often without consulting the engineers, architects and planners who typically dominate transportation projects. 
 ''It is completely a creature of the legislative process and has grown exponentially over a number of years,'' said Mortimer L. Downey, who was executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and then the deputy secretary of transportation under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Downey described the process as unwieldy, even irrational.
 ''I remember bills in the 70's that were thought to be heavy when they had six earmarks in them,'' he said. ''The practice has developed that every member of Congress has some opportunity to put in a project. Some of them aren't even transportation projects.'' 
 The New York City projects do seem to bear some relation to transportation. And most were developed with advice from the city, but some primarily involve private groups, including: 
 $6.25 million for the Doe Fund, a nonprofit group, to pay homeless people to remove graffiti along Kings Highway in Brooklyn and elsewhere. 
 $500,000 to rebuild streets, sidewalks and curbs around the newly expanded Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.
 $150,000 to provide transportation for elderly or disabled people at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in the Bronx. 
 In some cases, lawmakers inserted projects that do not have a government agency willing to build or operate them. Such projects may never come to fruition.
 The most expensive New York City project to receive specific financing last week was $15 million for the purchase of three ferries to provide service between the Rockaway Peninsula and Lower Manhattan.
 ''This has been a near-obsession for me,'' the project's sponsor, Representative Anthony D. Weiner, said in an interview, adding that a ferry system could reduce by half the commuting time for thousands of Queens residents.
 Mr. Weiner said he would like the transportation authority to buy and operate the ferries. But the authority, a state entity, does not operate any ferries and has no plans to start.
 The congressman, who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens, said he hoped the authority would change its mind. ''I've spoken to the M.T.A. about putting fare boxes on these babies and making it part of the integrated transit service in the city,'' he said.
 Similarly, Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Democrat, designated $3 million to upgrade Metro-North Railroad stations in the Bronx and plan for a new rail station at Yankee Stadium, while Representative Vito J. Fossella, a Republican, designated $2 million to rehabilitate the 86th Street subway station in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The transportation authority does not consider either project to be pressing. 
 Christopher P. Boylan, the authority's top lobbyist, declined to criticize any specific project and emphasized that he appreciated the help of New York's representatives. But he added that they do not always consult with experts before setting aside money for pet initiatives. 
 ''We will look at every earmark to see if there's a way we can work with it,'' Mr. Boylan said. ''There may be some that just don't fit. People come to us with projects all the time, thinking they are the most important projects.'' 
 Mr. Boylan is no stranger to asking for government help; the authority wants $10 billion from Albany and Washington to build the first segment of the Second Avenue subway and a link between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal.
 The federal contribution to those projects involves a rigorous assessment of their effectiveness and environmental impact, and can entail hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. By contrast, the individual House projects for New York City range from $150,000 to $15 million, and do not require the same sort of scrutiny. 
 City officials said the earmarking this time was far more rational than in 1991 or 1998. In 2003, shortly before the expiration of the 1998 transportation act, officials began meeting to coordinate and prioritize their requests. 
 ''In the past, the members would put in projects not having discussed them with the city, projects that were not our priority, projects that made no sense,'' said the city's transportation commissioner, Iris Weinshall, whose department oversaw the effort.
 ''This time,'' she said, ''we visited every member of the delegation and went over our priorities, their priorities, and tried to figure out how to mesh what they wanted to do with what we wanted to do.'' 
 In the end, at least 42 of the 70 or so projects were developed with guidance from the city's transportation, parks, planning or economic development agencies.
 Ms. Weinshall said she was particularly pleased by the designation of $14 million for improvements to the 125th Street commercial corridor in Harlem, $5.5 million to improve pedestrian safety in Times Square and $4.6 million to reduce traffic hazards around 135 schools throughout the city.
 The projects are only a tiny fraction of the spending that maintains and builds the local road, bridge and transit network. To planners, it remains one of the odder aspects of transportation policy.
 ''The earmarking process is not very rigorous,'' said Gerry Bogacz, the planning director at the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, a government-sponsored body that tries to predict the region's transportation needs over the next several decades. ''You're just putting a number down and a brief description of what it's for. You're going through the process backwards, effectively -- starting with the project and then going through all the different steps.''

Gone Tomorrow
 Globalization may be changing the destinies of nations, but does that mean it's here to stay? Not necessarily, writes Niall Ferguson in Foreign Affairs. In fact, it could disappear tomorrow.
 From around 1870 until World War I, the world economy thrived in ways that look familiar today. The mobility of commodities, capital and labor reached record levels. People spoke euphorically of ''the annihilation of distance.''
 Then, between 1914 and 1918, a horrendous war stopped all of this, sinking globalization. Moreover, the attempt to resuscitate the world economy after the war's end failed. The global economy effectively disintegrated with the onset of the Great Depression and, after that, with an even bigger world war.
 There are obvious economic parallels between the first age of globalization and the current one. The difficult thing -- indeed the nearly impossible thing -- is to predict a cataclysm. 
 We all know that another, bigger Sept. 11 is quite likely; it is, indeed, bin Laden's stated objective. We all know -- or should know -- that a crisis over Taiwan would send huge shockwaves through the international system; it could even lead to a great-power war. 
 We all know that revolutionary regime change in Saudi Arabia would shake the world even more than the 1917 Bolshevik coup in Russia. We all know that the detonation of a nuclear device in London would dwarf the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand as an act of terrorism. 
 But what exactly can we do about such contingencies if we cannot say even approximately when they might occur? Like the passengers who boarded the Lusitania 90 years ago, all we know is that we may conceivably sink.
 Still we sail.

Emily Goes Online
 Daniel Terdiman, covering the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco for Wired Online (www.wiredonline.com), attended a panel of game designers who had been assigned to come up with ideas for an online game about Emily Dickinson. The panelists included Will Wright, the creator of the Sims series. Excerpts from Wired Online follow.
 ''If she were alive today, she'd be an Internet addict,'' Wright deadpanned, ''and she'd probably have a really amazing blog.'' 
 At first, he said, he'd thought he would mix Dickinson's poetry into a Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas environment. Then came the idea to put the player in the role of Dickinson's therapist. 
 ''As you interact with her, you start with a cordial relationship,'' he said. ''She (either) becomes romantically obsessed with you, or goes into a suicidal depression, and at the end, she can delete herself .'' 
 Along the way, Wright explained, Dickinson would reside in the player's computerized world, popping up from time to time with an e-mail, instant message, text message or desktop appearance. As an example, he showed the crowd a potential text message from Dickinson: ''1t is b3tt3r t0 B th3 h4mm3r th4n th3 4nv1L'' (geek writing for ''it is better to be the hammer than the anvil''). 

Happy Now?
 Happiness. Just about everybody wants it, but what is it? Darrin M. McMahon, a professor of European history at Florida State University, writing in the Winter issue of The Wilson Quarterly, discovers that the closer one looks, the more difficult it is to answer that question.
 When Thomas Jefferson deemed the ''pursuit of happiness'' a ''self-evident'' truth, he was merely summarizing a good century of reflection on the subject in Europe and America. 
 But just how ''self-evident'' was the pursuit of happiness (to say nothing of its capture)? Was it, in fact, so obvious that happiness was our naturally intended end? To the followers of Jesus, God's grace was the indispensable criterion, just as a bit of luck was necessary in the reckoning of most ancients. 
 Yet the idea that human beings should be entitled not only to pursue happiness as they saw fit but to attain it was clearly in the air. When the French revolutionaries issued their Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, the preamble included a pledge to work for the ''happiness of everyone.'' 
 In England, Thomas Carlyle reflected on the novelty of the new ethic of happiness and the impossible hopes it raised, observing in ''Past and Present'' (1843) that nowadays, ''Even the pitifulest whipster that walks within a skin has had his head filled with the notion that he is, shall be, or by all human and divine laws ought to be, 'happy.'''

HEADLINE: A Walk on the Sunnyside Street

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HOW do you preserve the architecture of what was built as a social, not an architectural, utopia? Preservationists at the 1920's Sunnyside Gardens in Queens want landmark designation for their inventive and charming model housing. But the builders of Sunnyside produced a memorable experience rather than memorable buildings. 
 Sunnyside Gardens, on about 12 blocks, roughly bounded by 43rd and 49th Streets and Skillman and Barnett Avenues, with a part projecting farther south, went up in stages beginning in 1924, developed by the City Housing Corporation, headed by Alexander M. Bing, a New York real estate developer, with directors like Eleanor Roosevelt and Felix Adler, the leader of the Ethical Culture movement. 
 A team that included the architects Clarence Stein and Frederick Ackerman, the planner Henry Wright and the landscape architect Marjorie Cautley designed a unique urban vision of about 500 small houses and several apartment buildings, drawing inspiration from the Garden City movement in England. The City Planning Commission says there are a total these days of 1,202 living units. 
 The team's essential solution was to divide each long north-south block into three modules, separated by pedestrian walkways, with banks of attached houses dividing the long center of the block into three courtyards. The backs of the houses in each module had small yards but also shared a great common area with turf, plantings and playgrounds on what was usually just throwaway space. 
 Forty-year property covenants prohibited the redivision of the common space into the usual separate yards. The covenants also limited rear additions, required uniform paint colors and regulated the facades.
 The facades, however, are not much -- little reddish brick boxes, albeit with warm, variegated orange and red brick. That they do not emulate the vernacular Tudor and colonial of the typical speculative builder is refreshing, but their slightly staggered setbacks and occasional pitched roofs are the only aspects that set the Sunnyside Gardens house fronts apart from reductionist modernism. 
 The City Housing Corporation conceived of Sunnyside Gardens as economically integrated. On 47th Street, after the complex opened, a hospital porter lived next to a professor, who lived next to a construction foreman, who lived next to a lawyer, who lived next to a coffee-house waiter. 
 A noticeable percentage of the women who lived there worked. Among them was Sophia Mumford, who gave up the editorship of the influential literary periodical The Dial to serve as an assistant to her husband, Lewis Mumford, one of the most influential critics of his time. A vocal supporter of developments like Sunnyside Gardens, he wrote an architectural column in The New Yorker for decades. The Mumfords lived at 4002 44th Street, in a little off-street court, with houses facing one another across a planted rectangular plot at right angles to the road. 
 Another resident was the Australian-born Gordon Whyte, 43, a radio producer who lived at 3939 47th Street in one of the more typical attached houses, backing onto one of the large commons. 
 The houses were typically offered for purchase at monthly costs approaching rentals -- a 1925 ad offers a six-room house for $64.75 a month, ''only 15 minutes from Grand Central -- five-cent fare.'' The total price was $8,750, with an $875 down payment; the monthly payment covered all charges, except heat and repairs, ''amounting to even less than rent,'' the ad said. A limited number of two-family houses and co-op apartments were also available.
 It is unlikely that the early residents -- most of whom came from Manhattan -- were attracted by the architecture. More probably, they liked the quiet streets and, certainly, the ingenuity with which the usual warren of individual backyards had been converted to a coherent vista. This same vision had transformed elite enclaves in Manhattan like Sutton Place and Turtle Bay Gardens. 
 Bruce Bliven, writing in The New Republic, likened the Stein/Ackerman/Wright/Cautley creation to the common of a New England village. ''The A.I.A. Guide to New York City,'' by Norval White and Elliot Willensky (Crown, 2000) says it's a place where ''the architecture is unimportant, but the urban arrangements a source of urbane delight.''
 Sunnyside's buildings covered only 30 percent of their lots. But speculative builders responsible for most of the rest of Queens did not embrace its do-gooder vision. The experiment, although successful on its own, had little influence on private development. 
 Most of the easements expired in 1966, and a new generation of owners who did not partake of the original Sunnyside magic began taking back their pieces of the common gardens, paving their front yards for parking, making rear additions and altering their facades. The Mediterranean fortress in white stucco at 3935 47th Street is one example of such a vision. 
 In 1974, the City Planning Commission made the complex subject to special zoning that controlled many of these alterations, but pressure has been growing since then for landmark designation. 
 At first there was sizable opposition. But Herbert Reynolds, speaking for the Sunnyside Gardens Preservation Alliance, says he estimates that there is now about 70 percent support communitywide. Most of the others simply have questions, he says, adding that he has seen ''no coherent opposition'' at the meetings where the landmarks issues have been broached.
 Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, says he has also not encountered any coordinated opposition. ''We are evaluating Sunnyside Gardens, and I'm quite enthusiastic about it,'' Mr. Tierney said. ''My sense is there's substantial support for it.''
 Mr. Reynolds says the 1974 zoning law does not protect the facades and is inadequate in controlling illegal driveways and parking-pad installations.
 Still, a walk through Sunnyside Gardens is like a trip far away from the predictable grid of New York City. Avoid the vehicular streets, with their lines of parked cars, and instead slice through this unusual piece of Queens, crossing several blocks exclusively on the little pedestrian walks. 
 Try to find the little bronze plaque identifying Whittier Lane, the little walkway leading off the west side of 48th Street, a few hundred feet north of Skillman Avenue. Cutting through the backs of these blocks is so intimate it feels like trespassing. Some of the yards are individually fenced, but where the common gardens survive intact, it is like the surprise of a sudden forest clearing. 
 The lanes are also offset from block to block, avoiding the look of a continuous alley and creating a wonderful intimacy. There are some roof additions and some picture windows, but overall the plain, sturdy buildings of Sunnyside don't look endangered, unless you are particularly fussy about aluminum storm doors or the like. 
 One alteration frequently mentioned as the type of thing landmark regulation would not permit is an immaculately tasteful reconstruction of the little projecting vestibule of the old Gordon Whyte house. Done in painted wood of rich coloring and round-edged shingles, it suggests Victorian San Francisco -- which preceded Sunnyside Gardens stylistically by half a century. 
 Bruce Jensen, an artist, has lived there with his wife, Yoshie Odaka, since 1993 and did the alteration about three years ago. ''It was just an old plywood shell -- brick was out of our budget and we didn't want to do vinyl siding,'' he says. His wife, also an artist, designed it.
 ''When we did it, we always got compliments,'' he says, ''but when the landmarks folks started up, newspaper articles began pointing it out as incongruous.'' 
 He says he is not sure whether he supports landmark designation. ''We tried to do something nice here,'' he says, ''and we're getting attention for the wrong reasons. I find it frustrating that the philosophy is that the only way to arrive at something aesthetically pleasing is to keep it uniform.''

HEADLINE: To Win the Pool, Look the Other Way

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For most of the year, Bradley P. Carlin seems like a nice enough guy to have around. He lives in a suburb of Minneapolis with his wife and three sons, sings in several bands and spends his workday trying to keep people healthy.
 Come March, though, Carlin morphs into just about the last person you would want to have in your office. He is a University of Minnesota biostatistician who has published an academic article about how to win an N.C.A.A. basketball pool, and he is not shy about putting his ideas to work. 
 He won the pool at his wife's office three times in five years. He was then informed that the pool would no longer exist.
 ''It reminded me of when I was in a band and we wanted a new bass player,'' Carlin, 42, said. ''We told the bass player we were breaking up the band, and then we reformed it with a new name and a new bass player.''
 The part of Carlin's story that matters to the millions of people who will fill out brackets in the next four days is that his ideas are not a secret. Nor are the theories of a handful of other professors who have done serious research on what might be called poolology. 
 Poologic.com, a Web site that explains these ideas, claims to have helped people win $250,000 over the years. In return for the advice, the site asks only that winners give some of their bounty to the V Foundation for Cancer Research, named for Jim Valvano -- and that people realize they will still probably lose.
 Some pool players want to spend as little time as possible filling in their brackets. They may pick friends' alma maters or, like Diane Chambers on ''Cheers,'' the teams that play in places with the prettiest state flowers. Other entrants think they know so much about Kentucky's defensive scheme that they do not need help. Fair enough.
 But for anyone in between, there is a system that can help and that offers lessons about basketball along the way. It starts with knowing your competition. 
 Most pools award so many more points for the later rounds that you must pick the right champion to have a shot at winning. Choosing the team with the best chance of winning it all -- Illinois and North Carolina were the top-ranked teams entering this weekend -- sounds like the smart thing to do.
 The problem is that everybody thinks that way. If you choose a favorite, you leave yourself with long odds of winning a pool, because so many other people will make the same choice. 
 When Andrew Metrick, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, examined pools one year, he found that almost four of every five entrants chose one of the four teams seeded No. 1. But top-seeded teams have won only a little more than half of the titles since the men's tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. (A play-in game featuring a 65th team was added in 2001.) 
 ''I can tell you right now that Illinois and U.N.C. will be overbet,'' said Tom Adams, a systems analyst for the federal government who runs poologic.com. ''What you really have to do to get an advantage is to go for a contrarian champion.''
 Carlin has a handy way of making sense of this. Imagine that Illinois has a 30 percent chance of winning, roughly what statisticians say the team's odds are. If 30 people in a 100-person pool pick that team as champion, they essentially have to share that 30 percent. So each has a 1 percent chance of winning on average.
 Now say that Louisville has a 5 percent chance of winning the tournament, and only one person picks Louisville. That person's odds of victory become 5 percent, too.
 The best choices tend to be teams that are seeded Nos. 1, 2 or 3 but that are not among the two or three biggest tournament favorites and that are not local teams for your pool. Wake Forest and Michigan State seem to fit the part this season. 
 This seems like a good time to consider another question: Isn't all this illegal? Not really. Most states outlaw any game that requires money to enter, involves chance and offers a prize. 
 But because ESPN.com's online game, which drew 1.3 million fans last year, costs nothing to enter, it is legal. And the police say they are generally happy to ignore pools unless they are intended to make a profit for somebody. ''There is very little law enforcement can or will do about the friendly office pool,'' David Bayless, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, said. ''That's not much of a concern of ours.''
 The second big theorem of poolology comes from the way teams are seeded. The formula that the National Collegiate Athletic Association uses does not consider margin of victory. It treats a victory as a victory, just as the tournament does.
 But anybody who has studied past seasons -- in basketball or other sports -- knows that a team that has won a lot of squeakers typically does not have as bright a future as one that has blown out opponents. It is tempting to believe that teams that win many close games, as Arizona, Boston College and Gonzaga did this season, have the character to keep on doing it. Usually they do not. 
 On the other side, Florida and Louisville have won enough blowouts to be tempting choices to reach the final rounds. The seeding system can also give short shrift to schedule strength. The tough schedules of Texas and Georgia Tech suggest they may deserve more respect than they will receive, provided they get in. 
 These distinctions matter much more in pools that give a bonus for picking upsets, as the Sports Illustrated online game does. An 11th-seeded team that looks almost as good as its sixth-seeded opponent then becomes a smart first-round pick. These bonuses gave Carlin his winning margin in his old pool, he said.
 The simplest way to find these games in the opening round is to look at the Las Vegas point spreads. Using those betting lines may make you feel sketchy, but economists see them as packed with information, just like stock prices. The spreads are more accurate predictors of games than any computer rating -- in fact, than all the ratings combined, according to research by Ray C. Fair, a Yale economist, and John F. Oster. They studied college football, but the point almost certainly holds for basketball.
 There is one more lesson to keep in mind, at least if you live in Chicago.
 ''We'll investigate anyone,'' Bayless, the police spokesman, said, ''who isn't taking Illinois to win it all.''

HEADLINE: The Shrimp King, and His Clean and Colorful Subjects

BYLINE: By JOHN FREEMAN GILL

 BODY:
Economists say an increasing number of Americans are making career switches, but few are as drastic as that of Mustafa Ucozler. Until 2003, Mr. Ucozler was a financial adviser at Morgan Stanley. But after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, where his office was, he began reassessing his priorities and ultimately left Wall Street.
 ''I thought how all these things people strive for -- job, career -- are not really all that important, so you should do what you enjoy,'' he said. 
 For Mr. Ucozler, now 30, that turned out to be breeding and selling thousands of tiny pet shrimp. After he and his wife, Dr. Lynna Choy, and their crustacean roommates outgrew their apartment on the Upper East Side, they moved to a one-bedroom apartment in Morningside Heights, on West 113th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Once there, Mr. Ucozler proceeded to buy ever more tanks and fill them with ever more species of shrimp, which he sells through his Web site,petshrimp.com. He now has 23 tanks (with 9 more on the way) stacked on racks in his bedroom and foyer.
 ''I thought it was kind of weird,'' recalled Dr. Choy, a resident at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. ''It started with one tank and kept growing and growing. I still think it's pretty odd, actually.''
 Keeping shrimp is a popular pastime in Germany, where Mr. Ucozler grew up. But because the notion of shrimp as house pets is still foreign to most Americans, he is not shy about asserting that he is well on his way to becoming a premier breeder and purveyor of pet shrimp.
 ''The humming hub of the pet shrimp industry is in our foyer,'' Mr. Ucozler declared on a recent Saturday as he scooped up a half-inch-long pregnant red cherry shrimp. 
 Mr. Ucozler breeds 18 of the 20 species he owns -- including the striped Indian zebra shrimp and the predatory red-claw shrimp -- and he has been astonished by the extraordinary demand for information about them. 
 Since last June, when he established the Web site, it has received hits from about 25,000 distinct visitors each month, and he has sold 2,500 shrimp at $3.25 each, shipping them out every Saturday in special plastic bags protected by plastic foam boxes. He puts no more than three shrimp inside each bag, which ensures they survive shipping. (''I've never had a death,'' Mr. Ucozler said proudly.)
 Because he is a first-year law student at Rutgers, something he got into before the shrimp business took off, he limits his shrimp activities to one day a week. ''If I actually did this full time,'' he said, ''and sold all the shrimp I have, I could make six figures.''
 One of his customers is Ari Burstein, a lawyer living on the Upper West Side. ''He really is positioning himself to be the epicenter of the universe of pet shrimp,'' said Mr. Burstein, who bought 20 algae-gobbling red cherry shrimp to clean his aquarium, but soon became intrigued by their underwater antics. 
 Each species of freshwater invertebrate, which Mr. Ucozler buys from importers in places like Indonesia and India, has its own idiosyncrasies. To demonstrate why the red-striped peppermint shrimp, for example, is known as a cleaner shrimp, Mr. Ucozler stuck his hand in a tank, and a shrimp began looping around his finger like a runaway vacuum cleaner. ''He's looking for dead skin,'' Mr. Ucozler explained, before hollering, ''Ow! He's pulling my skin off!''
 Soon the day will come when Mr. Ucozler will have to choose between practicing law and becoming a full-time shrimp magnate. It seems clear that his heart is with the shrimp.
 ''In the future, I plan to have a warehouse area with hundreds of tanks,'' he said. ''This is way more exciting than sitting in a law office somewhere.'' JOHN FREEMAN GILL

 BODY:
The economics of running a nightclub in Manhattan can be brutal. Besides rent and insurance, there are utilities, those 1 a.m. calls to the plumber and, oh yes, all those musicians to pay. Two long-running downtown clubs, Luna Lounge and Fez, are closing this month, and others are struggling. 
 So the financial plan of the Stone, a new club that plans to open in April at Avenue C and Second Street in the East Village, seems to defy logic: 100 percent of the money from the door will go to the musicians and no alcohol, food or anything else will be sold inside, says John Zorn, the avant-garde composer who is the club's artistic director. The most musician-friendly clubs in the city generally give no more than 75 percent of the door and rely heavily on alcohol sales. How will the Stone make it work? With a little help from Mr. Zorn and his friends.
 The club's operating budget is to be raised through sales of limited-edition CD's, which will be produced at minimal expense. Recording time will be donated by the bassist Bill Laswell at his studio in New Jersey, and manufacturing will be handled free by Mr. Zorn's record label, Tzadik, and his chief contractor, A to Z Music Services. The CD's will be sold online, at cost, by the Downtown Music Gallery, a longtime booster. The club itself, in a former Chinese restaurant, is being rented from a filmmaker friend. The first CD will probably feature Mr. Zorn, the vocalist Mike Patton and Mr. Laswell, Mr. Zorn said. 
 ''We can sell 4,000 copies at $20 and run the place on $80,000 a year,'' he said. That would cover the rent, insurance and utilities, as well as a fee for Daniel Goldaracena, who will run the club's day-to-day operations. Bookings will be done by musicians in rotating monthlong curatorships; the first, for April, is the saxophonist Ned Rothenberg. ''This is about a community coming together,'' Mr. Zorn said. ''The downtown scene is so diverse that it eludes classification, but it functions as a community, with people helping each other.'' BEN SISARIO

HEADLINE: Miller Breaks the Curse to Reclaim the World Cup for the U.S.

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL VINTON

DATELINE: LENZERHEIDE, Switzerland, March 12 

 BODY:
The newest icon in the sport of Alpine skiing grew up free as a bird. He is Bode Miller, who was home-schooled in the woods near Franconia, N.H. Those who trekked up the steep half-mile path leading to the fairy-tale cabin his parents had built were sometimes shocked to find a 2-year-old boy playing in a rushing mountain stream beside the house. 
 They wanted him to ''discover his limits,'' say his parents, who speak with the same faraway soulfulness as Miller, who clinched the overall World Cup title by finishing second in Saturday's giant slalom.
 Miller, the most talented ski racer in the world, has earned the most respected trophy in the sport, something no American has held in 22 years, when Phil Mahre took the men's and Tamara McKinney the women's. 
 ''Like it was with the Red Sox, it was becoming embarrassing,'' said Miller, who spent the week reading Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay ''Self-Reliance.'' ''It was a different thing than a sports record. It became some kind of a curse.''
 With one race left, Miller has an insurmountable 204-point advantage over Benjamin Raich of Austria, who clinched the giant slalom title by placing third on Saturday. Miller was 68-hundredths of a second behind Stephan Goergl of Austria, who won in 2 minutes 10.51 seconds. Raich was 0.80 behind.
 The overall title represents success throughout the World Cup season, in all disciplines, against all racers. ''If you're looking for mass recognition, then the Olympics are the most important, especially in the U.S.,'' Miller said. ''If I was looking to prove that I was the best ski racer in the world, then I feel like I've done that.''
 Miller learned to ski by sliding down the path to the main road on an early incarnation of a snowboard. His preternatural talent was nurtured at Cannon Mountain, where an outcropping jutted improbably from the hillside, looking like the face of Abraham Lincoln.
 The Old Man of the Mountain appeared on New Hampshire's license plates, road signs and commemorative quarter. It drew thousands of tourists a year, and its sudden collapse, on a foggy morning in May 2003, was an existential crisis for the region, as well as an economic one.
 ''But if you ever went up there and saw it, it was like a travesty to nature,'' Miller said. ''They had it chained up there. It was all man-made and manufactured. That's one of the things that was supposed to be cool about it: that it's not man-made.''
 Miller, a phenomenally versatile and creative skier who puts authenticity first, was pleased by the landmark's sudden disintegration.
 ''I think it's awesome,'' he said. ''I totally support that. It should have fallen off years ago.''
 It is not the first time he has taken gravity's side.
 Miller, 27, competed in 33 races from late November through Saturday. He won the first two downhills of the season, silencing critics like the Austrian Olympic great Karl Schranz. 
 In December, when Miller won in four disciplines in a record-setting 16 days, the victories came in Canada, Colorado, France and Italy.
 ''Only a very few people have managed it in the past,'' said Marc Girardelli, a five-time overall winner who was an all-rounder like Miller. ''The movements in downhill are completely different from slalom and then giant slalom. You have to combat specialists. They only train in their specialist event. You have no recreation time for your mind.''
 Or for your body. Miller says he is so battered from the long season that he can hardly walk up a set of stairs.
 ''I pretty much limp around all the time now,'' he said. ''When I actually get in the course, I just black it out or have enough adrenaline.''
 Miller has spent his entire ski racing career trying not to be manufactured, resisting orthodox technique and ignoring every authority in the sport who proposed that he be more strategic in his approach to this grueling, tricky circuit.
 ''I just think that kids have a natural ability to learn on their own a lot more than they learn in a structured environment,'' said Miller's mother, Jo, who home-schooled him and let him roam the forests near his house. ''A child's natural curiosity drives them into all kinds of experiences that if you're sitting in a schoolroom you don't experience.''
 She said she could tell him what to do, and that ''maybe in a few days he might come a little bit towards what I'm saying, and it'll be his idea.'' 
 But Miller has resisted nearly every coach who tried to instill orthodox skiing technique in him, and that stubbornness drives coaches crazy.
 ''Even the geniuses, the Peles and Gretzkys, they had to do more than just show up,'' said Phil McNichol, head coach of the United States Ski Team. ''He wants to be so self-reliant and nonconformist. But he wants to be in a sport which is by definition conformist, with rules and scoring and structure and a team.''
 McNichol and the other coaches established a tenuous truce with Miller, hoping to keep him in their uniform so that his talents may rub off on his young teammates.
 But Miller is not completely with the program. Last season, he became sick of the team hotels. To regulate his environment, Miller found a sponsor for a 31-foot motor home, and paid his best friend from childhood to be his driver and cook. What was meant as a retreat from European fans and reporters only increased the fascination. 
 ''The fact that he lives in this mobile home shows that he is a good P.R. man for skiing,'' Gian Franco Kasper, the president of the International Ski Federation, said, chuckling. ''That's normal in the U.S., I know, but here gypsies have them. It's something for gypsies normally.''
 On Sunday, Miller will receive the 18-pound trophy -- the grosse kristallkugel to the Austrians, who have taken the overall title the past five years. The coveted prize is going back to Miller's family compound near Franconia -- no replacement for the Old Man, but a monument to nature's anomalous productions.
 Miller has not forgotten the folly of the Old Man. ''Maybe we shot ourselves in the foot,'' he said, referring to the Franconia natives who strapped the Old Man to the hillside with rebar and cement. ''That's the kind of thing that anxiety and stupid human nature tends to screw up. 
 ''If it had been left entirely alone, maybe it would have crumbled off and turned into, you know, an eagle or something, sitting on the cliff, and it would have been the Old Eagle on the Hill.'''

American Wins Cup Race
 LENZERHEIDE, Switzerland, March 12 (AP) -- Sarah Schleper of the United States recorded her first World Cup victory in the season's final slalom Saturday, and Janica Kostelic finished second to close in on the overall leader, Anja Paerson. 
 Schleper covered the two runs on the Silvano Beltrametti course in 1 minute 29.13 seconds, maintaining her lead from the first run.

HEADLINE: Now Batting: Hearings in Congress on Steroids

BYLINE: By ANNE E. KORNBLUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12 

 BODY:
In the shadow of the stadium where baseball makes its long-awaited return to the nation's capital next month, members of Congress are resurrecting their own familiar pastime: holding hearings into baseball's conduct.
 Admissions by major league players that they used steroids in the 1990's triggered an outpouring of congressional outrage in recent years, laying the groundwork for a high-profile hearing in the House of Representatives to be held on Thursday. Some of baseball's biggest stars have been subpoenaed to testify, including Jason Giambi, Sammy Sosa and the former major leaguer Mark McGwire, as well as Curt Schilling and Frank Thomas, who have been outspoken in criticizing steroid use. The subpoenas set off an uproar, with some witnesses saying they would not comply unless lawmakers agreed to limit their questioning. 
 But unlike earlier skirmishes between baseball and Congress, this one has not yet included serious threats of punishment from lawmakers. 
 In fact, few lawmakers are warning about the possibility of passing new laws or imposing specific regulations on baseball as a result of the hearings. The sport instituted a program for testing for steroids and a means of disciplining players who use them, after a string of hearings and warnings by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. 
 Some advocates of tougher drug rules in baseball are skeptical about the effectiveness of the newest investigations, which are at least the fourth to address the subject of drugs and baseball in three years. Even the lawmakers holding the hearings prefer to emphasize their effort at shining a spotlight on the scope of the problem rather than to talk about new legislation.
 ''The main objective of this hearing is to find out the truth of what's going on, and then we'll have to see where that takes us,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Government Reform, which will conduct the inquiry Thursday.
 Far from representing a new chapter in baseball or political history, the public tussling defines the latest intersection of the two industries and is in keeping with the keen interest that Congress has long had with baseball. It comes at a time when baseball is on the minds of many in Washington more than usual, with a former team owner in the White House and a professional team on its way to the capital for the first time since 1971.
 But to some of baseball's defenders, Congress's latest move is out of bounds, potentially intruding on players' privacy as lawmakers demand public testimony and medical records to determine the scope of steroid use over the past decade.
 It has also opened the door to more fundamental questions. How much further should Congress go in overseeing baseball, which is protected by special antitrust exemptions? Why is Capitol Hill so concerned with baseball and not, say, professional hockey, which has been shut down this season by a lockout? And could this simply be grandstanding by lawmakers who are deadlocked in an otherwise polarized Congress, thrilled to have finally found a topic on which both sides agree?
 ''Especially at a time when Congress has been virtually absent from any kind of oversight and any kind of initiatives apart from the president's rather controversial ones, it's a natural,'' Thomas E. Mann, a political expert at the Brookings Institution, said. ''It's seen as a win-win by the members of both parties.''
 A hearing into steroid use last Thursday, as well as the one scheduled for this Thursday, have their roots in a long history of congressional concern with baseball.
 By some estimates, there have been as many as two dozen inquiries into various baseball issues, in at least six committees and subcommittees, since the early 1990's. They have included hearings on baseball's efforts to stay competitive in small markets, its plans for buying and selling teams to certain owners, its firing of a former commissioner and its legal status.
 Lawmakers and sports lobbyists say there are several reasons for Washington's fascination with baseball, chief among them its popularity, its reach across geographic lines and its long history as an American pastime.
 But there is also a legal twist that often gives Congress a legitimate hook into baseball's inner workings: the 1922 exemption from antitrust laws that was granted to baseball by the United States Supreme Court. It has been modified by Congress only to give players greater rights in negotiating labor issues. The exemption applies only to baseball, and allows the sport to function as a monopoly when it comes to deciding team locations and broadcasting operations.
 The exemption, however, also gives Congress leverage over the sport. Lawmakers have repeatedly threatened to eliminate the exemption when baseball has not acted to its liking -- after the 1994 strike or before the 2003 season, when Major League Baseball was planning to eliminate teams.
 ''If they repealed the antitrust exemption, they'd have nothing to threaten us with,'' said Stanley Brand, a lawyer representing baseball executives and players in the recent subpoenas, a quotation he attributed to the former commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti.
 But that exemption is not even being threatened this time around. Lawmakers say they prefer to see baseball monitor itself. Other lawyers and political analysts say Congress will most likely not want another protracted battle with baseball, especially if the ramifications for other professions are unclear. If Congress can oversee drug policy in baseball, the logic goes, it can impose regulations across all private workplaces.
 At the same time, some argue that the debate over steroid use in baseball is past its prime. President Bush raised the issue in his State of the Union address more than a year ago. ''The use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football and other sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message -- that there are shortcuts to accomplishment, and that performance is more important than character,'' Bush said in his 2004 speech.
 McCain held hearings and sharply prodded baseball to step up its testing policy, which was established in 2002 and toughened this year.
 Late this week, McCain expressed his disapproval of the pending hearings in the House. ''The appropriate thing to do now is to let baseball's program run its course,'' McCain said in an interview on ESPN radio on Thursday.
 McCain said he would not have held a Senate hearing, saying, ''There's no point in it.''
 In fact, asked to explain why Congress is turning its attention to steroid use now, several aides said it was largely because of the publication of Jose Canseco's book ''Juiced,'' a sensational account of the use of performance-enhancing drugs by major league players, himself included. Canseco has agreed to testify before the House committee. Asked what he hopes to gain from Thursday's hearing, Waxman said his aim was to paint a complete portrait of a steroid problem that has been trickling into the public consciousness for years.
 ''There have been many reports in the past 10 years of steroids in baseball,'' Waxman said. Because of Canseco's book and players' saying that they did or did not use steroids, he added, ''It seemed to us this is the time to find out what's going on.''
 But neither Waxman nor a spokesman for Representative Tom Davis, the Republican head of the committee, would entertain what action Congress might take if it finds baseball has wantonly ignored widespread steroid use. And Representative Cliff Stearns, a Florida Republican who participated in a separate steroid hearing in the House Commerce Committee on Thursday, said the goal was to ''just bully-pulpit this and try to get them to do something.''
 Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who specializes in the economics of sports, called the hearings public displays and very little else. ''If Congress wanted to, in this particular instance, do something about the youth of America and their attraction to steroids, they should have approached this very differently,'' he sad. ''It shouldn't be in response to Jose Canseco's book.''
 Zimbalist added, ''They might as well bring Darryl Strawberry up and deal with cocaine.''

Iraqi Weapons Were Looted
Looters dismantled and removed machinery from weapons installations after Baghdad fell in 2003, including some with equipment capable of making parts for nuclear arms. An Iraqi official said it appeared that a operation made the plants its targets, looking for dual use equipment, which can be used for both military and civilian applications. 1

Gunmen in Mosul killed three Iraqi police officers as they drove to a colleague's funeral. In Baghdad, American military officials said they had begun an investigation into the possible mistreatment of civilian detainees by six marines. 20

The Iraqi insurgency appears to have mounted a full-scale propaganda war. Most militant groups now rely on the Web to recruit new adherents, but the recent flurry of propaganda from Iraq has a distinctly defensive sound. 22

Syrian Lebanon Withdrawal
President Bashar al-Assad of Syria agreed to carry out the terms of a United Nations resolution calling for a complete withdrawal from Lebanon, offering to set a timetable for the pullout as well, according to the Syrian official news agency and a United Nations envoy. 4

Hamas Ends Election Boycott
The Islamic group Hamas confirmed publicly that it will participate in Palestinian legislative elections, ending a 10-year boycott of the Palestinian Authority. The announcement is a victory for the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, who is trying to bring Hamas and its militant ally, Islamic Jihad, into mainstream Palestinian politics. 8

Iran Clings to Nuclear Power
Iran reacted testily to a statement from the United States that it should give up its nuclear program in return for economic incentives, saying that it would not give up its right to nuclear power. 14

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Stealthy Tax Increase

 BODY:
President Bush is presiding over a big middle-class tax hike. 
 As recently as 2000, only about one million taxpayers owed the alternative minimum tax, created by a provision in the federal tax code that is supposed to prevent multimillionaires from using loopholes to avoid paying their fair share. But by the time Americans file their 2005 taxes, some 3 million taxpayers will owe the alternative tax and by 2010, nearly 30 million taxpayers will be hit -- among them, a staggering 94 percent of married filers who have children and make $75,000 to $100,000. 
 Big families in high-tax states -- New York, New Jersey, California and Massachusetts -- will bear the heaviest burden, largely because the alternative tax increasingly disallows write-offs for dependents, state income taxes and local property taxes. On average, by 2010, people who make under $100,000 and owe the alternative tax will pay an additional $1,321 in federal income taxes, while alternative tax payers who make between $100,000 and $200,000 will owe an additional $2,592. 
 Meanwhile, and most outrageous, only 35 percent of taxpayers who earn $1 million or more will owe the alternative tax.
 Why does the alternative tax increasingly afflict middle-rung taxpayers for whom it was never intended, while largely ignoring the highest-end taxpayers it is meant for?
 First, the alternative tax is not adjusted for inflation, so over time, more and more middle-income taxpayers find themselves owing it. 
 Second, and crucially important, is the interplay of the alternative tax and Mr. Bush's first-term tax cuts. When the tax cuts were enacted, no long-term corresponding changes were made to the alternative tax system -- even though the administration was well aware that was a recipe for disaster. Not only will many families that thought they were in for lower income taxes wind up feeling shortchanged, some will find that the Bush tax cuts have done nothing at all to cut their taxes. 
 Here's why: The alternative tax applies to people whose income tax bills are low relative to their income. So as tax cuts reduce the liability on a filer's Form 1040, the alternative tax kicks in. In effect, it claws back all or part of the supposed savings from the Bush tax cuts. By 2010, the Bush tax cuts alone will cause an additional 17 million taxpayers to owe the alternative tax. By 2014, assuming the Bush tax cuts are made permanent, 40 million taxpayers will owe the alternative tax, nearly half of whom would never have faced it but for the tax cuts. 
 Meanwhile, the people who should be paying the alternative tax do not. Mr. Bush's administration, more than any other, has bestowed tax breaks on wealthy investors in the form of superlow rates on capital gains and dividends. But the alternative tax system -- which regards deductions for property taxes or state income taxes as a kind of tax shelter -- does not recognize this preferential treatment of investment income. That is a huge loophole. The alternative tax, whose very purpose is to prevent excessive sheltering, ignores the biggest tax breaks of all: special, low rates on capital gains and dividends that allow investors to avoid paying tens of billions of dollars in taxes every year. 
 Ever since the first round of Bush tax cuts were enacted, Congress has passed temporary relief measures to keep most middle-income taxpayers from owing the alternative tax, but the problem is becoming too big, too fast, for stopgaps to keep working. Mr. Bush, for his part, says that he wants to shield the middle class from the alternative tax and that his tax reform commission will recommend a solution when it makes its report in July.
 But Mr. Bush needs the alternative tax -- he relies on its projected revenue to mask the debilitating cost of making his tax cuts permanent. Congressional estimates say that extending them permanently will cost $281 billion in 2014. But that estimate assumes that nothing will be done to prevent the alternative tax from further burdening the middle class. If the middle class is fully protected, the cost of extending the tax cuts will mushroom to $356 billion -- 27 percent higher than the official estimate. The federal budget deficit would explode. 
 The obvious answer is to restore the alternative tax to its true antisheltering purpose, by making inflation adjustments that will exempt the middle class once and for all and by fully taxing capital gains and dividends under the alternative system. But Congress and the administration are currently heading in precisely the wrong direction. The Bush tax breaks for investment income are scheduled to expire in 2008, but both the president and Congressional leaders are calling for extending them, at least through 2010, while proposing no corresponding long-term change in the alternative tax. 
 Bush administration officials and their antitax allies seem to believe that if taxpayers become angry enough at having to pay the alternative tax, they will throw their support behind any tax reform plan the administration puts forth. That is fomenting a crisis in order to appear to solve it. Is it too much to ask not to put the country through that kind of cynical exercise yet again?

HEADLINE: A View To a Killing Field

BYLINE: By MELANIE THERNSTROM

 BODY:
''Sometimes in April,'' HBO's film about the Rwandan genocide, is the first large-scale movie ever shot in that country. (''Hotel Rwanda'' was shot in South Africa -- at a nicer hotel than the decrepit Mille Collines.) And it's certainly the first one to have its premiere there. The director Raoul Peck pledged to show the film first in Kigali, Rwanda's capital, which is why on Jan. 22 an enormous screen was erected at the Amhoro Stadium, one of the few places of successful refuge for thousands of Tutsis during the genocide. The film was screened for President Paul Kagame, government ministers and much of the city's elite. On the following night HBO opened it to the public and provided live, simultaneous translation of the English soundtrack into Kinyarwanda, the national language. (The movie will be shown in the United States on March 19. )
 Long before sunset on the second night, over 25,000 people had arrived, including those bused in from remote villages and 5,000 extras and other Rwandans employed by the movie, whose lengthy production had brought several million dollars to the country's fledgling economy. When the stadium backdoor finally opened, the crowds ran to fill the empty seats; the rest sat on the grass. 
 After waiting hours for darkness to fall, the restless crowd began to chant menacingly in Kinyarwanda. The authorities pleaded for order and debated whether to cancel the screening. While ''Hotel Rwanda'' is a story about survivors, ''Sometimes in April'' is about those who died. How would the audience -- many members had never seen a movie before -- respond to seeing the carnage recreated in living color? 
 The lead actress, Carole Karemera, milled around the crowd with me, translating as I asked Rwandans what brought them there. People seemed reluctant to give their names or have their pictures taken. When I asked the crucial question -- where were you in 1994? -- Ms. Karemera stopped translating and took me aside. 
 ''The people here, some are victims, some are killers,'' she said. ''You cannot ask who is who.''
 Somehow a Hutu orphan named Jean Claude found his way into the V.I.P. section of the stadium. He bore a straight dark scar line from his right eye to his chin that looked like a trail of tears but came from a machete wound. His parents had been killed because they were moderate Hutus. His own life had been spared after the first blow, when one of the Hutu militia said to another, ''Why are we killing a Hutu child?'' 
 I asked Jean Claude what had brought him to the screening. ''I just want to see what happened to my parents,'' he replied.
 As the Kigali night chills and the screams of characters filled the stadium, the audience shivered and cried out. Jean Claude's shoulders shook, and he made small noises, like a kitten. Afterward, the crowd surged out in stunned silence. As people flooded the street, men pounded their fists on the parked cars they passed and kicked the dirt. 
 Some attendees seemed to think the film had succeeded too well in its realism and moral complexity. (Even a Hutu hate propagandist is ultimately sympathetic.) ''People are angry,'' explained a man named Innocent, a former soldier in the Tutsi rebel army that finally halted the slaughter. He had just rescued a teenage girl, a stranger, who had collapsed on the street. ''I did not want to see this movie -- no, no, no,'' he said, shaking a trembling finger.
 ''People don't need to be reminded. They don't want to be reminded.'' 
 ''What do people want?'' I asked. 
 ''A moral, a lesson -- something that will show us how to live together.'' MELANIE THERNSTROM

HEADLINE: Fairfield's Two-Tiered Office Market

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE sale last December of a 131,633-square-foot office building opposite the train station in Greenwich for $97.75 million (an extraordinary $742.50 a square foot, in line with the high-end commercial market in Manhattan) split the Fairfield County market into what Ed Tonnessen, a senior vice president at Albert B. Ashforth, called ''the haves and the have nots.'' There is downtown Greenwich, and then there is everything else.
 While rents and vacancy rates have barely budged since 2002, sales prices are 20 to 30 percent higher than in 2002, according to Jeffrey Dunne, vice chairman for the New York metropolitan area at CB Richard Ellis, the commercial real estate firm, who negotiated the stunning Greenwich sale. 
 Soon to be announced is the sale of the former Pitney-Bowes postage meter factory in Stamford for $33 million, said Patrick Colwell, the broker who handled the sale at Cushman & Wakefield. Its new owners, the Antares Real Estate Company of Greenwich and Lubert-Adler Group of Philadelphia, will demolish some if not all of the nine industrial buildings on 22 acres in Stamford's South End to create space for 600 units of market-rate and affordable housing, 800,000 square feet of retailing and 200,000 square feet of government, educational and medical space. 
 Other major recent sales include Eight Sound Shore Associates of Greenwich, a 72,100-square-foot building that sold in February for $32.6 million; 274 Riverside Drive, a 46,585-square-foot building in Westport that went for $12.65 million in January; Lee Farm Corporate Park in Danbury, a 215,000-square-foot property sold for $25.75 million in December; and One East Weaver Street in Greenwich, with 82,806 square feet, which brought $32.78 million in February. 
 On the market now is Norden Park in East Norwalk, a 680,000-square-foot building on 30 acres, with 400,000 square feet still occupied by Norden. The building had a $10 million renovation two and a half years ago by the current owners, a partnership of the Spinnaker Companies, Greenfield Partners and Summit Development. Its principal tenants are Gibbs College, Tauck Tours, Comphealth and Pepperidge Farm, which has moved its bakery upstate and sold its property on Route 1 in Norwalk for residential development. 
 The push of commercial space east and north continues, from Greenwich to Stamford to Norwalk, as businesses seek lower costs and better travel conditions for their employees.
 Norwalk snared Diageo, the giant liquor, wine and beer company based in London, with a $40 million state tax break last year. This week, the company, whose brands include Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Tanqueray, is moving its American headquarters out of 140,000 square feet in Stamford and into its newly built 275,000-square-foot headquarters at 801 Main Avenue in Norwalk.
 The building, at the junction of the Merritt Parkway and Route 7, is part of a 1.45-million-square-foot commercial and residential complex developed by Building and Land Technologies, a company based at the site. Next to it, the development company is completing a 360,000-square-foot office building scheduled to open next year. Annual rents will be $40 a square foot on leases of 10 to 15 years, and the building will have a cafeteria, fitness facilities and underground parking. 
 Stung by the loss of Diageo and unable to move three large downtown lots into development for several years, Stamford is still holding its own.
 ''Eight hundred jobs were created in the tri-town area in the last quarter,'' meaning Stamford, Greenwich and Norwalk, said Stamford's mayor, Dannel Malloy. ''The unemployment rate is down to 2.5 percent, and we are in serious discussions about commitments of 1.5 million square feet of new office space. If you're going to move from New York, you can't go beyond Stamford if you want to hold onto your people.''
 According to a survey of Fairfield's largest office properties by Delmhorst & Sheehan, a real estate advisory firm, annual rents in downtown Greenwich average about $75 a square foot, roughly double rents ranging from the mid-$30's to the low $40's per square foot in the rest of Greenwich and in other towns. This disparity is indicative of ''a very skewed two-tier market,'' said John E. Sheehan.
 Year-end 2004 and early-2005 statistics as measured by three real estate brokerage firms -- CB Richard Ellis, Cushman & Wakefield and Albert B. Ashforth -- peg vacancy rates in Greenwich at 15.5 to 15.8 percent, compared with 17.6 to 20 percent in Stamford and 16.2 to 21.6 percent in Norwalk.
 But rents in the 4.4-mile downtown patch of Greenwich's 50 square miles are $65 to $75 a square foot annually, and a healthy $39.49 to $45.96 in the rest of the town. Rents in Stamford are $27.85 to $30.29, and in Norwalk the spread is $24.18 to $25.17. 
 Real estate professionals agree that there is a shortage of companies relocating into the area and some churning of space within the area. Currently, three large users of space are looking in Stamford: the Royal Bank of Scotland in Manhattan, and its subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets, which is now in Greenwich, and UBS Warburg, whose spokeswoman, Alison Chin, said, ''We are exploring expansion in Stamford.'' UBS's current building fills 998,300 square feet near the Stamford railroad station with an office tower and a 65,000-square-foot trading floor. 
 Tom Rich, a third-generation member of the F.D. Rich family, which redeveloped downtown Stamford under an urban renewal contract some 35 years ago, had planned to build a 162-room Marriott Residence Inn and a 150,000-square-foot office building on one of the vacant downtown parcels at the southwest corner of Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard. But bids at 20 percent over budget resulted in plans to reconfigure the project as part hotel and part condo. 
 At the same time, with an eye toward capturing one of the big users surveying the market, he has joined forces with the United States Postal Service, whose excess land borders his parcel, in marketing a ''build to suit'' project with a 70,000-square-foot trading floor. 
 The other two vacant parcels are 24 Richmond Hill Avenue, where the Dreyfus Company has been trying for five years to attract tenants to a proposed office building called Connecticut Place, and what is known locally as ''the hole in the ground,'' a four-acre hollowed-out tract behind the Stamford Town Center Mall that has been empty for about 20 years.
 A succession of developers with mixed-use plans for the site have been rejected for a variety of reasons. Now, Rick Redniss, head of Redniss & Mead, land use consultants in Stamford, has been working with the Milstein Brothers of New York, who have owned the property for the past seven years, on a plan to develop it themselves.

HEADLINE: Salvation in the Classroom

BYLINE: By PETER QUINN. 
Peter Quinn, Time Warner corporate editorial director, is the author of the forthcoming novel, ''Hour of the Cat.''

DATELINE: Hastings-on-Hudson 

 BODY:
THE recent announcement of extensive closings of Catholic schools throughout the New York area has stirred sadness and resistance among the families directly affected. For me, a veteran of Catholic schooling in the Bronx from kindergarten through the last stages of graduate study, the closings are a reminder of what I owe to these schools and how much they have shaped my life.
 St. Raymond's, the grade school I attended (which is not among the schools to be closed), is still there, at the corner of Castle Hill and Metropolitan Avenues. The old school, which was reserved for boys and supplemented by a newer building for girls, is a square, red-brick edifice, typical of the frill-free structures that have been a part of almost every New York Catholic parish for the last century and a half. 
 The original impetus to build these schools came from Irish immigrants who, after a long and bitter struggle to preserve their religious identity in their homeland, encountered in America a Protestant-dominated public school system that regarded Catholicism as an alien and subversive superstition. In the years leading up to the Civil War, with religious tensions at white heat, Archbishop John Hughes initiated a construction program that made parish schools a priority.
 From that time on, if lack of funds presented a choice between building a school or a church, the school came first. Mass was said in the school basement or auditorium until there was money to erect a proper church. Teachers were for the most part members of religious orders of nuns and brothers whose mission was the education of Catholic children. Their unpaid labor was the fuel that made the system run and allowed it to operate tuition free. In my experience, they ran the gamut from those unsuited by temperament and training to be teachers to extraordinary educators who did a heroic job of not only instructing us in the basics but inculcating in us a love of learning. 
 There was usually neither space nor time for cosseting individual students. At St. Raymond's, the typical class included 45 to 55 students of wildly varying abilities, often from wildly different economic and ethnic backgrounds. With scant resources and no assistants or special support services, teachers concentrated on seeing to it that, at a minimum, every student mastered the skills needed to pass a civil service exam or qualify for an entry position at Con Edison or the telephone company.
 The use of corporal punishment has been covered to the point of parody. What's left out is that this was often of a piece with the immigrant cultures that looked to these schools to train their children. The use of physical punishment frequently reflected the wishes of parents and families intent on having their children gain the discipline and knowledge they needed to rise in the world, even if it required force and intimidation. At St. Raymond's most of us didn't report the punishments we received at school on the certainty our parents would repeat them. 
 Intellectually, while rote learning took precedence over the development of a capacity for creativity, the results weren't entirely regrettable. Few graduated without knowing the difference between adverbs or adjectives or the requirement of subject and verb agreement. My wife, for example, educated by Ursuline nuns in the South Bronx, had drilled into her a mastery of English grammar that, in my estimation, ranks her among the best copy editors I have ever encountered. I remain supremely grateful for the way the Christian brothers grounded me in proper usage.
 In the eighth grade at St. Raymond's, in 1961, I sat in the same desk my father had in 1918. The son of a seamstress and a union organizer, neither of whom had gone beyond grade school, my father went on from that desk to college and law school and was eventually elected to the United States Congress and the state judiciary. 
 The desk we shared had an oak top set in a cast-iron filigreed frame that was bolted to the floor. It had a solid, permanent feel. It might still be there, occupied by the child of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, or Belize, or Haiti who are in the process of making the leap from rural poverty through urban struggle to the middle class and beyond.
 There have been dramatic changes in the church and the world in the four decades since I left St. Raymond's. The ranks of brothers and nuns have thinned to the point where lay people do most of the teaching. Old immigrant communities have dissolved and been replaced by new ones. But the need for well-ordered schools, with a moral as well as educational mission, remains as strong as ever. The consequences of losing such schools entirely will be felt far beyond the Catholic community.

HEADLINE: Bring the Farm to Whole Foods

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Greetings from ''the culinary fringe''; we'd just like to thank Brian Halweil for his eminently sensible call for more local products in New York's Whole Foods supermarkets (''Shop in Your Backyard,'' Op-Ed, March 6).
 It is tragic that in such a large and wealthy country we have allowed economies of scale and the reductionism of marketing to do such violence to local agriculture, the family farm and the quality and variety of foods available to us. Thousands of uniquely delicious and nutritious varieties of fruits, vegetables, grains and livestock have been driven to near-extinction by a system that values appearance over flavor, portability over freshness, uniformity over diversity and price over everything.
 The Greenmarket system has done a wonderful job of introducing many New Yorkers to the pleasures of local, fresh, seasonal foods; Whole Foods is now perfectly positioned to draft on that success. Doing so would go a long way toward demonstrating that good eating, good agricultural policy and good business can all go together.

EVERY MAN A SPECULATOR
A History of Wall Street
in American Life.
By Steve Fraser.
721 pp. HarperCollins Publishers. $29.95.
 TRY a multiple choice question. Which phrase best describes Wall Street: (a) a den of thieves; (b) the engine room of innovation; (c) a conspiracy of oligarchs; (d) Babylon on the Hudson (e) the yellow brick road to a property-owning democracy?
 In his rollicking history over two centuries, Steve Fraser nominates all of the above. He is notably assiduous. He plots the roller coasters of boom and bust from the panics of 1792, 1837, 1873 and 1893, through the Jazz Age and the Great Depression to the ''socially negligent and narcissistic'' second Gilded Age of the Reagan 80's and on to today's ''shareholder nation.'' He examines the biographies of the icons and the rap sheets of the scoundrels, but he also eyes the Street in succeeding eras through the critical prisms of literature and the movies. Yes, Gordon (''greed is good'') Gekko rubs shoulders with J. P. Morgan.
 This is not so much a financial as a cultural history. Fraser's ambition is to examine ''how Wall Street has entered into the lives of generations long passed and those alive today . . . the way the character of America has changed.'' He recognizes the dubiousness of fixing a unitary character on a polymorphous people, but argues that if you distill all the histories, all the satiric cartoons, the brimstone sermons, the exposes, the Horatio Alger storybooks -- all the Wall Streets of the mind -- Wall Street becomes ''a window into the souls of Americans.''
 That is a tough image to hold fast when one decade we are frolicking in the Elysian Fields with the ticker tape registering at $549 stock we bought at $85.25 a year before, the next we are weeping in Dante's Purgatory with Charles Ponzi, Ivan Boesky & Company (more recent candidates are crowding the anteroom).
 The popular mood pictured in ''Every Man a Speculator'' is volatile. It swings from loathing in the bad years to irrational exuberance in the good. Mostly, it seems to have been one of irritable ambivalence. But Fraser, also the author of ''Labor Will Rule: Sidney Hillman and the Rise of American Labor,'' has a keen grasp of his material, and his vivacious style and historical perspective carry us through the tumults. Rather surprisingly, at the end he suggests that today ''most of the hoary suspicions'' have faded away. He concludes that back home in living rooms all across America, where culture wars are ultimately settled, popular hostility to the Street has been revised ''even in the teeth of the most stunning Wall Street frauds since the crash of 1929.''
 His explanation for this, and for Democratic rhetoric no longer demonizing the Street, is the explosion of institutional investing through pension funds and mutual funds. The largest pension funds own 60 percent of the largest corporations. For the first time roughly half of the population participates in the stock market, up from 10 percent in 1960. Only a minority may be involved actively, but Foster considers their mortgages and college anxieties and dreams to be intertwined directly and intimately with Wall Street in a way not seen before.
 One would have thought this would make people a tad cross about having their pockets picked, say by investment bankers posing as disinterested analysts (as Charles Gasparino lays out in his chilling new book, ''Blood on the Street''), but Fraser stoutly maintains that in a society obsessed with consumption the ''homely motivations'' of the suburban capitalists have ''removed the taint of avariciousness that had always discolored the market.'' He appears to think the common-sense charisma of a Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway or a Peter Lynch of Magellan looms large enough in the average man's mind to obscure Kenneth Lay of Enron, Bernard Ebbers of WorldCom, Jack Grubman of Salomon Smith Barney, Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, etc., alas, etc. 
 Fraser is by no means an undiscriminating booster. He writes discerningly on the nexus of politics and finance. He offers an appraisal of the 19th-century Populist agitation about ''the money trust'' sucking blood out of the agrarian heartland that is uncommonly sympathetic and on the mark. The Wall Street gold bugs were dumb to inflict such a prolonged deflation on the country after the Civil War. 
 It is a pity Fraser does not bring quite the same skepticism to conventional history when he arrives at Black Tuesday, 1929, and the Great Depression. The long shadow fixed in the popular imagination is that the stock market crash came first, precipitating bank closures and bankruptcies and then the long free fall of output, incomes and employment. It was not quite like that. No major company fell in the crash. The wave of business liquidations was a full year off. There were no immediate bank failures. The market recovered; it was firm from November 1929 to April 1930. This is not to say the great bull market was sound. Professor William Z. Ripley was justified in trying to arouse President Coolidge in 1928 to the ''prestidigitation, double-shuffling, honey-fugling, hornswoggling and skulduggery.'' 
 But concentrating on the crash as the simple cause of 10 years of misery diverts attention from the shift in tectonic plates: by mid-1928, mass purchasing power no longer sustained the economy because industrial wages and farm incomes had fallen way behind output and profits. No amount of new regulation of Wall Street would have saved America from what followed unless demand had been stimulated and a thoroughly unbalanced budget embraced -- something even Franklin Roosevelt did not countenance until 1942.
 In the end it was the engineers, not the financiers, who saved the world. Fraser briefly acknowledges the work of a new generation of scholars and economists in putting Black Tuesday in proper perspective, but he concentrates on the way the crash ''invoked the whole historic iconography of shame that had shadowed the Street since the days of Thomas Jefferson.'' There is nothing he relishes more than a good scandal. In his lineups, he mostly and entertainingly identifies the right people. Here going off to Sing Sing in his bowler hat and black coat is the president of the Stock Exchange, Richard Whitney, who has raged against Roosevelt's New Deal reforms while stealing from the exchange's own gratuity fund and embezzling from the New York Yacht Club (is nothing sacred?). And here is former President Coolidge, the Democratic Party chairman John Jakob Raskob, the World War I hero Gen. John J. Pershing and numerous C.E.O.'s, all without a blush secretly accepting insider prices on Morgan confections. 
 Fraser skewers crony capitalism while being oddly gentle with its apotheosis, the lordly plutocrat Andrew Mellon. Was a tax-evading Treasury secretary whose answer to the Great Depression he helped to bring on was to ''liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers'' really a ''great man''? At the same time, Fraser in his appetite for villainy is sometimes a little too like the Queen in ''Alice in Wonderland'': sentence first, trial later. Michael Milken does not deserve his place in the tumbrel; he was not guilty of insider trading, and his financial and business innovations were significant. Fraser is cavalier in his treatment of Samuel Insull. It matters to get Insull's story right. He is one of history's answers to the crucial question Foster poses in his introduction: Has Wall Street been vital to the nation's efficiency, innovation and growth?
 Foster describes Insull as a creator of ''a cloud of paper wealth'' and says he was guilty of ''the grossest fleecing in American financial history.'' He has taken his text from John Dos Passos in ''Big Money,'' the third volume of the trilogy ''U.S.A.''; and it is a caricature. In truth, Fraser's ''king for a day'' worked nearly 50 years to electrify America. He was a lowly English clerk who started as Thomas Edison's gofer at 21 and helped build the company that became General Electric. In 1892, at 37, he took over a tiny power station in Chicago and conceived of a way -- power produced by huge generators and marketed at peak and off-peak rates -- to bring ever cheaper electricity to industry, street cars and the homes of millions of people otherwise dependent on gas. 
 Insull made two errors on the onset of the Depression. He believed President Hoover that it would soon be over, and he kept expanding. When recovery did not come, his companies crashed. He was saved from jail not by ''a swarm of high priced lawyers,'' as Fraser would have it, but by his own moving testimony. The prosecution had been a politically motivated witch hunt, and the jury took five minutes to clear him of all charges. In the end, about 40 percent of the stock of all American corporations was forfeited; that of Insull's electrical and gas operating companies fell by less than 1 percent. 
 Insull was not a crook. He was an innovator of the first degree, supported by Wall Street only, in Lenin's phrase, as a rope supports a hanging man. It was the same in 1932 with Amadeo Giannini, the heroic pioneer in California of popular banking and branch banking, ignored in Fraser's history. Giannini's triumph over the ''Wall Street gang,'' as he called his enemies around John Pierpont Morgan Jr., in one of the country's great takeover battles enabled him to finance the recovery in California. The Bank of America is his monument today.
 Curiously for his expansively researched book, Fraser is not excited much to investigate the relationships between money and invention. He refers to new mass-market technologies driving the 20's boom, like radio, sound movies, electric appliances, synthetic fabrics and Bakelite; he sketches the dot.com bubble of the 90's. But he does not examine how these innovations were brought from lonely brain wave to the bustle of the marketplace.
 There is a downside to the ''shareholder nation.'' It intensifies the stock market's appetite for a quick buck at the expense of the fortitude required to establish a new business or plan for growth in the long term. The luminous former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has remarked that an analyst who forecasts the five-year prospects for the Ford Motor Company will probably never make a living. Rubin laments the way the pension funds, the mutuals and amateur speculation -- every man a speculator! -- have put traditional Wall Street's short-term thinking into overdrive, to the detriment of the long term and risky innovation. Multibillion-dollar private equity groups have come more and more to the fore, irrigating the seeds of such now established companies as Genentech, Intel and Google. It is a remarkable sign of the ingenuity and enterprise in the broader Wall Street today. Georges Doriot, scanted like Giannini, deserves at least a friendly nod. He so despaired of Wall Street's reluctance to catch up with postwar technological change that he founded the first publicly owned venture capital investment company in 1947 (the American Research and Development Corporation). Out of that came the first interactive minicomputer. 
 A historian as dedicated as Fraser will no doubt repair omissions in due course. Meanwhile, he deserves a cheer for his long ascent to the summit. He affords us a panoramic view of decades of high endeavor and low greed. Wisely, he does not attempt to crown his endeavors by forecasting the course of the Dow. Nobody can say it better than J. P. Morgan. When asked what the market would do, he summoned all his authority and gravely pronounced: ''It will fluctuate.''

HEADLINE: Money Quote

BYLINE: By William Safire. 
Send comments and suggestions to: safireonlanguage@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
'At the outset of every sweep phoner,'' wrote Lisa de Moraes in The Washington Post in December about the calls placed by network officials to influence interpretation of the latest ratings, ''one NBC exec begins with a money quote -- one the press is sure to jump on.'' 
 Last summer, Bill Clinton's nicely phrased hope that debates would return to ''where we argue who's right and wrong, not who's good and bad'' was praised in The Des Moines Register with ''Clinton had the money quote of the day.'' Before that usage, Time magazine noted in 1984 that a biography of the Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton made the publisher, Random House, ''delighted but not surprised by the enthusiastic 'money quotes' in early reviews.'' 
 Here we have a phrase gaining in frequency that has bypassed the classic coinage blurb. That stroke of onomatopoeic linguistic genius by Gelett Burgess in 1907, meaning ''effusive praise for advertising purposes,'' now has a synonym that is more emphatic. A money quote has subsumed blurb's primary meaning of ''recommendation that helps its object make money,'' adding the sense of ''the essence, or most newsworthy part of the statement.'' 
 The love of money may or may not be the root of all evil, but what is the root of money as an attributive noun? (That's a noun doing the modifying work of an adjective, like killer whale, street-corner conservative, world opinion or blogger commentary.) 
 In sports, a money player is one who comes through in the clutch. It may have begun in billiards. The Chicago Daily Tribune in 1890, quoting from a decision on the handicapping of players, reported: ''Schaefer and Slosson are scratch men at 500 points each. . . . Catton, being a money player, can outstay Heiser in a test game.'' In horse racing, the money position was the front. In baseball, The New York Daily News wrote in 1949, ''Pee Wee Reese . . . Duke Snider . . . and Luis Olmo . . . came through with money hits to break the tie.'' (And where was Carl Furillo?) 
 Then money as a modifier meaning ''powerful, decisive'' made the move to movies as money shot. Steve Ziplow, in his ''Filmmaker's Guide to Pornography,'' noted in 1977 that ''there are those who believe that the . . . money shot is the most important element in the movie.'' The staid but resolutely unblushing Oxford English Dictionary, now available online for $295 a year, cites this climactic phrase as an American colloquialism for ''a provocative, sensational or memorable sequence in a film, on which the film's commercial performance is perceived to depend; (specifically, in a pornographic film) one showing ejaculation); . . . (also, in extended use) a crucial or pivotal moment, event or factor, especially in another art form, as a novel.''
 Generations from now, lexicographers and etymologists scanning The Times archives for the origins of attributive use of nouns in the late 20th century will find this scholarly entry and have no trouble determining the money quote.

BIG PICTURE
 In ''The Big Picture: The New Logic of Money and Power in Hollywood,'' the investigative author Edward Jay Epstein holds that what used to be the movie business, centered in ''movie houses,'' has been transformed into the home-entertainment business. As a result, its familiar lexicon has been overtaken. 
 ''Outdated vocabulary,'' he writes, ''includes such terms as B-picture, first run, marquee name, long run, blockbuster and box-office gross -- terms from an era in which the paramount measure of success was the performance and duration of movies in theaters.''
 Lest we forget, a B picture was a low-budget film made to accompany the feature film, thereby producing a double feature -- enough to fill three hours of an evening out, or time to air-cool off on a hot afternoon. The theater circuit was so named, Epstein tells me, ''because reels of a single movie could be sent by bicycle from one theater to the next. Show times were sometimes cut so close that one theater was showing the first reel of a film while another theater was showing the last.''
 I pick no nits with his thesis of a paradigm-dropping shift in the industry and its lingo, but one of his etymologies is speculative. Blockbuster, he reports, was ''coined in the 1920's to denote a movie whose long line of customers could not be contained on a single city block.'' Though an online encyclopedia suggests a similar origin -- describing a play so successful that competing theaters on the block are ''busted'' -- no specific citation is given, and without a citation, you don't have a coinage you can bite on. I'd say blockbuster is World War II vintage and cite The Los Angeles Times of July 30, 1942: ''The R.A.F. had lost 29 of the 600 bombers sent against Hamburg Sunday, when 175,000 incendiaries and hundreds of explosive bombs, including two-ton 'block busters,' were dumped in a 35-minute raid.'' 
 In that same year, the phrase the big picture had its premiere. In his title, Epstein plays its movie meaning against its current sense of ''an overview that brings perspective.'' Probably (now I'm the one speculating) the phrase grew out of the perspective in a painter's ''broad canvas.'' The Big Picture, with initial caps to signify a theme, was used in 1931 by a Depression-era baseball official to describe the distinction that sportswriters bestowed on the St. Louis Cardinals star Pepper Martin, but its grand-perspective sense was first brought into play by Lt. Col. Robert Allen Griffin, in defining the word strategy in 1942: ''The term applies to the big picture; it is used in direction of campaigns . . . to win wars.'' 
 Griffin's use of the phrase in the present sense may have been from an earlier use in an economics context by the British social scientist Barbara Wootton. His usage is today's money quote, but when somebody comes up with the hard evidence of its origin, security strategists, business gurus and language mavens will consider that a blockbuster.

HEADLINE: The Choices For Wal-Mart Workers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Welcome to Sherwood Forest, Er, Wal-Mart'' (On the Contrary, March 6) argued that Wal-Mart's lower prices do not come at the expense of low-paid employees because ''many Wal-Mart employees presumably can't get better jobs; if they could, they would.''
 Such an argument does not consider the power that Wal-Mart has to determine the choices available to low-wage workers. If a Wal-Mart expansion into Southern California forces many of the area's unionized supermarkets out of business, for example, many of those supermarkets' workers may have to work at Wal-Mart for much less. 
 If economic arguments are to apply in the real world, it is necessary to consider the unequal distribution of economic and political power.

 BODY:
IT'S the value investor's quandary: With corporate profit growth slowing and the Dow Jones industrial average near a four-year high, stocks are no longer a bargain. In fact, 72 percent of global fund managers say they think that equities are either fairly valued or overvalued, according to a recent survey by Merrill Lynch.
 Yet the primary alternatives to stocks -- bonds -- are also overpriced, in the view of a vast majority of professional money managers. 
 That leaves a central question for investors, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago: ''If you decide that now is the time to take some money off the table, where do you put it?'' 
 Traditionally, when stocks and bonds zig at the same time, some alternative asset classes, like commodities or real estate, manage to zag. 
 But that doesn't seem to be the case this time. ''Honestly, I don't know of any good bargains out there,'' said Brian Jones, vice president of Cooper, Jones & McLeland, a financial planning and wealth management firm in Fairfax, Va. In fact, he said, there are some asset classes that, because of their valuations, ''we're going out of our way to avoid.'' Those include traditional portfolio diversifiers like gold, oil and real estate. 
 So what's left? Ben Inker, director of asset allocation at GMO, an investment management firm in Boston, said that ''there's no shame in going to cash if you don't like stocks or bonds.'' 
 Money market mutual funds virtually assure protection of principal, and their yields have been rising along with short-term interest rates, Mr. Inker said. And they will keep rising if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further, as most market watchers expect.
 The average taxable money fund was yielding 1.93 percent last week, according to iMoneyNet, which tracks money market funds, up from 0.51 percent a year ago. Still, money funds are returning less than the inflation rate, about 3 percent for the last 12 months. 
 Traditionally, investors turn to bonds to earn slightly higher yields than money markets can offer. But ''I would hesitate to use the bond market with the Fed in tightening mode,'' said James Stack, editor of InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter. After all, if market interest rates rise further, the value of older, lower-yielding bonds is likely to fall, which means that your bond portfolio may lose money.
 But fixed-income investors have a couple of options. For starters, the broad category of bond funds includes so-called bank loan funds. These portfolios, also known as loan participation funds, invest in floating-rate debt taken out by companies that are not rated or are not of investment grade.
 These companies pay a premium on these loans that is above a benchmark rate like the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Investors in bank loan funds can typically expect to earn around two and a half or three percentage points above the Libor, which is now above 3 percent on 90-day loans.
 Moreover, unlike traditional bond funds, bank loan portfolios invest in variable-rate debt. ''Therefore, in a rising rate environment, there's an opportunity to pick up greater returns,'' said James A. Shambo, a financial planner in Colorado Springs. 
 Floating-rate loans are often compared to high-yield bonds, because both are non-investment grade. But there are big differences, said Scott H. Page, co-manager of the Eaton Vance Floating-Rate fund.
 For example, floating-rate loans are a form of senior debt while high-yield bonds are subordinated. That means investors in bank loan funds get priority when making claims against the borrower's assets in case of default. Holders of junk bonds must wait in line. Moreover, junk bonds are an unsecured form of debt, meaning they're not backed by collateral. Floating-rate bank loans are secured by the borrowing company's assets. 
 Bank loan funds tend to do best when rates are rising and the economy is improving, reducing the likelihood of defaults, said Andrew Clark, senior research analyst at Lipper, the fund tracker. Since retail versions of bank loan funds started in the late 1980's, interest rates have generally fallen. Yet the average bank loan portfolio has managed to return 4.1 percent a year since the start of the bear market, according to Morningstar. That is well above money market levels. 
 There is also a relatively safe way to invest in traditional bonds amid rising rates: by laddering, or building a portfolio of bonds that mature at various intervals. 
 So instead of buying a collection of bonds all coming due in, say, five years, you can buy bonds with maturities ranging from 1 to 10 years. ''If you think interest rates are going north,'' said Ronald W. Roge, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y., ''you want to have a laddered portfolio so that as bonds mature, you can reinvest your money into higher-yielding bonds.'' 
 The problem is that it's hard to build a ladder of individual bonds, with a few thousand dollars here and a few thousand there, when the money needs to be reallocated from other assets. But a handful of bond mutual funds, with relatively low minimum investment requirements, use bond ladders in their portfolios.
 For example, all eight bond funds run by the Thornburg family of funds ladder their securities. By doing so, the Thornburg Limited Term U.S. Government bond fund, for instance, has had virtually the same returns as the average intermediate-term government bond fund, but with only about ''two-thirds of the volatility of five-year Treasuries,'' said Steven J. Bohlin, managing director of Thornburg Investment Management.
 IF equity investors don't think the stock market will go straight up, they can hedge bets by, among other things, putting a small portion -- say, 10 percent -- of their equity stake into market-neutral funds.
 Some of these funds aim to be perfectly ''market neutral,'' meaning that for every $1 they bet on stocks, they bet another $1 against a market climb, by shorting. Others aren't so strict. 
 Because they invest in stocks, market-neutral funds can easily lose money over a given period. But some can dampen the volatility of a total portfolio better than money market funds.
 For instance, according to Morningstar, a portfolio with 60 percent in stocks, 30 percent in bonds and 10 percent in money funds returned 5.7 percent, annualized, in the three years through February; the portfolio's standard deviation, a gauge of volatility, was 9. 14 percent. By comparison, the same portfolio with 10 percent of its assets invested not in money funds but rather in the Laudus Rosenberg Value Long-Short fund would have returned 6.2 percent, annualized. And that's with a standard deviation of only 8.45 percent. 
 To be sure, market-neutral money management is hard to execute, and many of these funds lag behind traditional long-only stock funds for extended periods.
 But the point of this exercise is not to find the hot investment of the month, but to reduce risk in your overall portfolio, said Mr. Ablin at Harris Private Bank. ''And here's a way to do it,'' he said, ''while avoiding just idling in cash.''

HEADLINE: A Wave of Mergers, Not Yet at Its Crest

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
THE current wave of mergers and acquisitions is just the beginning of a major period of corporate consolidation, says Dennis J. Block, co-chairman of M.&A. for the New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, who has played a role in many mergers. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation:

Q. We're seeing proposed mergers like Procter & Gamble's plan to acquire Gillette and Federated's plan to buy May Department Stores, as well as proposed deals involving AT&T and MCI. But companies like Citigroup and American Express are spinning off certain assets. What's going on?

A. It's a period of consolidation. Even in such a period, the concept is to find a way to enhance your core business. Spinoffs are usually a good method of carving out pieces of the business that don't fit the description of ''core.''
 The real increase started in December. It's somewhat of a reaction to the certainty created by the election.

Q. Until recently, it seemed that mergers were out of fashion, on the assumption that they did not reward shareholders and were difficult to manage, as we saw with Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer.

A. Your assumptions are applicable to some transactions, but not all. Some have created value. Some have enhanced businesses that needed to have more critical mass. There is a great need for consolidation today because of the business environment. You're dealing in a global market. There's tremendous competition. Profit margins are being squeezed. To reach double-digit growth, which is the goal of most companies, they're looking for additional products and additional critical mass.

Q. Why don't companies spend all this money on internal innovation?

A. That's more expensive. You have great uncertainty when you do it internally. If you can buy something that has a track record, you start out that much farther ahead in the game. If you can buy a brand and take advantage of the synergies, that's easier. Most of the transactions you're seeing are ''in market.'' They are building on their own core business, as opposed to bringing in some business they're not familiar with.

Q. Hasn't the term ''synergies'' been discredited?

A. Synergy obviously depends on having two items that are synergistic, that work hand in glove. If you look at a merger of two banks, it's hard for me to see why you're not going to create enormous synergies. You're going to be able to remove one set of overhead from management. You close some branch offices that are unnecessary. It's a question of what you're putting together. If you're putting crayons and marbles together, you probably don't have much synergy.

Q. What industries are going to be transformed?

A. Retail is very active. Telecommunications is extraordinarily active. Media is an area that's going to be active in the upcoming year. Energy is going to be active. Real estate ought to be active. We're going to see action in fields where there already has been some consolidation. You have a catching-up effect.
Q. What would you expect to see in manufacturing?

A. Look at pharmaceuticals. It takes 14 years to create a new drug. You'll see a consolidation. Food products are another good area where you'll see consolidation.

Q. How far will mergers go in retailing?

A. When you think of retailing, who do you think of? Wal-Mart. If you're competing with them, you need to have a certain size so that you have comparable buying capability. Winn-Dixie apparently attributes its bankruptcy to its inability to compete with Wal-Mart. You're going to see consolidations among supermarkets to enable them to compete.

Q. What is happening in media?

A. There's been lots of consolidation over the past 10 years. You're going to see more of it. It's a business that's capital-intensive. There's lots of competition. You're going to see fewer, bigger participants. I read that somebody thought Cablevision was prettying itself up for a transaction. That wouldn't shock me. Cable is a unique industry. There is only a finite number of subscribers. It's very hard for a business to grow internally because you're limited by geography and how many subscribers you have in that location.

Q. How does this wave of consolidation compare with previous periods?

A. In the last wave of the 90's, we saw mostly synergistic transactions. This will be comparable. But you won't see these huge ''mergers of equals'' because those have been discredited.

Q. Are you referring primarily to Hewlett-Packard and Compaq and DaimlerChrysler?

A. I don't want to use examples, but you've picked two good ones. The idea of having two executives at the top doesn't work real well.

Q. Does this wave of consolidation raise anticompetitive issues?

A. The regulators are aware that there is a need to consolidate. Almost everything today is a commodity. To compete in a commodity world, you need bulk. This is a world economy. There is a lot of competition. When you look at consolidation, you really have to look at the world market. The antitrust regulators recognize that in a world economy, there are not that many monopolistic players out there.

HEADLINE: Of Ice Cream, and Homogenization

BYLINE: By JACK SILBERT. 
Jack Silbert is a children's magazine editor who has lived in Hoboken for 11 years.

 BODY:
WALKING through Hoboken recently, I noticed that one of the many vacant storefronts along Washington Street would soon be home to a Cold Stone Creamery, the fast-growing national ice-cream chain. 
 Good news, no? Business returning to a dormant location seems like a positive economic indicator. And who doesn't love ice cream? But this was not good news. For I knew that there had been another ice-cream shop right across the street. Jordan's was a small, independently run shop with a devoted customer base. 
 I've chatted with Jordan's owner, Alex Pina. He is the textbook honest man trying to make an honest living. Alex gave up a successful career in marketing with the dream of opening his own business. He took classes, learning to make ice cream. He bought top-quality ingredients. Alex and his wife, Lisa, worked countless hours to build a thriving operation. But Cold Stone effectively put the deep-freeze on those dreams. Alex did the math, and realized Jordan's would lose customers and, eventually, wouldn't be able to remain solvent. So he decided to shut down sooner rather than later. Alex hopes to reopen in another town, but it's too soon to say. 
 The homogenization of the American Main Street is ancient news by now. We've squeezed every last drop of individuality from our communities, and have welcomed the Great Wall of Wal-Marts. There is the occasional flicker of resistance: In the early 1980's, chain stores were not welcome on Nassau Street in Princeton. Then came the coronation of Burger King, a dark day that wilted the ivy in the esteemed college town. There is no standing in the way of progress or the flame-broiled Whopper.
 Did I mention that Jordan's was across the street? Sure, it's practically a cliche for a Starbucks to open within a cold stone's throw of another Starbucks. But knowingly opening a national franchise across from a minuscule local competitor? It just seems sinister. 
 Ten years ago, there was only one genuine ice-cream shop on Hoboken's main thoroughfare: Hobo's at 636 Washington Street. I should next acknowledge the combination Baskin-Robbins/Dunkin' Donuts (214 Washington). However, I don't want to get on a tangent, questioning the necessity of four Dunkin' Donuts locations in a mile-square city. 
 Two seasonal walk-up windows opened in the ensuing years: the Ice Hut (201 Washington) and Family Scoops (320 Washington). In the fall of 2003, Jordan's arrived (121 Washington). They all peacefully coexisted. In 2005, however, Washington Street has become a rocky road for these frozen confection retailers. Ben & Jerry's (a division of Unilever) just opened at 405 Washington Street, halfway between Jordan's and Hobo's. And now, Cold Stone is quietly rolling in at 116 Washington.
 I can envision the boardroom discussion in Cold Stone's corporate offices: ''What Hoboken needs is another ice-cream shop. Oooh, here's a good spot; it's right across the street from an ice-cream shop. We'll move in the dead of winter and maybe no one will notice.''
 So, how does it all relate to Hoboken's economy? The town doesn't quite fit Springsteen's description of ''Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores; seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more.'' Hoboken is actually thriving, with an influx of luxury high-rise construction in the past several years. Hoboken's boomtown status has driven Washington Street storefront rents to exorbitant heights, tripling in many cases. 
 Some retailers have been forced to relocate far off the main drag (like the quirky gift shop Hand Made, which long resided at Cold Stone's new home). Others have simply folded. In their places come the inevitable chain stores, often the only ones that can afford the rent. I've only been in a Cold Stone Creamery once. I'd heard it was ''very entertaining,'' whatever that means. But everything was so expensive, I left without buying anything. Since then, talking with friends in different cities, different states, I've learned of the nearly viral spread of the Cold Stone brand. 
 Where does it end? With Cold Stone as the victor in a post-apocalyptic Ice-Cream War, shops on every corner? The eerie silence pierced by the haunting melody of mercenary Mister Softee trucks, scavenging the streets for undead soft-serve customers? Perhaps I exaggerate. But come on, fellas, there was another ice-cream shop right across the street. 
 That's just cold, Cold Stone. Stone cold.

 BODY:

ALOFT, by Chang-rae Lee. (Riverhead, $14.) Set in the newer developments and subdivisions of Long Island, Lee's third novel is an affecting tale of one man's disaffection with the American dream. Approaching his 60th birthday, Lee's affable, semiretired hero, Jerry Battle (descended from Battaglias), faces a series of family crises and is shadowed by the mental illness and early death of his Korean-American wife. Piloting a small plane aimlessly over the Long Island Sound is Jerry's only escape from life's complications. ''Lee has dreamed up an intricate, ingratiating character'' in this ''large-spirited American novel,'' A. O. Scott wrote in the Book Review.

NAME ALL THE ANIMALS: A Memoir, by Alison Smith. (Scribner, $13.) In 1984, when Smith was 15, her adored older brother was killed in a car accident. The author's graceful memoir captures her family's grief, the wavering of her faith and the rift this caused in a deeply religious home.

BUSH COUNTRY: How George W. Bush Became the First Great Leader of the 21st Century -- While Driving Liberals Insane, by John Podhoretz. (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.95.) In this punchy, passionate defense of the president, Podhoretz, a New York Post columnist, rejects the negative caricatures (of Bush as a puppet, a fanatic, a liar and so on) and argues that ''Bush's presidential qualities mark him as a genuine leader and a transformative figure on the American and world stages.'' Karen Hughes, Bush's former adviser, also answers the president's critics in her memoir, TEN MINUTES FROM NORMAL (Penguin, $15). Hughes, who left the White House in 2002, describes her upbringing, her professional life and her conflicts over the competing demands of work and family.

TRANSMISSION, by Hari Kunzru. (Plume, $14.) After leaving his native India for America, Arjun Mehta, a shy young computer programmer and the protagonist of this fast-paced novel, discovers that the jobs he wants are heading east on a wave of outsourcing. Thwarted at work (and in love) in his new country, he concocts a disastrous scheme: launch a killer computer virus and become a hero by ultimately stopping it. Kunzru, named one of the best young British novelists by Granta magazine, ''is as up-to-date as writers come, with interests in technology, pop culture and the economics of globalization,'' Walter Kirn wrote in the Book Review.

FOOLS RUSH IN: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner, by Nina Munk. (HarperBusiness, $14.95.) Munk, a contributing editor for Vanity Fair, recounts the catastrophic merger of America Online and Time Warner -- which involved some $200 billion in shareholder losses -- and heaps much of the blame for its failure on the companies' willful chairmen.

THE CALLIGRAPHER, by Edward Docx. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) Docx mixes the art of calligraphy and the metaphysical poetry of John Donne in this stylishly clever debut novel. Jasper Jackson, a British cad eking out a living as a calligrapher, is working on a commission to transcribe love poems by Donne when he himself falls madly in love. As the tale unfolds, each chapter is simultaneously a new episode in Jasper's complicated romance and an explication of the poem he's rendering.

THE FABRIC OF THE COSMOS: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality, by Brian Greene. (Vintage, $15.95.) Greene, whose 1999 book, ''The Elegant Universe,'' outlined the case for string theory, is adept at popularizing even the most arcane principles of abstract science. The irreconcilable differences between the cornerstones of theoretical physics -- the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics -- aren't easily understood, but here the author ably presents the latest astronomical data to help us make sense of them. Our reviewer, Roger G. Newton, said Greene ''discusses all these matters with a knack for presenting things difficult to visualize or intuit, aided by colorful and persuasive metaphors.''

THE BEST AWFUL, by Carrie Fisher. (Simon & Schuster, $13.) This novel, a sequel to ''Postcards From the Edge,'' picks up the story of Suzanne Vale, a manic, fading Hollywood star, who gives up her medication and takes off on a drug misadventure to Mexico. (She ultimately pulls herself together in a mental hospital.) In The Times, Janet Maslin called this partly autobiographical tale ''amusingly snarky.'' Ihsan Taylor

HEADLINE: Worker Shortages May Lead to Enticements

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT needs nurses, teachers and technology specialists. For a decade, the state has been encouraging public school students as young as 5 years old to work in fields that have worker shortages, particularly health care.
 But the state's economy continues to change; manufacturing jobs have disappeared and Connecticut's reputation as the insurance capital of the world is increasingly shaky.
 Lawmakers want students to stay in the state and fill jobs where there are worker shortages. Now, they're considering enticements. 
 Gov. M. Jodi Rell and at least one state senator have proposed bills this year to help college students pay for their education in return for their commitment to take certain jobs within the state. 
 These new programs would join a handful of others that the state already offers to reward students who choose careers in shortage areas, including a scholarship program for young people studying science and technology.
 With a projected budget deficit of more than $1 billion looming, the bills may not be passed this year, but some say they are a harbinger of things to come.
 ''In order for Connecticut to compete in the world market we have to compete in the knowledge-based economy,'' said Roberta B. Willis, a Democrat from Lakeville who is co-chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Higher Education and Employment Advancement. ''I think that's why there's pressure to have incentives in these fields.''
 Ms. Willis's committee is looking at two bills this year that funnel state money to students who agree to work in specific fields. One, proposed by State Sen. John A. Kissel, a Republican from Enfield, would give nursing students a four-year tuition rebate if they attended nursing school in Connecticut and agreed to work in the state for four years thereafter. The proposal was not fully fleshed out; the bill does not discuss how to administer the money nor does it address the fiscal impact to the state.
 ''This is just a conceptual notion,'' Mr. Kissel said in an interview on Tuesday. ''All of the provisions would be subject to negotiation.''
 The concept of the bill -- to use taxpayer money to give students extra economic incentives to study certain fields -- is new, he said, but the state already has scholarship programs to help underserved students pay for their education.
 ''Why couldn't we maybe fine-tune that to incentive certain careers?'' he said. ''The rewards need to be tied to the goals the state wants to achieve.''
 In a 2002 report, the state's Health Resources and Services Administration projected a 55 percent shortage of nurses by 2020. 
 But Dr. Laura Cox Dzurec, dean of the University of Connecticut School of Nursing, said the nursing shortage has not been spurred by a lack of interest among students. UConn's enrollment has steadily increased over the last few years. Three years ago the school graduated just 55 students, she said. But this year there are 84 seniors, as well as 159 juniors and 181 sophomores. The problem, Dr. Dzurec said, is that too many nurses are retiring just as American baby boomers begin to need their services. And there isn't enough space for all of the students that want to study in the field, she said.
 ''I can safely say every school in the state is at or above capacity,'' Dr. Dzurec said. 
 The shortage, she said, is in the number of nursing teachers, an obstacle to any increase in enrollment. 
 Mr. Kissel said the bill could be amended to address the need for more nursing teachers. He said the kind of advice that Dr. Dzurec can give legislators is important and he hopes there will be public hearings on his incentives program. The committee, however, did not choose to send the bill to lawyers for drafting, so it is not likely to receive a hearing this year.
 Another bill, however, also addresses the need to plug shortages in the workforce. Under a bill the governor has proposed, the state would set aside $3 million over the next two years to give students in nursing, information technology and certain teachers up to $10,000 over five years to pay off student loans. The students would be expected to work in those fields.
 Education and information technology (many computer-related occupations) were also identified as shortage areas in strategic plan of the state's Career Ladder Advisory Committee. The advisory committee identified loan forgiveness and tuition assistance programs as possible solutions to these shortages.
 ''In order to begin addressing these gaps and ensure the future growth of the economy, the governor proposed this loan forgiveness program,'' said Dennis Schain, spokesman for the governor.
 Ms. Willis said she had concerns about passing the governor's bill at a time when the state doesn't have much money to spend on new programs. She said she would rather the state targeted taxpayer money this year to need-based financial aid programs rather than incentive programs.
 ''If I had to choose between loan forgiveness and giving up-front financial aid to go to school,'' she said, ''it would be up-front financial aid.''

HEADLINE: Rising Oil Prices Leave Stock Indexes in the Red

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Rising oil prices and climbing bond yields set back the stock market last week. All three major stock indexes lost ground, and they ended the week in negative territory for the year. 
 The main culprit was the jump in the price of crude oil, which on Wednesday briefly matched its record high of $55.65 a barrel in futures trading in New York. The surging oil price had repercussions in the bond market, where concerns mounted over inflation in the broader economy. Prices fell and yields rose. The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note moved up to 4.54 percent by Friday, from 4.31 percent the previous week, for the biggest weekly jump since May.
 In the stock market, financial companies were big losers. Among them was, J.P. Morgan Chase, which fell 3.7 percent for the week. Delta Air Lines, which said it has having cash-flow problems, fell 14 percent for the week, among the biggest declines in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 166.19 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,774.36. The S.& P. 500 shed 22.04 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at 1,200.08. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 29.01 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,041.60. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Iran Dismisses Economic Offer From the U.S.

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, March 12 

 BODY:
Iran reacted testily on Saturday to a statement from the United States offering modest economic incentives if it permanently ended the enrichment of uranium, saying that it would not give up its right to nuclear power.
 ''The Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, and no pressure, bribe or threat can make Iran give up its legitimate right,'' said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamidreza Assefi, in a statement carried on the ministry's Web site.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced on Friday that the United States was shifting to a somewhat more conciliatory approach on Iran, offering to back limited economic incentives if Iran agrees to a series of steps that would permanently give up any opportunity to building nuclear arms. 
 Europe's leading nations also warned that if Iran did not give up the program, they would have ''no choice'' but to seek punishment at the United Nations Security Council. Iran's defense minister, Ali Shamkhani, dismissed the warning. The ISNA news agency quoted him saying, ''We are ready to confront any threats, and protecting our nuclear installations is part of this equation.'' 
 Mr. Assefi's statement said that the American offer could not keep Iran from ''its legitimate rights,'' apparently a reference to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iran signed. But the statement did not make an explicit reference to enrichment, perhaps leaving open the possibility of negotiations over Europe's offer to supply Iran with the fuel. That would mean Iran would be able to power its nuclear plants without having to enrich uranium itself. Highly enriched uranium can be used for bomb fuel.
 The Iranians seemed unimpressed by the two major incentives offered by the United States: dropping objections to Iran's effort to enter the World Trade Organization and allowing Iran to buy spare parts for commercial aircraft. 
 ''The restriction on spare parts that were of no military use should have not been imposed from the beginning, and lifting them is not an incentive,'' Mr. Assefi said.

HEADLINE: Softer Words For Harder Times?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
IS Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, trying to send a reassuring message on the nation's record current-account deficit?
 A close comparison of two speeches -- one he made on Thursday to the Council on Foreign Relations and one on Nov. 19 at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt -- suggests that he is. 
 The current-account deficit -- the gap in the trade of goods and services that the United States has with the rest of the world -- is a threat because it has to be financed with money from abroad. If the world became less willing to finance that deficit, the dollar would fall and interest rates in the United States would rise. 
 The current-account deficit for the fourth quarter, which will be reported Wednesday, is expected to be $182.8 billion, according to Bloomberg News. For the year, that would make the deficit a record $659 billion, up 24 percent over 2003. 
 Mr. Greenspan's speech in November, which followed comments from other Fed officials about the threat of the growing current-account deficit, seemed to put the central bank's official stamp of concern on the issue, focusing the market's attention on it. From then until the end of the year, the dollar fell 4.4 percent against the euro.
 Mr. Greenspan's comments were direct -- for someone who customarily speaks in a syntax so complex that it is open to more than one interpretation. He said that sooner or later, foreigners would reduce their appetite for dollars and dollar-denominated securities. That, he said, would make the financing of the current-account deficit more difficult.
 ''This situation,'' he said in November, ''suggests that international investors will eventually adjust their accumulation of dollar assets or, alternatively, seek higher dollar returns to offset concentration risk, elevating the cost of financing of the U.S. current account deficit and rendering it increasingly less tenable.''
 His most reassuring comment about the problem then was: ''The marked increase in the economic flexibility of the American economy that has developed in recent years suggests that market forces should over time restore, without crises, a sustainable U.S. balance of payments.''
 On Thursday, Mr. Greenspan said again that foreigners ''will at some point'' reduce their dollar holdings. But he was much more upbeat about resolving the problem, saying, ''the resolution of our current account deficit and household debt burdens does not strike me as overly worrisome.''
 The dollar's fall on Friday may suggest that traders want more than Mr. Greenspan's reassurance.

OPEC WATCH The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets this week, but don't hope for any price relief. James R. Steel, New York research director for Refco, said a little more oil might trickle out because of the high price: $54.55 a barrel on Friday. ''Officially, they will not increase production,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tilting Toward the Right

BYLINE: By JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: MOUNTAINSIDE 

 BODY:
YOU could call a fight for the hearts and minds of the far right in New Jersey -- a state that voted convincingly for John Kerry last November -- something of a Pyrrhic victory.
 So consider Bret Schundler's quandary as he tries to persuade Republicans that he is the best candidate to take on the person widely considered to be the most popular politician in the state, Senator Jon S. Corzine.
 Anti-abortion advocates around the nation adopted Mr. Schundler's conservative cause when he won the Republican nomination for governor in 2001 and, according to a statement from a prominent anti-abortion group, his eventual defeat to James E. McGreevey in the general election was a ''big disappointment.''
 But this year, with Mr. Schundler, a former mayor of Jersey City, once again trying to capture his party's nomination, that same group is placing its bets on a different horse -- and a long shot at best -- Steve Lonegan of Bogota. 
 ''We appreciate your heartfelt, truly pro-life stand,'' reads an endorsement letter from the Republican National Coalition for Life.
 The letter, which accompanied a check for $500 for the Lonegan campaign, went on to wish the outspoken and sometimes outlandish Mr. Lonegan luck and expresses eagerness to work with him in the future ''to protect the inherent natural right to life of every innocent American, born and unborn.''
 Mr. Lonegan, whose greatest political achievement to this point has been his election as mayor of the Bogota -- a Bergen County town with a population of just over 8,000 -- has hardly been catapulted to front-runner status by virtue of the endorsements he is collecting support from anti-abortion, pro-gun and small-government conservatives. But it is an interesting indication nonetheless that the battle for support from the strongly conservative voters -- who decided the last gubernatorial primary -- has been joined.
 The heavyweight, by virtue of his statewide campaign against Mr. McGreevey is still Mr. Schundler -- even though he was soundly defeated by a margin of 14 percent in the 2001 general election.
 Early polls show that this year's Republican primary appears to be emerging as a showdown between the two best-known candidates -- Mr. Schundler and Douglas Forrester -- for the right to run against Mr. Corzine -- the man with the seemingly bottomless war chest. 
 In an echo of 2001, when the party rallied unsuccessfully around Representative Bob Franks -- a moderate and well-liked candidate -- over the more charismatic but ideologically polarizing Schundler candidacy, much of the early organizational support is going to Mr. Forrester. But with his new, more focused message on lowering property taxes -- the highest in the nation -- and restricting the growth of state government, Mr. Schundler is confident that a conservative base of support will be there for him again.
 ''I think I will have that base,'' Mr. Schundler said in an interview in his near-empty campaign office in Mountainside. 
 If that turns out to be the case, it will be no small thing. This is especially true in the context of the current weakness of the Republican organization, which has no clear leader, controls no branches of state government and seems to have a diminishing ability to deliver support for its chosen candidates. 
 For those reasons, the conservative voting block could easily decide a primary featuring seven candidates with messages that frequently overlap. Mr. Schundler and Mr. Forrester, who was the unsuccessful Republican candidate in the 2002 United States Senate race, enjoy advantages in name recognition, but several other candidates have managed to attract at least limited support from geographical or ideological splinter groups.
 As a result, some of the state's prominent conservative leaders are already predicting that the primary will again be decided not by organizational support, but by highly motivated conservative voters at the grass-roots level. 
 ''Last time, the establishment went with one candidate and Main Street went with another,'' said Assemblyman Guy R. Gregg, leader of the Republican Conference and self-described conservative ideologue who endorsed Mr. Schundler in 2001. ''That isn't totally lost on the field this time. I think the candidate that can be the strongest in the grass roots still probably will prevail.'' 
 But with seven candidates competing for the Republican nomination, and three months still remaining before the vote on June 7, there are bound to be a number of wrinkles.
 One of them, it is increasingly clear, is that there is a vigorous contest-within-the-contest for support among the crucial block of conservative voters that put Mr. Schundler over the top last time. 
 Enter Mr. Lonegan, the bombastic, headline-grabbing mayor of Bogota who bears a passing resemblance to the comic book villain Dr. Octopus, and who has apparently attracted attention, if not actual support, from some of the conservative groups that stand to play a crucial role in the election. 
 If nothing else, Mr. Lonegan seems determined to mar Mr. Schundler's careful makeover as a non-polarizing advocate of tax relief, and to capitalize on his opponent's outward moderation by grabbing for the support of staunchly conservative voters.
 ''Bret, because he's shellshocked from his last loss, he's afraid to talk about his vision for the state -- he's afraid to say we need to cut the size of state government,'' Mr. Lonegan said in a recent interview. ''I'm the only candidate who's still willing to talk about the issues that these people care very deeply about. I'll just say it. If you're looking for free abortions, I'm not the candidate for you. If you're looking for lower taxes and smaller government, I'm your man.''
 True to form, Mr. Lonegan called Mr. Schundler's centerpiece proposals to limit government growth an ''income redistribution scheme'' and ''these fancy amendments that would create a huge central state government where local mayors like myself would have to crawl to Trenton on bended knee.'' 
 Although he is still unknown to the average voter -- indeed, some of the most recent public opinion polls show Mr. Lonegan's support almost too small to measure -- he has gained the endorsements of several influential groups and individuals in conservative circles, including the powerful anti-abortion group headed by Phyllis Schlafly, leaders of the gun rights group Second Amendment Sisters and Murray Sabrin, a conservative economics professor who is currently teaching at Ramapo College.
 ''I think if the people who care deeply about being pro-life or pro-Second Amendment see Lonegan as carrying the mantle on those issues, they'll come out to vote for him,'' said Mr. Sabrin, whose Senate candidacy in 2000 was endorsed by conservative groups across the country, and who is backing Mr. Lonegan this time. ''And they're a pretty big block in the Republican primary.''

Tentativeness in the Mainstream
 While the conservative bloodletting unfolds, much of the New Jersey's Republican firmament is watching from the sideline with a growing tentativeness. 
 Paulette DeKorte Ramsey, a member of the Franklin Lakes Town Council and a veteran of Republican politics, said that she was still trying to decide whom to support, and that personal ethics would weigh heavily in her decision.
 But, Ms. Ramsey added: ''I do think that New Jersey does not really want a very conservative candidate. The candidate has to be more open-minded and moderate. I do like Schundler, but I do think you have to be more moderate to win in the state.'' 
 One Republican who would be perfectly happy to stoke the party's innate fears of another electoral debacle is Mr. Forrester, who has made his perceived electability a major selling point. Mr. Forrester, who had pulled ahead of the incumbent, Senator Robert G. Torricelli, in the 2002 race before losing to his 11th-hour replacement, Frank Lautenberg, frequently points to that campaign as evidence and -- taking some liberties -- asserts that he has ''already won statewide.''
 To emphasize Mr. Schundler's vulnerability, Steven Berlin, Mr. Forrester's campaign manager, says: ''There's a great deal of concern based in what happened in 2001 with Schundler. We're hearing overwhelming concern. This is clearly a race between us and Bret, and there are a lot of people in the party who would prefer Forrester to lead the ticket because they know he can win statewide.''
 It will soon become known whether those murmurs of concern about nominating someone who is too conservative will turn into full-blown opposition as officials from several crucial Republican counties convene in the coming days to determine their support.
 Although organizational support at the county level is less crucial in the Republican primary than on the Democratic side, it does determine which candidates receive the favorable placement on the ballot. And in a seven-person scrum, that sort of organizational backing could be more meaningful than usual, since it is entire conceivable -- indeed likely -- that someone could win the contest with fewer than half the votes cast. 
 If that support is split along geographical and other lines -- Freeholder John Murphy, for example, has picked up solid support from Republican officials in his home county, Morris -- it could add an element of volatility. 
 ''I think that what your really talking about is motivated voters,'' said Ingrid Reed, a director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers. ''In New Jersey, at least, a very narrow group of voters -- those who really care about being affiliated with a party -- have decided primaries. If you look at the numbers, you're talking about a relatively small segment of the voting population.''

A 'Complicated Primary'
 As Ms. Reed put it: ''With the field the way it is right now, I don't think it's possible to tell what's going to happen. This is just an amazingly complicated primary.''
 Considering that Mr. Schundler is involved in such a potentially chaotic race, he presents a remarkably calm face these days, and certainly not that of a wide-eyed reactionary that he has been made out to be. When he discusses the campaign, he comes across less as a politician than as an academic -- although one who is fully aware that he is espousing a somewhat eccentric thesis.
 ''The specific mechanics of the amendments have overwhelming public support,'' he said, explaining the proposals he intends to make the centerpiece of his campaign, and which he intends to disseminate to the public through a statewide e-mail petition drive. ''The amendments would slow the growth of state government and send a lot more of people's tax money back to their local government.''
 In particular, Mr. Schundler has written two resolutions -- currently before the Assembly -- that call for putting constitutional amendments on the November ballot aimed at prohibiting sharp spending increases in Trenton by restricting budget growth to about 130 percent of the previous year's expenditures. Mr. Schundler often cites numbers showing that New Jersey's spending has grown over the past three years at several times the national average.
 His notion is that for all the fund-raising scandals and ethical lapses of Trenton in recent years, the single most pressing issue is going to be New Jersey's high property taxes, which he blames on runaway spending. And who, after all, wants high taxes?
 ''You really have an issue here where I'm trying to draw a line where 100 percent of the people are on my side of the line, and the only people on the other side of the line are the Democratic bosses,'' Mr. Schundler said. ''I think the party will be unified behind me by June.''
 He explained that what his plan would amount to, tactically speaking, is a way of achieving the conservative goal of shrinking government without allowing opponents to paint him as a right-wing zealot.
 ''I made a mistake last time,'' he said. ''I allowed myself to be painted in a certain way. The facts were in dispute. What I'm trying to do this time is to address the single biggest problem everyone is talking about and that everyone can agree on -- property taxes and the growth of state government -- and draw a line where 100 percent of the people are on my side. No one would be against it.''
 Mr. Schundler said that he had learned from his past electoral mistakes. ''I'm running a very different kind of campaign now,'' he said, explaining that his focus on specific ideas would insulate him from the well-financed and inevitable personal attacks from the Democratic opposition.

Schundler's Take on Forrester
 ''I made the same error in 2001 that Doug Forrester is making right now, and it's a big error,'' Mr. Schundler explained. ''Back in 2001 I basically said, 'Look at my record, look at Jim McGreevey's record, I would be the better governor who would be able to control spending and give money back to our local governments and school districts.' He basically said he had the exact same platform as me -- don't raise taxes control state spending. Now, I had a record that was consistent with those commitments, he did not. However, he had 10 times as much money for television as I did -- and I realize now that when you run a campaign about what may be disputable facts, whoever has more money for television wins the argument. I'm not making that mistake again.''
 By contrast, he predicted that Mr. Forrester, a wealthy businessman from West Windsor who is affluent enough to finance his own campaign, was setting himself up for defeat against Mr. Corzine, whose personal fortune is estimated at several hundred millions dollars.
 ''If you look at what Doug's doing right now, he's saying, 'I'm honest and my opponent's corrupt,''' Mr. Schundler said. ''Jon Corzine's going to say with 10 times as much money that he's honest and Doug Forrester is corrupt -- and it's a disputable fact -- and Jon Corzine's money is going to win that argument.''
 As for the pesky Mr. Lonegan and his niche support among certain conservatives, Mr. Schundler said that he was not keeping track of endorsements, and that he had not publicized his own support for fear of taking attention from his property tax proposals.
 He also suggested that Mr. Lonegan's message was not a serious alternative to his own, and represented an approach that was, in a way, not conservative enough. 
 As he explained it: ''Lonegan is saying that I, Steve Lonegan, will cut everything under the sun. He says, 'I'm going to get the fiscal house in order.' What happens if a Democrat comes back in office, or a Republican who can't control state spending? It's a short-term solution.'' 
 ''The bottom line,'' Mr. Schundler added, ''is almost everything he's proposing is stuff that I've proposed -- but he's doing less.''

HEADLINE: The Quality Cure?

BYLINE: By Roger Lowenstein. 
Roger Lowenstein is a contributing writer. His last article for the magazine was about Social Security.

 BODY:
David Cutler hit what seemed to be the peak of his career at 28, when as a junior faculty member at Harvard he was whisked down to Washington to help draft a health-care bill under the tutelage of Ira Magaziner and, of course, Hillary Clinton. The project produced a dispiriting result: nothing.
 Corporations, consumers, the uninsured and doctors had all been clamoring for reform, and the question of why the project failed has nagged at Cutler ever since, especially as the problems have continued to worsen. In the years since he left Washington, which was in 1994, the ranks of the uninsured have surged, from 35 million people to 45 million. There are also serious gaps in the quality of care, and there is a deep dissatisfaction with the way the system functions -- in how it seems to make adversaries of patients, doctors and insurers, for instance. Arguably, Americans want health-care reform more urgently than anything else. 
 Yet designing a national health-care policy has become a kind of taboo. Congress provided prescription drugs for seniors, and President Bush, not normally thought of as timid, has backed some modest initiatives: legislation to limit malpractice suits, individual health savings accounts. But Washington has done nothing on the scale that a social engineer -- a Robert Moses or a Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- might to reinvent the system. Cutler has thought about this ever since his failed experience in Washington, and his diagnosis has shaken up the health-care-policy world. ''The real reason health-care reform has not succeeded,'' he has written, ''is that it is rooted in a misconception of what health-care reform should accomplish.''
 Virtually every would-be reformer, Democrat and Republican alike, starts with the presumption that the major problem in health care is high costs. This is understandable: America now spends 15 percent of its gross domestic product on health care. That's a higher percentage than any country has ever spent in the history of the planet, and the figure is increasing. The United States spends more on health care than on automobiles; we spend more on health care than China spends on tea; in fact, as Cutler likes to point out, we spend more on health than the Chinese spend, per capita, on everything. And health care threatens (far more than Social Security) to consume the federal government. Medicare, the health-care program for retirees, and Medicaid, which provides basic services for the poor, already account for one-fifth of the federal budget, and their share could double in a generation. 
 Curbing such growth has been the aim of every reformer, and according to Cutler, it is the reason reform has failed. The Clinton team proposed to pay for universal coverage by limiting increases in spending (partly through mandatory caps). But limiting spending also meant limiting service. The proposed legislation was never put to a vote.
 Managed care was next at trying to contain costs. It succeeded for a while, until it became clear that Americans did not want health-maintenance organizations to limit their choices any more than they wanted the government to. Since then, reform has languished. The Medicare drug bill is suggestive of why. The Republican Congress promised restraint but then passed a hugely expensive law that barred Medicare from using its clout to negotiate prices with drug companies. The pattern has been failed efforts to control costs, followed by a void of new ideas.
 Cutler's approach is radically different. He says that most health-care spending is actually good. Spending has been rising, he says, because it delivers positive, and measurable, economic value, and because it can do more things that Americans want. Therefore, Cutler says, we should focus on improving the quality of care rather than on reducing our consumption of it. Rather than pay less, he wants to pay more wisely -- to encourage health-care providers to do more of what they should and less of what is wasteful. 
This, as it turns out, is exactly what some of the most innovative health-plan sponsors -- from Kaiser Permanente to General Electric -- are doing. To them, the Cutler approach of focusing on quality offers a way out of the void and possibly, over the longer term, an acceptable route to restraining costs.
 To understand how Cutler has upended conventional thinking, you first have to understand the political straitjacket in which health care has found itself. Health care ''lefties,'' as Cutler refers to some of his colleagues, favor a European system -- universal insurance financed by a single payer (the government) and some sort of rationing to hold down the screaming increase in high-tech procedures. Canada rations by limiting access: Ontario, with one-third the population of California, has one-tenth the number of open-heart-surgery facilities. 
 While Cutler acknowledges the merits of such an approach, he also sees its problems. The British may be accustomed to waiting for hip replacements, but Americans do not like rationing. Also, systems with just one payer do not encourage innovation and experimentation. Imagine America if everyone were on Medicare. Doctors and hospitals would do whatever Medicare approved and nothing more. 
 Right-wingers go for a market approach -- it's not the technology they object to, but people's cheap access to it. If people paid for their own angioplasties, so the theory goes, they would have fewer of them. This is the theory behind Bush's health savings accounts, initiated during his first term: let people buy insurance from their own (tax-sheltered) pockets. 
 Apart from the obvious objection that low-income people find it hard to save for those accounts, Cutler points out another shortcoming: Most of the dollars spent on health care are spent on people with serious illnesses or conditions. Those with coverage quickly move into the territory covered by insurance. Few people really pay for their own angioplasties, so few care what they cost. 
 Moreover, it's not clear that we want people to be too price-sensitive, especially people with chronic conditions, lest they try to starve themselves of care. ''My grandmother used to say, 'Why should I take the blue pill -- I'm feeling better,''' Cutler recounts. ''The blue pill was why she was feeling better.'' As Cutler told me in the first of our many conversations, ''Ultimately, every discussion of health care turns personal.'' 
 A tweedy, self-effacing 39-year-old, Cutler is a seriously modified lefty. He envisions a system in which everyone could get insurance while free-market incentives would motivate health-care providers to be more effective as well as more efficient. Instead of suppressing the market by rationing care, restraining prices or regulating doctors, he wants to liberate it. It is neither Clinton nor Bush -- but closer to Bill Bradley, whose 2000 campaign Cutler advised. Dr. Robert Galvin, head of global health care at General Electric, says, ''David has showed everyone that the way to rein in costs is not to squash innovation.'' 
 The soft-spoken Cutler was a star even as a Harvard undergraduate, when he assisted an up-and-coming economics professor named Larry Summers. Finance -- not health care -- was the hot field among economists, but as a graduate student, Cutler wrote a still cited dissertation on how changes in Medicare's compensation scheme caused hospitals to release patients after shorter stays. It proved, Cutler says, that doctors were incredibly and, in some cases, ''horribly,'' responsive to incentives. 
 Hired onto the economics faculty at Harvard, he was urged by Summers to continue in health care. After his stint in Washington, Cutler continued to think of ways of rationing care until, at lunch one day, an economist named Zvi Griliches asked him, ''Why is it you think I get too much health care?'' He said it in a thick Polish accent -- ''Vy is it?'' Cutler immediately saw his point. He was looking at the wrong side of the ledger; instead of worrying about the cost of health care, he should think about the benefits.
 This sounds obvious, but almost no one was looking at it this way. Thinking of people he knew -- ''all health care is personal'' -- Cutler wondered if Americans might be spending more because they were getting more and better treatment. Joining with Dr. Mark McClellan, another economist, he zeroed in on heart disease. The pair discovered a curious fact: heart attacks were occurring less frequently, thanks to drugs for treating high blood pressure and to reductions in smoking, but spending on heart attacks was rising. Surgery rates -- $25,000 for an angioplasty, $40,000 for a bypass -- had been relatively stable. But as the technology improved, the operation was being performed far more often. Was that an example of waste?
 Looking at the data, they discovered that, on average, heart attack victims were surviving eight months longer than in the 1980's. In economic terms, they argued, the increased spending was ''worth it.'' Subsequently, Cutler concluded that a 45-year-old American could expect to spend $30,000 over the course of his life on all forms of cardiac care and that, thanks to improvements in cardiac technology alone, he could expect to live three years longer. That worked out to $10,000 a year of added life. Cutler can rattle off figures to prove that Americans value life even more. (Air bags cost something like $100,000 per year of life saved, for instance.) But you don't need to be an economist to believe that $30,000 for three extra years is a pretty good deal. 
 McClellan now runs Medicare, where he is experimenting with paying doctors for better results -- a Cutler-like departure from the old policy of simply trying to restrain costs. But it is Cutler, now the dean of social sciences at Harvard College, who has plainly broken from the health-care establishment. In a book published last year, ''Your Money or Your Life,'' Cutler summarized his research as follows: ''The evidence shows clearly that spending more has been good; we get a lot more out of the medical system than we put in.'' 
 The book won praise from The New England Journal of Medicine and other publications. ''It's good to see in Cutler's study an analysis of some of what has gone right,'' a reviewer in The Los Angeles Times commented.
 Critics responded that good health care could be much less expensive. Canada spends only 10 percent of its G.D.P. on health care, but according to common yardsticks like longevity and infant mortality, Canadians are just as healthy. Dr. John Wennberg, a health-care expert at Dartmouth, and his colleague Jonathan Skinner point out that some areas of the United States, like Boston and Miami, spend far more than others, like Minneapolis, without any noticeable improvement in mortality. This leads them to conclude that the additional spending is fruitless. 
 Ira Magaziner, who ran the Clinton effort, says that project was meant to eliminate just such redundancy and also to make a serious dent in administrative costs. ''There is a lot of waste you can take out of the system before you get to questions of rationing,'' he says. In any case, the Clinton plan's complexity, as well as the secretive style in which it was developed, probably did as much to torpedo it as rationing, which is what Cutler has focused on. 
 Cutler, who reads as many medical journals as economics ones, does not dispute that America buys more health care than it needs. He estimates that 20 percent of spending (such estimates are all over the map) is unnecessary, much of it for tests and specialist consultations. Indulgent Boston, for instance, has 1.7 times as many specialists per capita as frugal Minneapolis. But it is extremely difficult to weed out only the ''bad stuff,'' Cutler says. Oregon, he notes, tried to proscribe ''unnecessary'' procedures for Medicaid patients. It ended up relenting on almost everything.
 In any case, the idea that America could trim spending to Canadian levels is probably unrealistic. American doctors earn more than those in Canada. Our culture tolerates, even approves of, greater disparities in income; Congress is not likely to legislate a change. Canada also enjoys a ''free rider'' benefit. Drug makers earn a return on their investment in the United States, and so are willing to accept price caps in the smaller Canadian market. And since Canada has just one insurer (the government), its doctors spend less on administration. 
 However, health-care costs in Canada have increased at nearly the same rate as in the United States. In fact, spending growth in most developed nations -- regardless of how they finance and organize care -- has been moving ahead at similar rates. Since 1960, costs in six of the G-7 countries have risen, on average, by 4.9 percent a year. The rise in costs in the United States, at 5.1 percent annually, is close to the middle of the pack. Sherry Glied, of Columbia's School of Public Health, concludes that ''no particular characteristic of any health-care regime is the main determinant of growth in costs.'' Technology is.
 Critics of America's profligate ways fret about the relentless character of spending increases, and they have a point. Even when technologies lower costs, they increase spending by broadening the market. More people have gallbladders removed because laparoscopic surgery is less invasive. More people take medication for depression because the Prozac-era drugs have fewer side effects than earlier drugs. In fact, doctors diagnose depression more often. Better treatments lead to higher use. 
 Contrary to the fears of many on the left, higher prices are not the chief culprit. Thanks to continued pressure from H.M.O.'s, doctors' rates have been held in check. So have the prices of pharmaceuticals already on the market. But because new drugs are more expensive, and because people take more pills, total spending on drugs since 1990 has quadrupled.
 As Cutler says, medical spending isn't increasing because of inflation so much as because of people consuming more ''good stuff.'' This view is beginning to course through the health-care world. Scanning the literature, you now happen upon sentences like, ''We believe that some of the concern about the growth in spending may be misplaced'' (Health Affairs) and ''On average . . . society is better off exchanging more money for better health'' (The Journal of Economic Perspectives). No one disputes that spending will continue to increase; limiting the rate of growth is the most we can hope for.
 Since he reckons that most of what we get is beneficial, Cutler puts primary emphasis on improving the quality of care. ''Most of economics is about the cost of things,'' he notes. ''There has been little effort to figure out what the benefits are. That's often more difficult. How do you value clean air, lower crime or improved health?'' 
What Cutler has in mind is a twofold plan. First, he proposes a variant of the voucher system. Let the government finance people's -- everyone's -- health care, with tax credits to be spent on private providers or insurers. But vouchers would only broaden the system, not improve it. To accomplish the latter, Cutler wants insurers, both public and private, to redesign the way doctors and hospitals are compensated, to give them an incentive to compete on quality. 
 At first blush, this struck me as pretty naive -- the sort of mushy academic theory that could lead, ultimately, to higher bills. Cutler's former mentor Summers, now Harvard's president, shares that skepticism. How, after all, do you measure performance in health care? It turns out that there are lots of ways. 
 People (like me) often assume that the American system, while expensive, is about as effective as possible. That turns out to be wrong. People are prescribed pills for hypertension and don't take them. Diabetics are supposed to monitor their blood sugar and don't. According to a study by the RAND Corporation, people get only 55 percent of the care recommended for them. Doctors themselves are surprisingly inconsistent. Alarmingly, many heart attack patients do not receive beta blockers, inexpensive pills that significantly reduce mortality.
 Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician obsessed with the shortcomings in health-care quality, has shown that it is possible to improve care rather significantly. Berwick, who runs the Cambridge-based Institute for Healthcare, teamed with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for a trial in which six hospitals and one H.M.O. focused on improving overall performance. The results were stunning. Tallahassee Memorial Hospital reduced mortality after heart attacks from 12 percent to 6 percent in two years. It also lowered mortality for strokes by 41 percent and for pneumonia by 32 percent. The improved cardiac performance was a result of systematically administering beta blockers and aspirin, making sure EKG's arrived promptly and prodding the emergency-room doctor and the cardiologist to be in closer touch. These procedures ''were being done'' before the project began, says Winnie Schmeling, an administrator at Tallahassee Memorial. ''They just weren't being done every time.''
 According to Berwick, Tallahassee's experience is common. ''Hospitals are out to save lives, but they won't necessarily track survival rates, or compare themselves to others, or think about what they could be doing better,'' he says.
 There is an aphorism for such behavior in the business world: ''You manage what you measure.'' If doctors measure how long it takes to deliver an EKG, then EKG's are delivered faster. 
 America's fee-for-service system does not require doctors to measure. It rewards them for each instance of delivered ''care,'' Cutler notes, but not necessarily for the end result -- for ''health.'' This is especially true for chronic patients, whose well-being depends on following a long-term regimen of care. Diabetics, for instance, should receive yearly eye exams, regularly monitor blood sugar and cholesterol and take other steps to avoid problematic (and expensive) complications. ''Doctors say, 'You really should get your eyes examined,''' Cutler notes. ''There is no follow-up. Every doctor you talk to says: 'I know we don't do a good job on that. We don't get paid for it.' My way, we would pay them.''
 How would ''paying for performance'' work? In the late 90's, HealthPartners, a not-for-profit health plan in Minneapolis with 630,000 members, instituted a bonus system to providers. It paid doctors extra if their diabetic patients got blood sugar and cholesterol below certain levels, ceased smoking and took aspirin daily. In 1996, 5 percent of patients met all criteria. By 2003, 17 percent did. Similar gains were registered with heart patients. ''These clinics are trying to provide quality care,'' says Dr. George Isham, the plan's medical director. ''What we're doing is putting a measurement on it.'' In 2003, the plan awarded a total of $9 million to doctors on merit. But was it worth it? 
 At Isham's request, Cutler and a team of colleagues analyzed the economic payoff. They found that the program reaped huge rewards. It cost $330 a patient and was expected to save roughly $30,000 over each patient's life. While the analysis is not precise, Cutler wrote, it ''illustrates a general point that professionals in health care have known intuitively for some time: . . . comprehensive disease-management programs are clearly worth the investment.'' 
 The rub is that the investment was only marginally worth it for HealthPartners. The gains went to the patients, in the form of better health, and to their employers, who were expected to suffer less absenteeism. HealthPartners did recoup some of its investment, as members were hospitalized less frequently. But some of those people would change jobs and change insurers, so the benefits were largely reaped by someone else. Ultimately, as patients retire, they will be reaped by Medicare.
 This ''exemplifies some of the problems inherent in our current system,'' Cutler wrote. A program with huge benefits for society (and for patients) offered only a marginal incentive to the health plan to create it. HealthPartners did not have the option of simply raising its rates, because healthy patients would have departed for a cheaper plan. This is why closed-loop systems -- systems in which patients made healthy don't leave -- tend to work best. 
Kaiser Permanente, the huge health plan based in California, is something of an example. Both insurer and provider, Kaiser pays its doctors a fixed salary regardless of how much (or little) they do. Its doctors also receive a bonus tied to measures of performance. The theory is that its integrated approach will pay off both in terms of patients' health and economically. So far, the approach has shown significant improvement in health and after some missteps has been able to stay competitive (though it is hardly cheap). Other major health plans in the state recently agreed to a similar system of quality bonuses, so California could become something of a closed loop. 
 General Electric is another intriguing case. Despite its supposed fervor for quality, until recently G.E. had been shelling out more than $2 billion a year in health coverage without regard to the quality of care. Robert Galvin set out to change that. In 2000, G.E. and several other companies began a program to reward doctors in certain cities on the basis of quality. Specifically, the companies split with doctors the savings that flowed from better care of diabetes and heart disease. According to G.E., the average cost of caring for diabetics who are properly treated drops by $350 a year, even before factoring in the cost of the long-term complications of leaving the disease untreated. Maybe pay-for-performance won't work for an earache, Galvin allows, ''but we have found a business case for diabetes.'' Clinician groups that hit their quality targets can earn up to $20,000 a year.
 Predictably, G.E. started with two conditions -- diabetes and heart disease -- that afflict large numbers and for which care guidelines are well established. G.E.'s next experiment was less predictable. Cutler and others (including President Bush) have been pushing the health industry to invest in computers. Many doctors still write prescriptions and keep records manually, and Cutler says that digitizing the health-care system would save considerable administrative expense and improve quality. It would minimize prescription errors, speed paperwork and make a patient's medical history portable. But the big kick is what information technology could do for the doctor's understanding of his own performance.
 Most doctors' offices have no idea, say, what the average blood pressure is of their patients being treated for heart disease. In fact, most clinics could not tell you how many heart patients they have or how many have been prescribed a particular drug. Cutler envisions a medical world in which doctors routinely get readouts of their patients' blood-pressure levels, insulin, smoking rates -- the lot. This, of course, is how most of the business world already operates. So the G.E. program is paying doctors' offices up to $15,000 a year for investing in, and using, computers. G.E. and other companies have asked RAND to analyze the financial payoff, but in the meantime they decided to kick-start doctors, some of whom have reacted warily to any sort of proposed changes, into the digital age. 
If you look at why Americans are going to the doctor, it strengthens the economic case for performance goals. Half of the growth in spending is for chronic conditions like asthma, obesity and diabetes. With proper treatment, including preventive care, chronic patients require less intensive care and less hospitalization. In their case, particularly, Cutler argues, quality will pay.
 One criticism is that pay-for-performance still rewards doctors for doing something. It doesn't motivate them to cut waste -- to not do things. Another is that doctors could game the system, just as C.E.O.'s with performance bonuses can. Nonetheless, McClellan, the Medicare administrator and former Cutler collaborator, is taking a gamble that pay-for-performance will work. Medicare has started half a dozen pilot programs to test various incentives. In one, hospitals scoring in the top 10 percent in a set of quality measures for certain conditions will be given a 2 percent bonus. 
 Medicare is also testing incentives that reward doctors for savings. The American Medical Association is nervous about anything that smacks of encouraging doctors to withhold care (a battle it fought with H.M.O.'s in the 90's), but it appears to be willing to look at schemes that link pay to quality.
 Medicare hopes that by making providers think about both quality and efficiency, modern doctors might acquire some of the wisdom of those old-time family practitioners who, so we like to recall, had their patients' health uppermost in mind without losing all regard for their pocketbooks. ''Speaking as an economist,'' McClellan says, ''it's clear that doctors respond to incentives.''
 Cutler says that Medicare's willingness to experiment is hugely important. Private health plans do not have the clout to force a clinic to purchase software or adopt performance goals. But Medicare is so big that were it to adopt performance targets, it would force every doctor to adjust. ''Medicare could really jump-start'' pay-for-performance, Galvin says. Then H.M.O.'s would surely begin to mimic Medicare and adopt similar targets. 
 Reoriented to managing ''health'' rather than merely costs, H.M.O.'s might again become a useful part of the health-care landscape, Cutler says. Managing care, he says, was a necessary idea that went off the tracks as H.M.O.'s became remote, single-minded cost-control freaks. His models for the future are the progressive organizations (he calls them hippie places) like Kaiser that employ their own doctors, invest in computers and ''engage'' their patients. They manage quality as well as cost. 
 This does sound sort of pie-in-the-sky, but Kaiser and the other California health plans are already paying bonuses to doctors who score high on patient surveys. Just imagine: a doctor paid to make you feel better.
 Cutler says that the next step is for Medicare to go beyond trials and move from a fee-for-service model to, in part, pay-for-performance. ''If Medicare has to pay more to doctors -- which it will, given current projections -- don't raise fees across the board,'' he explains. ''Set up a bonus fund that goes to M.D.'s who follow guidelines or have the best measures of outcome.'' Similarly, Medicare could pay more for operations that are clearly indicated, less for procedures (or drugs) that seem discretionary. By such steps, Medicare would come to resemble a large, progressive H.M.O.
 All this would ease the way to Cutler's ultimate goal, which would be to abolish the distinction between Medicare and private plans. That America has a separate plan for seniors is an accident of history: it was a compromise adopted in the 60's when business and the American Medical Association lobbied to defeat universal coverage. Many corporations, however, are now quite eager for the government to resolve the mess. And the present hodgepodge system (or nonsystem) simply has no logic to support it. As former Senator Bob Kerrey testified in 2002, ''There are six main ways a resident of the United States can become eligible for insurance'': wait until he is 65, demonstrate that he is disabled, ''get blown up in a war,'' prove he is poor and ''promise to remain poor,'' work for the federal government or find a job with an employer who offers insurance. Those who fall through the cracks get only half as much care as people with insurance. 
 To make coverage universal, Cutler advocates a $6,000 credit for poor families (and less, on a sliding scale, for others, tapering off to a small credit for people earning $50,000 and up). The credits would be redeemable as a sort of health-insurance voucher. Significantly, Cutler would extend credits to everyone -- even to people who are covered now. Many employers, for competitive reasons, would still offer coverage, but access to care would no longer depend on either employment status or age. 
 Vouchers are a leap for a Democrat, but the idea is popular with conservatives. Bush has also proposed tax credits, though on a smaller scale and for only the uninsured. Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation prefers Cutler's universal model. Butler points out that the government already subsidizes people in corporate plans, who do not have to declare their employers' contributions as income. This is a huge break: it costs the United States Treasury more than the mortgage deduction. It is also distributed, illogically, only to people whose employers provide a subsidy. As Cutler declared in his book, ''Health insurance is not something that is made better by tying it to employment.'' Even the A.M.A. has come around and favors having the government finance universal access.
 Cutler's idea is to preserve the diversity of America's system while subsidizing people's access to it -- to let the G.E.'s and the HealthPartners of the world, and also the Mercks, continue to innovate. 
 Cutler says that under his scheme, the government might spend an additional $100 billion a year. Some of that would represent new spending for people who previously did not have insurance; some would represent a transfer to the government of costs now borne by others -- employers, or hospitals that provide charity care. That's a big number, but, to keep it in perspective, spending for Medicare and Medicaid currently totals just over $500 billion.
 More problematic is that Cutler's plan would seem not to brake the projected future escalation of spending. By 2040, according to various projections, that spending could rise from its present $1.8 trillion to something like $3 trillion -- that is, to 20 percent of G.D.P. or conceivably 25 percent. This is why so much attention is focused on cost. According to Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, ''We can't continue to provide all care for all people.'' 
 Cutler's answer to these fears is not exactly cavalier, though some might find it so. If we institute a more results-oriented, and a more health-conscious, system, our dollars will buy us better care and probably cheaper care. By emphasizing prevention and effective treatments for the chronically ill, we might also reduce the rate at which spending grows. We'll still consume more health care -- more ''good stuff,'' in Cutler's trademark colloquialism. But the drive to keep spending down will forever be challenged by technology's efforts to overcome it. If it turns out that gene therapy delivers a cure for cancer, and if that turns out to be something that most Americans want, we should be prepared to pay for it and indeed to tax for it, Cutler says. Spending a fifth, even a quarter, of our resources on life-enhancing and life-prolonging miracles would not be the worst of fates.

HEADLINE: Looting at Weapons Plants Was Systematic, Iraqi Says

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ and WILLIAM J. BROAD; James Glanz reported from Baghdad for this article, and William J. Broad from New York. David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 12 

 BODY:
In the weeks after Baghdad fell in April 2003, looters systematically dismantled and removed tons of machinery from Saddam Hussein's most important weapons installations, including some with high-precision equipment capable of making parts for nuclear arms, a senior Iraqi official said this week in the government's first extensive comments on the looting.
 The Iraqi official, Sami al-Araji, the deputy minister of industry, said it appeared that a highly organized operation had pinpointed specific plants in search of valuable equipment, some of which could be used for both military and civilian applications, and carted the machinery away. 
 Dr. Araji said his account was based largely on observations by government employees and officials who either worked at the sites or lived near them.
 ''They came in with the cranes and the lorries, and they depleted the whole sites,'' Dr. Araji said. ''They knew what they were doing; they knew what they want. This was sophisticated looting.'' 
 The threat posed by these types of facilities was cited by the Bush administration as a reason for invading Iraq, but the installations were left largely unguarded by allied forces in the chaotic months after the invasion. 
 Dr. Araji's statements came just a week after a United Nations agency disclosed that approximately 90 important sites in Iraq had been looted or razed in that period. 
 Satellite imagery analyzed by two United Nations groups -- the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or Unmovic -- confirms that some of the sites identified by Dr. Araji appear to be totally or partly stripped, senior officials at those agencies said. Those officials said they could not comment on all of Dr. Araji's assertions, because the groups had been barred from Iraq since the invasion. 
 For nearly a year, the two agencies have sent regular reports to the United Nations Security Council detailing evidence of the dismantlement of Iraqi military installations and, in a few cases, the movement of Iraqi gear to other countries. In addition, a report issued last October by the chief American arms inspector in Iraq, Charles A. Duelfer, told of evidence of looting at crucial sites. 
 The disclosures by the Iraqi ministry, however, added new information about the thefts, detailing the timing, the material taken and the apparent skill shown by the thieves. 
 Dr. Araji said equipment capable of making parts for missiles as well as chemical, biological and nuclear arms was missing from 8 or 10 sites that were the heart of Iraq's dormant program on unconventional weapons. After the invasion, occupation forces found no unconventional arms, and C.I.A. inspectors concluded that the effort had been largely abandoned after the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
 Dr. Araji said he had no evidence regarding where the equipment had gone. But his account raises the possibility that the specialized machinery from the arms establishment that the war was aimed at neutralizing had made its way to the black market or was in the hands of foreign governments.
 ''Targeted looting of this kind of equipment has to be seen as a proliferation threat,'' said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a private nonprofit organization in Washington that tracks the spread of unconventional weapons. 
 Dr. Araji said he believed that the looters themselves were more interested in making money than making weapons.
 The United Nations, worried that the material could be used in clandestine bomb production, has been hunting for it, largely unsuccessfully, across the Middle East. In one case, investigators searching through scrap yards in Jordan last June found specialized vats for highly corrosive chemicals that had been tagged and monitored as part of the international effort to keep watch on the Iraqi arms program. The vessels could be used for harmless industrial processes or for making chemical weapons. 
 American military officials in Baghdad did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the findings. But American officials have said in the past that while they were aware of the importance of some of the installations, there was not enough military personnel to guard all of them during and after the invasion. 
 White House officials, apprised of the Iraqi account by The New York Times, said it was already well known that many weapons sites had been looted. They had no other comment.

Daily Looting Reports
 Many of Iraq's weapons sites are clustered in an area from Baghdad's southern outskirts to roughly the town of Iskandariya, about 30 miles south. Dr. Araji, who like many others at the Industry Ministry kept going to work immediately after the invasion, was able to collect observations of the organized looting from witnesses who went to the ministry in Baghdad each day.
 The Industry Ministry also sent teams of engineers to the looted sites in August and September of 2003 as part of an assessment undertaken for the Coalition Provisional Authority, the interim American-led administrative apparatus. By then, virtually all of the most refined equipment was gone, Dr. Araji said.
 The peak of the organized looting, Dr. Araji estimates, occurred in four weeks from mid-April to mid-May of 2003 as teams with flatbed trucks and other heavy equipment moved systematically from site to site. That operation was followed by rounds of less discriminating thievery.
 ''The first wave came for the machines,'' Dr. Araji said. ''The second wave, cables and cranes. The third wave came for the bricks.'' 
 Hajim M. al-Hasani, the minister of industry, referred questions about looting to Dr. Araji, who commented during a lengthy interview conducted in English in his office on Wednesday and a brief phone interview on Friday.
 Dr. Araji said that if the equipment had left the country, its most likely destination was a neighboring state. 
 David Albright, an authority on nuclear weaponry who is president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, said that Syria and Iran were the countries most likely to be in the market for the kind of equipment that Mr. Hussein purchased, at great cost, when he was secretly trying to build a nuclear weapon in the 1980's.

Losses at Enrichment Site
 As examples of the most important sites that were looted, Dr. Araji cited the Nida Factory, the Badr General Establishment, Al Ameer, Al Radwan, Al Hatteen, Al Qadisiya and Al Qaqaa. Al Radwan, for example, was a manufacturing plant for the uranium enrichment program, with enormous machine tools for making highly specialized parts, according to the Wisconsin Project. The Nida Factory was implicated in both the nuclear program and the manufacture of Scud missiles.
 Al Qaqaa, with some 1,100 structures, manufactured powerful explosives that could be used for conventional missile warheads and for setting off a nuclear detonation. Last fall, Iraqi government officials warned the United States and international nuclear inspectors that some 377 tons of those explosives were missing after the invasion. But Al Qaqaa also contained a wide variety of weapons manufacturing machinery, including 800 pieces of chemical equipment.
 The kinds of machinery at the various sites included equipment that could be used to make missile parts, chemical weapons or centrifuges essential for enriching uranium for atom bombs. All of that ''dual use'' equipment also has peaceful applications -- for example, a tool to make parts for a nuclear implosion device or for a powerful commercial jet turbine. 
 Mr. Hussein's rise to power in Iraq culminated in his military building not only deadly missiles but many unconventional arms. After the 1991 gulf war, international inspectors found that Baghdad was close to making an atom bomb and had succeeded in producing thousands of biological and chemical warheads.
 Starting in 1991, the United Nations began destroying Iraq's unconventional arms and setting up a vast effort to monitor the country's industrial infrastructure to make sure that Baghdad lived up to its disarmament promises. The International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, was put in charge of nuclear sites, and Unmovic, based in New York, was given responsibility for chemical and biological plants as well as factories that made rockets and missiles.
 A Western diplomat familiar with satellite reconnaissance done by the International Atomic Energy Agency said it confirmed some of the Iraqi findings. For instance, he said, it showed that the Nida Factory had been partly destroyed, with some buildings removed, and some rebuilt. He added that the Badr General Establishment was almost entirely dismantled.
 By contrast, he said, the agency's photo analysts found Al Ameer untouched, but only as seen from overhead. ''The buildings could be totally empty,'' he said.
 The diplomat added that the atomic energy agency's reconnaissance team found that Al Radwan was ''significantly dismantled'' and that Al Qadisiya had almost vanished. At the sprawling Hatteen base, he said, ''parts are untouched, and parts are 100 percent gone.''
 Before the invasion, the United Nations was monitoring those kinds of sites. Two senior officials of the monitoring commission said in an interview that their agency's analysis of satellite reconnaissance photos of Iraq showed visible looting and destruction at five of the seven sites that had been cited by Dr. Araji.
 The officials cautioned that the agency zeroed in on certain buildings of special interest in its monitoring work on unconventional weapons and that other structures or warehouses at a particular identified site might still be intact.
 ''You might have a place with 100 buildings but we'd have an interest in only 3 of them,'' an official said. 
 Officials at the United Nations monitoring agency said some areas of the sprawling Qaqaa installation involved in chemical processing had been wrecked by fire and possible extensive looting. Unknown is the fate of such equipment there like separators, heat exchangers, mixers and chemical reactors, all of which can be used in making chemical weapons.
 The Badr General Establishment, they said, had been systematically razed. ''It's fairly significant,'' one official said of the looting and disappearance of important buildings.
 The Radwan site has been dismantled, they said, with the destruction quite extensive. And the Qadisiya small arms plant has been razed, they said, as have the buildings the agency monitored at the sprawling Hatteen installation. The two officials said the agency had no information on the condition of the Nida Factory or the Ameer site.

No Saudi or Iranian Replies
 The recent monitoring agency report said Unmovic had asked Iraq's neighbors if they were aware of whether any equipment under agency monitoring had moved in or through their countries. Syrian officials, it said, replied that ''no relevant scrap from Iraq had passed through Syria.'' The agency, the report added, had yet to receive a response from Iran and Saudi Arabia.
 Dr. Hasani, the Iraqi industry minister, said the sites of greatest concern had been part of the Military Industrialization Commission, a department within the ministry until it became a separate entity in the 1990's. The commission, widely known as the M.I.C., was dissolved after the fall of Baghdad, and responsibility for its roughly 40 sites was divided between the ministries of industry and finance, Dr. Hasani said. ''We got 11 of them,'' he said.
 Dr. Araji, whose tenure with the ministry goes back to the 1980's, is now involved in plans to use the sites as manufacturing centers in what the ministry hopes will be a new free-market economy in Iraq. He said that disappointment at losing such valuable equipment was a prime reason that the ministry was determined to speak frankly about what had happened.
 ''We talk straight about these matters, because it's a sad thing that this took place in Iraq,'' Dr. Araji said. ''We need anything that could support us here.''
 ''When you have good factories that could support that move and that transformation,'' he said, ''it would be good for the economy of the country.''
 In an interview, a senior atomic energy agency official said the agency had used the reconnaissance photos to study roughly 100 sites in Iraq but that the imagery's high cost meant that the inspectors could afford to get updates of individual sites only about once a year. 
 In its most recent report to the United Nations Security Council, in October, the agency said it ''continues to be concerned about the widespread and apparently systematic dismantlement that has taken place at sites previously relevant to Iraq's nuclear program.''

Alarms to Security Council
 Agency inspectors, in visiting other countries, have discovered tons of industrial scrap, some radioactively contaminated, from Iraq, the report noted. It added, however, that the agency had been unable to track down any of the high-quality, dual-use equipment or materials. 
 ''The disappearance of such equipment,'' the report emphasized, ''may be of proliferation significance.'' 
 The monitoring commission has filed regular reports to the Security Council since raising alarms last May about looting in Iraq, the dismantlement of important weapons installations and the export of dangerous materials to foreign states.
 Officials of the commission and the atomic energy agency have repeatedly called on the Iraqi government to report on what it knows of the fate of the thousands of pieces of monitored equipment and stockpiles of monitored chemicals and materials.
 Last fall, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, put public pressure on the interim Iraqi government to start the process of accounting for nuclear-related materials still ostensibly under the agency's supervision. Iraq is obliged, he wrote to the president of the Security Council on Oct. 1, to declare semiannually changes that have occurred or are foreseen.
 In interviews, officials of the monitoring commission and the atomic energy agency said the two agencies had heard nothing from Baghdad -- with one notable exception. On Oct. 10, the Iraqi Ministry of Science and Technology wrote to the atomic agency to say a stockpile of high explosives at Al Qaqaa had been lost because of ''theft and looting.''
 During the American presidential election last fall, news of that letter ignited a political firestorm. Privately, officials of the monitoring commission and the atomic energy agency have speculated on whether the political uproar made Baghdad reluctant to disclose more details of looting.

HEADLINE: Savings: Lots of Talk, But Few Dollars

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THERE are moments when a particular word acquires such a compelling grip on the political imagination that it can be used as cover for all kinds of agendas.
 The big word is not ''bust'' or ''bankrupt,'' even though President Bush utters them often as he barnstorms the country to whip up a sense of crisis about Social Security. The word that is really catching on in Washington is ''savings.'' Democrats say that Mr. Bush has greatly depleted national savings with his tax cuts and soaring fiscal deficits. Mr. Bush invokes the need for savings to justify more tax incentives as well as his plan to overhaul Social Security.
 Without a doubt, the dearth of savings poses serious concerns. Economic growth requires investment, and investment requires savings. Because Americans consume far more than they produce, the country is now borrowing more than $600 billion a year from foreigners -- almost 6 percent of the gross domestic product. Put another way, the United States is tapping the savings of almost every other part of the world -- including relatively poor countries. At some point, those bills will come due and constrain growth for many years. 
 Another big concern is that millions of aging baby boomers may not have stashed away enough for their retirements. Only about half of all workers participate in a pension plan with their current employer, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Less than one-quarter of workers are covered by a traditional defined-benefit retirement plan. And savings through individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans have been meager: in 2001, the average worker in the 55-to-64 age group had a balance of only $42,000.
 But if the problem is clear, the proposed solutions are not.
 Start with President Bush's plan to overhaul Social Security by letting workers divert some of their payroll taxes to personal retirement accounts. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow says in his stump speech that the accounts would not only enable younger workers to ''build a nest egg,'' but would also help the nation ''create a larger pool of savings.''
 But at least for the next few decades, that last assertion would not be true. For every dollar a person contributed to his nest egg, the government would reduce at least a dollar in traditional Social Security benefits. At best, savings would simply be transferred from government to individual accounts.
 More likely, the government would have to borrow trillions of dollars over the next several decades to pay full benefits to retirees who earned them under today's system.
 ''Moving to a forced savings account technically does not materially affect net national savings,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last month. ''It merely moves savings from the government account to a private account.'' Mr. Greenspan is a supporter of personal accounts.
 Savings are also at the heart of the battle over tax cuts.
 For the third year in a row, Mr. Bush is proposing a big expansion of tax incentives for savings accounts. The most controversial idea is to create ''lifetime savings accounts,'' into which individuals could contribute up to $5,000 a year and earn tax-free investment income.
 The twist of these accounts is that people would not have to wait until retirement to withdraw money. They could do so at any time and for any reason. But economists are divided over whether tax-advantaged savings accounts -- even traditional retirement accounts -- actually increase national savings. 
 Personal savings have declined fairly steadily for more than two decades, even as tax incentives for savings have proliferated. According to a recent analysis by Elizabeth Bell, Adam Carasso and C.Eugene Steuerle at the Urban Institute, the federal government now spends more on tax breaks for retirement savings than Americans actually save.
 Tax breaks for retirement programs cost $112 billion in 2004, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Personal savings -- for any purpose -- totaled only $100.8 billion, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve.
 The issue isn't whether tax incentives prompt people to put money into 401(k) plans -- the answer is clearly yes. The question is whether people actually save more, or whether they simply shelter income they were going to save anyway.
 ''The government does not really subsidize saving,'' wrote Mr. Steuerle and his colleagues in a paper published in the journal Tax Notes. ''It subsidizes deposits, which can then be borrowed for consumption.''
 By contrast, one of the hottest ideas in Washington grows out of new research on the behavior of savers. Recent studies by researchers at the Wharton School of Business and Harvard showed that employee contributions to 401(k) plans soared at companies that automatically enrolled employees and gave them a chance to opt out.
 Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, is expected to introduce a bill next week with Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, that would call for automatic enrollment of workers in 401(k) plans.
 But there is an even more curious turn to the politics of savings. A growing number of thoughtful analysts, Democrat and Republican alike, contend that today's tax incentives are misdirected at those who already have a strong propensity to save: people with high incomes who can spare the money.
 Yet the tax incentive for savings that the Bush administration would scrap happens to be the one aimed precisely at low-income families.
 Peter Orszag and William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution note that tax deductions for contributions to a retirement account provide a 35 percent deduction for people in the top tax brackets but only a 10 percent deduction for those in the lowest bracket. For tens of millions of low-income families, who owe no federal income tax at all, the tax benefit is zero.
 To address that issue, Mr. Bush's 2001 tax cuts included a ''saver's credit'' aimed at low-income families. A family with an adjusted gross income below $30,000 is entitled to a 50 percent tax credit for retirement contributions of up to $2,000 a year.
 A $1,000 credit would reduce a family's tax bill by $1,000. By contrast, a $1,000 deduction against income would save a person in the 10 percent bracket $100 at most.
 Mr. Portman is so enthusiastic about the saver's credit that he wants to make it refundable, so families who don't owe any federal taxes could still get a check from the Internal Revenue Service.
 But for reasons that are unclear, the Bush administration apparently wants to scrap the saver's credit entirely. Even as it pushes Congress to make almost all its other tax cuts permanent, the administration is not proposing to renew the credit when it expires in 2006. Treasury Department officials gave little explanation of why they did not propose a continuation of the credit, saying only that they had ''pared down'' their list of tax proposals while waiting for recommendations from President Bush's advisory panel on tax reform. 
 ''The core of the president's priorities are in there, but a lot of other things aren't,'' said Taylor Griffin, a spokesman for the department. ''We wanted to give the tax panel as much flexibility as possible.''
 The credit's fate can't be a matter of cost: it costs $1.2 billion a year. That isn't even a rounding error in Mr. Bush's agenda to permanently extend all his tax cuts for a total of $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
 Maybe it's time to increase savings without spending so much money.

HEADLINE: Our Currency, Your Problem 

BYLINE: By Niall Ferguson. 
Niall Ferguson is professor of history at Harvard and author of ''Colossus: The Price of America's Empire.''

 BODY:
Every congressman knows that the United States currently runs large ''twin deficits'' on its budget and current accounts. Deficit 1, as we well know, is just the difference between federal tax revenues and expenditures. Deficit 2 is generally less well understood: it's the difference between all that Americans earn from foreigners (mainly from exports, services and investments abroad) and all that they pay out to foreigners (for imports, services and loans). When a government runs a deficit, it can tap public savings by selling bonds. But when the economy as a whole is running a deficit -- when American households are saving next to nothing of their disposable income -- there is no option but to borrow abroad.
 There was a time when foreign investors were ready and willing to finance the U.S. current account deficit by buying large pieces of corporate America. But that's not the case today. Perhaps the most amazing economic fact of our time is that between 70 and 80 percent of the American economy's vast and continuing borrowing requirement is being met by foreign (mainly Asian) central banks. 
 Let's translate that into political terms. In effect, the Bush administration's combination of tax cuts for the Republican ''base'' and a Global War on Terror is being financed with a multibillion dollar overdraft facility at the People's Bank of China. Without East Asia, your mortgage might well be costing you more. The toys you buy for your kids certainly would. 
 Why are the Chinese monetary authorities so willing to underwrite American profligacy? Not out of altruism. The principal reason is that if they don't keep on buying dollars and dollar-based securities as fast as the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury can print them, the dollar could slide substantially against the Chinese renminbi, much as it has declined against the euro over the past three years. Knowing the importance of the U.S. market to their export industries, the Chinese authorities dread such a dollar slide. The effect would be to raise the price, and hence reduce the appeal, of Chinese goods to American consumers -- and that includes everything from my snowproof hiking boots to the modem on my desk. A fall in exports would almost certainly translate into job losses in China at a time when millions of migrants from the countryside are pouring into the country's manufacturing sector. 
 So when Treasury Secretary John Snow insists that the United States has a ''strong dollar'' policy, what he really means is that the People's Republic of China has a ''weak renminbi'' policy. Sure, this is bad news if you happen to be an American toy manufacturer. But there are three good reasons that the administration is tacitly delighted by the Asian central banks' support. Not only is it keeping the lid on the price of American imports from Asia (a potential source of inflationary pressure). It is also propping up the price of U.S. Treasury bonds; this in turns depresses the yield on those bonds, allowing the federal government to borrow at historically very low rates of interest. Reason No. 3 is that low long-term interest rates keep the Bush recovery jogging along.
 Sadly, according to a growing number of eminent economists, this arrangement simply cannot last. The dollar pessimists argue that the Asian central banks are already dangerously overexposed both to the dollar and the U.S. bond market. Sooner or later, they have to get out -- at which point the dollar could plunge relative to Asian currencies by as much as a third or two-fifths, and U.S. interest rates could leap upward. (When the South Korean central bank recently appeared to indicate that it was shifting out of dollars, there was indeed a brief run on the U.S. currency -- until the Koreans hastily issued a denial.) 
 Are the pessimists right? The U.S. current account deficit is now within sight of 6 percent of G.D.P., and net external debt stands at around 30 percent. The precipitous economic history of Latin America shows that an external-debt burden in excess of 20 percent of G.D.P. is potentially dangerous. 
 Yet there is one key difference between the United States and the countries south of the Rio Grande. Latin American economies have trouble with their foreign debts because those debts are denominated in foreign currency. The United States' external liabilities, by contrast, are almost entirely denominated in its own currency.
 It therefore makes more sense to compare the United States with other members of that exclusive club of countries that have produced -- and hence been able to borrow -- in international currencies. The most obvious analogy that springs to mind is the United Kingdom 60 years ago. 
 During the Second World War, Britain financed its wartime deficits partly by borrowing substantial amounts of sterling from the colonies and dominions within her empire. And yet by the mid-1950's, these very substantial debts had largely disappeared. Unfortunately, this was partly because the value of sterling itself fell significantly. Moreover, sterling's decline and fall did not reduce the U.K.'s chronic trade deficit, least of all with respect to manufacturing. On the contrary, British industry declined in tandem with the pound's status as a global currency. And, needless to say, the decline of sterling coincided with Britain's decline as an empire.
 From an American perspective, all this might seem to suggest worrying parallels. Could our own obligations to foreigners presage not just devaluation but also industrial and imperial decline? 
 Possibly. Yet there are some pretty important differences between 2005 and 1945. The United States is not in nearly as bad an economic mess as postwar Britain, which also owed large sums in dollars to the United States. The American empire is also in much better shape than the British empire was back in 1945.
 Even the gloomiest pessimists accept that a steep dollar depreciation would inflict more suffering on China and other Asian economies than on the United States. John Snow's counterpart in the Nixon administration once told his European counterparts that ''the dollar is our currency, but your problem.'' Snow could say the same to Asians today. If the dollar fell by a third against the renminbi, according to Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University, the People's Bank of China could suffer a capital loss equivalent to 10 percent of China's gross domestic product. For that reason alone, the P.B.O.C. has every reason to carry on printing renminbi in order to buy dollars. 
 Though neither side wants to admit it, today's Sino-American economic relationship has an imperial character. Empires, remember, traditionally collect ''tributes'' from subject peoples. That is how their costs -- in terms of blood and treasure -- can best be justified to the populace back in the imperial capital. Today's ''tribute'' is effectively paid to the American empire by China and other East Asian economies in the form of underpriced exports and low-interest, high-risk loans. 
 How long can the Chinese go on financing America's twin deficits? The answer may be a lot longer than the dollar pessimists expect. After all, this form of tribute is much less humiliating than those exacted by the last Anglophone empire, which occupied China's best ports and took over the country's customs system (partly in order to flood the country with Indian opium). There was no obvious upside to that arrangement for the Chinese; the growth rate of per capita G.D.P. was probably negative in that era, compared with 8 or 9 percent a year since 1990.
 Meanwhile, the United States may be discovering what the British found in their imperial heyday. If you are a truly powerful empire, you can borrow a lot of money at surprisingly reasonable rates. Today's deficits are in fact dwarfed in relative terms by the amounts the British borrowed to finance their Global War on (French) Terror between 1793 and 1815. Yet British long-term rates in that era averaged just 4.77 percent, and the pound's exchange rate was restored to its prewar level within a few years of peace. 
 It is only when your power wanes -- as the British learned after 1945 -- that owing a fortune in your own currency becomes a real problem. As opposed, that is, to someone else's problem.

PERSON: Fred G. Burke

HEADLINE: Fred C. Burke, 79, Is Dead; Education Chief in Trenton

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Fred G. Burke, who oversaw sweeping changes in the financing and accountability of public schools as the commissioner of education for Rhode Island and then New Jersey in the 1970's and early 80's, died Friday at Newton Memorial Hospital in Newton, N.J. He was 79 and lived in Milford, Pa.
 The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said his wife, Carol Sterling. 
 A political scientist and African-affairs specialist with a reputation for getting things done, Dr. Burke had written books, taught in colleges, served as a United Nations consultant, directed the training of the first Peace Corps volunteers and been Rhode Island's top education official for more than three years when, in 1974, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed him commissioner of education in New Jersey. 
 It was like stepping into the center of a storm. Over the next eight years, Dr. Burke, a Democrat, became a target of teachers' unions, school boards, disgruntled taxpayers and political foes as he pushed for accountability by students, teachers and administrators, while New Jersey imposed its first income tax to reverse the slide of a school system that discriminated against children in poorer districts. 
 Standing his ground, Dr. Burke was instrumental in persuading the Legislature to pass a 1975 law calling for a ''thorough and efficient'' education for the state's 1.5 million students. It mandated testing and monitoring, annual evaluations for tenured teachers and yearly reviews for every school. Students squirmed, and the New Jersey Education Association, the 85,000-member teachers' union, objected.
 So did the State Board of Education, local school boards, legislative opponents and other critics, who said tests were no guarantee of learning, that central authority threatened academic freedom and the autonomy of school districts, and that teachers and schools might be unfairly penalized. But Dr. Burke won support among many parents, especially after the scores showed improvement late in his tenure.
 Beyond performance and accountability, the problems with schools in New Jersey -- and across the country -- included too little money, and wildly disparate budgets in the patchwork of rich and poor school districts, with money largely coming from local property taxes, supplemented by state aid. 
 In a landmark 1973 ruling, the State Supreme Court said the financing system violated New Jersey's constitutional mandate for a ''thorough and efficient'' education for all children, because poorer districts were unable to give their schools adequate support. The constitutional phrase -- bland and powerful and all but ignored -- provided the rationale, and in 1976, after a long and bitter fight, the Legislature and Governor Byrne pushed through the state's first income tax.
 It was to provide millions in ''equalization aid,'' to level the playing field for rich and poor districts. But much of the $800 million raised in the first year went not to schools but to homeowners as rebates to make the tax more palatable. Dr. Burke had no direct role in the adoption of the unpopular tax, but as the personification of the state school system he became a natural target of its critics.
 In 1982, the newly elected Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, appointed a replacement for Dr. Burke. In a departing interview, the commissioner said there had been dramatic improvements in the schools. But, citing a faltering economy and sharply rising teachers' pensions and other costs, he acknowledged that there had been too little money, and that the gap between rich and poor districts had only grown wider.
 In 1990, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered the state to ensure that the poorest cities spend as much on their children's education as wealthy suburbs spent. The suit, known as Abbott v. Burke, by 20 students in East Orange, Jersey City, Camden and Irvington, was filed in 1981 against Dr. Burke as education commissioner, and though he was named as the defendant he regarded the outcome as a victory. 
 ''He was so happy to lose that,'' his wife recalled. ''It was the beginning of equitable financing for the schools of New Jersey.''
 Fred George Burke was born in Collins, N.Y., on Jan. 1, 1926. He was in the Army Air Forces in World War II and served in the Korean War. He graduated from Williams College in 1953, and at Princeton received a master's in 1955 and a doctorate in 1958. Over the next 12 years, he taught political science at Ohio Wesleyan University, Syracuse University and the State University of New York at Buffalo.
 During that time, he traveled often to Africa, wrote six books on African affairs, was a consultant to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and directed the training of Peace Corps volunteers in East Africa. From 1971 to 1974, he was the commissioner of education for Rhode Island, instituting innovations that included full state funding of public schools -- with money raised from the state's first income tax, adopted in 1972 -- and a statewide salary scale for teachers.
 After resigning as New Jersey education commissioner, he joined the University of Connecticut as vice president for graduate education and research and dean of the graduate school, and in 1992 became a senior fellow at the Phelps Stokes Fund. His last book, ''Public Education: Who's In Charge?'' (Praeger, 1991) argued for a national education policy.
 In addition to Ms. Sterling, whom he married in 1985, Mr. Burke is survived by three sons, Fritz, of Union, Me.; Daniel, of Bangor, Me.; and Adam, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Rebecca Burke, of Washington; two sisters, Marlene Johnston, of Roopville, Ga., and Ellen Van Note, of Chapel Hill, N.C.; and four grandchildren. Two earlier marriages ended in divorce.

HEADLINE: Medicaid in the Cross Hairs

 BODY:
Everyone seems to be howling about the cost of Medicaid, and no wonder. Spending on the health care program for the poor has been exploding, up from about $200 billion in 2000 to more than $300 billion at last count. State governments, which share the costs with the federal government, were hit with the bill just as the economic downturn hit their revenues. And the Bush administration, awash in red ink, wants to cut costs.
 The biggest problem with Medicaid is that it has been deputized to do a lot of jobs it wasn't originally created for. Intended as a health insurance program for families on welfare and people with disabilities, Medicaid has gradually been stretched to cover for Congress's failure to deal with the millions of low-income American workers without health insurance, and the refusal of Medicare to pay for long-term nursing home care for the elderly. 
 It's understandable that the states (and in New York, the localities, which pay for part of the program) want to control this fiscal albatross. And while this page has deep disagreements with the current budget priorities in Washington, both the White House and Congress have a responsibility to get a handle on Medicaid's rising costs. But the effort should account for three important points:
 Medicaid is performing a critical service that the public supports -- making sure that poor children get proper medical care, that working families have health coverage and that old people get quality care. The driving force behind the recent upsurge in costs, according to an analysis by researchers at the Urban Institute, was a big increase in the number of people enrolled. The wobbly economy left more workers with incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid and fewer employers offering affordable health coverage. That is hardly an indictment of Medicaid. The program was doing what it was meant to do, filling a gap for people in real need.
 There is a difference between real spending cuts and simply moving the bills into a different account book. People's health needs won't disappear just because Medicaid stops paying for treatment. People will turn instead to hospital emergency rooms, adding to the huge burden of charity care at hard-pressed medical institutions. Medicaid itself is the ultimate victim of cost shifting. A great deal of its cost is due to Medicare's failure to cover some vital services for the elderly -- particularly nursing homes. As a result, people of modest means routinely impoverish themselves on nursing home bills, until they qualify for Medicaid. When Medicare begins paying for prescription drugs for the elderly, states will continue to provide the bulk of the money for coverage for the elderly poor. Congress insisted on that to keep down the cost of the new program. 
 Despite loose talk about Medicaid providing Cadillac services when a Chevy would do, the program is extremely parsimonious in big ways. Most of its beneficiaries are in health maintenance organizations that are often shunned by better-off Americans. It typically pays hospitals and doctors far less than Medicare or private plans, making many doctors unwilling to accept Medicaid patients. Its spending per enrollee has increased more slowly than private insurance spending, and it delivers care more cheaply than a private plan. It's a pretty safe bet that few of the critics talking about overly generous benefits would be willing, in real life, to exchange health plans with a Medicaid recipient. 
 That said, there are problems with Medicaid that need to be addressed. Sordid Medicaid mills sometimes hustle patients through at a rapid clip or charge the program for services not rendered. Middle-class people sometimes hide or transfer assets or income, often quite legally, to qualify for nursing home benefits. Many states have used outrageous accounting tricks to gain millions of dollars in federal matching funds to which they were not entitled.
 Such abuses can and must be curtailed, and the Bush administration deserves credit for trying. But eliminating fraud and closing loopholes will barely make a dent in the overriding problem -- the inexorable rise in Medicaid costs that is restricting the ability of states to finance other vital services, such as education and transportation. 
 In seeking to reduce the cost of Medicaid, it will be crucial to look hard at long-term care, which soaks up roughly a third of total Medicaid spending. In a rational world, those costs would be paid by Medicare, and the fact that Medicare is already in deep, deep financial trouble is no reason to continue forcing the states to pay.
 It is long past time for a serious national discussion about how best to handle an aging society's needs for long-term care for victims of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other ailments that require constant medical or custodial care beyond what the immediate family can provide. We don't argue with fiscal conservatives who say that the government should clamp down on people who shift all their assets to their children in order to make Medicaid pay for nursing home care. Citizens have a responsibility to pay their own way as much as possible. Working with the private insurance market to make sure people can get coverage for old age, and making it as automatic as buying car or home insurance, could make a big difference.
 Meanwhile, without a broad plan for long-term care, it would make little sense to cut deeply into Medicaid, the default funder of services needed by our aging society.

HEADLINE: A Settlement For Kosovo

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Still Troubled After All These Years'' (editorial, March 3) says that ''work should begin immediately on a settlement'' for Kosovo, but it does not say what that settlement would look like in international law. The truth is, the world has been avoiding this thorny problem for six years. 
 You say the solution should ''include a semiautonomous zone for the Serbs,'' but do not define what that zone would be semiautonomous from. You also reject independence for the province. Does this mean that the Kosovo Albanians would just live in the international limbo of United Nations administration indefinitely -- with no access to foreign lending and investment, and thus very high unemployment?
 The riots last year against Serbs and other minority groups were indefensible. But recognizing that social unrest has underlying causes and charting a path to a settlement to begin dealing with those causes does not ''reward bad faith.'' Independence may well be the best way to get a functioning state that produces real benefits for people, including Kosovo's Serbs. When people have responsibility, they tend to behave more responsibly.
 Let's hope that the calm response to date of the Kosovo Albanians to Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj's indictment and resignation (''Kosovo's New Chance,'' editorial, March 9), together with his own dignified exit, may mark precisely that society's turning point toward responsibility.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Hevesi Sees Green In Green Energy

BYLINE: AP; Compiled by John Harney

 BODY:
The state could benefit greatly from a greener economy that produces and consumes more renewable energy from soybeans to hydrogen, according to an economic report released by the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi. The report, released last week, said thousands of jobs would be created in manufacturing and in energy-related industries if New York steps up its commitment to generating more electricity through renewable sources. The report is the latest to call for New York to expand solar, wind and fuel cell power, as well as develop crops including corn and soybeans that can be processed into fuel.

HEADLINE: China Denies 'Taiwan' Law On Secession Is a 'War Bill'

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, March 14 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao on Monday defended a newly approved law that could authorize a military attack to prevent Taiwan from seeking independence, saying it was intended to ensure peace, not promote war.
 ''It is not a war bill,'' Mr. Wen said at a televised news conference after the closing of this year's session of the National People's Congress, China's version of a parliament.
 Mr. Wen also criticized as outside interference a recent joint security declaration by the United States and Japan that listed a peaceful Taiwan Strait as a common objective. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and insists its policy regarding the island is a domestic matter. 
 ''We don't want to see foreign interference,'' Mr. Wen said slowly, speaking about Taiwan, ''but we do not fear foreign interference.'' The assembled hall of 700 journalists, a large majority Chinese, applauded.
 His comments came about an hour after the National People's Congress overwhelming approved the law. It grants legal authority to the top leaders to attack Taiwan if they believe the disputed island territory is moving too far toward independence. Officials in Taiwan and the United States have criticized the law as overtly provocative and warned it could further destabilize the fragile status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
 The law's passage came a day after the president, Hu Jintao, assumed formal control of China's military with a promise to protect the country's sovereignty and defend its ''territorial integrity,'' language pointed directly at Taiwan.
 ''We shall step up preparations for possible military struggle and enhance our capabilities to cope with crises, safeguard peace, prevent wars and win the wars if any,'' Mr. Hu said, according to the official New China News Agency.
 At his news conference, Mr. Wen said the law was meant to ''check and oppose Taiwan independence forces.'' Acknowledging that the law contains potential triggers to war, he said ''as long as there is a ray of hope,'' China would pursue peaceful means to ensure reunification.
 He said the United States Congress had passed similar resolutions in 1861 with the intent to stave off civil war, though he said he hoped the Chinese law would be more successful. 
 Mr. Wen, who leads the government's huge bureaucracy, spoke on a range of issues about the country's fast-growing economy. He said countries that have called on China to quickly revaluate its currency have not fully considered the problems that a revaluation could bring. He said that there was no timetable for any changes and that changes might come at an ''unexpected'' time.
 Mr. Wen also spoke about China's need to balance its economic growth and to spread its wealth to the vast, impoverished countryside. But asked if the government would change the law that prohibits farmers from owning the land they till, he sidestepped the question, instead saying that they would always be allowed autonomy in ''managing the land.'' Some analysts say the lack of land ownership in rural areas is a fundamental reason farmers remain poor.
 On Sunday, Mr. Hu's approval as chairman of the state Central Military Commission was a formality, coming months after top leaders announced that he would replace the former leader, Jiang Zemin. It completed the transfer of power to Mr. Hu that began in 2002 when he replaced Mr. Jiang as general secretary of the Communist Party. And it was delivered by another lopsided legislative margin: 2,886 delegates voted for Mr. Hu, while 6 opposed him and 5 abstained.
 To a large degree, the anti-secession law is a political gambit, as China's leaders already are empowered to invade Taiwan with or without statutory approval. But the law creates conditions that could complicate the political machinations of Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, who is loathed by Beijing.
 The law dedicates much verbiage to ensuring peaceful reunification. But it also specifies that any change to Taiwan's constitution that would enhance its de facto independent status could bring a military response. Mr. Chen has made changing the constitution a centerpiece of his second presidential term.

HEADLINE: Publishers Face the Risky Economics of Charging Online

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Consumers are willing to spend millions of dollars on the Web when it comes to music services like iTunes and gaming sites like Xbox Live. But when it comes to online news, they are happy to read it but loath to pay for it. 
 Newspaper Web sites have been so popular that at some newspapers, including The New York Times, the number of people who read the paper online now surpasses the number who buy the print edition. 
 This migration of readers is beginning to transform the newspaper industry. Advertising revenue from online sites is booming and, while it accounts for only 2 percent or 3 percent of most newspapers' overall revenues, it is the fastest-growing source of revenue. And newspaper executives are watching anxiously as the number of online readers grows while the number of print readers declines. 
 ''For some publishers, it really sticks in the craw that they are giving away their content for free,'' said Colby Atwood, vice president of Borrell Associates Inc., a media research firm. The giveaway means less support for expensive news-gathering operations and the potential erosion of advertising revenue from the print side, which is much more profitable.
 ''Newspapers are cannibalizing themselves,'' said Frederick W. Searby, an advertising and publishing analyst at J.P. Morgan.
 As a result, nearly a decade after newspapers began building and showcasing their Web sites, one of the most vexing questions in newspaper economics endures: should publishers charge for Web news, knowing that they may drive readers away and into the arms of the competition?
 Of the nation's 1,456 daily newspapers, only one national paper, The Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow Jones & Company, and about 40 small dailies charge readers to use their Web sites. Other papers charge for either online access to portions of their content or offer online subscribers additional features. 
 The New York Times on the Web, which is owned by The New York Times Company, has been considering charging for years and is expected to make an announcement soon about its plans. In January, The Times's Web site had 1.4 million unique daily visitors. Its daily print circulation averaged 1,124,000 in 2004, down from its peak daily circulation of 1,176,000 in 1993.
 Executives at The Times have suggested that the paper, which already charges for its crossword puzzle, news alerts and archives online, may start charging for other portions of its content, but would not follow the Journal model, which charges online readers $79 a year for everything. 
 (The Journal charges $39 a year to online readers who also subscribe to the printed newspaper.)
 ''A big part of the motivation for newspapers to charge for their online content is not the revenue it will generate, but the revenue it will save, by slowing the erosion of their print subscriptions,'' Mr. Atwood said. ''We're in the midst of a long and painful transition.''
 Most big papers are watching and waiting as they study the patterns of online readers. Analysts said that the growth in readers was slowing but that readers appeared to be spending more time on the Web sites.
 ''We're always looking at the issue,'' said Caroline Little, publisher of Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive, the online media subsidiary of The Washington Post Company. She said that the online registration process that most papers now require for use of their Web sites, while free, lays the groundwork for charging if papers decide to go that route. 
 ''You're getting information from your users and you can target ads to your users, which is more efficient for advertisers,'' she said. ''This has been a dipping of the toe in the water.'' 
 The Post has no plans to charge now because it would mean too big of a drop-off in readers. ''It's just not a strong financial proposition at this point,'' she said. 
 Executives at other newspaper groups, including the Gannett Company, which publishes USA Today, said they had no plans to start charging either.
 A report last week from the Online Publishers Association underscored the challenges facing newspapers in selling news. Internet users spent $88 million for general news in 2004, or just 0.4 percent more than they paid in 2003, the report said; by comparison, they spent $414 million on entertainment, up 90 percent.
 Rob Runett, director of electronic media communications at the Newspaper Association of America, eyed the report ruefully. News, he said, may become an acronym for ''Not Ever Willing to Spend.''
 The Tribune Company, which owns The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune and other papers, has conducted limited experiments in charging for access, some more successful than others.
 The Los Angeles Times charges $4.95 a month for its Calendar Live section, which covers entertainment and provides listings and restaurant reviews, but traffic to the site has declined and a spokeswoman said the paper was reviewing the decision to charge for it.
 The Chicago Tribune offers a ''subscriber advantage'' program, which gives print subscribers free access to archives and bonuses online. ''It's an interesting first step to see how people react in trying to differentiate between the two products,'' said Alison Scholly, general manager of Chicago Tribune Interactive.
 The difficulty comes in determining what readers will pay for on the Web. Most executives agree that national news can be found in so many places that it would be self-defeating to try to charge for it. But they are finding that readers will pay for sports, if the Web offers more than the printed page. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel provides in-depth coverage of the Green Bay Packers, along with blogs, fan photos and audio reports, in ''Packer Insider'' for $34.95 a year.
 But for the most part, publishers make money on Web sites by selling space to advertisers, and that is a booming business. Mr. Atwood at Borrell said a preliminary analysis of online revenues for about 700 daily newspaper Web sites showed an average increase of 45 percent from 2003 to 2004. 
 But some newspapers want to develop a cadre of paying readers as a second stream of revenue beyond the advertising.
 Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times, said of relying on advertising as the sole revenue stream: ''My main concern is that, however we distribute our work, we have to generate the money to pay for it. The advertising model looks appealing now, but do we want our future to depend on that single source of revenue? What happens if advertising goes flat? What happens when somebody develops software to filter out advertising -- TiVo for the Web?''
 At the same time, he said, charging for the Web site could alienate both current readers and potential new readers, particularly in growing markets like China and India, and The Times would be limiting its global reach.
 Perhaps the biggest obstacle for newspapers is that online readers have been conditioned to expect free news. ''Most newspapers believe that if they charged for the Web, the number of users would decline to such an extent that their advertising revenues would decline more than they get from charging users,'' said Gary B. Pruitt, chairman and chief executive of the McClatchy Company, which publishes The Sacramento Bee, The Star Tribune in Minneapolis and other papers, which do not charge for their Web sites.
 The Wall Street Journal experiment suggests the contrary. About 700,000 people subscribe to its online edition, with 300,000 of them subscribing to the Web edition only and 400,000 subscribing to both the online and print editions. The print edition has 1.8 million subscribers. 
 ''If you have strong value, people will pay for it,'' said Todd H. Larsen, president of consumer electronic publishing for Dow Jones, which owns The Journal. ''There is nothing so magical about the Internet that everything has to be free.''
 The Journal's experience may not translate to other papers. It is primarily a financial paper, and analysts said that it is a business expense for many readers buying it. Moreover, charging online brings its own problems. By limiting readership to subscribers, papers also limit the amount of advertising space they can sell. Earlier this year, Dow Jones spent more than $519 million for MarketWatch, the financial news Web site, largely as a way to attract advertising that it was not getting online.
 When the paper first charged for its Web site in 1996, daily traffic fell by about two-thirds, said Rich Jaroslovsky, who was the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal Online at the time and is now a managing editor at Bloomberg News. 
 ''You have to take the hit some time if you do this,'' he said of charging for a Web site. ''We took the pain because we felt over the longer term, we'd see the gain.''
 Since 1997, The Journal's Web site has grown, although growth has slowed dramatically. Subscriptions jumped 35 percent from the third quarter of 1999 to the third quarter of 2000, for example, but grew by just 2 percent from 2003 to 2004, according to the company. This reflects an industrywide slowdown, said Merrill Brown, the founding editor of MSNBC.com and a media consultant. ''There is no question that growth has slowed as the medium has matured,'' he said.
 ''It's a pretty stagnant business for a variety of reasons,'' he added. ''At a moment when big papers are so financially stressed and their prospects uncertain, they aren't investing at the level they need to grow their alternative distribution platforms.''
 On a smaller scale, another newspaper that charges for its Web site is The Spokesman-Review in Spokane, Wash., which has a print circulation of around 100,000. About 20,000 of those print subscribers also get the paper online for no additional fee; just 545 people pay for the Web edition only, at $7 per month.
 Ken Sands, the online publisher, who until a month ago was the managing editor of the print edition, said the paper decided to charge for the Web in an effort to save the print edition.
 ''We had the sense that a lot of people had canceled their print subscriptions because they could read the paper for free online,'' he said. He said that as soon as the paper started charging for the Web, in September, new daily traffic, which had been growing by more than 40 percent a year, stopped cold. He said that traffic was 5 percent lower this January than it was in January a year ago. He added that the print circulation had been steadily declining somewhat anyway, and so he could not blame the Web for that. 
 ''Print is going the way it's going, which is down, which is unfortunate because it's the revenue engine that keeps this whole thing going,'' he said. ''The online business model won't ever be able to support the whole news infrastructure.''
 Mr. Jaroslovsky, the former editor of The Wall Street Journal Online, said that some publishers were regretting not having charged for the Web back in the 1990's when it was developing, because doing so now will be a bigger shock to their readers. Also, he said, the stakes are higher.
 ''When we did this, we were at the beginning of an investment curve and the amount of money at stake was not as great,'' he said. ''Today, if you make a wrong decision, there's a chance it will be not only embarrassing, but very costly.''

HEADLINE: Action on the State Budget Is Moving Into Higher Gear

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 14 

 BODY:
For all the seeming harmony between Gov. George E. Pataki and his fellow Republicans in the State Senate over next year's budget plan, the two are still standing on opposite sides of an $800 million divide on spending.
 Seeking to satisfy the Senate, Mr. Pataki resubmitted some budget bills over the weekend, making 11 language changes to give the Senate more leeway to amend his spending proposals and policy changes. As a result, the Senate promptly began to pass the bills on Monday, making some remarkable progress, at least for Albany, in pushing the budget forward this early in the year. 
 But by no means was Mr. Pataki's acquiescence, after weeks of negotiations, meant to signal approval of a spending spree. Rather, the governor made it clear on Monday that while he might be willing to change the language of the budget to please the Senate, he was not ready to endorse its ultimate policy decisions or adopt its plans for increased spending.
 ''We have agreed to let the Senate move forward,'' Mr. Pataki said at a news conference. ''This doesn't mean that we don't prefer our original submission.''
 With the governor having been assailed as a high spender by some conservative elements in his party, he said that both the Senate and the Assembly were proposing to ''spend too much, unquestionably,'' compared with him. The governor has outlined a $105.6 billion plan for the fiscal year that begins April 1.
 The Senate wants to add $800 million to that, and the Assembly, which is led by Democrats, has been set to pass a budget resolution that would add $1.95 billion to what the governor wants, but since the Assembly plan would prompt an offset of $860 million in federal money, the net increase would be about $90 million. Both houses will now move toward common ground in joint conferences beginning as early as Tuesday.
 But there are still serious divisions. The governor said he wanted lawmakers to set aside more than $1 billion in reserve funds, in case of another economic downturn; he said he wanted a budget that is structurally balanced in future years; and he voiced opposition to an Assembly plan to make permanent a temporary income tax surcharge on New Yorkers making more than $500,000 annually, saying that jobs could go elsewhere.
 Sheldon Silver, speaker of the Assembly and a Democrat, said the real test will be how the governor responds to the Legislature's efforts to reach an agreement.
 ''The real question is what is the impact of what the Senate did with the governor's language changes and what will the governor declare to be appropriate and inappropriate,'' Mr. Silver said.
 John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the leader of the Republican majority in the Senate, said the conference committees could reach agreement by March 24. He said the momentum for an on-time budget was gaining.

FARE INCREASES STICK -- For the second time in a month, Northwest Airlines has taken the lead in imposing fare increases that have been adopted by the other major carriers. The latest increases are as much as $20 round trip, depending on routes. In the past, Northwest has often been the spoiler when competitors sought to raise fares to offset the higher cost of fuel. ''It's amazing because this is going to stick, and it's the second time in two weeks that Northwest has led the way,'' said Terry Trippler, an air fare researcher who is starting a Web site, FareFacts.com. ''It shows you just how serious the airlines are about fuel costs.''

BIG SPENDING IS BACK -- Travel spending continues to rebound. Expenditures in the United States last year on air transportation, hotels, restaurants and other direct services rose 6.7 percent last year, to $548.6 billion, the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Commerce Department said yesterday. That reflects a steady recovery from the $482.1 billion spent in 2001. While business travelers account for about 18 percent of all domestic trips taken, they spend far more per trip, doling out $153 billion in spending in 2003, or nearly 30 percent of the total, according to Cathy Keefe, a spokeswoman for the Travel Industry Association of America.

TURN IT OFF -- It will probably be a year or more before federal regulatory agencies rule on whether individual cellphone use will be allowed on airplanes, but a poll released yesterday suggests that resistance to the idea of cellphone louts hollering from the middle seat might be solidifying. The survey of a nationally representative sample of 752 Americans found that 42 percent supported a law prohibiting talking on cellphones in public spaces like museums, movie theaters or restaurants. Only 30 percent agreed or strongly agreed that people should be reachable at any time in any place. Over all, however, more than 80 percent of respondents said that cellphones had made their lives easier, according to the survey, which was conducted by the University of Michigan and released in New Orleans at the annual convention of the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association.

HEADLINE: U.S. Power Producers Window-Shop For Latest Models of Nuclear Reactors

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
Like the taxis in Havana, American nuclear power reactors are in heavy use, important to the economy and really, really old. The most modern was ordered in 1973. 
 Now after decades, four huge electric companies are expressing strong interest in new reactors, and they would like a new plant to reflect some of what has been learned of the operation. 
 Entergy, Exelon and Dominion have each applied for advance approval on sites where they might build reactors, although they have not committed to actually ordering one. The fourth, Duke Power, met with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday to describe how it was in the early stages of preparing an application for a reactor license, although it did not say what type it wanted to build, or where it would go. 
 On the drawing boards are all kinds of exotic designs, using graphite and helium, or plutonium and molten sodium, and making hydrogen rather than electricity. But the experts generally agree that if a reactor is ordered soon, its design changes will be evolutionary, not revolutionary. 
 The utilities are not ready for a giant technology leap; they want a plant that does what the existing ones do, but slightly better. So if new orders materialize in the next five years, it will be the mechanics and engineers who will get to show what they have learned. The physicists will have to wait. 
 ''The pitfall is too much innovation,'' said Jeffrey S. Merrifield, one of the five members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, addressing 1,400 industry professionals at a meeting last Tuesday at the commission's headquarters. He compared new designs with the ''concept vehicles'' that car companies display at auto shows; buyers are drawn to them, but when it is time to buy, they pick a Ford F-150 or a Toyota Camry instead, he said.
 In a telephone interview, another expert, Dr. Andrew C. Kadak, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the former president of the Yankee Atomic Electric Company, which helped run several reactors, laid out some practical considerations. 
 ''If I were shopping today,'' Dr. Kadak said, ''I would like a reactor that minimizes the dependency on active cooling systems for emergency core cooling.''
 It would also have some smaller changes to increase efficiency and ease of working, in the nature of interior decorating. For example, Dr. Kadak said, reactors would be a lot easier to maintain if designers stopped putting pumps and valves far from platforms and stairs.
 ''Give me some more space, so I can at least take this pump out without having to move three other parts,'' he said.
 Fundamental innovations that may be introduced in the long term include the ''pebble-bed,'' which uses fuel that cannot melt at the temperatures the reactor can achieve, and the use of liquid sodium for heat transfer, allowing operation at much higher temperatures and making more efficient use of uranium or plutonium. 
 Westinghouse is one of the companies trying to market a reactor, the AP1000, with more modest technical goals. It has an output of a little over 1,000 megawatts with what is called a passive approach to safety. It requires only half as many safety-related valves, 83 percent less safety-related pipe and one-third fewer pumps. 
 In the new design, water for emergency cooling has been moved to a tank inside the containment, above the reactor vessel. The changes will allow the emergency core cooling system to run even if all alternating current power fails, Westinghouse says.
 The company is trying to sell four AP1000 reactors to China. 
 The AP1000 is competing with the EPR, for European Pressurized Water Reactor, a creation of Framatome of France and Siemens of Germany, which both became expert in the technology as those countries continued to build reactors after the United States stopped. Their joint venture is called Areva.
 Their reactor has four emergency core cooling systems, instead of the usual two. That could help safety, further reducing the small chance that the system will not be available in an emergency. But there is a more practical reason. One cooling system can be shut down for maintenance while the reactor is running without reducing the safety margin to an unacceptable degree. 
 The EPR is being built now at Olkiluoto, Finland. It has a containment building designed to withstand the impact of a commercial jet, and a set of features intended to cope with a molten core in case of meltdown, preventing a ''China syndrome'' of a core burning through the floor and into the earth beneath. The reactor has a ''core-spreading area'' where the molten material would spread out and be cooled by water running above and below the area. 
 Approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is many months away, but Areva hopes American companies will buy it because of the track record in Finland. And, executives say, they have taken full advantage of everything learned in the last few decades.
 The third entry is General Electric's Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor, derived from its boiling water reactor design. 
 It is tweaked for better natural circulation in case of an accident, so there will be less reliance on pumps. A typical weak spot in existing reactors is the emergency diesel generators, but this model does not need them for emergency operations.
 The reactor has a higher water inventory, as a safety measure, and eliminates large pipes below the level of the core, to reduce the chance of a leak. If the reactor shuts down automatically, then the decay heat, or heat given off by radioactive material after the reaction stopped, can be removed automatically for 72 hours, with no operator action, according to General Electric. Decay heat is what melted the core of the Three Mile Island reactor.
 GE portrays its new design as an improvement on its previous evolutionary version, the advanced boiling water reactor. Peter G. Wells, who is in charge of marketing the new model, said that two of the previous versions were built at Kashiwazaki in Japan in the late 1990's. ''They have 15 reactor years of proven operation,'' he said. Two more are under construction at Lungmen in Taiwan. 
 It is not certain, of course, whether anyone in the United States will order a new reactor in the next few years, although high prices for natural gas and uncertainty about what rules will apply to coal plants are creating interest.
 Most nuclear advocates are expecting federal help, perhaps in the form of a production tax credit, like the one given for windmills, for the first four or five reactors, on the theory that once the first few plants are built, costs will fall and other reactors will follow, unsubsidized, with a benefit to clean air and the national economy.
 Cost and construction time are only projections. David Lochbaum, who once worked as a start-up specialist for General Electric reactors and is now at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that frequently petitions to have plants shut for safety reasons, said that the best reactor is one that has not been built yet; its problems are still undiscovered.

HEADLINE: Some Wonder if the Surging Oil Market Is Ignoring Supply and Demand 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 14 

 BODY:
Even as oil prices flirt with record highs, a growing number of people in the energy industry, including the chairman of Exxon Mobil, are voicing concern over whether the soaring oil prices are justified by supply-and-demand conditions in the market. Some are even comparing the trading in energy markets to the speculative frenzy in technology stocks in the late 1990's. 
 The concerns are being raised as officials in pivotal oil-producing nations have aggressively signaled that prices may remain high or be pushed up even more in coming months. 
 Ali al-Naimi, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia, recently said that he expected prices to remain at $40 to $50 a barrel for the rest of the year, despite OPEC's previously established -- and lower -- price targets. Crude oil, currently near $55 a barrel, is already 45 percent more expensive than it was a year ago 
 The acting secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Adnan Shihab-Eldin of Kuwait, told reporters early in the month that $80-a-barrel oil was not out of the question if there were a sudden interruption in production. And an analysis from the Energy Department released last week said crude oil prices were expected to average around $50 a barrel this year.
 In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, crude oil for April delivery rose 52 cents, to settle at $54.95. The record closing price for a next-month contract was $55.17 last October; intraday, it touched $55.67 a barrel around that same time. 
 Yet, with oil inventories in the United States expanding and preliminary signs of weakening demand from China, some energy strategists are raising questions whether the market has gotten ahead of itself.
 Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Company in New York compared behavior in the oil market to the run-up in Nasdaq stocks that ended five years ago. ''The higher oil prices go, the closer we get to bursting the bubble,'' Mr. Gheit said. ''At some point the circuit breaker will kick in and the price will come down. I would not be surprised to see oil come back to $30.'' 
 There are, of course, ample reasons for speculators to justify higher prices. Imports by China have skyrocketed over the last couple of years, the American economy is growing despite the cost of gasoline and home heating oil, and fears persist over the possibility of terrorist attacks on oil wells and pipelines in Middle East countries like Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 
 But even in the energy industry's highest echelons, some are questioning the recent run-up in prices. Although crude oil remains far from its levels in 1981, when it averaged about $73 a barrel at today's prices after adjusting for inflation, it is much costlier than most forecasters expected a year ago. 
 ''We are in the mode where the fundamentals of supply and demand really don't drive the price,'' Lee R. Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest energy company, said at a meeting last week with analysts in New York. ''Oil is a commodity, and history tells us that commodity prices never stay high forever.''
 Few companies have profited from the recent increases in energy prices like Exxon Mobil, which this year surpassed General Electric as the world's largest company by market capitalization.
 Since the start of the year, Exxon Mobil's share price has climbed nearly 20 percent, closing on Monday at $61.28. The company's market value in the last year has grown by more than $180 billion, to nearly $393 billion, creating some unusual issues for investors. 
 Despite its good fortune, the company has reason to worry about the current price of crude oil.
 Paul Sankey, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said that ''at high oil prices, Exxon Mobil is left with too much cash and insufficient options,'' citing an estimated $20 billion in cash that the company has on its balance sheet. Mr. Sankey also noted the difficulty that Exxon Mobil and other international oil companies are having in securing access to oil reserves from governments emboldened by increasing oil revenue. 
 There are some indications that prices may be due for a decline. China's crude oil imports fell 12.7 percent in the first two months of the year, to 18.17 million tons, from the period a year earlier, the country's General Administration of Customs said last week. 
 In the United States, concern about a supply shortage is easing. The Energy Department said last Wednesday that oil inventories rose by 3.2 million barrels in the previous week, to 302.6 million barrels, the highest level since July. The nation's oil supplies are almost 10 percent higher than a year ago. 
 ''The numbers speak for themselves, but it's up to the market to interpret them,'' said Vincent Delisle, an energy strategist at Scotia Capital in Montreal. ''Anytime anyone says we're in a new era of oil prices, I feel the need to remind them that oil is a commodity and commodity prices are cyclical. We're in a mania environment for anything related to oil that lacks fundamental reasoning.'' 
 For every voice calling for moderation in the market, there are others putting forth reasons for oil prices to climb. The International Energy Agency said on Friday that it had increased its estimate for growth in worldwide demand for oil this year to 1.81 million barrels a day, a 2.2 percent rise from last year -- putting global consumption of oil at 84.3 million barrels a day. Much of the output to meet that demand will have to come from Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, and other OPEC countries.
 It may take a while for supplies to catch up. The Saudis are expected to quadruple drilling, to 60 rigs, but that is not expected to lead to marked production increases for about three years, said David Pursell, a principal at Pickering Energy Partners, an energy investment firm in Houston.
 ''At the end of the year,'' Mr. Pursell said, ''OPEC's going to be looking under the couch cushions for additional supply.''

HEADLINE: China to Meet With U.S. And Europe Over Exports

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 14 

 BODY:
China plans to hold talks with the United States and Europe to try to avoid trouble over China's rapidly growing exports of clothing, the government-run New China News Agency has reported.
 A delegation from the Chinese government will visit Washington and Brussels to tryo persuade officials not to act against exports of clothing by China, the news agency said on Sunday, citing Wang Shenyang, president of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Textiles.
 Mr. Wang could not be reached for comment Monday. Commerce ministry officials would not comment. 
 Richard Mills, a spokesman for the United States trade representative's office, said, ''We have an ongoing dialogue with China on a range of trade issues including textiles, but have not been contacted by the Chinese about a special textile delegation coming.'' 
 The announcement comes amid rising fears among the makers of Chinese clothing that the United States and the European Union may place new restrictions on Chinese imports after trade quotas on clothing were lifted worldwide on Jan. 1. That led to a jump in exports of Chinese clothing.
 In January, China's exports of clothing to countries in the European Union grew 47 percent compared with the period a year earlier. Exports of clothing to the United States soared 80 percent, according to Mr. Wang. That figure was even higher than the 75 percent estimated by an American industry group last week.
 Textile makers in the United States have pressed for restrictions on clothing from China. The European Union's trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, suggested last week that Europe might act on garment exports by China.
 But Chinese trade officials and exporters said the surge in exports was natural once low quotas were lifted. 
 ''China has a strong production capacity in some product lines, but the quotas given by the U.S. were very small, and so they aren't a reasonable base for assessing China's export growth,'' Mr. Wang told New China News Agency. His group represents many of China's biggest clothing exporters and it consults with the government on policy. 
 China's exports of trousers to the United States have increased eightfold since January 2004.The United States previously allotted China only 3 percent of all trousers imports, although China produces a third of the world's trousers, Mr. Wang said.
 ''It wouldn't be right for the E.U. and U.S. to impose restrictive measures on China's textile exports on the basis of just one month's statistics,'' he added. 
 Mr. Wang did not set out the specific objectives of the talks. But last week he told a visiting official from the United States Department of Commerce that the Chinese clothing industry would try to limit any excessive growth in exports, according to a notice Monday on the Web site of the China Chamber of Commerce.
 ''If exports grow too fast, the industry will formulate measures, and the government will give its support to any industry self-restraint measures,'' Mr. Wang said to the trade official, according to the Web posting.
 But other officials in the Chinese textile industry expressed fears that China's aggressive bid for new markets was unsustainable and could lead to price wars. 
 The boom in clothing exports is dangerous, an unidentified official from the Jiangsu Province Textile Association told the China News Agency, another government-run news service. ''We're in danger of becoming trapped in a vicious circle of price cutting, giving people an excuse to use 'dumping' charges that would bring utter disaster to the industry,'' he said.

HEADLINE: More Energy Follies

 BODY:
What this country needs is an energy strategy worthy of the enormous energy-related problems it faces: global warming, soaring energy costs and dependency on Middle East oil among them. Opening up the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drill for oil and gas is not such a strategy. Yet that is the road the Bush administration is headed down once again. 
 At the administration's request, Senate Republicans have put a drilling provision into a budget resolution that could be voted on this week. Since budget resolutions can't be filibustered, Republicans need only a simple majority, 51 votes, to open up a wilderness that has been off limits to commercial exploitation since the Carter administration. 
 That tactic has not worked in the past. The Republicans came close in 1995, passing a budget with a drilling provision in it that President Bill Clinton vetoed, precipitating a government shutdown. They think they have the votes again this year, and this time they have a president only too eager to sign it.
 In recent weeks, the administration has mounted a full-court press. Gale Norton, the interior secretary, and Samuel Bodman, the new energy secretary, recently toured the refuge with newer members of Congress, whose votes could be decisive. 
 In addition to the familiar economic arguments -- that the refuge is America's last great untapped source of domestic oil and is crucial to its competitiveness -- Ms. Norton emphasized one other line of thought, which she spelled out yesterday in an Op-Ed article in The Times. It is that drilling technology has advanced to the point where we are capable of extracting billions of barrels of oil without harming the refuge's fragile ecology or abundant wildlife.
 Environmentalists beg to disagree. Where Ms. Norton sees undisturbed tundra, they see hundreds of miles of pipelines, roads and drilling platforms, which would fragment wildlife habitats and corrupt a wilderness that, according to recent polls, a majority of Americans wish to leave undisturbed. We have expressed such reservations ourselves. But what troubles us most about President Bush's fixation on drilling is what it says about the shallowness of his energy policy.
 The numbers tell the story. The United States Geological Survey's best guess is that even at today's record-high prices -- in excess of $50 a barrel -- just under 7 billion barrels could profitably be brought to market. That's less than the 7.3 billion barrels this country now consumes in a year. At peak production -- about 1 million barrels a day in 2020 or 2025 -- the refuge would supply less than 4 percent of the country's projected daily needs. 
 Any number of modest efficiencies could achieve the same result without threatening the refuge. Simply closing the so-called S.U.V. loophole -- making light trucks as efficient over all as ordinary cars -- would save a million barrels a day. Increasing fuel-economy standards for cars by about 50 percent, to 40 miles per gallon, a perfectly reasonable expectation, would save 2.5 million barrels a day. And bipartisan commissions have offered even bigger ideas: tax credits to help automakers produce a whole new generation of fuel-efficient cars, for instance, or an aggressive biofuels program that would seek to replace one-quarter of the gasoline we use for cars with substitutes from agricultural products. 
 These programs would yield benefits -- less dependency on foreign sources, a decrease in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere -- long after the last drop of oil had been extracted from the refuge.
 Mr. Bush mentioned some of these ideas in a speech last week, but only in passing. His main emphasis was not on reducing demand, but on increasing supply by opening the refuge. That is where this administration has been ever since Dick Cheney's energy report of 2001. It was the wrong place to be then, and it is the wrong place now.

HEADLINE: The Rise of the Boards

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
With the ouster of the American International Group's chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, the turnover at the top of American companies is starting to look like a 10-car pileup. The upheaval is the strongest sign yet that boards are reacting forcefully to changes in governance put in place to clean up the scandal-ridden landscape of the last few years.
 The departures have multiplied this year, after last year's decision by Michael D. Eisner to give up his post as Disney's chairman after a shareholder revolt, and the forced retirement by Franklin D. Raines from Fannie Mae. The announcement that Mr. Greenberg would be stepping down as chief executive amid several regulatory inquiries brings to seven the number of high-profile executives who have been replaced, mostly against their will, in the last three months. 
 Amid a new culture of corporate openness, boards have acted to punish poor performance and ethical lapses to stem potential fallout from regulators, major customers and large investors. Their newfound vigilance stems in part from new federal rules and stock-exchange requirements that boards have more independent directors and act in a more transparent manner. The changing culture of boards themselves, after a series of ugly corporate scandals this decade, has also heightened their sensitivity to public-relations embarrassments.
 That so many chief executives have been ousted amid signs of an improving economy and market shows the strength of the trend toward greater scrutiny, said Evan Scott, president of the Evan Scott Group International, an executive search firm in Philadelphia.
 ''This is not coincidental at all,'' Mr. Scott said. ''Boards are flexing their muscles and beginning to take on the role they are supposed to take on, and that is very healthy for American business.''
 After the collapse of Enron in late 2001 and WorldCom in 2002, Congress required more vigilance by directors, auditors and other gatekeepers in the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-overhaul law. That measure, which strengthened auditor independence and made boards more responsible for financial results, created a model of corporate governance that is ''designed as a circuit breaker,'' said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ''Lately, the signal is that the governance mantra is actually working.
 ''The question is, Are boards getting too active? Are they pulling the trigger too quickly? I don't think so,'' Mr. Elson said. ''They are looking at these terminations over the long term.''
 Changes in listing requirements at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, more institutional investor activism and court decisions that have increased directors' financial liability for their decisions have all pushed boards to be more involved. The changes have spurred a shift in corporate culture.
 ''The fraternal culture that characterized America's boards is undergoing a dramatic change to a culture of skepticism,'' said Arthur Levitt Jr., the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now a senior adviser at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm in Washington. ''The humility and embarrassment of the past few years, combined with regulation, have changed the culture of boardrooms.'' 
 Just a few years ago, board members were reluctant to challenge chief executives and their strategies. ''You could go for years with crummy performance and bleed a company out of existence,'' Mr. Elson said. A board would do nothing until a chief executive decided it was time to go, he said.
 But increasingly, executives are reluctant to serve on boards at all if they cannot have a stronger hand in calling the shots, Mr. Scott said. The departure of Mr. Eisner, Disney's longtime chief, was a case where friction between him and a board seeking greater control after many years of passivity, led to its naming a successor. Hewlett-Packard's board was strongly behind the exit of Carleton S. Fiorina, who was deposed after she failed to produce the level of profits she had promised. 
 Sometimes boards are pushing chief executives to the exits in anticipation of similar moves by unhappy regulators. Mr. Raines was forced to resign once it became clear to the board that Fannie Mae's regulators at the S.E.C. and at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight were determined to rein in Fannie.
 Fear of scandal is also driving heightened scrutiny of executive performance. In the post-Enron era, cases like the ouster of Boeing's chief executive, Harry C. Stonecipher, who was forced to resign for carrying on an extramarital relationship, could become more common, said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm. 
 The affair came to the board's attention when an unidentified employee blew the whistle by providing some of Mr. Stonecipher's e-mail messages to the board. ''As we put in these internal whistle-blowing programs, they are going to turn up every bit of dirty laundry that used to be swept under the rug,'' Mr. Challenger said.
 Chief executives themselves, recognizing the need for perceived independence, are also backing away from involvement in the search for directors and relying more heavily on board search committees, corporate governance experts said.
 Beyond the high-profile cases, top executives have been moving on in record numbers recently. Last month, public and private American companies announced 103 chief executive changes, the most for any month in four years, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. It was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in four years and the first time that companies announced more than 100 chief executive changes since February 2001.
 As the economy continues to recover, expect more leadership changes at the top, Mr. Challenger said. Boards are looking for leaders with the technological and global vision to carry their companies through the next decade. He cited the selection by Sony's board this month of its first non-Japanese chief executive, Sir Howard Stringer, who ran Sony's American operations, as an ''extraordinary event'' that shows Sony's desire to be an even more globally responsive company.
 ''In a period of economic change, most companies are looking for visionaries who are willing to take risks and create more markets,'' Mr. Challenger said. ''That is different from the C.E.O.'s from 2001 to 2004 who were more risk-averse and prone to keeping their heads down.''
 But Mr. Levitt cautioned that chief executives, especially those who resemble the ''autocratic, muscular C.E.O. of the 1980's and 1990's that ruled with an iron fist,'' will continue to be vulnerable to being shown the exit. In this decade, successful chief executives will have more of a sense of the public interest and operate in a more consultative fashion with their boards, he said. ''And staying below the radar is not a bad idea.''

HEADLINE: Coal Mine 'Under the Radar' Stirs Cross-Border Feud

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: FERNIE, British Columbia 

 BODY:
Topping a mountain ridge after an hourlong, bone-jarring drive on a precipitous, rutted and muddy road, Henry Leuenberger, a Canadian hunting guide, gets out of his truck and surveys dozens of snow-mottled peaks around him. Then he hears the growl of a bulldozer below. ''It makes me sick to imagine a mine in here,'' he says. 
 For Mr. Leuenberger, it's not only the where of the mine, but the when. Scraping a new road in the inhospitable month of February to carry out feasibility work for a coal mine, he says, means the project, at Foisey Creek, is on a fast track to bypass the opposition of locals like him and a roster of staunch opponents in the United States. 
 ''It was under the radar screen,'' he said. ''No one knew about it until it started.''
 State and federal officials in Montana, downstream from the mine, were also incredulous they were not informed when an exploration permit was issued in November, despite a memorandum of understanding on mining issues signed by the province and the state last year.
 ''In light of the correspondence we had, it came as a complete shock,'' said Rich Moy, chairman of the Flathead Basin Commission, a group of local, state, federal and tribal officials concerned with the environmental integrity of the United States side of the Flathead drainage. 
 The commission has asked Montana's senators to refer the issue quickly to the International Joint Commission, a body established to settle these kind of cross-boundary disputes. 
 Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat of Montana, who has criticized the exploration and the absence of notice, has written to Premier Gordon Campbell of British Columbia, asking him to look again at the exploration and begin collecting environmental data.
 If the project continues, Mr. Baucus said, he will soon ask the State Department to have the commission get involved.
 ''I'd like to see the exploration stopped or at the least put on hold until we get data,'' Mr. Baucus said. That could take months or longer.
 In February, Mr. Baucus met in Fernie, which is in the southeast corner of British Columbia and about 30 miles from the United States border, with locals about the mine. 
 The potential for environmental damage has been an issue since the late 1970's, when a coal mine was first proposed for Cabin Creek, in the same area, just northwest of Glacier National Park in Montana and west of Waterton International Park in Alberta.
 Officials in the United States said then that they believed the mine would violate the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty, which forbids polluting the other country's waters. In 1988, the International Joint Commission found the mine would compromise the treaty. Plans were dropped, and the commission decision remains untested. 
 The wild valley cut by the Flathead River along the western boundary of Glacier spans the border. In 2003, the Wildlife Conservation Society studied the valley and said it contained the densest population of predators in the Lower 48 states and much of Canada. The valley is also a critical link between wildlife populations in Montana and Canada, providing the United States with a critical replenishment of new genes to a dwindling genetic pool.
 A proposal for a new mine in this valley surfaced last year, but was canceled in the face of opposition. Things were quiet until the Cline Mining Corporation began cutting the new road into Foisey Creek, a tributary of the North Fork of the Flathead. 
 While the state and province have an agreement that includes notification when development is planned, Richard Neufeld, minister of energy and mines for British Columbia, said exploration isn't significant enough to warrant notification. ''We will not do anything to spoil the Flathead River,'' he said. ''That would be totally irresponsible and to suggest we would do so is unfair.'' 
 But United States officials think even exploration could cause problems. Up to 2,000 tons of coal could be dug out of the ground during the exploration phase, and more than four miles of road and two tunnels are to be built.
 Ken Bates, president of Cline Mining in Toronto, would not comment on the controversy.
 Mr. Baucus and other critics say if a mine is dug here, it will probably be only a first step. Much of the region is contains high-grade coal, and there is concern about large-scale industrialization to fuel the booming Asian market. 
 If a mine at Foisey Creek moves ahead it would produce one million to two million tons of high-grade metallurgical coal a year. The price for it has nearly tripled to around $125 a ton, largely as a result of demand from China.
 At other coal mines in Canada, like Line Creek, not far from here, mountains of waste rock have collapsed, and settling ponds, which store the water used for processing the coal, have spilled over into streams. United States officials fear the same thing could happen if a mine is established here. 
 Nitrates used in explosives at the mine can also find their way to the water and, along with naturally occurring phosphorous in the coal-bearing rock, they could create severe algae blooms that could affect the river and Flathead Lake, the center of economic and social life in the Flathead Valley.
 ''People highly value the fact that Flathead Lake is clean, clear and blue,'' said Dr. Richard Hauer, a University of Montana limnologist who studies the Flathead River system at the Yellow Bay Biological Station on the lake. ''They don't want to see it brown or green. The mine could make a pretty bad mess of our water quality.''
 Mr. Neufeld responded: ''It's ridiculous to think we would muck up a river in B.C. and do something to a neighboring jurisdiction. We're not backward. We're a beautiful province, and we'll keep it that way. But we have to employ people.''

HEADLINE: How Electronics Are Penetrating North Korea's Isolation

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
Halfway through a video from North Korea, the camera pans on a propaganda portrait of Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, magnificent in his general's dress uniform with gold epaulets. Scribbled in black ink across his smooth face is a demand for ''freedom and democracy.''
 If genuine, the graffiti speaks of political opponents willing to risk execution to get their message out. If staged, the video means that a North Korean hustler was willing to deface a picture of the ''Dear Leader'' to earn a quick profit by selling it to a South Korean human rights group.
 Either way, the 35-minute video is the latest evidence that new ways of thinking are stealing into North Korea, perhaps corroding the steely controls on ideology and information that have kept the Kim family in power for almost 60 years. 
 The construction of cellular relay stations last fall along the Chinese side of the border has allowed some North Koreans in border towns to use prepaid Chinese cellphones to call relatives and reporters in South Korea, defectors from North Korea say. And after DVD players swept northern China two years ago, entrepreneurs collected castoff videocassette recorders and peddled them in North Korea. Now tapes of South Korean soap operas are so popular that state television in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, is campaigning against South Korean hairstyles, clothing and slang, visitors and defectors have said.
 ''In the 1960's in the Soviet Union, it was cool to wear blue jeans and listen to rock and roll,'' said Andrei Lankov, a Russian exchange student in the North at Kim Il Sung University in 1985, who now teaches about North Korea at Kookmin University here in the South. ''Today, it is cool for North Koreans to look and behave South Korean, as they do in the television serials. That does not bode well for the long-term survival of the regime.''
 Interest in the political hold of the Kim family has spiked since the North's claim that it has nuclear bombs and will continue to boycott disarmament talks. Analysts of the North usually focus on the governing elite, and some cracks have appeared there in the past year: the demotion of Kim Jong Il's brother-in-law, the defection of a few high-ranking military officers, the huge explosion that destroyed a rail station a few hours after Mr. Kim's train had passed through, and what appears to be the start of a succession battle among his three sons.
 Analysts are debating the importance of Mr. Kim's visits to military bases, which accounted for almost two-thirds of his 92 publicly divulged appearances last year, compared with one-third in 2003. With North Korea closed to American journalists, it is hard to decipher whether Mr. Kim is shoring up his power base in the army out of fear of a foreign attack or of an internal coup. 
 Past predictions that Mr. Kim's power was ebbing have not been borne out.
 ''We have very meager intelligence resources, and we're sort of flying blind,'' Howard H. Baker Jr. said on Feb. 16 in Tokyo, in his final news briefing as American ambassador to Japan. ''My country has no alternative but to assume that Kim Jong Il will continue in power. There won't be any significant change in the governance of that country.''
 Reviewing North Korea's political elite, ''we see no big change,'' said Noriyuki Suzuki, director of Radio Press, a Japanese government monitoring service that focuses on the North Korean media.
 ''But the bigger worry for him should be not in the core part of his power structure, but any move of distrust or dissatisfaction with the regime among the general public,'' Mr. Suzuki said, referring to Mr. Kim. He cited a recent joint editorial published in North Korea's three most important newspapers ''strongly warning against the flow of information from outside the country, warning against the inflow of capitalist elements through travel outside.''
 In the recording studio of a radio station here, Seong Min Kim, a former North Korean Army captain who is now the director for the South Korean radio station Free NK, explained how Chinese cellphones in North Korea have enabled him to nurture sources there. 
 ''He just dials 0082 to get the Korean-speaking Chinese operator, then makes a collect call to here,'' Mr. Kim said of one source. The prepaid cellphones are usually paid for by journalists in South Korea, he said, and the North Koreans go along largely out of curiosity or to try to make business deals. He added: ''They are getting more and more tech savvy. Now they are asking for cellphones with cameras attached.''
 At a human rights conference here on Feb. 15, defectors estimated in interviews that about one-third of the defectors in South Korea regularly talk to family members back in North Korea, calling owners of prepaid Chinese cellphones at a prearranged time.
 To counter this, North Korea has reportedly started border patrols using Japanese equipment that can track cellphone calls. Reporters tell stories of their contacts who only make calls from their private garden plots in the hills, burying the cellphone in the ground after each call.
 While Chinese cellphones only work a few miles inside North Korea, the videocassette phenomenon has reportedly spread throughout the nation, reaching into every area where there is electricity.
 ''They are within the reach of the average family,'' said Dr. Lankov, who regularly interviews recent defectors. ''They watch, almost exclusively, smuggled and copied South Korean movies and drama. Only a few weeks after airing here, they will go throughout North Korea.''
 More than showing middle-class family lifestyles, which can be staged in a studio, the soap operas also provide images of a modern Seoul -- the forest of high-rise buildings, the huge traffic jams, the late-model cars. 
 With such images showing a stark contrast with primitive conditions in North Korea, Mr. Kim ordered the formation of a special prosecutor's office last November to arrest people who deal in South Korean goods, largely videotapes, or who use South Korean expressions or slang, analysts in South Korea say.
 To crack down on home viewing of imported videotapes, the North Korean police developed the strategy of encircling a neighborhood in the evening, cutting off electricity, then inspecting players to find videotapes stuck inside, according to Young Howard, international coordinator of the Network for North Korean Democracy and Human Rights, a Seoul-based group. Recent defectors have also told Mr. Howard that police cars with loudspeakers have patrolled neighborhoods, warning residents to maintain their ''socialist lifestyle'' and to shun South Korean speech and clothing and hairstyles, he said.
 Aggressive moves by the United States have added to the information leaking into North Korea. Last fall, Congress unanimously approved the North Korea Human Rights Act, which provides for increased Korean-language radio broadcasting to North Korea and for helping North Korean refugees in China. 
 The law has been a favorite target of harsh denunciations from North Korea. In January, the official radio network blamed the United States for societal decay, accusing Washington of increasing the broadcasting hours of Radio Free Asia toward North Korea and ''massively infiltrating'' into North Korea ''portable transistor radios and impure publications and video materials.''
 Inside North Korea, social, political and economic controls have been eroded by two other changes over the past decade: private markets and a breakdown in travel restrictions, Dr. Lankov said.
 ''You have private money lenders, you have inns, you have brothels, you have canteens,'' he said, adding that most North Koreans survive through a combination of foreign aid and a fledgling private economy.
 Draconian controls on internal travel and on travel to China have been breaking down, he said, and hundreds of thousands of North Koreans have traveled to and from Korean-speaking areas of China, exposing them to a thriving market economy and more South Korean television broadcasts. 
 ''They are gradually learning about South Korean prosperity,'' Dr. Lankov said. ''This is a death sentence to the regime. North Korea's claim to legitimacy is based on its ability to deliver the worker's paradise now. What if everyone sees that it is not delivering?''

HEADLINE: Foreign Capital Inflows Rise (But Read the Small Print)

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
There was good news and troubling news in the new data on foreign inflows into American stocks and bonds.
 The good news, which helped send the dollar modestly higher against the euro, was that foreigners bought, on a net basis, $91.5 billion of American stocks and bonds in January, up from $60.7 billion in December. That net monthly inflow is second only to the $103.9 billion in May 2003, based on Treasury data. 
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent while the euro dropped to $1.3314, from $1.3368 Monday. 
 The troubling news was that 41 percent of the buying came from Caribbean countries, with much of that from hedge funds based there. The funds could easily reverse their positions and sharply lower the flow of money into the United States in the months ahead.
 This possibility appeared to have been partly responsible for the drop in Treasury prices yesterday and the rise in yields. The dollar also slipped against the yen, falling to 104.45, from 104.93 Monday. 
 Another surprise in the Treasury Department data was that American purchases of foreign stocks and bonds nearly ground to a halt. Because the purchases are counted as an outflow, the slowdown was the other reason net inflows were so big. Like hedge fund flows, this trend could also reverse quickly. 
 The numbers on inflows of foreign capital are being watched closely in the foreign exchange and bond markets because the United States current-account deficit is growing rapidly. It has to be covered by inflows of capital from abroad and if those capital flows slow, the dollar could fall and interest rates rise.
 For 2004, the current-account deficit -- the gap in the trade of goods and services that the United States has with the world -- is expected to be around $650 billion, a record. The fourth-quarter data, which will round out the year, is due today. 
 Asian central banks, which have been big buyers of Treasury securities, have slowed their purchases or have been sellers of American securities. So investors have been waiting to see if private investors would pick up the slack.
 ''The results may suggest that the foreign appetite for longer-term U.S. securities -- and especially non-Treasury products that are correlated with optimism on the U.S. economy -- is rising,'' said Steven Englander, chief foreign exchange strategist for the Americas at Barclays Capital.
 ''However,'' he said, ''the question is whether this will persist, as clearly the market fell out of love with U.S. assets at some point in February.''
 The net purchase of $91.5 billion of stocks and bonds, after deducting purchases of foreign stocks and bonds by Americans, showed that private foreign investors stepped in to buy as foreign central banks slowed their purchases. 
 Purchases of American stocks and bonds by official foreign institutions slowed to $14.3 billion in January, from $27.9 billion in November, while private purchases have risen to $78.2 billion, from $72.2 billion.
 In January, Japan was a net seller of $10.2 billion in Treasury securities while South Korea reduced its Treasury holdings by $1.3 billion and Singapore by $400 million.
 But most of the new private investment was $37.3 billion from Caribbean-based hedge funds.
 The sharp slowdown of purchases by Americans of foreign stocks and bonds came as the dollar rose in January against many foreign currencies, a move that reduced returns from abroad. 
 Net American purchases of foreign stocks and bonds fell to $1.1 billion in January, from $22.4 billion in December and $10.6 billion in November.

HEADLINE: The Calendar vs. the Purse

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 15 

 BODY:
As they mount their biggest effort in years to try to pass the state budget by the April 1 deadline, the three men who control Albany find themselves weighing the relative merits of punctuality versus a budget they like.
 It would be quite a feather in Gov. George E. Pataki's cap to be able to announce the state's first on-time budget in more than 20 years, regardless of whether he plans to seek a fourth term in 2006, step down from office or continue to explore a run for higher office. But winning on-time passage from the Legislature could prove costly for him: It might require Mr. Pataki to agree to hundreds of millions of dollars in extra spending, just as his spending record has come under increasing attack from conservatives. 
 Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's problem is the mirror image of the governor's. He, too, would like to be able to pass the budget on schedule, a top priority as well for many upstate Assembly Democrats who were attacked in last year's elections over the state's long record of late budgets. But Mr. Silver will be hard pressed to pass an on-time budget if it does not restore many of the governor's proposed cuts to Medicaid and spend more money on education and the state's transportation needs. 
 And Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader, finds himself, as usual, with a foot in each camp: longing for an on-time budget and reluctant to pick a public fight with Governor Pataki, his fellow Republican, but under pressure from the lawmakers in his conference to spend more, especially on education and health care.
 Hashing out these competing pressures in the next few weeks will not be easy.
 The Senate and the Assembly announced Tuesday morning that they wanted to spend roughly $1.5 billion more than the governor next year in a number of areas, and that they planned to convene a series of conference committees to decide which programs would get the money.
 Governor Pataki was not thrilled by the idea of adding $1.5 billion in spending. ''Just understand,'' he told Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno at a negotiating session on Tuesday evening, ''that where the numbers are right now -- that is not something that I can accept.''
 The governor announced that he was flying to Washington on Tuesday night to seek a waiver from the federal government that would provide New York with money to ease the transitional pain as it changes its Medicaid system to cut costs in the long term. 
 Aides to Mr. Pataki said they hoped that if the governor succeeded in winning the waiver, it would pave the way for a deal to overhaul the Medicaid system by allaying the short-term concerns of some of the groups opposed to the cuts.
 But the Legislative leaders are planning to restore $695 million of the $1.1 billion in Medicaid cuts that the governor has proposed. ''Reform, to us, is not doing less,'' Mr. Silver said at the meeting. ''It means delivering the same services more efficiently.''
 As the two houses form conference committees, though, big differences still divide them. The Assembly wants to retain an income tax surcharge on the state's top earners; the Senate does not. The Assembly wants to make economic need a bigger factor in the formula for distributing education spending; the Senate jealously guards the shares that suburban and upstate school districts receive under the current formula. 
 And even if the two houses come to an agreement soon, they will in all likelihood have to go back to Governor Pataki and open a whole new round of three-way negotiations before a budget can be passed.
 The governor faces his own competing pressures. He speaks frequently about the need to contain spending, the need to put at least $1 billion into reserve funds, the need to pass a budget that leaves the state's finances in good shape in the coming years. But if Mr. Pataki holds the line in calling for Medicaid cuts, he could find it much harder to get a budget passed on time. And the governor, whose approval numbers have dropped precipitously in recent months, faces the prospect of a huge advertising campaign attacking his proposals -- something the health care lobby has done in the past. 
 Asked this week about the tension between containing spending and meeting the budget deadline, Mr. Pataki said: ''There's always that tension, you know, that if you just open the doors it is easier to meet all the perceived needs, but that's not the right thing to do. I don't think there should be a problem being able to both meet the deadline, and do it with a budget that reflects the fiscal realities of the state of New York.''
 Mr. Silver, who warmly saluted Mr. Bruno when the meeting ended, went on to criticize the governor for seeking to cut an income tax surcharge on the state's biggest earners ahead of schedule, while raising tuition at the city and state universities. 
 Mr. Bruno summed up the position of the three men: ''The governor is in a particular place, that he has just shared with us in an articulate way,'' he said after the meeting. ''And we are where we are.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Lists Possible Terror Attacks and Likely Toll

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
The Department of Homeland Security, trying to focus antiterrorism spending better nationwide, has identified a dozen possible strikes it views as most plausible or devastating, including detonation of a nuclear device in a major city, release of sarin nerve agent in office buildings and a truck bombing of a sports arena. 
 The document, known simply as the National Planning Scenarios, reads more like a doomsday plan, offering estimates of the probable deaths and economic damage caused by each type of attack. 
 They include blowing up a chlorine tank, killing 17,500 people and injuring more than 100,000; spreading pneumonic plague in the bathrooms of an airport, sports arena and train station, killing 2,500 and sickening 8,000 worldwide; and infecting cattle with foot-and-mouth disease at several sites, costing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Specific locations are not named because the events could unfold in many major metropolitan or rural areas, the document says. 
 The agency's objective is not to scare the public, officials said, and they have no credible intelligence that such attacks are planned. The department did not intend to release the document publicly, but a draft of it was inadvertently posted on a Hawaii state government Web site. 
 By identifying possible attacks and specifying what government agencies should do to prevent, respond to and recover from them, Homeland Security is trying for the first time to define what ''prepared'' means, officials said.
 That will help decide how billions of federal dollars are distributed in the future. Cities like New York that have targets with economic and symbolic value, or places with hazardous facilities like chemical plants could get a bigger share of agency money than before, while less vulnerable communities could receive less. 
 ''We live in a world of finite resources, whether they be personnel or funding,'' said Matt A. Mayer, acting executive director of the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness at the Homeland Security Department, which is in charge of the effort. 
 President Bush requested the list of priorities 15 months ago to address a widespread criticism of Homeland Security from members of Congress and antiterrorism experts that it was wasting money by spreading it out instead of focusing on areas or targets at greatest risk. Critics also have faulted the agency for not having a detailed plan on how to eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities.
 Michael Chertoff, the new secretary of homeland security, has made it clear that this risk-based planning will be a central theme of his tenure, saying that the nation must do a better job of identifying the greatest threats and then move aggressively to deal with them.
 ''There's risk everywhere; risk is a part of life,'' Mr. Chertoff said in testimony before the Senate last week. ''I think one thing I've tried to be clear in saying is we will not eliminate every risk.''
 The goal of the document's planners was not to identify every type of possible terrorist attack. It does not include an airplane hijacking, for example, because ''there are well developed and tested response plans'' for such an incident. Planners included the threats they considered the most plausible or devastating, and that represented a range of the calamities that communities might need to prepare for, said Marc Short, a department spokesman. ''Each scenario generally reflects suspected terrorist capabilities and known tradecraft,'' the document says. 
 To ensure that emergency planning is adequate for most possible hazards, three catastrophic natural events are included: an influenza pandemic, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake in a major city and a slow-moving Category 5 hurricane hitting a major East Coast city.
 The strike possibilities were used to create a comprehensive list of the capabilities and actions necessary to prevent attacks or handle incidents once they happen, like searching for the injured, treating the surge of victims at hospitals, distributing mass quantities of medicine and collecting the dead. 
 Once the White House approves the plan, which could happen within the next month, state and local governments will be asked to identify gaps in fulfilling the demands placed upon them by the possible strikes, officials said.
 No terrorist groups are identified in the documents. Instead, those responsible for the various hypothetical attacks are called Universal Adversary.
 The most devastating of the possible attacks -- as measured by loss of life and economic impact -- would be a nuclear bomb, the explosion of a liquid chlorine tank and an aerosol anthrax attack.
 The anthrax attack involves terrorists filling a truck with an aerosolized version of anthrax and driving through five cities over two weeks spraying it into the air. Public health officials, the report predicts, would probably not know of the initial attack until a day or two after it started. By the time it was over, an estimated 350,000 people would be exposed, and about 13,200 would die, the report predicts.
 The emphasis on casualty predictions is a critical part of the process, because Homeland Security officials want to establish what kinds of demands these incidents would place upon the public health and emergency response system. 
 ''The public will want to know very quickly if it is safe to remain in the affected city and surrounding regions,'' the anthrax attack summary says. ''Many persons will flee regardless of the public health guidance that is provided.''
 Even in some cases where the expected casualties are relatively small, the document lays out extraordinary economic consequences, as with a radiological dispersal device, known as a ''dirty bomb.'' The planning document predicts 540 initial deaths, but within 20 minutes, a radioactive plume would spread across 36 blocks, contaminating businesses, schools, shopping areas and homes, as well as transit systems and a sewage treatment plant.
 The authors of the reports have tried to make each possible attack as realistic as possible, providing details on how terrorists would obtain deadly chemicals, for example, and what equipment they would be likely to use to distribute it. But the document makes clear that ''the Federal Bureau of Investigation is unaware of any credible intelligence that indicates that such an attack is being planned.''
 Even so, local and state governments nationwide will soon be required to collaboratively plan their responses to these possible catastrophes. Starting perhaps as early as 2006, most communities would be expected to share specially trained personnel to handle certain hazardous materials, for example, instead of each city or town having its own unit.
 To prioritize spending nationwide, communities or regions will be ranked by population, population density and an inventory of critical infrastructure in the region.
 The communities in the first tier, the largest jurisdictions with the highest-value targets, will be expected to prepare more comprehensively than other communities, so they would be eligible for more federal money.
 ''We can't spend equal amounts of money everywhere,'' said Mr. Mayer, of the Homeland Security Department.
 To some, the extraordinarily detailed planning documents in this effort -- like a list of more than 1,500 distinct tasks that might need to be performed in these calamities -- are an example of a Washington bureaucracy gone wild. 
 ''The goal has to be to get things down to a manageable checklist,'' said Gary C. Scott, chief of the Campbell County Fire Department in Gillette, Wyo., who has served on one of the many advisory committees helping create the reports. ''This is not a document you can decipher when you are on a scene. It scared the living daylights out of people.'' But federal officials and some domestic security experts say they are convinced that this is a threshold event in the national process of responding to the 2001 attacks.
 ''Our country is at risk of spending ourselves to death without knowing the end site of what it takes to be prepared,'' said David Heyman, director of the homeland security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based research organization. ''We have a great sense of vulnerability, but no sense of what it takes to be prepared. These scenarios provide us with an opportunity to address that.''

HEADLINE: An Overnight Infirmary Is a Campus Luxury

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
Arwen Sheridan felt terrible. She had a sore throat, swollen glands and a fever that came and went for weeks. 
 ''Even brushing my hair hurt,'' she said.
 A student at George Washington University in the District of Columbia, Ms. Sheridan visited the campus health center, where she was tested for strep throat, given Tylenol and told to return in a week if she did not feel better. The health center could not offer her an overnight bed because, like a growing number of colleges, George Washington does not have a 24-hour infirmary. 
 Instead, Ms. Sheridan returned to her dorm, languished in bed and dragged herself to midterm exams until a roommate took her to the hospital, where mononucleosis was diagnosed. A few days later she went home to Delaware for spring break.
 ''The minute I came home my Mom put me to bed, and I was not allowed to get out,'' Ms. Sheridan said. ''I was a mess.'' She added that her mother, a nurse, had thought that George Washington had an overnight infirmary.
 In fact, the university has never had overnight beds for sick students, and many large universities that once did have infirmaries, like Cornell, Tufts, New Hampshire and Vermont, shut them down long ago. Smaller liberal arts colleges hung on a bit longer, but many, like Williams, Kenyon and Bowdoin, also no longer provide overnight beds. Duke University closed its 10-bed unit in 2002, and Syracuse University is considering shutting down its infirmary this fall. 
 ''A lot, if not the majority of schools did this 10 or 15 years ago,'' said James R. Jacobs, director of health services at Syracuse. ''There are a few holdouts, but ultimately there will be very few schools that will have overnight capacity.''
 The main reason is financial. College health care services face the same rising costs as the overall health care system, but also have to deal with shrinking educational budgets. 
 ''Cost is the No. 1 driver,'' said Stephen L. Beckley, president of SLBA, a Colorado-based consulting firm for college health care programs. ''At one school where we helped close the infirmary, for them to see a student on Sunday morning, it cost $300 for that one visit.''
 He added that at smaller schools, an overnight infirmary often used 25 percent of the health care budget; for larger institutions, infirmaries account for closer to 10 to 15 percent of the health care budget.
 When Cornell closed its overnight infirmary in 1996, it was then costing the school $290,000 a year to run it. The previous year 418 patients were admitted to the unit, so on average the cost per student was roughly $690. 
 Liability is also a concern. Mr. Beckley said that the majority of lawsuits in college health care involved infirmaries. Once a student is put to bed, the college is assuming custodial care for that patient. 
 A generation ago, overnight care at a college infirmary might have been as good as what a community hospital could offer, but today, unless the infirmary has a 24-hour laboratory, radiology department and other services available, it may not be equipped to handle overnight emergencies as well. 
 Mr. Beckley went so far as to suggest that some college infirmaries were unsafe.
 ''The middle ground of care is dangerous,'' he said. ''If you have to hook someone up to an IV, and you've got Nurse Ratched there who is not up to date on her training and she might miss something, that's scary.''
 Drinking, which some college medical directors say is the No. 1 health problem on campus, adds to the difficulty. Ted W. Grace, director of student health at Ohio State University, said many college infirmaries had evolved into ''drunk tanks.'' Tucking a drunken college student into bed, however, is far from good medicine. Extremely intoxicated students who show up at an infirmary (or more likely are dropped off by their friends) may also have injuries that are not readily apparent. Drugs can also add to the mixture of uncertainty about treatment. 
 ''Intensive care nurses hated it when I used to write on certain injuries and overdoses, 'Check vital signs every 15 minutes,''' Dr. Grace said. ''In the hospital they have the capability of getting an alcohol level stat, they can monitor oxygen in your blood and they would know immediately to respond. Now just think about putting someone to sleep at a small college infirmary.'' 
 Most campuses maintain health clinics for students during daytime hours, and also have protocols for nighttime emergencies. Generally, larger universities offer a wider range of services. Some maintain overnight telephone nurse service, and most have doctors on call who can admit students to local hospitals if necessary.
 Some schools that have closed their infirmaries have made arrangements with local hospitals for amenities like telephone access to the emergency room staff or lower co-payments for visits. At most hospitals, local college students are treated the way any other patient would be.
 The shift away from overnight infirmaries reflects schools' continuing move away from their traditional role of ''in loco parentis.'' Health laws recognize students 18 and older as adults, and their medical records may not be released to their parents without written consent. 
 ''If they weren't in college, they'd be out there dealing with their health care on their own,'' said Jim Mitchell, director of student health service at Montana State University and past president of the American College Health Association. 
 Mr. Mitchell said part of the role of college health services was to help students, often away from home for the first time, learn how to take care of themselves when they are ill. 
 At Syracuse, for instance, students with the flu are sent back to their room with a bag from health services that approximates the care that a mother might provide. The bag contains soup packages, ginger ale, salt to gargle with, Tylenol, and sometimes Gatorade if the student is dehydrated. 
 ''Their mom was still taking them to the pediatrician's office at 17,'' said Dr. Jacobs, the Syracuse health director. ''We try to strike a balance between providing nurturing and being sensitive to their needs as sick kids and their responsibilities and rights as young adults.'' 
 Jean Hansen, director of administration services for Duke Student Health, said that in a few cases since the infirmary was closed, parents have rented a motel room near campus and had their ailing child stay with them and venture out only for classes. 
 Some schools have kept their infirmaries open, including Dartmouth, the University of Connecticut and Middlebury College. They argue that not only is the health care they provide good, but also that infirmaries play an important role in the health of college students. 
 John H. Turco, director of Dartmouth's health service, said the school's 10-bed infirmary, with two registered nurses on staff 24 hours a day, provided an important intermediate level of care attuned to the needs of students. Those who are moderately ill -- too sick to recover in a dormitory but not sick enough to be hospitalized -- are otherwise at risk for losing a semester, because without an infirmary, their next best option is to recover at home.
 When home is in another state, it can be tough to keep up academically. Dr. Turco said that at Dartmouth's infirmary, the staff was highly aware of both the academic calendar and the college culture, and worked with deans to help patients in the infirmary remain active students.
 ''It's kind of hard to ask that community hospital to be sensitive that -- 'Hey, I need to be out of here to get to an 8 a.m. class.''' Dr. Turco said. ''If the doctors are making rounds at 9, they're not going to be very amenable to that. We can adopt what is happening at the health center to the school.''
 Dr. Jacobs, of Syracuse, said that if money were no object, he, too, would like to keep a 24-hour infirmary open, fully staffed with two registered nurses and a doctor on call, but he described maintaining such a setup in today's economic climate as a luxury.
 ''If we could continue it, I would, because though only a few students benefit, those that do, truly benefit,'' he said. ''But the reality is that looking at the limited utilization and the resources of keeping the building open over night, it simply doesn't make sense.''

HEADLINE: Denouncing Elections, Protesters Gather for Rallies in Kyrgyzstan

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER PALA

DATELINE: JALALABAD, Kyrgyzstan, March 15 

 BODY:
Protesters staged rallies and occupied government offices in several towns across this former Soviet republic on Tuesday, in one case forcing the authorities to reinstate an opposition lawmaker who had lost his seat in runoff elections widely criticized as rigged. 
 The protests were largely peaceful with demonstrators entering local administration offices without violence or resistance by the police. 
 But in a television address from the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, President Askar A. Akayev hit out at the opposition, saying that some of the losing candidates had ''taken off the mask of democracy and stepped on the path of illegal seizure of power.'' 
 Mr. Akayev warned that the protesters risked drawing the country into ''an abyss of civil war.''
 In the town of Uzgen, protests forced the authorities to reinstate an opposition member of Parliament, Adakhan Maduvanov, after his followers seized the city hall. The election commission initially declared him a loser, but later reversed itself, saying Mr. Maduvanov had won. The move brought to seven the number of opposition candidates winning seats in runoff elections on Sunday. The opposition held 17 seats in the previous Parliament. 
 In Washington on Tuesday, a State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli, urged the government to ''investigate allegations of fraud and misconduct, promptly and transparently.'' 
 Here in the country's most rebellious city, in the crowded and impoverished Fergana Valley, about 2,000 people gathered in front of the main administration building, which protesters have occupied for the past 10 days, for a traditional gathering called a kurultai. 
 While several hundred police officers, some in riot gear, looked on, speaker after speaker denounced the elections and accused Mr. Akayev of helping his family amass political and economic power -- two of his children won seats -- while their own lives were getting harder. United Nations officials say that even through the country's economy is growing at a rate of 5 percent a year, infant mortality is high and rising, while life expectancy is falling. 
 Though Mr. Akayev, who has been in power for 15 years, has pledged not to run in presidential elections set for Oct. 30, protesters have called for his immediate resignation. 
 At the gathering here, a local opposition figure was elected to replace the regional governor, who has had to set up his office at a nearby police station because the government buildings were occupied by protesters. ''The opposition has lost its mind,'' the governor, Jusupbek Sharipov, grumbled.
 The former prime minister Kurmanbek Bakiyev, a front-runner for the October presidential race, said in an interview that more such gatherings would be held around the country. ''How else can we put up with this fraud?'' he asked.
 Eventually, he said, protests will reach Bishkek, which so far has remained quiet. 
 Mr. Bakiyev lost his seat in Parliament in the runoff.

HEADLINE: New Rules Set For Emission Of Mercury

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency released its final rule on mercury emissions from power plants on Tuesday, asserting that allowing companies to buy and sell the right to pollute would encourage control of the biggest sources of mercury first. 
 Mercury from smokestacks poses a hazard, especially to children and developing fetuses, because it eventually ends up in rivers and lakes, where it is absorbed by fish that are then caught and eaten by people. 
 Some environmentalists said the agency should have simply required uniform emission limits, to reduce concentrations everywhere. They say the new rule means that some plants will end up doing nothing to curb emissions, allowing mercury ''hot spots'' to persist, affecting the health of people living nearby. 
 But Jeffrey R. Holmstead, the assistant administrator, defended the ''cap and trade'' system, already used for a pollutant that causes acid rain. ''The highest deposition is in areas where there are concentrations of very large power plants,'' Mr. Holmstead said. ''Because of the economies of scale when it comes to pollution control, all of our analysis and experience with acid rain shows the largest plants are the ones that control the most, and control the soonest.''
 Economists say the cost of eliminating a ton of pollution is lower under cap and trade than under a blanket rule. 
 Some environmentalists disagreed, though, that the cap-and-trade concept would work for mercury. Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense, which is based in New York, said that while other pollutants were under a cap-and-trade system, they were also regulated with ''a cascade of other clean air programs to ensure that health standards are met everywhere.'' In contrast, he said, mercury is a highly potent neurotoxin and this is the only rule that applies to it. 
 ''In this case trading is just completely inappropriate because of the nature of the pollutant and the lack of other safeguards,'' he said.
 But Mr. Holmstead said the system gave companies an incentive to start controls early, so they could save up credits and delay final compliance. He predicted that emissions by 2010 would fall to 31 tons, lower than the target of 38 tons. The current level is 48 tons per year.
 On March 10 the Environmental Protection Agency announced a ''clean air interstate rule'' that will further limit emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, and in controlling those two pollutants, power plants will also be filtering out mercury.

HEADLINE: Philadelphians Take In Rare Sight: A Tower Rising

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, March 13 

 BODY:
When Kelli J. Lucas takes the train into town, she has noticed that the conversation among passengers often turns to the dazzling glass office tower being built on the west bank of the Schuylkill, just outside the city's central business district. 
 ''I'm fascinated by the shape -- by the transparency of the skin,'' Ms. Lucas, 24, said of the design of the $177.6 million Cira Centre. ''It can totally transform from day to night, depending on whether the light is from the inside or outside.'' 
 Indeed, the building's architect, Cesar Pelli, said he had been surprised by the excitement his design generated. ''I've been receiving a lot of feedback -- more so than other buildings in other cities,'' said Mr. Pelli, whose work includes the giant tapering Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ''I'm not sure why that is.'' 
 The answer is simple, economic development officials say. City residents have not witnessed the construction of a skyline-altering office tower in 15 years. There are a variety of reasons: corporate mergers, a lackluster economy and business flight to the suburbs.
 ''There's a whole generation of people who never saw a major building get built in Philadelphia,'' said Peter S. Longstreth, president of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, a public-private economic development company.
 What is more, the site of the Cira Centre is noteworthy. At 29 floors, it is the tallest office tower on the west side of the Schuylkill. It stands on Arch Street next to Amtrak's 30th Street Station, effectively creating a striking new western gateway to the city. In addition, planners and economic development officials say, the building promises to propel efforts to reinvigorate the riverfront and University City neighborhood, once a forbidding area and one that is still far from thriving.
 When the first tenants begin moving into the Cira Centre in October, they will be the advance guard for about 2,000 workers. The University City neighborhood is named for the educational institutions there, including the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University and University of the Sciences of Philadelphia. The building's name, however, was the product of brainstorming and has no meaning, the developer said.
 ''In five years, this area will look very different,'' said Omar Blaik, senior vice president at the University of Pennsylvania, which has ambitious plans for land it owns south of the train station. 
 According to Mr. Blaik, more than $1 billion in improvements have been made in University City over the last 10 years by the universities, Amtrak, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and private investors. From 1998 to 2004, house price appreciation in University City, primarily a tree-lined neighborhood of semidetached homes built during the late 1800's, averaged 24 percent annually, outpacing all other city neighborhoods, according to research done by Kevin C. Gillen, a doctoral candidate at the Wharton School, part of Penn. It is now a diverse community of almost 48,000 people, including members of the universities' faculty and staff, artists, musicians, writers and thousands of students.
 The expansion of the city's commercial district to the west side of the Schuylkill and the revitalization of West Philadelphia have been a dream for decades. When the Pennsylvania Railroad began work on the 30th Street Station in the 1920's, architectural renderings of the classical-style station show the structure ringed by buildings.
 ''It was intriguing to me that when I went to look at the old drawings, I saw a plan that was done 80 years ago that envisioned the same thing we're trying to create today,'' said Gerard H. Sweeney, chief executive of the Cira Centre's developer, Brandywine Realty Trust, a publicly traded real estate investment trust in Plymouth Meeting, Pa.
 Despite a number of unsuccessful proposals for the land near the station over the years, including plans for a convention center, development did not venture far beyond Center City, the district between the Delaware River to the east and the Schuylkill to the west.
 That began to change in 1997, when Amtrak spearheaded a movement to redevelop some of the 70 acres it owns near its 30th Street Station. 
 Amtrak began with the development of a much-needed 1,525-car garage off Arch Street. It then offered a neighboring 30,000-square-foot parcel for an office tower. Brandywine was selected as the developer for the tight site, positioned between the active passenger tracks and the coach yard.
 The railroad, which signed a 99-year-lease with Brandywine, was interested in making an architectural statement with the Cira Centre. Mr. Sweeney said he had reservations about being adventurous with design in such a high-risk location. But Cesar Pelli & Associates won him over because the firm focused on the building's place in the skyline. 
 Other than four piers that hold some commercial development on the Delaware River waterfront, Brandywine is a newcomer to the city itself, although most of its 300 buildings are in the greater Philadelphia region, including central and southern New Jersey and Delaware.
 The design by Mr. Pelli turned out to be ''a stroke of genius,'' Mr. Sweeney said. Because 30th Street Station is so square and massive, Mr. Pelli said he wanted the Cira Centre to be ''very contemporary, luminous and sparkling.''
 The 727,725-square-foot building with a glass curtain wall has the look of a quartz crystal at different times of the day. The 42-foot-high lobby is a profusion of angles with a commanding view of the city; an elevated pedestrian bridge runs from the Amtrak garage through the lobby into the 30th Street Station. About 37,000 square feet on the lower levels have been set aside as conference, retail and restaurant space.
 The building, now three-quarters complete, is leasing ahead of schedule, with nearly 75 percent of the tower taken. Space is leasing around the mid-$30's a square foot, which is about $10 a square foot higher than top-tier space in Center City, according to Matthew Guerrieri, research services manager with the Philadelphia office of Grubb & Ellis, a real estate services firm.
 Because Brandywine wanted the building to be about 50 percent leased before starting construction, it was the signing of two Center City law firms that kicked off the project in December 2003. The Dechert firm took eight floors and Woodcock Washburn leased four. But the firms were criticized for the tax relief they will receive until 2018 for relocating to an opportunity improvement zone. One critic, Mr. Gillen of Wharton, said the Cira Centre project was stretching the definition of a distressed area and, in turn, benefiting wealthy, established firms.
 Dechert's chairman, Barton J. Winokur, counters that his firm was poised to move its entire operations center and part of its legal offices out of the city. It was a credible threat. Statistics show suburban flight in the last decade and a half. The amount of occupied space in Philadelphia's suburbs in Delaware, Montgomery, Bucks and Chester Counties increased 63.8 percent from 1990 to 2004, while occupied space in the city fell by 8 percent in the period, according to Mr. Guerrieri.
 The tax benefit of moving to the Cira Centre influenced Dechert's decision, Mr. Winokur said. But the firm also wants to be part of the city's effort to redevelop University City, he said. 
 Another major tenant is SCA Americas, a maker of packaging materials, paper towels, napkins and other paper products. It will relocate from Eddystone, Pa., to four floors in the building. 
 John O'Rourke, SCA's vice president for human resources, said the Cira Centre was attractive because it is close to Eddystone, so employees will not have to relocate. It is also near transportation hubs and it fits the image SCA wants to project.
 The paper company also liked the idea that Penn had plans to redevelop the Main Post Office property next to the train station, he said. The university purchased the 24-acre property with its one-million-square-foot postal facility last year for $50.6 million as part of its plan to expand eastward toward Center City. The property is still occupied by the post office and used for mail sorting, vehicle parking and maintenance work, among other things. Penn is not expected to begin work until 2007.
 Still, some critics say the Cira Centre is cannibalizing downtown and contributing to greater office vacancies in Center City. At 16 percent, the vacancy rate has risen to levels not seen in more than 10 years, Mr. Guerrieri said.
 Proponents of the project maintain that the long-term benefits to the city will be well worth it. 
 ''I really do believe the seeds have been planted for a connection between Center City and the University City district,'' said Stephen P. Mullin, a principal in the Econsult Corporation in University City.

HEADLINE: Descendants Following Divergent Paths

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The jaw is pure Roosevelt, thrust out with the kind of patrician confidence that shepherded America through the Great Depression and World War II.
 But in at least one surprising way Joshua Boettiger, the 31-year-old great-grandson of Franklin and Eleanor, is not a Roosevelt in the classic aristocratic mold. He is studying to be a rabbi, working with a small congregation, Mishkan Ha'am, in southern Westchester County and Riverdale in the Bronx. He credits Franklin and Eleanor's striving for social justice as an inspiration and believes Eleanor would have particularly given him her blessing.
 ''She was a traitor to her class in the best sense and I hope we're all following in her footsteps,'' he said. 
 Indeed, he is not alone among Roosevelt descendants in taking paths that do not seem to rendezvous with their presumed destiny. Nearly 60 years after the president's death, his descendants are spreading in directions that are both wide-ranging and, in some cases, unexpected.
 One grandson, James Roosevelt Jr., spent a year as a novice at a California monastery of a Catholic order, the Christian Brothers, though he eventually became a Boston lawyer who made an unsuccessful stab at a Congressional seat against another dynastic heir, Joseph P. Kennedy II. Nina Roosevelt Gibson, a granddaughter, is an Arizona psychologist who has worked with children of drug-addicted and abusive parents. Dr. David Russell Luke, a great-grandson, is a mathematics professor who studies topics like nonsmooth analysis. And Amelia Roosevelt, a great granddaughter, is a concert violinist.
 One grandson, Frank Roosevelt, flirted with Marxism in the 1970's and has made it a specialty of his economics teaching at Sarah Lawrence College. But another grandson, Elliott Roosevelt Jr., known as Tony, is a Texas oilman and has supported President Bush's plan to overhaul Social Security, the domestic program for which his grandfather is best known.
 These life stories tell volumes about the flexibility of social class and ethnicity in the United States, where even a Roosevelt can become a rabbi, but if anyone is responsible for this potpourri of Roosevelt pursuits, it may be Franklin and Eleanor. 
 The Roosevelt biographers James MacGregor Burns and Doris Kearns Goodwin say that Franklin and Eleanor's example gave, in Mr. Burns's words, ''a kind of permission to descendants to move as widely as they wished.'' Eleanor's example particularly encouraged many of her five children and 29 grandchildren to find friends in a variety of circles and to do battle with social inequities.To be sure, many descendants of this New York State clan have taken more predictable paths, studying at prep schools like Groton, working for white-shoe law firms, running charities, marrying upper-crust names like Havemeyer and du Pont and taking roles in their Episcopal churches. But others have veered from those paths, sometimes sharply.
 Hall Delano Roosevelt, 47, a grandson, remembered three decades ago when his father, James, told him they ought to tour ''the campus.''
 ''What campus?'' he asked.
 ''Harvard,'' the father replied.
 But the younger Mr. Roosevelt told his father he did not want to go to Harvard like his older brothers, Michael and James. 
 ''At that point my hair was down to my shoulders and the only thing important in my life was surfing,'' he said. 
 He enrolled in Orange Coast College, a junior college in California minutes from the beach. For a time he broiled steaks at a restaurant, but he eventually found his way into jobs in energy conservation and is now an environmental consultant. He even picked up his dynastic calling by running as a city councilman in Long Beach, Calif., serving from 1996 to 2000. ''One thing I learned on my father's knee is when you get to a point in life where you've worked hard and gotten yours, we have an absolute obligation to help somebody else get theirs,'' he said.
 Franklin and Eleanor were fifth cousins and the descendants of Claes Martenszen van Rosenvelt, who landed in New Amsterdam during the 1640's. Both Roosevelts grew up with the blueblood trappings of a Henry James and Edith Wharton novel, though Eleanor was orphaned at 10. But Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, who has an uncanny likeness to her grandmother Eleanor and is a board member of the March of Dimes, said that Franklin and Eleanor both spurned lives of genteel ease for public service.
 Eleanor took uncommon roles for a woman of her time, serving as a United Nations delegate and newspaper columnist, surrounding herself with labor leaders and officials of black and Jewish groups.
 John R. Boettiger, a 65-year-old grandson of the couple, said that the five children of the president struggled under the weight of their parents' achievements. They each married more than once and never quite felt comfortable in the skin of their careers. Three sons struggled with alcohol.
 ''How do you compete with the commander in chief of the Western world or the first lady of the Western world?'' asked Mr. Boettiger, a retired professor of psychology.
 But most members of subsequent generations simply gave up on emulation. ''There is this legacy to live up to, but I'm never going to win a world war,'' said Lulie Haddad, the 38-year-old daughter of Kate Roosevelt Whitney, a granddaughter of Franklin and Eleanor, who married a tabloid newspaper reporter. 
 Files at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, N.Y., suggest that the Roosevelt maverick streak was evident early on. After an expected first marriage to a reputable stockbroker, Anna Roosevelt, the eldest daughter, took a loop out of the film ''It Happened One Night'' and married Clarence John Boettiger, a working-class reporter for The Chicago Tribune whom she met as he was covering Roosevelt's first presidential campaign. 
 The second of Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.'s five wives, Felicia Schiff Warburg Sarnoff, came from the ''Our Crowd'' German Jewish gentry. And the youngest son, John, seconded the nomination of Dwight Eisenhower at the 1952 Republican convention. One Roosevelt granddaughter, Sara Delano Roosevelt, caused a mild sensation in 1953 when she married a piano prodigy who was the son of an immigrant barber.
 But he said that one generation later, he and the other grandchildren were able to take departures in their careers or marriages because his grandmother ''had a sense of explicitly recognizing the promise of her grandchildren, whatever their leanings.''
 Mr. Boettiger married Janet Adler, the daughter of a small-town Jewish family from Indiana. It is their son Joshua who is studying at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Wyncote, Pa. 
 Among Jews, Mr. Boettiger is usually asked how he can rationalize why Franklin Roosevelt did not rescue more Jews from the Nazis, and did not bomb the railroad tracks leading to Auschwitz. 
 ''On the one hand this was the president most beloved by the Jews ever -- who did more for the poorer Jewish community than had anyone -- a friend of the Jews,'' he said. ''And people are trying to square that with the fact that he didn't do as much as could have saving Jews from the Nazi machine. Somehow we have to hold both thoughts.''
 Whatever their doubts, the descendants seem unanimous in their pride in Franklin and Eleanor. Frank Roosevelt, the professor of Marxism, led the effort to build a monument to his grandmother in Riverside Park. But they are also proud that the way Franklin and Eleanor lived their lives made it easier to shape their own.
 When he attends the next family reunion, perhaps as an ordained rabbi, Mr. Boettiger said, ''I'll take my place among the other funky Roosevelts who have taken alternate paths.''

HEADLINE: Declines in Chip Shares and in A.I.G. Pull Indexes Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as investors sold semiconductor shares, including Intel, while a 3 percent decline in the insurer American International Group weighed down blue chips. 
 Stocks were also shaken after samples collected from a Defense Department mail center tested positive for anthrax. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.41 points, or 0.55 percent, to 10,745.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 9.08 points, or 0.75 percent, at 1,197.75, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 16.06 points, or 0.78 percent, to 2,034.98. 
 All three indexes closed at their lowest level since Feb. 23. 
 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange index of semiconductor stocks dropped 2 percent after Merrill Lynch said in a research note that semiconductor makers had limited opportunity for growth. 
 Shares of Applied Materials, which supplies equipment for making chips, fell 33 cents, or 2 percent, to $16.20, after the company warned of waning sales to China. Intel, the chip maker, dropped 39 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $23.88. 
 ''There was a gloomy outlook on the semis earlier today,'' said Evan Olsen, head of equity trading at Stephens. ''Everyone's still watching oil prices and that's troubling.'' 
 Crude oil futures ended just shy of record levels yesterday ahead of an OPEC meeting today that is considering a Saudi proposal to lift output limits. But traders said such an increase might be too little to cover surging demand. 
 Crude for April delivery settled 10 cents higher at $55.05 a barrel, just 12 cents below the record set on Oct. 26. 
 ''Tomorrow is the OPEC meeting and maybe there will be something that comes out of that that takes a little pressure off the oil prices,'' Mr. Olsen said. ''But it's very cautious buying that we're seeing at this point.'' 
 United States health officials said samples collected from a Defense Department mail center near the Pentagon building tested positive for anthrax in a preliminary examination. 
 The incident brought back memories of 2001, when anthrax-laced letters and envelopes were mailed to government offices and media companies. 
 A.I.G., the world's largest insurance company by market value, fell $1.93, to $61.92, dragging on the Dow. A major credit rating agency stripped the insurer of its AAA debt rating and a second threatened to do the same. On Monday A.I.G.'s board decided to oust its longtime chief, Maurice R. Greenberg. 
 There was little reaction in the market to a speech by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who told the Senate Special Committee on Aging that lawmakers should act swiftly to shore up the Social Security retirement system and avoid economically crippling budget deficits in the future. 
 ''People didn't really react to Greenspan, but they did react a little to the macroeconomic numbers -- i.e., the retail numbers,'' said Ted Oberhaus, manager of equity trading at Lord Abbett & Company. ''The core retail sales number was slightly lower than people expected.'' 
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that retail sales were up 0.5 percent in February, raising expectations for first-quarter growth. The number was slightly below forecasts of a 0.6 percent gain, but analysts said a revision in January to a 0.3 percent rise from a 0.3 percent drop made up for the disappointment.
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said business inventories climbed 0.9 percent in January, in line with expectations. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32, to a price of 9522/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.54 percent from 4.51 percent on Monday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Take Us Out of the Ballgame, Dollar-Gazing Floridians Are Saying

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: WINTER HAVEN, Fla., March 10 

 BODY:
Here by the shores of Lake Lulu is the training camp of the Cleveland Indians, a 1960's ballpark so intimate that fans rest elbows and beers along the outfield wall to watch the game. But when city officials look at the waterfront park these days, it's not the baseball that makes their Floridian hearts flutter. It's the prime real estate.
 Where the Indians hone pitches, shag flies and steal bases every March, Winter Haven wants boutiques and restaurants, big-box chain stores and a recreation complex. It is not the only town to ponder turning its back on the boys of spring, hoping to reap a profit more tangible than the joy of baseball fans for just six weeks a year. 
 Port Charlotte has already said goodbye to the Texas Rangers and has closed the door to other teams, while Sarasota County is resisting the building of a new stadium for the Cincinnati Reds. When reporters asked Gov. Jeb Bush last month whether he could find money to fend off Arizona's latest incursions into spring baseball, he offered a tepid ''We'll see,'' adding that the state had other priorities. 
 Florida without spring training used to be unthinkable, but the unsentimental fact is that it costs a lot, and places like Winter Haven have turned cynical about the benefits. It took $1.2 million to run Chain of Lakes Park last year, but revenues totaled only $520,000, according to the city. The difference came out of Winter Haven's general fund, a subsidy for baseball that Mayor Mike Easterling said could not continue.
 ''If you live here you can't even enjoy the games unless you're retired, because most are at 1, 1:15 in the afternoon,'' Mayor Easterling said. ''Yet John Q. Public, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, are paying for it.'' 
 Instead of the quirky red and blue stadium, the mayor, a retired city employee, envisions ''a Cheesecake Factory, a theater, upscale shops of every description'' on the 60-acre site. These would make Winter Haven, now more a Wal-Mart than Banana Republic type of town, ''a real destination.''
 The Indians have agreed to depart. They arrived in Winter Haven, halfway between Tampa and Orlando, in 1993 after Hurricane Andrew tore up their new stadium in Homestead. While the city had said it would consider building a new park if the team pitched in, the Indians announced last spring that they would not. They are waiting for the right invitation from another town, but it is slower coming than they would like.
 Florida, the main home of spring training since the 1920's, still has 18 teams practicing in 13 counties, including several, like the Boston Red Sox and the Detroit Tigers, that have enjoyed major improvements to their ballparks in recent years. 
 Florida's spring training circuit, the Grapefruit League, had a healthy jump in attendance last spring and expects the same this year, even as ticket prices climb. Some economists say that the state profits tremendously from spring training, and in cities that are host to wildly popular teams like the Red Sox (Fort Myers) and Yankees (Tampa), it is unflinchingly embraced. 
 Yet some places, because of geography, economics or history, are not so rhapsodic about spring training. Sarasota County has balked at requests from the Reds to help finance improvements to Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota, where the team has trained since 1998. 
 When the Texas Rangers left their spring stadium in Port Charlotte in 2002, heading to Arizona, Charlotte County rebuffed several teams that were interested in moving there and let the park stand empty. Fort Lauderdale, meanwhile, is grasping for a way to pay for a costly stadium overhaul for the Baltimore Orioles.
 Amid this uncertainty, Arizona is beckoning. Last month, that state -- which, with 12 teams, is fast catching up as a spring-training mecca -- announced a plan to lure teams from Florida. Slade Mead, a former Arizona state senator who is leading the effort, told The Arizona Republic in February that the Indians, Reds and Orioles topped Arizona's wish list. He was not so blunt in a recent phone interview but said his state intended to convince several Grapefruit League teams of its superiority.
 ''I've done the Florida circuit, and the Arizona setup is a whole lot better,'' Mr. Mead said in a phone interview. ''The weather is better than Florida, and the distances between stadiums are very, very short.'' 
 Those might have been fighting words a decade ago. When Arizona was threatening to entice more teams away in the late 1990's, the Florida Legislature allocated $75 million to help improve stadiums or build new ones for the Houston Astros in Kissimmee, the Philadelphia Phillies in Clearwater, the Los Angeles Dodgers in Vero Beach, the Detroit Tigers in Lakeland and the Toronto Blue Jays in Dunedin.
 But Florida has other considerations now. Spring-training stadiums are competing for funds with the Florida Marlins, who have threatened to go to Las Vegas if the state does not give a $60 million subsidy toward a new stadium. 
 Even the Marlins, who won the World Series in 2003, have not convinced the state that they are worth it. Tom Lee, the State Senate president, responded to their proposal by saying he did not ''negotiate with terrorists.'' Likewise, Paul Mercier, chairman of the Sarasota County Commission, said he thought the Cincinnati Reds did not contribute enough to his community to warrant millions of dollars in financial aid. 
 ''I don't like to do things because a bully is saying, 'We're going to Arizona,''' Mr. Mercier said. ''Baseball 20 years ago was a very integral part of how we looked at ourselves, but we have matured economically, and I don't think spring training carries the charisma or financial clout that maybe it did 20 years ago.'' 
 The Cleveland Indians believe differently. Bob DiBiasio, the vice president for public relations, pointed to a study commissioned by the Florida Sports Foundation, which found that spring training pumped about $450 million a year into Florida's economy. For a city like Winter Haven, isolated and with only 27,000 residents, the benefits are especially dear, Mr. DiBiasio said.
 ''The vacationers are coming here to see us,'' he said. ''We are the draw.'' 
 Mr. DiBiasio said the team would rather not move to Arizona because Florida was an easier trip for fans in Ohio. One possibility has the team moving closer to Orlando, to share the Atlanta Braves' sleek new stadium at Disney's Wide World of Sports in Lake Buena Vista. 
 The prospect dismays Lou and Al Sullivan, retirees from Wadsworth, Ohio, who stay at a Days Inn here for most of each spring-training season. When they are not rooting for the Indians, they walk on the park's lakefront trail, attend local plays and concerts, and putter around town.
 ''It's heartbreaking to think of them leaving this place,'' said Mrs. Sullivan, 70, as she watched the Indians play the Washington Nationals one dazzling afternoon. ''It's so relaxing here. You don't have to fight the traffic. We hate Disney, and if they go there we will not come.''
 Steve Hartman, who comes from Fairlawn, Ohio, to Winter Haven for long weekends every March, said it was harder to park and to get players' autographs at newer, fancier parks like Cracker Jack Stadium at Disney World or Legends Field in Tampa, spring home of the Yankees. 
 ''This is as down-home, good old-fashioned experience as you can get,'' Mr. Hartman, 61, said. ''It might be better economically to do something different with this property, but is it good for the town in a deeper sense?'' 
 J. William Bowen, a fifth-generation Winter Haven resident who owns a downtown shop, Classic Collectibles and Antiques, thinks it is. Mr. Bowen does not love the idea of turning Chain of Lakes Stadium into a shopping complex, preferring that it stay a ballpark geared toward high school and college athletes. Though he loved spring training back when the Red Sox camped in Winter Haven, from 1969 through 1992, it now leaves him cold.
 Mr. Bowen, 64, remembers Red Sox players' participating in auctions for local charities and rubbing elbows with locals in downtown restaurants, but he sees no such interest from the Indians, he said. While restaurants near the stadium benefit greatly from spring training, he said, other local businesses do not reap windfalls every March.
 ''The team wants everything for themselves and wants us to spend all the money it takes,'' Mr. Bowen said.
 ''But that's a valuable piece of property that the city needs on its tax rolls. I can't speak for everybody, but I can speak for my circle of friends: we wish to heck they would finally go.''

HEADLINE: Is the Empire Striking Back?

BYLINE: By Yong Xue. 
Yong Xue is an assistant professor of Asian history at Suffolk University.

DATELINE: Boston 

 BODY:
HALFWAY though the 10th paragraph of an otherwise bland statement issued last month by the United States and Japan is a historic sentence. Among the ''common strategic objectives'' of the two nations, it reads, is ''the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait.'' 
 Such language may seem mild compared with the usual diplomatic back-and-forth between China and the United States about Taiwan, like this week's contentious exchange over the Chinese Parliament's new law authorizing the use of force to stop Taiwan from becoming independent. But in the 40-plus years that Japan and America have been making announcements regarding their security concerns in East Asia, Japan has deliberately remained silent about Taiwan. With their statement last month, for the first time the two nations have taken a clear stand together. 
 This is a mistake. The United States is right to be concerned with the growing military might of China, and America should honor its commitment to peace and democracy in the region. The United States is also right to encourage Japan to take a more assertive role in world affairs, as it has in Iraq. But there are parts of the world where Japan's history is too much of a burden, where it may not be in America's national interest to align itself with Japan too closely. East Asia is such an area.
 Japan invaded China some 70 years ago, killing millions of Chinese. Despite expressions of regret, Japan has never formally apologized for these atrocities -- certainly not to the satisfaction of most Chinese. Only when World War II was over, and millions of lives had been lost, did China win back Taiwan from Japan, which had annexed it in the late 19th century. Understandably, Taiwan is a very sensitive issue to China's national pride. On this issue, Japan commands no moral high ground.
 There is no reason for the United States to carry this historical burden for Japan. To the contrary: Americans fought with the Chinese against Japan in World War II, and the goodwill they earned among the Chinese people persists to this day. By pursuing policies toward Taiwan in concert with Japan, the United States becomes less a defender of peace and democracy and more an apologist for imperialism. At least this is how many Chinese people will perceive it.
 Even worse, America gains nothing by yielding the moral high ground. Historically, the United States has always held open the possibility of a military response to a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Japan, meanwhile -- trapped by a sense of guilt over the war and restricted by strong public sentiment against the military -- has long been unwilling to take a public stand on the Taiwan issue.
 At the same time, Japanese-American relations have always taken priority in Japan's foreign policy. Since at least the late 1950's, the posture of the Japanese government has been clear enough: if forced to make a choice in a military confrontation over the Taiwan Strait, Japan would quietly provide aid to the United States. Last month's joint statement was not only unwise but also unnecessary.
 On the issue of Taiwan, the United States would be wise to deal with China alone. After all, anti-American sentiment in China is shallow. Many Chinese people continue to admire America for both its values and its political system. More practically, they also realize that China needs the United States to maintain a stable international order so its economy can continue to grow. They have benefited greatly from trade with America.
 They are also sophisticated enough to understand America's distrust of China's emerging power; they expect only sensible and fair leadership. The Bush administration should deal with China in a businesslike manner, without needless provocation that leaves the moderate forces within Chinese government and society little room for maneuvering. In this respect, unilateralism may be preferable to multilateralism -- especially if America's partner is Japan.
 For more than a half century, Japan has hidden behind two umbrellas provided by the United States. The first is a security umbrella: a lightly armed and largely nuclear-free Japan has relied on the United States for its national defense. The second is a moral one: because of its lingering guilt from the war, Japanese foreign policy can find its moral compass only by following the American lead.
 These two umbrellas have well served the interests of the United States and Japan, as well as East Asia, since the end of World War II. Now the security umbrella may seem partly obsolete. But it is not a good time to fold the moral umbrella. For the United States and its allies, it can still provide shelter and comfort.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Brings Fraud Suit Against Ex-Qwest Officials

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications International, and six other former executives yesterday, accusing them of orchestrating a sweeping $3 billion accounting fraud intended to mislead investors during the telecommunications bubble and its bursting.
 The civil complaint, which grew out of an investigation by the S.E.C. lasting more than two years, was filed in Federal District Court in Denver, where Qwest is based, and covered the period from April 1, 1999, to March 31, 2002.
 The S.E.C. is seeking to force Mr. Nacchio and his associates to give back what it calls their ill-gotten gains in higher salaries, bonuses and stock sales from inflating Qwest's financial results. Mr. Nacchio alone reaped $216 million, according to the complaint, and the profits to the others came to $84 million. 
 Mr. Nacchio, through his lawyer, denied any wrongdoing.
 The S.E.C. complaint also contended that Mr. Nacchio and his subordinates inflated revenues they reported to investors as part of a scheme to persuade shareholders of U.S. West to allow their company to be acquired by Qwest in a deal in 2000.
 That $38 billion stock swap transformed Qwest from one of many start-ups building vast fiber optic communications networks into a more traditional phone company deriving most of its business from basic service in 14 Rocky Mountain and Plains states. It proved to be a financial lifesaver for Qwest's original investors when the Internet boom collapsed and rivals like Global Crossing and Metromedia Fiber plunged into bankruptcy. But it was a disaster for the shareholders of U.S. West.
 Besides Mr. Nacchio, those sued include Afshin Mohebbi, Qwest's former president, and two former chief financial officers, Robert S. Woodruff and Robin R. Szeliga. James J. Kozlowski and Frank T. Noyes, both senior accounting executives, and Gregory M. Casey were also targets.
 ''The disclosure fraud at Qwest was orchestrated at the highest level of the company to deceive investors,'' said Randall J. Fons, regional director of the commission's office in Denver. ''Qwest's C.E.O. and other top executives projected revenue and earnings that they knew were overly aggressive, and then all of the defendants used smoke and mirrors to meet those unrealistic projections.''
 The complaint comes at an awkward moment for Qwest. The company itself reached a $250 million settlement in October with the S.E.C. over the accounting scandal and is now involved in a bidding war with Verizon Communications for control of MCI, the long-distance telecommunications company once known as WorldCom. 
 ''Qwest is trying to represent itself as a clean and solid company with a bright future,'' said Scott C. Cleland, an industry analyst at the Precursor Group in Washington. ''This reminds people that Qwest has a closer history to WorldCom's than Verizon's.''
 In a statement, Qwest said that the complaint related to ''events that took place many years ago.''
 The underlying allegations in the complaint centered largely on previously reported methods Qwest used to generate phony revenues. The complaint accused Mr. Nacchio of encouraging sham transactions from fiber capacity swaps and said that Qwest executives frequently misled outside auditors.
 Richard Stillman, a lawyer for Mr. Nacchio, said yesterday that his client had cooperated fully and had not misrepresented Qwest's financial condition.
 ''The S.E.C. unfairly seeks to impute to Mr. Nacchio and others at Qwest responsibility for the results of a widespread industry downturn in a deteriorating economy,'' Mr. Stillman said in a written statement.
 Kevin D. Evans, a lawyer for Mr. Kozlowski, said that regulators had ''overreached in the extreme'' by including his client, who was a ''midlevel accountant.'' He said that Mr. Kozlowski tried to get the company to use a proper accounting approach and that the S.E.C. was at fault for declining to provide accounting guidance for the fiber deals.
 Forrest W. Lewis, a lawyer for Mr. Noyes, issued a similar response. ''The allegations against Frank Noyes are pulp fiction,'' Mr. Lewis said.
 David Meister, a lawyer for Mr. Woodruff, declined to comment. The other defendants and their lawyers could not be reached or did not return calls seeking comment.
 Mr. Nacchio was forced to resign from Qwest in 2002 and was succeeded by Richard C. Notebaert, an outsider with long experience in the industry who promptly swept away most of the senior management. He restated Qwest's results for 2000 and 2001 to remove sales of $2.5 billion. The company's stock, which reached $64 a share in 2000, fell as low as $1.11, costing shareholders about $89 billion in market value. 
 Earlier, eight midlevel executives were sued in early 2003 for their activities under Mr. Nacchio, but that action was stayed when the Justice Department filed criminal charges against four executives.
 The S.E.C. said that it had settled with William L. Eveleth, one of the defendants in the original civil suit; Bryan K. Treadway, a defendant in both the civil and criminal cases filed in 2003; Mark A. Schumacher; Qwest's controller in 2001; and Roger B. Hoagland, a former senior vice president for finance. 
 Mr. Treadway was acquitted in the criminal case last year. He and Mr. Schumacher agreed to pay $40,000 but were not required to admit any offenses. Mr. Eveleth's settlement, which also covered the original civil claim, required him to pay a $75,000 penalty and disgorge nearly $36,000. Mr. Hoagland agreed to a penalty of $100,000 and to give back nearly $229,000.

HEADLINE: Antiterror Efforts Squeeze Money Transfer Operations

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
After Sept. 11, 2001, strict new controls were imposed on the flourishing businesses that help immigrant workers send money home to their families abroad. 
 Now, despite complying with all the new requirements, part of a crackdown on any potential financial pipeline to terrorists, licensed money transmitters in New York and elsewhere are facing what they and regulators call a banking crisis. It could end up hurting anti-terrorism efforts as well as immigrant families in the United States and elsewhere, state and federal officials said yesterday.
 Assemblyman Jose R. Peralta, a Democrat from Queens who sits on the State Committee on Banks, is one of several officials trying to draw attention to the problem, which became acute this week when North Fork Bank and J.P. Morgan Chase quietly informed about 20 money transmittal businesses with hundreds of outlets in travel agencies, grocery stores and storefronts that their bank accounts would be closed at the end of March. 
 The two banks were among the last still offering accounts to the businesses, which cannot operate without such financial institutions.
 The problem, Mr. Peralta said, is that because of pressure from federal banking regulators, one bank after another has rejected its money transmittal customers, unfairly lumping together licensed, reputable businesses and risky, illegal operations, mainly to eliminate the risk of an oversight and bad publicity.
 ''What we see here is yet another case of mistaken identity by the federal government,'' the assemblyman said after a news conference Monday in Jackson Heights, the heavily immigrant neighborhood that he represents.
 State and federal bank regulators also became alarmed earlier this month when they heard at a regulatory hearing in Washington that banks throughout the Northeast were reacting to federal pressure for stricter scrutiny by simply shutting down the accounts of all money service businesses. They said the result was both unintended and counterproductive, because closing the licensed businesses and their 10,000 agents around the country would drive those looking to send cash remittances to foreign countries to illegal fly-by-night operations that do not check names, amounts and documents in compliance with antiterrorism regulations. 
 ''That is fundamentally the concern that we have,'' said William Langford, associate director for the regulatory policy and programs division of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the federal Treasury Department. ''Money service businesses as a group are not pariahs. The problem is now that the wrong message is being sent. I don't know how it happened, but it has happened, and there are misapprehensions all over out there.''
 Officials at North Fork and J.P. Morgan Chase banks would not comment. But Elizabeth McCaul, formerly New York State's chief bank regulator, said banks were in a tough position these days, because there is zero tolerance for error where terrorism is concerned and no well-established rules for banks to follow in vetting money service customers.
 ''The banks have to serve the international needs of customers while putting strong barriers to terrorism financing,'' said Ms. McCaul, now chief partner of the New York office of Promontory Financial Group, financial consultants. ''And in the present environment, where we have a national security alert, this has resulted in the banks feeling that they need to restrict certain kinds of relationships.''
 She added, ''We have to remember that there's nothing inherently nefarious in the need of the hard-working immigrant to provide these funds for his family.''
 But Manuel Orozco, a senior researcher at Georgetown University who has been studying remittances for several years, said that is exactly what is being forgotten. Over the last two years more than 70 accounts have been closed by 33 banks, most of them in New York, he said. 
 Complicating the picture, he added, is that three years ago banks themselves tried to enter the immigrant remittances market. But despite hefty marketing efforts, banks have captured only a meager share of the business.
 According to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center, the four largest banks in the business -- Citibank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Harris Bank -- together handle about 100,000 transfers a month. That is less than 3 percent of the 40 million remittance transactions to Mexico alone each year.
 Unlike the smaller-scale remittance businesses, banks lack the ability to deliver money to family members in far-flung rural areas, Professor Orozco said.
 Mr. Peralta called for a moratorium on the account closures, calling them ''a devastating blow to immigrant communities'' that in many cases would ''sever the lifeline that many new Americans have to their native land.''
 More than $30 billion a year in remittances are sent to Latin America and the Caribbean from the United States, and remittance businesses account for more than 70,000 jobs in the United States, Mr. Peralta said. In New York neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, earnings from remittance transactions make up from a third to a half of the revenues of local minority-owned businesses like delis and convenience stores.

HEADLINE: Climate Change Is Called Economic Threat at Talks

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, March 15 

 BODY:
The British government gathered together environment and energy officials from 20 countries on Tuesday to discuss climate change, which Britain has declared a top issue as it takes the leadership of the Group of 8 industrialized nations. 
 Britain's finance minister, Gordon Brown, told the delegates here at the opening of the meetings that the changing climate could no longer be considered just an environmental issue, but a real threat to economic activity. 
 ''We have sufficient evidence that human-made climate change is the most far-reaching and almost certainly the most threatening of all the environmental challenges facing us,'' Mr. Brown said. Problems from soil erosion to the depletion of marine stocks ''threaten future economic activity and growth'' around the world, he said. 
 Mr. Brown called on wealthy nations to solve these problems, both because they had caused them, he said, and because less developed nations will feel their effects more keenly. ''Climate change is an issue of justice as much of economic development,'' he said. 
 The British government and the Bush administration differ over the importance of greenhouse gases, mostly notably in the Kyoto agreement on limiting emissions that went into effect last month without the backing of the United States.
 The same day that Mr. Brown talked about cutting emissions, an American delegate, James L. Connaughton, chairman of the United States Council on Environmental Quality, told the BBC in an interview that the science was still contested. ''We are still working on the issue of causation, the extent to which humans are a factor'' in global warming, he said. He added, though, that they might well be a factor. 
 The United States rejected the Kyoto treaty, an international pledge to cut carbon emissions that went into effect last month, because the quotas assigned to the country were ''unreasonable,'' Mr. Connaughton said. Instead, the United States government plans to focus on technology, he said. 
 At the meeting, a Chinese delegate, Liu Jiang, vice chairman of the country's National Development and Reform Commission, emphasized the country's willingness to work on controlling greenhouse gas emissions even as its rapid economic expansion continued.

HEADLINE: Who Gets It? Hillary

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If the Democratic Party wants to figure out how to win national elections again, it has an unexpected guide: Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 Senator Clinton, much more than most in her party, understands how the national Democratic Party needs to rebrand itself. She gets it -- perhaps that's what 17 years in socially conservative Arkansas does to you.
 The first lesson Mrs. Clinton is demonstrating is the need to talk much more openly about God and prayer. That resonates in a country where a Pew poll found that 60 percent of Americans pray at least once a day. 
 ''I've always been a praying person,'' Mrs. Clinton declared recently. Of course, this approach works in her case only because her religious faith is longstanding. It didn't work for Howard Dean when he described the Book of Job as his favorite book in the New Testament. With a candidate like him, you'd worry that more talk about religion would lead to comments about how much he treasures the Twelfth Commandment. 
 Democrats are usually more comfortable talking about sex than God. But that doesn't work in a country where 70 percent say that ''presidents should have strong religious beliefs.''
 Then there's abortion. Mrs. Clinton took a hugely important step in January when she sought common ground and described abortion as a ''sad, even tragic choice to many, many women.''
 The Democratic Party commits seppuku in the heartland by coming across as indifferent to people's doubts about abortions or even as pro-abortion. A Times poll in January found that 61 percent of Americans favor tighter restrictions on abortion, or even a ban, while only 36 percent agree with the Democratic Party position backing current abortion law. 
 That doesn't mean that there's no middle ground on abortion. In fact, most of America is standing, conflicted, on middle ground. Many people are deeply uncomfortable with abortions, but they also don't want women or doctors going to prison, and they don't want teenage girls dying because of coat-hanger abortions. 
 What has been lethal for Democrats has not been their pro-choice position as such, but the perception that they don't even share public qualms about abortion. Mrs. Clinton has helped turn the debate around by emerging as both pro-choice and anti-abortion.
 That is potentially a winning position for Democrats. Abortions fell steadily under Bill Clinton, who espoused that position, and have increased significantly during President Bush's presidency. (One theory is that economic difficulties have left more pregnant women feeling that they cannot afford a baby.)
 Mrs. Clinton is also hard to dismiss as a screechy obstructionist because she's gone out of her way to be collegial in the Senate and to work with Republicans from Trent Lott to Sam Brownback. Senator John Kerry never seemed much liked by his colleagues, while other senators seem to like Mrs. Clinton. Perhaps it's that, according to New York magazine, she surprises other senators by popping up during meetings and asking: Anybody want a coffee?
 The makeover is working with New York State voters. Mrs. Clinton has an approval rating in the state of 69 percent, according to a Times poll published last month, and her negative ratings have tumbled to 21 percent. That puts her approval rating even higher than that of New York's popular senior senator, Charles Schumer.
 Still, I doubt that Mrs. Clinton can be elected president. I use my hometown, the farming community of Yamhill, Ore., as my touchstone for the heartland, and I have a hard time imagining that she could do well there. Ambitious, high-achieving women are still a turnoff in many areas, particularly if they're liberal and feminist. And that's not just in America: Margaret Thatcher would never have been elected prime minister if she'd been in the Labor Party.
 In small towns like Yamhill, any candidate from New York carries a lot of baggage, and Mrs. Clinton more than most. Moreover, television magnifies her emotional reserve and turns her into a frost queen. Mrs. Clinton's negative ratings nationally were still around 40 percent at last count, and Hillary-hating thrives. 
 So Mrs. Clinton may not be able to get there from here, and in any case it's way too early to speculate meaningfully about 2008. But it's just the right time for Democrats to be fretting about how to reconnect to the heartland, and they can't find a better model for how to do that than Mrs. Clinton.

HEADLINE: And Now, the Counterfeit News

 BODY:
The Bush administration has come under a lot of criticism for its attempts to fob off government propaganda as genuine news reports. Whether federal agencies are purchasing the services of supposedly independent columnists or making videos extolling White House initiatives and then disguising them as TV news reports, that's wrong. But it is time to acknowledge that the nation's news organizations have played a large and unappetizing role in deceiving the public. 
 As documented this week in an article in The Times by David Barstow and Robin Stein, more than 20 federal agencies, including the State Department and the Defense Department, now create fake news clips. The Bush administration spent $254 million in its first four years on contracts with public relations firms, more than double the amount spent by the Clinton administration.
 Most of these tapes are very skillfully done, including ''interviews'' that seem genuine and ''reporters'' who look much like the real thing. Only sophisticated viewers would easily recognize that these videos are actually unpaid commercial announcements for the White House or some other part of the government. Some of the videos clearly cross the line into the proscribed territory of propaganda, and the Government Accountability Office says at least two were illegally distributed.
 But too many television stations run government videos anyway, without any hint of where they came from. And while some claim they somehow stumbled accidentally into this trap, it seems obvious that in most cases, television stations that are short on reporters, long on air time to fill and unwilling to spend the money needed for real news gathering are abdicating their editorial responsibilities to the government's publicity teams. Bush administration officials now insist that they carefully label any domestic releases as government handouts.
 However disingenuous those assurances may be, in at least some cases the stations are the main culprits in the deception -- as at the Fox affiliate in Memphis, where a station reporter narrated a State Department video, using the text that came with it. The Times also reported on a small central Illinois station that was so eager to snap up this low-cost filler that it asked the Agriculture Department to have its ''reporter'' refer to its morning show in his closing lines. The Times tracked station malpractice into bigger markets, like San Diego (the ABC affiliate) and Louisville, Ky. (the Fox affiliate).
 If using pretend news is one of the ways these stations have chosen to save money, it's a false economy. If it represents a political decision to support President Bush, it will eventually backfire. This kind of practice cheapens the real commodity that television stations have to sell during their news hours: their credibility.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Defends His Support of Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, defended himself on Tuesday against Democratic lawmakers who say he contributed to soaring budget deficits by endorsing President Bush's tax cuts in 2001.
 Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that he and many others had been wrong to expect trillions of dollars in surpluses that never materialized.
 But in testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, he said almost all budget analysts were predicting a stream of large surpluses at the time. 
 ''I look back and I would say to you, if confronted with the same evidence we had back then, I would recommend exactly what I recommended then,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''It turns out we were all wrong.''
 His defense was a response to rising criticism from some Democrats.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, told Mr. Greenspan on Tuesday that his support for tax cuts had set the stage for the government to spend surpluses that were building up in the Social Security trust fund's ''lock box.''
 ''Your testimony helped blow the lid off the lock boxes when it came to the size of the tax cut, the extent of the tax cut,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, recently called Mr. Greenspan ''one of the biggest political hacks'' in Washington. On Monday, Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, called Mr. Greenspan an ''enabler'' of the administration's fiscal policies. The criticism has intensified partly because Mr. Greenspan has cautiously supported Mr. Bush's idea of letting people divert some of their payroll taxes to private retirement accounts.
 Most analysts say Mr. Bush's plan would force the government to borrow trillions of dollars over the next several decades, because the government would have to pay full benefits to people who are at or near retirement age right now. Supporters say the government would recoup the cost as future retirees get most of their benefits from private accounts rather than the government.
 Confronted by Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Greenspan said his support for tax cuts in 2001 was based on nearly unanimous expectations of large budget surpluses for many years, a cumulative surplus of $5.6 trillion by 2011, according to the Congressional Budget Office at the time.
 ''We were confronted at the time with an almost universal expectation amongst experts that we were dealing with a very large surplus for which there seemed to be no end,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
 Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that he had wanted to reduce the budget surplus, but said he also proposed ''trigger'' mechanisms for Congress to re-evaluate the tax cuts if the budget forecasts proved wrong.
 As it turned out, federal deficits rose as tax revenues plunged for three years in a row and spending increased in areas including war costs, education and domestic security. What was expected to be a $5.6 trillion surplus by 2011 is now expected to be at least a $4 trillion deficit by 2015 if the tax cuts are made permanent.
 Mr. Greenspan repeated his support for private retirement accounts on Tuesday, saying they could make it harder for Congress to spend annual surpluses in the Social Security trust fund. This year, those programs are expected to take in about $173 billion more than they pay out in benefits, but in 2018 the surpluses are expected to turn into deficits.
 But Mr. Greenspan cautioned that the details of any overhaul of Social Security would be crucial, and that certain types of seemingly private accounts might in fact be just as easy to tap as the existing trust fund.
 ''The major attraction of personal accounts is that they can be constructed to be truly segregated from the unified budget, and therefore are more likely to induce the federal government to take those actions that would reduce public dis-saving,'' Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: Wall Street West Recuperates From 9/11

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
The once-decrepit warehouse district along this city's waterfront acquired the nickname Wall Street West about a decade ago. It houses the back offices for some of Manhattan's largest financial institutions and is a job destination for about 100,000 every weekday. But the area stood still for a long time after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as various companies dropped plans to move or expand here and vacancy rates rose. 
 Now, with the recession eased and the PATH train connection between the two financial districts rebuilt, the Jersey City waterfront is moving forward again. Developers and brokers say there is a major movement under way to upgrade the area to front-office status. 
 Two years ago, in the face of high vacancy rates, the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation marketed the half-empty office tower it had built for Charles Schwab & Company, after Schwab decided not to move in, and sold it last year. This month, Mack-Cali laid out $329 million to buy a different office building, the 42-story tower at 101 Hudson Street, and did not stop there. The company is also beginning a $20 million renovation project at one of the buildings in its ''city within a city'' office complex, Harborside Financial Center.
 With the purchase of 101 Hudson Street, Mack-Cali's waterfront office holdings bounced back to more than four million square feet, approaching the Lefrak Organization's five million square feet at its nearby Newport Office Center. The newest major property holder is Goldman Sachs, whose 45-story waterfront tower is the tallest building in New Jersey and has 1.1 million square feet of space.
 Mack-Cali now owns roughly a quarter and Lefrak close to a third of total office space on the waterfront. Mack-Cali also manages an additional 1.2 million square feet of Class A office space in the district.
 Leasing activity in the waterfront area has picked up rapidly in the last year, according to brokers for both companies. Mark Ravesloot of CB Richard Ellis, the broker for Mack-Cali, said his company's statistics showed drastic declines in the number of signed leases each year from 2001 to 2003. 
 By the end of last year, however, the trend had begun to reverse. Last year, about 920,000 square feet were leased, higher than the 380,000 square feet leased in 2003, but still far below the 4 million square feet leased in 2001. 
 At the sleek new 980,000-square-foot Plaza 5 building that Mack-Cali added to Harborside Financial Center last year, 87 percent of space is now leased. Earlier this month, IXIS North America, an investment bank, and HQ Global Workplaces, a provider of temporary office suites, took a combined total of 93,910 square feet.
 Now, Mack-Cali is starting a $20 million renovation of the Plaza 1 building at Harborside. It is a former shipping warehouse and the first building to attract a major company to Jersey City back in 1983.
 Mack-Cali's chief executive, Mitchell E. Hersh, said his company's investment in Plaza 1 is both ''a recognition'' of the significant change that has taken place on the waterfront in the last 20 years and evidence that the process is continuing. ''When Bankers Trust moved into Plaza 1 over 20 years ago,'' Mr. Hersh said, as he stood in the less-than-modern lobby of the building, ''it was the first major company to come here and really started the transformation.'' 
 At the time that Bankers Trust (which is now part of Deutsche Bank) set up its office, the waterfront was almost completely lacking in amenities for those who worked there, Mr. Hersh said. ''At least it was a short commute back to New York,'' he noted.
 More than two decades later -- and nine years after Mack-Cali bought the five buildings and all developable land at Harborside Financial Center, adding many amenities, including the Hyatt Regency hotel next door -- Deutsche Bank is still at Plaza 1. But Deutsche Bank contracted its business sharply last year, selling part of its global securities services operation to State Street Bank. Consequently, it is shrinking its Jersey City office to 90,000 square feet, from 400,000 square feet.
 Mack-Cali, Mr. Hersh said, is seizing the opportunity to upgrade Plaza 1 to ''cutting-edge Class A status'' -- meaning competitive with the most-modern, best-located properties -- with renovations designed by the high-profile Manhattan architecture firm of Beyer Blinder Belle. The architects are known for their adaptive reuse of buildings like Grand Central Terminal and the historic structures on Ellis Island. The firm also completed the renovations in the late 1980's at Harborside Plazas 2 and 3, now occupied by tenants that include Morgan Stanley, Bank of Tokyo, J.P. Morgan Chase and Dow Jones.
 The renovations to Harborside Plaza 1 will include reconfiguration of the main lobby and all common areas. A new two-story glass entrance with wood-paneled walls and bluestone flooring will be created. Also, all elevator cabs and bathrooms will be renovated, and new heating and cooling systems are to be installed on every floor.
 ''We will assist every new tenant in customizing their space,'' Mr. Ravesloot said. 
 Mr. Hersh added that if a large company decided it would like to ''brand'' the building as its headquarters, building designs were flexible enough to accommodate that.
 ''This has become the kind of commercial neighborhood that another large company might very well want to call home,'' he said.
 The current vacancy rate in the waterfront office district is 13.7 percent, Mr. Ravesloot said, down from 15.1 percent at the end of last year and 17.2 percent at the end of 2003.
 Mr. Hersh said that Wall Street companies were still likely prospects to locate at Harborside and noted that several large firms currently operated trading floors here.
 Mr. Ravesloot pointed to four first-class restaurants now in the financial center in addition to restaurants at the Hyatt, and Harborside's bustling retail promenade offering many dozens of shops and fast-food possibilities, plus several attractive courtyards where people might gather and the riverside walkway and piers along the Hudson, which are popular with people on lunch breaks in the warmer months.
 ''It's a dynamic market,'' Mr. Hersh summed up, ''that's obviously still on its way to better things.''

HEADLINE: Bidding for a 'Free Ride' to Business School

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
Dylan Raap knows the value of a full scholarship to business school. He just bought one on eBay for $36,000. 
 ''Actually, I was prepared to pay a little more,'' said Mr. Raap, 26. 
 In an effort to raise its profile and attract more foreign students, Nyenrode Business Universiteit, a relatively well-ranked but very tuition-dependent business school in the Netherlands, auctioned off full scholarships last week to a pair of eager bidders -- one in China, one in the United States. 
 Now, one could hardly be blamed for wondering whether paying tens of thousands of dollars for a ''free ride'' to business school defeats the whole purpose, sort of like buying coupons. But Mr. Raap says he has done the math. 
 Normally, an M.B.A. from Nyenrode costs 29,500 euros, a little more than $39,000, a princely sum in a country where education usually costs a fraction of that, but not so expensive by American business school standards. While the early bidding on the scholarship started at $5,000, making for a much more obvious bargain, Mr. Raap said he was perfectly content that ''I still saved a little bit.''
 Of course, there is one small hitch: Mr. Raap still has to get into the school. In fact, he says he has not even applied for admission yet, and herein lies his ulterior motive.
 ''To some extent I would get a leg up this way,'' said Mr. Raap, a gardening supply company executive from Vermont who wants to study abroad and is confident about his chances for admission but keenly aware that ''it's still not a done deal.'' By winning the auction, Mr. Raap reasons that he will at least get noticed by the university's admissions office, and perhaps even stand out for his entrepreneurial spirit. 
 Should Mr. Raap fail to make the grade, Nyenrode says it will simply give the scholarship to the next highest bidder, probably in the mid-$30,000 range, and still consider it a pretty good haul. By comparison, the Chinese auction fetched $8,500.
 ''If someone bid over the price of tuition, we'd accept it, of course,'' said Karel J. Samsom, professor of entrepreneurship at Nyenrode. ''But then we might have to give him a lesson in economics once he got here.'' 
 As for the proceeds, Nyenrode, in the city of Breukelen, south of Amsterdam, says they will be spent in the bidders' home state or town, probably on an elementary school in need. The point is to mix a little advertising in a new market with some philanthropy, a mantra of sorts for the university and precisely what makes Nyenrode so attractive to Mr. Raap.
 ''We teach students how to be entrepreneurs, to be profitable in order to survive but also to bear a great responsibility to the environment in which you live,'' Mr. Samsom said. ''Well, this is a way for us to practice what we preach.''

HEADLINE: In Good Times, a Pupil-Made Quilt Can Outsell McEnroe Tennis Lessons

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
There are many ways to gauge the economic recovery of New York's most lucrative professions, and everyone has a favorite indicator. The packed dining rooms of $250-a- plate-restaurants. The plethora of luxury hotels being converted into apartments. The mere existence of an $800 haircut offered on Gansevoort Street.
 But surely one of the best is the $40,000 fetched recently by Columbia Grammar School for a nautical-themed mural panel, made by some of its youngest students and sold at its annual benefit auction.
 Every spring, schools across the city hold benefit auctions to beef up their coffers, allowing another year of scholarships, school upkeep and general expenses to be met. The affairs range from the folksy -- dance parties in the school gym -- to the elaborate -- a night at Cipriani -- and pull in anywhere from just less than $100,000 to more than $600,000, with several Manhattan private schools netting near the top of the range. 
 Often, as goes the stock market, so goes the annual auction take.
 ''I have been here 18 years, and I can say that when things are going well in the economy, we tend to do well, too,'' said George P. Davison, the head of Grace Church School in Greenwich Village. ''That is the reason for the timing of the auctions,'' Mr. Davison said, ''because people don't get their bonuses until after January.'' 
 Grace Church is still calculating its final tally from last week's auction but is likely to end up 8 percent higher than last year's, when its $460,000 net was 50 percent more than the previous year's. School auctions have come a long way since the late 1970's, when a group of families from the Trevor Day School gathered for a potluck dinner auction in a West End Avenue apartment, taking in $10,000. 
 Today's auctions feature elaborate themes and fancy sites, as well as catalogs filled with summer homes in Greece, floor seats to Knicks games and offers for private time with popular teachers. 
 ''There is quite a range in terms of the amount of energy and activity that goes into them,'' said Patricia Girardi, executive director of the Parents League, an association that helps parents navigate the private school system. ''Even nursery schools are able to do very handsomely.''
 Auction catalogs also provide a window into the distinct cultures of each school. 
 Chef parents, for example, often live downtown. So it is that Grace Church pulled in $38,000 for a dinner for 12 in the winning bidder's home, prepared by the fathers Danny Meyer and Tom Colicchio. And Mario Batali will be cooking in the home of the winning family from LREI in Greenwich Village. 
 That school, which encompasses the Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, holds two auctions. One offers only art, featuring parents like the artist Tom Slaughter and the photographer Sandi Fellman. 
 At the general auction, a family can bid to have a photograph of their child taken with one of William Wegman's dogs. ''We are very fortunate being a downtown school,'' said Pippa Gerard, the director of development at the school. ''Many artists have sent their children here.'' 
 News media people tend to flock uptown, as do random sports celebrities. At the Trinity School on the Upper West Side, parents can win tennis lessons with John McEnroe, at an event with Paula Zahn as the M.C. At the Dalton School, Al Roker auctioned off backstage tours of the ''Today Show.'' 
 The Berkeley Carroll School in Brooklyn combines the groovy independent film vibe -- the ''Sopranos'' star Steve Buscemi offered a tour of the set -- with local color. One family paid $4,000 to have lunch with the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, at Bamonte's in Williamsburg. ''The place is quintessential Brooklyn,'' said Henry Trevor, an assistant head of the school.
 And what to say, exactly, about the Packer Collegiate Institute, also in Brooklyn, where $100 could get one a gift certificate to a company ''dedicated to the spreading of sexual enlightenment through the promulgation of chosen playthings,'' as well as a guide to good sex?
 Parents volunteer to do everything from decorating the catering hall to checking the coats at the auctions. But in the city's most expensive schools, some parents squirm in their seats as the wealthiest among them battle with their paddles to win vacations at holiday homes in Italy, chartered sailboat rides, private time with the school director and the science teacher's hazelnut cake recipe.
 ''It is a nice community event,'' said one Grace Church parent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''But you better have money in that community. If you were a family getting any degree of scholarship, who is just scraping by to send your kid here, it would have been a lot to take.'' At Dalton, several parents say they do not even consider attending the auction, considering that tickets are about $200.
 Occasionally, bridges are burned, bad karma invited. Sometimes someone drinks too much, overbids and then cannot pay the next morning, one school director said. At an Upper East Side nursery school one year, a group of parents who were officers in their respective companies donated 10 shares of stock each to create a miniportfolio. The buyer, according to one parent, eagerly paid up, and then immediately shorted all the shares, showing a lack of confidence in his peers' companies. 
 Some schools are trying to tone down the auction fever. Trinity, for example, canceled its live auction in 2003 in favor of a benefit with a small silent auction. 
 ''We came to the conclusion that the auction, from a fund-raising point of view, was very successful,'' said Myles Amend, director of development at the school. ''But it was not open to the entire community. As we talked among ourselves, there was just a sort of general level of discomfort with the auction process.''
 John McEnroe still auctioned off tennis lessons last week, Mr. Amend said, just silently. ''It has made a big difference in bringing the school community together,'' he said. ''You want fund-raisers that are friend raisers.'' 
 At the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, the auction is now done online, with eBay as a model. 
 And the proceeds from tonight's auction at St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's in Morningside Heights will all be donated tsunami victims in a village in India, the first time the school has ever donated its auction kitty.
 But some things about auctions may never change. The most coveted items remain the homemade projects fashioned by the school's children. Many schools have children make a quilt of some sort; others do murals like the one at Columbia Grammar.
 This year, for example, St. David's, the boys' school on the Upper East Side, sold a quilt made by second graders for $30,000, the highest amount ever fetched for a school project, according to Maureen Barry, the director of development there.
 ''Somehow it seems pure to bid on a quilt,'' said Anne Goldrush, who runs her own real estate company and once was co-chairwoman of the auction at Christ Church Nursery School. 
 ''It is almost something about the sentimentality about it that allows people to feel free to go nuts. And on some level, everyone wants to come home and tell their child that they got the quilt.''

HEADLINE: Money to Clean Up Polluted Sites Goes Unspent by State

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
A state environmental law passed in 2003 to help clean up polluted industrial sites known as brownfields sets aside $15 million a year for the most heavily contaminated neighborhoods in New York State.
 But not one dollar has yet been spent, because Gov. George E. Pataki and the leaders of the State Legislature have failed to sign a memorandum of understanding outlining how the money should be divided up.
 The last two state budgets have included $15 million each year for programs in these neighborhoods, and the governor's new budget proposal calls for another $15 million. But Republicans in the Senate took steps this week to eliminate the latest appropriation until the $30 million backlog is spent. 
 Because of the impasse, residents of the polluted neighborhoods that applied for grants say they have not be able to advance their plans to clean up old junkyards, gas stations and other sites that are not polluted enough to be put on the Superfund list of the worst toxic sites but cannot be built on unless they are decontaminated. 
 ''The state gives the impression that it supports community-based efforts to clean up these areas, but it is undermining us by not making money available on time,'' said Elizabeth C. Yeampierre, executive director of the United Puerto Rican Organization of Sunset Park, which is awaiting an $80,000 planning grant for brownfield sites on the Brooklyn waterfront near Sunset Park and in surrounding areas. 
 In the South Bronx, Ajamu Kitwana, director of community development and planning for Youth Ministries for Peace and Justice, said his group was waiting for $394,000 in state assistance for developing a plan for cleaning up part of the Bronx waterfront. 
 ''It's like a knife in the back to all the communities that saw this as something that could reverse a legacy of environmental injustice,'' Mr. Kitwana said. 
 Since the brownfields law was passed in September 2003, 52 groups or municipalities across New York have applied for about $10 million to plan for cleaning up polluted land and reusing it for parks, low-income housing and small businesses. 
 Brownfields are concentrated in poor urban neighborhoods. In New York City, approximately 6,000 lots and properties are considered brownfields. 
 James F. Gennaro, chairman of the City Council's Environmental Protection Committee, called the delay ''an outrage.'' He helped push a resolution through the Council last week urging the leaders in Albany to break their deadlock and release the brownfields money to the community groups that have applied for the grants , including nine in the city.
 In 2003, Governor Pataki made the brownfields law a priority and insisted on linking it to a bill to refinance the state's Superfund. The Legislature objected at first, but later passed the measure. 
 The new environmental law put $120 million into the Superfund program and set up a system of tax credits to help owners clean up their own brownfields properties.
 The new law also established a Brownfields Cleanup Program that paid particular attention to poor urban communities. A final decision on allocating the $15 million a year in grants was left to a memorandum of understanding among the leaders. 
 Such agreements are sometimes used in Albany to settle differences over the allocation of state money, often along regional or partisan lines. 
 Timothy Sweeney, director of the regulatory watch program of Environmental Advocates of New York, said it appeared that the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democrat-controlled Assembly were wrestling for control of the brownfields grant money.
 But Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, chairman of the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, said the snag was over how much money can be used to cover costs of state employees in the Department of Environmental Conservation who will administer the grant program. 
 Mr. DiNapoli said the governor and the Senate wanted to dedicate as much as $3.5 million a year to administrative costs, an amount the Assembly thinks is too high. ''We'd like to see the money spent on the folks who applied for the funding, and not administrative costs,'' he said. 
 A spokesman for the Senate declined to talk about the negotiations, except to say that an agreement was close.
 Mr. DiNapoli also said he expected the Senate's attempt to eliminate the $15 million in the new budget to fail. 
 Another meeting on the brownfields memorandum of understanding is scheduled for today. Jennifer Meicht, a spokeswoman for Governor Pataki, said the remaining conflicts could be ironed out ''in the next several weeks.''

HEADLINE: Don't Parade, Just Go Vote

BYLINE: By Thomas Fleming. 
Thomas Fleming is the author of ''The Illusion of Victory: America in World War I'' and the forthcoming ''Mysteries of My Father: An Irish-American Memoir.''

 BODY:
WHEN I was growing up in Jersey City, no one gave more than a passing thought to St. Patrick's Day. Ireland was a remote place where people sang weepers like ''Mother Macree.'' Otherwise the country was seldom if ever mentioned. We did not even have a St. Patrick's Day Parade.
 Some may find this more than a little strange because for 30 or so years, the city was governed by a mayor and four commissioners with Irish names. I went to St. Patrick's Parochial School. I had a grandfather, David Fleming, whose brogue was so thick I could not understand him most of the time. 
 Old Davey, as we called him, used to pay me a nickel a stanza to recite his favorite poem, ''Why I Named You Patrick.'' These days I can remember only the final stanza, which more or less sums up the rest of this work of high literary art:
 When you wear the shamrock, Son,
 Be proud of your Irish name.
 No other one I know of
 Can stand for greater fame.
 Except for the poem about St. Patrick, Davey never said a word about Ireland. Neither did my father, Teddy Fleming, who was chairman of the Board of Chosen Freeholders and later sheriff of Hudson County as well as leader of the multiethnic Sixth Ward. He often said that was his real job.
 My father frequently referred to himself and others as Irish. But the only people from beyond our shores I ever heard him discuss were the Englishmen with whom his regiment trained before going into the trenches on the Western Front in World War I. He liked them.
 After I recited ''Why I Named You Patrick,'' Old Davey frequently told me about the ''dirty thieving Republican Protestants'' who seldom paid him more than 50 cents a day to dig ditches and roll barrels in his immigrant youth.
 Getting madder by the minute, Davey told me what happened when he went to Jersey City factories in search of a better job. ''Protestant or Catholic?'' he was asked. If he said Catholic, the answer often was: ''No work today.'' 
 Shortly after Davey arrived from Ireland, the Protestants won a municipal election and fired everyone on the public payroll with an Irish name. ''From now on,'' one of the gleeful winners told a New York newspaper, ''Irish men are nowhere.''
 I heard similar stories at election night parties in my youth. In Jersey City, Election Day was a lot more important than St. Patrick's Day. The voting booth was where we learned to tell the Protestant establishment that the Irish-Americans might be nowhere but they had no intention of staying there.
 The man who did most of the telling in Jersey City was a tall, lean Irish-American named Frank Hague. He put together what students of the subject consider the ultimate political machine. Unlike other bosses, Hague refused to make nice with Hudson County's Protestant powers. He forced the railroads to pay millions in city taxes they had avoided for decades with the help of the Republican Party. This was no small accomplishment: the Pennsylvania and other lines owned 25 percent of Jersey City's property.
 Hague also involved himself in labor disputes. Before he took office, thugs hired by the corporations often beat and shot striking workers on Jersey City's streets. Hague vowed to put an end to this practice. He forced the corporations to arbitrate the disputes (and served as an arbitrator himself). The workers usually won these bloodless arguments. And he confounded the Protestants by cleaning up downtown Jersey City. Hague closed brothels and dance halls where prostitutes picked up customers and reformed the Police Department, which had become all but indifferent to enforcing the law when payoffs were forthcoming. Hague was not a model of ethical perfection in other ways, but no one in Jersey City worried about that.
 Davey Fleming used to say that Hague -- ''the Big Fellow'' -- had the nerve of a burglar going up the outside of a New York skyscraper. 
 My father, who had won a lieutenant's commission during the Battle of the Argonne, also liked Hague's hardball style. Teddy Fleming made sure that at least 90 percent of the Sixth Ward voted the straight Democratic ticket on Election Day. That was the expected percentage in all 12 Jersey City wards. 
 This Irish-American-led political juggernaut elected Democratic governors and senators and soon had a lot to say about judges, district attorneys and numerous other officials in the rest of New Jersey. 
 In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided to run for a third term against the wishes of the Democratic Party. Roosevelt went to Mayor Hague, who was vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Hague's close friend, Mayor Ed Kelly of Chicago, and let them handle the nominating convention.
 In Albany, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Jersey City, Kansas City, New York and Pittsburgh, which is by no means a complete list, tens of thousands of Irish-Americans found a way out of the slums thanks to their political machines. (A term no Jersey City Irish-American ever used -- it was always ''the Organization.'') The grandsons and granddaughters of these policemen, firemen, court officers and other state and municipal jobholders armed themselves with college and law degrees and got somewhere in the larger American world.
 What does all this mean on St. Patrick's Day?
 Gradually, as I turned into an historian to understand the world in which I grew up, I realized we Irish-Americans have our own story to tell -- a very different story from the Irish in Ireland. It's a story with plenty of troubles and not a little heartbreak. But threaded through it is the triumph of a defeated people who used America's freedom to win their share of pride and prosperity.
 On St. Patrick's Day, that's worth a come all ye or two. But I hope we never forget the importance of Election Day.

HEADLINE: Homeland Insecurity

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Bush officials have always been eager to pose as the tough guys willing to make the tough decisions. On Iraq and Afghanistan, they did. But when it comes to China, the Bush administration is engaged in one of the greatest acts of unilateral disarmament ever seen in U.S. foreign policy. 
 National security is about so much more than just military deployments. It is also about our tax, energy and competitiveness policies. And if you look at all these areas, the Bush team has not only been steadily eroding America's leverage and room for maneuver vis-a-vis its biggest long-term competitor -- China -- but it has actually been making us more dependent than ever on Beijing. Indeed, if the Bush policies were wrapped into a single legislative bill it could be called ''The U.S.-China Dependency Act.'' 
 The excessive tax cuts for the rich, combined with a total lack of discipline on spending by the Bush team and its Republican-run Congress, have helped China become the second-largest holder of U.S. debt, with a little under $200 billion worth. No, I don't think China will start dumping its T-bills on a whim. But don't tell me that as China buys up more and more of our debt -- and that is the only way we can finance the tax holiday the Bush team wants to make permanent -- it won't limit our room to maneuver with Beijing, should it take aggressive steps toward Taiwan. 
 What China might do with all its U.S. T-bills in the event of a clash over Taiwan is a total wild card that we have put in Beijing's hands.
 On energy, the Bush team's obsession with drilling in the Alaskan wilderness to increase supply is mind-boggling. ''I am sure China will be thrilled with the Bush decision to drill in Alaska,'' said the noted energy economist Philip Verleger Jr. ''Oil in Alaska cannot easily or efficiently be shipped to our Gulf Coast refineries. The logical markets are on the West Coast of the United States and in Asia. Consumers in China and Japan, not the U.S., will be the real beneficiaries of any big Alaska find. 
 ''With a big find, China and Japan will be able to increase imports from a dependable supplier -- the U.S. -- while consumers in the U.S. will still be at the mercy of unreliable suppliers, such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. It is simple geography. [Also], a big find will lead to lower prices in the short term, promoting more emissions and more warming.'' 
 Moreover, focusing exclusively on squeezing out a little more supply will only discourage conservation, Mr. Verleger added, setting the stage for higher prices again in three or four years -- ''when exhausting oil reserves and burgeoning demand from China and India will drive the price of oil to well above $100 a barrel.'' That will put even more money in the pockets of some of the world's worst governments.
 That's why America urgently needs what I call a ''geo-green'' strategy, which combines geopolitics with environmentalism. Geo-greenism starts with a $1-per-gallon gasoline tax, which would help close our budget gap and force the U.S. auto industry to convert more of its fleet to hybrid and ethanol technology, thereby reducing the amount of money going to Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Iran for oil. It would also reduce our dependence on China to finance our debt and the chances that we will end up in a global struggle with China for energy.
 Finally, on competition policy, the Bush team and Congress cut the budget of the National Science Foundation for this fiscal year by $105 million. I could not put it better than Congressman Vern Ehlers, one of the few dissenting Republicans, who said: ''This decision shows dangerous disregard for our nation's future at a time when other nations continue to surpass our students in math and science and consistently increase their funding of basic research. We cannot hope to fight jobs lost to international competition without a well-trained and educated work force.''
 In addition, at a time when China is encouraging its new companies to offer employees stock options to get Chinese innovators to stay at home and start new firms, the Bush team has been mutely going along with a change in accounting standards that will force U.S. companies to expense stock options by June 2005. This is likely to dampen the growth of our own high-tech companies and encourage U.S.-educated Indian and Chinese techies to go back home.
 I am not a China basher. We need to engage China, and help accommodate its rising power with the world system, but the only way to do that is from a position of strength. But everything the Bush team is doing is ensuring that it will be from a position of weakness.

HEADLINE: HOUSE PROUD; Toddler-Proof and Party-Perfect

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MASON

 BODY:
LAST Saturday the TriBeCa loft of Dominique Lvy and Dorothy Berwin was the scene of a rollicking dinner party capping off a week of art shows in New York. The guests -- artists, visiting Europeans and collectors-- caroused late into the night amid artworks by Cindy Sherman, Tom Sachs, and Tim Noble and Sue Webster, whose wall-mounted light sculpture in the front hall flashed the word ''Forever'' all night. Cheers erupted when the artist Lisa Yuskavage demonstrated her skill at fireman's lifts by hoisting Ms. Berwin over her shoulder not once but twice.
 The following morning Ms. Lvy, an art consultant who is the former international director of private sales of 20th-century and contemporary art at Christie's, was nursing a hangover and wearing dark glasses as she greeted guests at a brunch for the opening of a show of Polaroids by Andy Warhol, the first exhibition at her sleek new gallery, Dominique Lvy Fine Art, on East 74th Street. 
 ''It's been a long week,'' Ms. Lvy said wearily. Ms. Berwin kept everyone amused by recalling the exploits of an artist who had sat on the lap of a married financier the night before, asking him if he was rich enough to buy her paintings. 
 Ms. Berwin is an independent producer whose latest film, ''On a Clear Day,'' was selected for opening night at Sundance in January. As significant players in the overlapping worlds of contemporary art and film, Ms. Lvy and Ms. Berwin have emerged as one of Downtown's new power couples. 
 They entertain frequently in their 6,300-square-foot apartment, which is filled with contemporary art and designer furniture and suggests a stage set for heroines in an updated Noel Coward comedy of manners. Gertrude Lawrence would feel right at home.
 The women met in 1998 at the London premiere of a film co-produced by Ms. Berwin. Ms. Lvy had recently moved from London to New York, and they began a transatlantic courtship by e-mail. When they started living together in 2001, they found that they shared remarkably similar tastes in furniture, art and even flowers. Both were already passionate collectors of furniture by Modern and contemporary designers.
 ''Looking around, you couldn't say which was hers or mine before,'' Ms. Lvy said. ''And we both only like white flowers,'' she added, gesturing to a lavish arrangement of parrot tulips and lilies in their favorite noncolor.
 Ms. Lvy and Ms. Berwin are known for their high style and strong character. As daughters of powerful European businessmen -- a Swiss financier and a British lawyer, respectively -- both have inherited the acumen and steely resolve of their fathers. And both are highly gregarious. ''I was so intimidated by Dominique's high profile at Christie's,'' said Yvonne Force, an art consultant. ''Then I realized that these two black-haired power ladies are girls who want to have fun.''
 They are also doting parents. Ms. Berman, who was divorced a few years before she met Ms. Lvy, brought her son, Caleb, now 10, to New York. Ms. Lvy gave birth to a son, Samuel, two years ago.
 ''Life is very full,'' Ms. Berwin said. 
 Ms. Lvy found the apartment in 2000, a year after Fran-->ois Pinault, the French billionaire who owns Christie's, invited her to move to New York to run the private sales division, which generated more than $100 million a year on her watch. 
 The apartment was a warren of small office cubicles. ''No one wanted this space,'' she said. ''But I loved the high ceilings and huge windows, and I decided to go for it.''
 In 2003, when Ms. Lvy was pregnant with Sam, Ms. Berwin bought the apartment next door, which gave the couple a nursery wing and substantial office space. That year Ms. Lvy decided to leave Christie's and go out on her own. ''I wanted my business to be more haute couture, so I can work with artists I'm passionate about,'' she said.
 The conjoined apartments are bridged by a futuristic-looking egg-shaped screening room with curved banquettes and walls upholstered in dark purple soundproofing material, which contribute to a sense of being inside a plush cocoon. The room also serves a symbolic nexus between the domestic and professional zones of the expanded apartment. By day it functions as a screening room for InFilm Productions, Ms. Berwin's boutique movie company; by night it serves as the family's media room. 
 Much of the furniture in the apartment comes from Galerie Kreo, Ms. Lvy's favorite design store in Paris (www.galeriekreo.com), including a powder-blue chaise by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, an oak desk from the 1950's by Jean Prouv, and a contoured aluminum commode by Marc Newson.
 The chandelier over the dining table, composed of trumpetlike tubes of blown glass, was commissioned from Jeff Zimmerman, a glass artist, through the R 20th Century gallery on Franklin Street (www.r20thcentury.com).
 The couple decorated the mauve and yellow kitchen with a fairy-light train strung between two columns. ''Everyone has been asking the name of the artist,'' Ms. Lvy said. ''They think it's a piece by Tim and Sue,'' she added, referring to Mr. Noble and Ms. Webster, London artists whose work has fetched $300,000 at auction. Actually the train is an $80 Christmas decoration from a costume shop on Lower Broadway.
 There is plenty of bona fide art of course. A mushroom sculpture by Takashi Murakami springs up from the carpet of the media room. On the wall at the end of the table where the family eats supper each night is a self-portrait of Cindy Sherman as a clown, a picture that has particular resonance for Ms. Lvy, whose first job was working as a clown at children's parties. Nearby a life-size orange rat by the renegade sculptor Tom Sachs, fashioned out of torn-up Herm<heart>s gift bags and with a matching syringe clenched in its teeth, adorns a side table.
 The 45-foot-long living room is dominated by a wildly colorful painting by Franz Ackerman, a Berlin artist. ''All the colors leapt out at me when I bought it,'' Ms. Lvy said. ''It's really the heart of the apartment.''
 The couple do not seem concerned about the potentially combustive proximity of children and expensive artwork. ''Strangely enough, Samuel has learned not to touch,'' Ms. Lvy said. ''And Caleb was always very sensitive to it. Everywhere they go, they look at the art.'' 
 A budding artist, Caleb has tried copying the Ackerman, and recently finished a charcoal drawing of the Sherman clown, which he gave to Ms. Yuskavage.
 The other day Ms. Berwin's persona seemed to change abruptly as she walked from the living room to her office, a large room she shares with four assistants. With a brisk, no-nonsense manner she began peppering one of them with questions about faxes and budgets, dictating letters and fielding calls from Gaby Dellal, the director of ''On a Clear Day.'' (The film, starring Peter Mullin and Brenda Blethyn, is about an unemployed Scot who decides to swim the English Channel.) 
 ''Working at home is wonderful,'' Ms. Berwin said between calls. ''Not only do I save travel time, I get to spend more time with the children. It's extremely practical and efficient.''
 Meanwhile Ms. Lvy was in the living room, trying to relax in a tangerine armchair designed by Jean Prouv. She looked mildly exasperated as her 2-year-old son scampered across the room and turned on the vacuum.
 ''Sam loves everything to do with cleaning,'' Ms. Lvy said. ''We were in Central Park this afternoon having an ice cream and all he wanted to do was come home to play with the vacuum cleaner.''
 Unlike Ms. Berwin, who shares Sam's zeal for cleanliness, Ms. Lvy is cheerfully undomesticated. ''Dorothy is quite obsessed with order,'' Ms. Lvy said, as if identifying a troubling character flaw. Ms. Berwin is also an adventurous cook; Ms. Lvy prefers to make reservations. ''When Dorothy's not here, I order in,'' Ms. Lvy admitted.
 Sam is already bilingual. ''He speaks French to me and English to Dorothy,'' Ms. Lvy said. His favorite word of late is ''ridiculous,'' which he applies liberally to every situation. Sam's antics make his mother erupt with giggles and hugs. ''I'm a little bit silly gaga with my son,'' she said. 
 Sam's father is Fermin Vilanova, a Spanish advertising executive who lives in Barcelona. ''He's an extraordinary father with a very warm heart,'' Ms. Lvy said. ''He comes to see him every month, and they speak twice a week.''
 ''I think a child needs a daddy and a mummy,'' she added. ''There was no way I was going to have a child without a present father.''
 After a marathon of art fairs and complex deals Ms. Lvy seemed to be unwinding as she sipped a cup of chamomile tea. Until, that is, the calm was disturbed by the loud drone of the vacuum cleaner. 
 ''Darling boy!'' Ms. Lvy said plaintively. ''No more cleaning.''

HEADLINE: Children's Life Expectancy Being Cut Short by Obesity 

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 16 

 BODY:
For the first time in two centuries, the current generation of children in America may have shorter life expectancies than their parents, according to a new report, which contends that the rapid rise in childhood obesity, if left unchecked, could shorten life spans by as much as five years.
 The report, to be published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, says the prevalence and severity of obesity is so great, especially in children, that the associated diseases and complications -- Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, cancer -- are likely to strike people at younger and younger ages.
 The report, which wades into several controversial aspects of public health, is likely to stir debate on both scientific and political grounds. The health effects of being obese depend on many factors, like one's fitness level. And estimating these effects could alter the expected cost of medical care and the size of pension payouts. 
 The report says the average life expectancy of today's adults, roughly 77 years, is at least four to nine months shorter than it would be if there were no obesity. That means that obesity is already shortening average life spans by a greater rate than accidents, homicides and suicides combined, the authors say.
 And they say that because of obesity, the children of today could wind up living two to five years less than they otherwise would, a negative effect on life span that could be greater than that caused by cancer or coronary heart disease.
 ''Obesity is such that this generation of children could be the first basically in the history of the United States to live less healthful and shorter lives than their parents,'' said Dr. David S. Ludwig, director of the obesity program at Children's Hospital Boston, and one of the authors of the report.
 ''We're in the quiet before the storm,'' Dr. Ludwig said. ''It's like what happens if suddenly a massive number of young children started chain smoking. At first you wouldn't see much public health impact.'' He added, ''But years later it would translate into emphysema, heart disease and cancer.''
 ''There is an unprecedented increase in prevalence of obesity at younger and younger ages without much obvious public health impact,'' Dr. Ludwig said. ''But when they start developing heart attack, stroke, kidney failures, amputations, blindness, and ultimately death at younger ages, then that could be a huge effect on life expectancy.''
 Longevity projections are notoriously slippery and politically charged, with consequences for issues like Social Security, pension plans, health insurance and health care costs. Some demographers and obesity experts question whether the authors' estimate is alarmist.
 ''Yes, it is almost certain that the risks of these various diseases will rise as obesity rises in the population, but you also have to assume that the medical sciences will get better at treating some of these complications,'' said Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, an obesity researcher at Columbia University. ''Certainly doing that is going to end up costing more, but it may not end up stripping months or years off life.''
 An editorial in the same issue of The New England Journal, written by Dr. Samuel H. Preston, a demographer at the University of Pennsylvania, raises similar questions. It suggests that the predictions of decreased life expectancy might be ''excessively gloomy,'' given potential advances in medicine and genetic engineering, and the reduction of harmful behaviors like smoking.
 Dr. Preston concludes, however, that ''the rising prevalence and severity of obesity are capable of offsetting the array of positive influences on longevity.'' 
 The report's lead author, Dr. S. Jay Olshansky, a professor of public health at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said he considered the report's projections of reduced life expectancy to be ''very conservative, and I think the negative effect is probably greater than we have shown.''
 ''Hopefully, we can fix obesity so that our projections are wrong,'' Dr. Olshansky added. ''But we're seeing such large increases in obesity in the last couple of decades that it's hard to imagine that we're going to be able to work fast enough.''
 Estimating the number of obesity-related deaths is controversial, too. Last November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said its earlier estimate that 400,000 people die annually from obesity was inflated. A revised, lower estimate is expected soon. The New England Journal report uses an estimate of 300,000 deaths, which some experts contend is still too high.
 The report projected life expectancy by calculating how much longer people would live if ''everyone who is currently obese were to lose enough weight to maintain an optimal'' body-mass index, a measure of the relationship between a person's height and weight. The authors believe it is more accurate than other projections. 
 The report comes at a time when the country is embroiled in a debate over Social Security. While the report's authors say they started their research long before the current debate, they write that ''the U.S. population may be inadvertently saving Social Security by becoming more obese'' and dying sooner, but that ''this 'benefit' will occur at the expense of the economy in the form of lost productivity before citizens reach retirement and large increases in Medicare costs associated with obesity and its complications.''

HEADLINE: OPEC Raises Ceiling, but Price Hits a Record

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: ISFAHAN, Iran 

 BODY:
Oil prices rose to a record yesterday, brushing aside a mostly symbolic decision by OPEC to raise its production ceiling by half a million barrels a day.
 The reaction on oil markets was not exactly what OPEC ministers anticipated earlier in the day and increased pressure on OPEC to add more barrels to the market. It also raised the likelihood that the cartel would increase its ceiling by another 500,000 barrels before it meets again in June. 
 Signs that demand is outpacing supply drove oil prices higher in trading in New York. Oil futures rose after the United States Energy Information Administration reported that inventories of gasoline fell 2.9 million barrels last week, to 221.4 million barrels -- a much sharper decline than expected. Crude oil inventories rose 2.6 million barrels, to 305.2 million barrels. 
 Crude oil for April delivery rose as high as $56.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange before settling up 2.6 percent, at $56.46. The price of oil is now nearly 50 percent higher than it was a year ago. On Wall Street, shares fell sharply as oil prices rose; the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 112.03 points.
 ''The lack of both spare capacity and inventory cushions to cover potential surges in demand or disruptions in supply in a strong demand environment is the primary force behind currently high prices,'' said the E.I.A., the analytical arm of the Energy Department. 
 The decision by OPEC will not actually add extra oil to the market because the cartel's members, excluding Iraq, are already producing 27.7 million barrels a day -- above their new quota of 27.5 million barrels. Still, the decision was intended to send a signal that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was doing something to push prices down. 
 ''There are a lot of messages in this decision,'' the OPEC president, Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah, said after the meeting here. ''First, OPEC has the will to increase its ceiling; second, OPEC has the capability to add more oil; and third, the additional 500,000 barrels will be real production if the markets need it.''
 OPEC has been coming under pressure from consuming nations, including the United States, to help curb prices that have more than doubled over the last two years. The gains have been fueled by growing demand in Asia and the United States and tight supplies in producing countries.
 This is the fourth time in less than a year that OPEC has raised its quota. The group has an option to raise the ceiling again, ''if prices remain at these levels,'' Mr. Sabah said.
 OPEC expects demand to rise sharply in the second half of the year while production from non-OPEC producers like Russia is dropping, increasing pressure to raise output. The trouble is that most of OPEC's members are currently producing close to full capacity.
 Perhaps that explains why the spike in prices left oil ministers short of words. Bijan Zangeneh, Iran's oil minister, said: ''What more can we do? The market has confused us.''
 The announcement reflects a policy shift toward encouraging consumers to build up stocks to help bring prices down. A few weeks ago, some OPEC ministers were considering cutting the group's production to prevent a price slump in the second quarter, a time of the year when demand for oil drops. 
 OPEC is concerned about strong demand at the end of the year. It forecast that it would need to produce 30.3 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter, a time of the year when demand for oil typically grows. 
 ''OPEC tried to surprise the market,'' Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, an oil consultant, said from Washington. ''In doing so, it reinforced the view that OPEC is panicking about fourth-quarter demand, and they decide that prices have more upside potential.'' 
 ''The more OPEC is perceived to be powerless, the more the market will bet that prices are going up,'' Mr. Diwan said. ''The Isfahan meeting showed us that there is little to stop the bulls but building stocks for next winter. Will OPEC allow that to happen?''
 When it met six weeks ago in Vienna, OPEC dropped its price range of $22 to $28 a barrel and said that instead it would monitor commercial stocks -- or oil held in consuming nations -- to help set production policy. The group indicated that it would curb production if commercial stocks rose above 56 days of consumption. They currently stand around 51 days. 
 But now, the group seems to be encouraging consumers to fill up their reserves. ''We hope that stocks will be built,'' Mr. Sabah said. ''If there is any shortage in the markets, the stocks will be there.''

HEADLINE: Port of New York Imports Rise Faster Than Places to Put Them

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Cargo passing through the Port of New York and New Jersey set records, in both value and volume, in 2004, increasing the need for new facilities to store the incoming merchandise, government officials said on Wednesday. 
 Richard J. Codey, the acting governor of New Jersey, praised the gains as signs of the region's economic strength and he urged an acceleration of a $600 million project to improve rail connections at the port.
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey must invest more and faster in expanding the port and linking it to the region's rail network because ''we face real competition from ports along the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf Coasts,'' Mr. Codey said at a press briefing overlooking loading docks in Elizabeth. 
 Port Authority officials released a list of 18 properties in northern New Jersey that are potential sites for additional warehouses and distribution operations. The possibilities include a Chevron refinery in Perth Amboy and the Military Ocean Terminal of Bayonne.
 The Port Authority and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority are spending $1.8 million to find and evaluate the properties. 
 Finding more places to prepare imported goods for sale is a priority because business at the port is rising steadily, Mr. Codey said. The total value of all of the cargo that moved through the port last year was more than $114 billion, he said, an increase of more than 14 percent from 2003.
 That growth translated into more ''high-paying, high-quality jobs'' at the port and more economic activity in the region, Mr. Codey said. 
 What the port took in last year in foreign goods was worth about four times as much as what it sent out. All told, the 2004 trade deficit at the port was $67.4 billion, or more than one-tenth of the national deficit. In one year, it increased almost 20 percent.
 The main beneficiary was China, the source of much of the low-priced clothing, toys and electronics in the region's stores. China is by far the region's largest trading partner, accounting for one of every five tons of cargo imported or exported.
 Among regions, Asia has surpassed Europe as the region's No. 1 trading partner, said Robert T. Beard, who supervises research on port commerce at the Port Authority. Asia now accounts for more than 25 percent of the trade through the port, compared with 23 percent for Europe, he said.
 Most of those goods come packed in 20-foot-long steel containers stacked on the decks of enormous freighters. Enough goods passed through the port last year to fill 3.15 million containers, up 11.7 percent from 2.8 million in 2003, according to the Port Authority.
 Mr. Codey said the port handles more automobiles than any other in the country, a total of 728,700 last year. That was an increase of about 100,000 cars from 2003 and, surprisingly, more than half of that growth was on the outbound side. More than 97,000 cars were exported in 2004, up from fewer than 43,000 in 2003.
 With a bit more chagrin, Mr. Codey added that he was standing in the nation's leading port of entry for alcoholic beverages.

HEADLINE: Fears for a Program That Lends Just a Little

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Since the beginning of the 1990's, thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs have moved away from unemployment or welfare by borrowing a few thousand dollars -- even as little as $500 -- to set up their own small business.
 Diane Holloway, a single mother and out-of-work pastry chef, used a $5,000 loan from a local women's economic agency in Silver City, N.M., several years ago to cobble together a restaurant in an old storefront, cooking for customers with a scavenged pizza oven and serving them on a half-dozen mismatched tables.
 ''That money made the difference,'' said Mrs. Holloway, whose restaurant, Diane's, is now thriving, with 30 employees. She plans to open two more restaurants next year. ''Without it, I wouldn't have had a chance to get my business going.'' 
 Now the modest financial backing that Mrs. Holloway and other women and minorities have used to create jobs for themselves and others may soon be shut off. The Bush administration has proposed ending the funding for the Small Business Administration's microloan program, which provides seed money and technical assistance to start-ups and low-income entrepreneurs.
 Small-business owners like Mrs. Holloway were wooed in the recent election by both parties, which hailed them as driving the American economy by creating millions of jobs across the country. But now that budget time is here, a political debate is boiling over administration proposals to scale back small-business programs.
 Two of the S.B.A.'s signature loan programs are in trouble, according to some members of Congress who support them. 
 One, the microloan program, is targeted for elimination. It lent almost $33 million to 2,400 entrepreneurs in fiscal 2004, and is one of 10 agency programs set for termination in the budget proposed by President Bush for 2006. Supporters argue that a microloan is almost always the essential first step to success for women and minorities, who usually do not have the money, credit history or collateral to borrow from a commercial bank.
 The other, the S.B.A.'s giant 7 (a) guaranteed loan program, is in turmoil. While it is not expected to be cut back, it has been operating on fees generated by its loans after running out of money in 2004. Supporters fear it may eventually be slated for elimination, following the pattern of another loan program, intended to help high-technology companies, that the administration now proposes ending. 
 The guaranteed loan program backed $12.7 billion in loans in fiscal 2004 to nearly 75,000 businesses. 
 Defenders of the administration's proposed cutbacks, including the agency's administrator, Hector V. Barreto, say that, in reality, money for small businesses will be little affected, and the government will save by not having to pay for the technical assistance that the law requires for loan recipients. 
 There is little chance that Congress, which has resisted previous administration efforts to prune the agency's budget heavily, will approve the proposed Bush administration cutbacks wholesale. Some influential Republicans are opposed, including Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the chairwoman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Still, advocates of the program say the proposals are a serious threat to a program that has an exemplary record of success. 
 Women have received the greatest share of microloans, where the S.B.A. furnishes seed capital for lending by intermediaries, usually local nonprofit groups. According to Congressional data for fiscal 2004, more than 60 percent of such loans went to women, and the program had a default rate of just over 1 percent. The government also spent $15 million on technical assistance.
 Teri Wade, who used a $5,000 microloan to open a salon in Herndon, Va., offering cellulite-reduction treatments, said that the hands-on assistance she received was crucial to her start-up.
 ''I would have made major mistakes,'' she said, ''like not getting liability insurance, or giving away too much of my business to get financing. Without that advice, I wouldn't be in business.''
 The S.B.A. maintains that microloans, which average $13,600, can be folded into its guaranteed loan program, where the average loan is $15,300. The agency said that around one-third of guaranteed loans were under $35,000, indicating that they were borrowings by start-up firms.
 The members of Congress said that recent changes in the way the guaranteed loan program was run, especially higher fees for borrowers and lenders, have already crimped the ability of small businesses to get loans. Moreover, they say, the fees and paperwork make smaller loans uneconomical for many banks.
 Last October, the S.B.A.'s guaranteed loan program was shifted to fee-only, meaning the program receives its support from fees charged to borrowers and banks, and does not have yearly Congressional appropriations to make up any financial shortfall. As a result, the fees have risen, to as much as double on some loans. 
 ''The borrower's costs are now double for the smaller loans of up to $150,000,'' said Richard Proudfit, chief executive of the Gateway Business Bank, a small bank in Cerritos, Calif., that lends to small businesses.
 Mr. Barreto, the S.B.A. administrator, said higher fees had not curbed credit, citing statistics that S.B.A.-backed lending rose 11 percent in the last quarter of 2004 from a year earlier, to $4.4 billion.
 But Representative Nydia Velazquez of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, argued that higher fees were pushing lenders out of the picture. For example, she said that in 2001, more than 5,000 banks made S.B.A.-backed loans; three years later, only half as many banks did so. And she contested Mr. Barreto's claim of increased S.B.A. lending, saying that the agency's lending declined by about 10 percent in the last quarter of 2004, to $3.56 billion.
 The members of Congress say that confidence in the agency's guaranteed loan program has been undermined, citing the disruption caused when the program ran out of money in early 2004 and was shut down for two weeks until an emergency appropriation was made. Then last April, the maximum amount of money businesses could borrow was lowered temporarily to $750,000, from $1.5 million.
 That was damaging to some ventures. Marilyn Landis, a consultant for small businesses, said that lack of funding sank the effort of an established Pittsburgh trucking company to expand by buying a 40-truck fleet from a retiring owner.
 The prospective buyer could not meet the $1.5 million asking price and the owner, who was in her 80's, did not want to carry a second loan. ''In the end, she sold the entire fleet of dump trucks and laid off all 30 employees,'' said Ms. Landis, of Basic Business Concepts in Pittsburgh. ''No one would finance this without S.B.A. backing.'' 
 For a new business, it can be difficult to obtain even an S.B.A.-backed loan, small-business owners and bankers agree. 
 ''It's fine and dandy,'' said Ms. Wade, the Virginia salon owner, ''to be talking about 7(a) loans, but those are not for start-ups, they are for established businesses.'' 
 In New Mexico, Mrs. Holloway noted that it was not until she had been in business for 18 months that she was able to get a $30,000 S.B.A.-backed loan for her restaurant.
 Only a tiny percentage -- 5.7 percent -- of guaranteed loans go to rural small businesses, which is one reason Senator Snowe opposes terminating the microloan program. Fully 40 percent of microloans currently go to micro enterprises in rural areas, so her constituents in Maine would suffer if the program were shut down. 
 She has also criticized a proposed $85 million reduction, to $593 million, in the S.B.A.'s overall budget for fiscal 2006. Among the cutbacks she is fighting is the proposed termination of the agency's Small Business Investment Company participating securities program, which encourages venture capitalists to invest in high-technology companies.
 Her counterpart in the House, Representative Donald A. Manzullo of Illinois, a Republican who leads the Small Business Committee, also has resisted administration plans to terminate the decade-old program, which, in fiscal 2004, backed more than 2,100 equity investments in small businesses by venture capitalists, totaling more than $1.4 billion.
 Rich Carter, a spokesman for the House committee, said, ''This program has had some hard times, but we feel we can salvage it to help small manufacturers.''
 Ms. Velazquez said that minority-owned ventures would be hurt most because they received, in 2004, only 11 percent of the investment company money, totaling $148 million.
 Still, she predicted that the proposed cutbacks would not win approval easily in Congress, ''because no one wants to be on the record as opposing small business.''

HEADLINE: Americans save so little, but what, if anything, can be done to change that?

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank is an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University and the author, most recently, of ''What Price the Moral High Ground?''

 BODY:
THE single-cell paramecium is about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. In many species, mature cells divide daily into two daughter cells. In schools around the world, this feature has made the paramecium a favorite vehicle for illustrating the miracle of compound interest. 
 Left unchecked for 64 days, a single paramecium would become a colony of 9,223,400,000,000,000,000 members. Since 125 paramecia lined up shoulder-to-shoulder would span about an inch, this means a string spanning more than 1,164,600,000,000 miles -- over 6,000 round trips between the Earth and sun. 
 The story is less dramatic, of course, for growth rates much smaller than the paramecium's. Even with relatively small growth rates, however, the gains are impressive. Money invested at 7 percent interest, for example, will double every 10 years, which means that $1,000 deposited at that rate by Benjamin Franklin in the late 1700's would be worth more than $3 trillion today. The same $1,000 invested in 1945 would be worth more than $64,000.
 Given the miracle of compound interest, our ability to invest at even modest rates of return represents an extraordinary opportunity. Yet Americans have largely squandered it. Our savings rate, always low by international standards, has fallen sharply in recent decades. 
 Almost a fifth of American adults have net worth of zero or less. Even more troubling, it is now common for families to pay $1,800 and more in annual interest on revolving credit card balances. Those families experience the miracle of compound interest in reverse.
 The savings shortfall threatens not just those who face retrenchment in retirement living standards, but also the country's economic prosperity. With little of Americans' own savings to finance domestic investment, the United States has been borrowing more than $600 billion each year from foreigners. 
 The mushrooming foreign debt, now almost one-fourth of gross domestic product, has already weakened the dollar and threatens far more serious harm.
 Why do Americans save so little? Lack of self-discipline is one reason. If that were the only problem, families could solve it by simply committing a portion of each year's income growth into a payroll savings account, placing it out of temptation's reach.
 But the savings shortfall also stems from a second source, one less amenable to this solution. The basic idea is captured in the following thought experiment: 
 If you were society's median earner, which option would you prefer? 
 You save enough to support a comfortable standard of living in retirement, but your children attend a school whose students score in the 20th percentile on standardized tests in reading and math; or 
 You save too little to support a comfortable standard of living in retirement, but your children attend a school whose students score in the 50th percentile on those tests. 
 It is an unpleasant choice, to be sure, but most people say they would pick the second option. 
 Because the concept of a ''good'' school is relative, this thought experiment captures an essential element of the savings decision confronting most families. If others bid for houses in better school districts, failure to do likewise will often consign one's children to inferior schools. Yet no matter how much each family spends, half of all children must attend schools in the bottom half. 
 The savings decision thus resembles the collective action problem inherent in a military arms race. Each nation knows that it would be better if everyone spent less on arms. Yet if others keep spending, it is too dangerous not to follow suit. Curtailing an arms race requires an enforceable agreement. Similarly, unless all families can bind themselves to save more, those who do so unilaterally risk having to send their children to inferior schools. 
 People in other countries also face temptation and collective action problems. Why do they save more than we do? One explanation is that both problems are made worse by income disparities, which have widened much faster in this country than elsewhere. 
 A collective agreement that each family save a portion of its income growth each year would attack both sources of the savings shortfall. Such an agreement might specify that one-third of income growth be diverted into savings until a target savings rate -- say, 12 percent of income -- was achieved. A family whose income did not rise in a given year would be exempt from the agreement.
 Such an agreement would put the magic of compound interest to work for retirement savings, a benefit that the current Social Security system completely misses. Most of the money currently taken from workers in payroll taxes gathers no interest in the decades before their retirement. Instead, it is paid directly to current retirees, who spend it on rent and food. We have a pay-as-we-go system because the program was started in the Great Depression, when there was simply no money to create a fully financed system. 
 The good news is that Americans now have ample wealth to support such a system. Some have praised President Bush's proposal to privatize Social Security as a move that will create a fully financed program of retirement savings. It is no such thing. Under his proposal, the transition to private accounts is to be financed with borrowed money. The interest earned on private accounts would thus be offset by the interest paid on the money borrowed to create them, leaving the system right where it started. 
 Many would object that requiring families to save a portion of each year's income growth would be an infringement of individual liberty. Yet it is the very absence of such a requirement that currently prevents most American families from saving as much as they wish to. Just as nations find it advantageous to restrict their options by signing arms reduction treaties, families may have a similar interest in limiting their freedom to engage in bidding wars for houses in top school districts. 
 It is clear, in any event, that the failure to save entails risks of its own to freedom. America's rapidly rising debt to foreigners now threatens the economic prosperity on which so many of our cherished liberties depend.

HEADLINE: U.S. Added a Record $666 Billion to Its Debts Abroad Last Year

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
The United States' indebtedness to the rest of the world climbed sharply from October through December, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday, as the broadest measure of the nation's international economic transactions hit a record deficit of nearly $666 billion for all of 2004.
 The figures, though not unexpected, highlighted the United States' rising demand for foreign capital -- much of it from Asian central banks -- to finance business investment and consumption by Americans. 
 Foreign governments bought American securities worth $355 billion last year, providing slightly more than half of the money needed to finance the United States' deficit in goods, services and overseas payments known as the current-account balance. There is also fresh evidence that as Asian central banks slow their purchases, other foreign investors and hedge fund operators are avidly stepping in to fill the gap. 
 All that money from abroad helps keep long-term interest rates low, lifts housing prices and encourages spending on everything from computers and cars to toys and textiles.
 But it has also allowed the United States to spend far more than it produces, a trend that has ignited a fierce debate over the potential consequences for global economic stability and the value of the dollar against foreign currencies.
 The current-account deficit reached a record in dollar terms, as well as when adjusted for inflation and as a share of the total economy. At $666 billion, the deficit was 5.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, a level that most economists say should continue to put pressure on the dollar to weaken.
 The deficit widened by 13.3 percent, to $187.9 billion, in the fourth quarter of last year. The deficit for the full year climbed 24 percent.
 Analysts in one camp warn that the widening imbalances have set the stage for a potentially brutal drop in the value of the dollar, which could fuel inflation and push up interest rates.
 But other analysts, including many at the Federal Reserve, contend that imbalances are less ominous than they appear because foreign investors continue to pump money into the United States.
 Few specialists in either camp expect the gap to narrow significantly this year. Economic growth in the United States remains far higher than in Europe or Japan, meaning that American demand for imported goods is likely to keep climbing faster than foreign demand for American goods.
 And even though the dollar has dropped sharply against the euro and more modestly against the Japanese yen, making American exports cheaper, the Chinese government has kept its currency, the yuan, at a fixed exchange rate against the dollar for more than a decade.
 ''Foreign government currency manipulation is the root cause of the U.S. trade deficit,'' said Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland. At $355 billion, Mr. Morici said, foreign government purchases of American securities last year were equal to 20 percent of the value of imports to the United States.
 That can be seen as, in effect, a subsidy intended to encourage American consumers to buy more imports, though that also makes it harder for producers in the United States to sell goods abroad. It can also be seen as a gift to Americans that provides them with cheap imports. 
 European leaders have become increasingly unhappy, because the euro is allowed to float freely against the dollar and has soared to levels that are now pinching European exporters.
 The euro has climbed 35 percent against the dollar since its low point in February 2002. The euro climbed again after the data was released Wednesday, rising from $1.33 late Tuesday to $1.34 Wednesday afternoon. 
 As the strong euro has pinched European exporters, their products have become more expensive in dollars. BMW, the German manufacturer of luxury cars, predicted on Wednesday that its earnings would be flat this year because the weakness of the dollar was forcing it to squeeze its margins in the United States.
 European leaders have quietly pleaded with the Bush administration to take stronger action, perhaps by leading a coordinated effort to strengthen the global value of the dollar.
 The Bush administration has been trying to coax the Chinese government for nearly two years to adopt more flexible exchange rates, and Chinese officials have said that they will move in that direction. But thus far, the administration's financial diplomacy has yet to produce any tangible results.
 ''The Chinese have clearly stated that they intend to move to a flexible exchange rate,'' said Robert Nichols, a spokesman for the Treasury Department. ''China is making progress in establishing the financial infrastructure for a move to greater flexibility, and the U.S. government is assisting China in these efforts.''
 Despite growing unease about the trade deficit, global investors have been buying up American government securities as enthusiastically as ever.
 On Tuesday, the Treasury Department reported that net foreign purchases of American securities shot up 51 percent in January. Most of that recent investment appears to have been from the private sector rather than from central banks.
 Sean Callow, a senior currency analyst at IDEAglobal, an economic research firm in New York, said that net foreign direct investment, like purchasing companies or buying real estate, had plunged lately.
 ''The U.S. is still extremely attractive to foreign investors,'' Mr. Callow said. ''But it does bother me that foreign investors are not enthusiastic about direct investment or in U.S. equities. The rest of the world only seems willing to invest in lower-risk U.S. investments.''

HEADLINE: JUDGE RULES AGAINST FORD IN DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A federal judge in Tennessee ruled that Ford's Primus lending unit discriminated against African-American buyers by allowing dealers to mark up interest rates. 
Judge Aleta Trauger said she would issue an order stopping the practice unless Primus reached a settlement by April 18, said Michael Terry, an attorney for customers. The buyers claimed that dealers charged black customers an average of $450 a car more through higher interest rates. Seven cases, including lawsuits against the lending arms of General Motors and Nissan, have settled by agreeing to change policies, Mr. Terry said.

HEADLINE: Seeking Energy Solutions

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Putting Last Things First'' (editorial, March 10), you assert that President Bush and this administration don't ''make a big deal'' about reducing America's dependence on foreign sources of oil.
 In fact, from his first weeks in office, President Bush has demonstrated his commitment to reducing America's dependence on foreign sources of energy without imperiling American jobs or economic growth.
 He formed a panel that developed the first energy plan in more than a decade that focused on an array of solutions including improvements in energy conservation, expansion of renewable energy sources like wind and biomass, and the development of clean energy sources like hydrogen. 
 While environmentally responsible domestic production of oil and gas is, indeed, part of the overall strategy, it is only a piece of the puzzle. Today, with the exception of items that require Congressional action, 95 percent of that plan has been put into effect.
 The energy challenges we face today have been decades in the making, and now is the time to act. While finding an answer may require innovation and exploration, the only ''fixation'' President Bush and this administration have is on finding a solution.

HEADLINE: Oil and G.M.'s Dim Outlook Push Shares Down Sharply

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
General Motors' prediction of a loss in the first quarter and a new high for the price of crude oil were just too much for stocks yesterday, as the three main market gauges dropped 0.8 percent or more. European stock markets also fell on the news. 
 The stock market decline was led by economically sensitive stocks, including G.M. The automaker's struggles, along with oil at $56.46 a barrel, could be signaling a fall-off in consumer spending, which would mean slower economic growth and lower corporate earnings. 
 ''It was a growth-scare market,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. ''G.M. raised the idea that the consumer may be slowing down.'' 
 G.M.'s announcement, in which it forecast a loss this quarter of around $1.50 a share, also helped drag down the investment-grade and high-yield bond markets. Some analysts said the selling could continue in the weeks ahead. 
 The price of G.M.'s 6.75 percent bond maturing in 2014 fell to $90.05, a 3.8 percent drop, as the yield jumped to 8.26 percent, from 7.69 percent Tuesday, according to J.P. Morgan.
 G.M. bonds were battered not only by the company announcement but also by three credit rating agencies that all responded negatively to the news.
 Fitch Ratings downgraded G.M. bonds to BBB-, its lowest investment-grade rating. Standard & Poor's changed G.M.'s outlook to negative, which means the rating agency could reduce G.M.'s rating to below investment grade, or junk bond status, in the months ahead. Moody's Investors Service put G.M. on review, which means the company could be knocked down to Moody's lowest investment-grade rating in the weeks ahead. 
 Unlike the stock market, the investment-grade corporate and high-yield bond markets had been very hot recently, with several indicators showing their price valuations to be at or near multiyear highs. But because Treasury interest rates have risen sharply in the last month -- the yield on the 10-year note jumped half a percentage point to 4.55 percent -- sentiment in the corporate bond market has changed recently, said Stephen Antczak, fixed-income strategist at UBS.
 ''And this was a catalyst for more profit taking,'' he said, referring to the news from G.M. ''I would expect overall sentiment to remain cautious,'' he added, especially because it is just a few weeks until companies begin announcing their earnings for the first quarter.
 Edward B. Marrinan, head investment-grade strategist at J.P. Morgan, said another factor weighing on corporate bonds recently was bad news at other big companies, including the ouster of the chief executive of American International Group, Maurice R. Greenberg, and the downgrading of Liberty Media to junk bond status by Fitch Ratings.
 ''The corporate bond market is under some pressure,'' he said. ''But I would not say we have reached a turning point. There is resilience in the bond market because we still have too many people who want to own bonds.'' 
 The government's report that the current-account deficit was a record $666 billion last year, and the dollar's fall in response to that news, also weighed on financial markets. The euro was valued at $1.3414 as the dollar fell 0.7 percent. The dollar dropped 0.3 percent against the yen, to 104.12.. 
 While prices in the Treasury market rose and yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell, some analysts said this was because money from the corporate bond market and the stock market was looking for a safe place to take cover for awhile. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 9/32 to 95 31/32 while the yield slipped to 4.51 percent, from 4.54 percent Tuesday.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 112.03 points, or 1 percent, to 10,633.07. GM's stocks fell $4.71, or 14 percent to $29.01, its lowest since the end of 1994. The G.M. decline accounted for about 35 points of the Dow's decline. The fall in G.M. and other economically sensitive stocks in the Dow, including Alcoa, Citigroup, Caterpillar and DuPont, accounted for about 53 points of the Dow's fall.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.68 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,188.07. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 19.23 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,015.75.

HEADLINE: Bush Makes His Mark

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz once wrote that a major lesson of the cold war for American foreign policy was ''the importance of leadership and what it consists of: not lecturing and posturing and demanding, but demonstrating that your friends will be protected and taken care of, that your enemies will be punished, and that those who refuse to support you will regret having done so.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz's career has hewed to those same unshrinking precepts, and in nominating him for the presidency of the World Bank, President Bush simultaneously removed one of the most influential and contentious voices in his war cabinet and rewarded one of his administration's most dogged loyalists with an influential and contentious spot in a wholly new realm.
 By sending Mr. Wolfowitz to the World Bank, and another outspoken administration figure, John R. Bolton, to be ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Bush all but announced his belief that both institutions could benefit from unconventional thinking and stern discipline. At the same time, Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation as deputy secretary of defense, and the planned departure this summer of Douglas J. Feith as undersecretary for defense policy, would seem to give Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who often tangled with Mr. Wolfowitz, expanded influence over national security policy and minimize public feuding -- something Mr. Bush is said to want badly. 
 But Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney, who share many of Mr. Wolfowitz's interventionist views, remain in place, and some debates will doubtless go on. 
 In her first weeks on the job, Ms. Rice has taken pains to put her own stamp on diplomacy and the American image abroad. But she and the president have absorbed Mr. Wolfowitz's longstanding optimism about the prospects for democracy in the Middle East, so his departure probably marks more an evolution than a radical shift in policy.
 Yet perhaps not since Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara left the Pentagon at the height of the Vietnam war to take up the World Bank presidency and the fight against global poverty has a top Washington policy maker undertaken such a bold shift. The appointment was seen as provocative in some quarters, abroad and at home. But that seemed precisely Mr. Bush's aim.
 For unlike Mr. McNamara, who left the Johnson administration battered and shaken by his own doubts over Vietnam, Mr. Wolfowitz leaves the Pentagon at a moment of confidence. The first Iraqi elections and other positive developments in the Middle East mean Mr. Wolfowitz and his allies can claim a measure of success in their single-minded focus on toppling Saddam Hussein.
 ''There is a logic to it, though it's not the McNamara logic,'' said Stephen R. Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who worked as a planner for Mr. Wolfowitz. ''McNamara took the job to expiate, and Wolfowitz is taking the job to vindicate. That's a big difference. For Wolfowitz, it's meant to be going from strength to strength.''
 The cerebral Mr. Wolfowitz forged an unlikely bond with a president who calls himself a gut player. Mr. Bush undertook the invasion of Iraq principally proclaiming the danger of its unconventional weapons, but came in time, aides said, to share the impassioned view of the man he calls Wolfie: that a democratic beachhead in Iraq could reshape the broader Middle East.
 Mr. Bush is famous for his loyalty to those who are loyal to him, but the idea of nominating Mr. Wolfowitz to a cabinet post was all but out of the question. Senate confirmation hearings would be bruising at best, re-opening raw arguments about flaws in prewar intelligence, troop strength after the fall of Baghdad and Mr. Wolfowitz's disproved prediction that the postwar occupation would go smoothly and could be easily financed with Iraqi oil revenues. 
 So Mr. Bush has now sent Mr. Wolfowitz to shake up the world of international economic development in some of the same ways that he and Mr. Rumsfeld have sought to shake up American military and foreign policy. One of Mr. Wolfowitz's associates, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to steal the spotlight, said he expected Mr. Wolfowitz would continue the anticorruption efforts of the departing president, James D. Wolfensohn, and demand fresh accountability from governments that receive aid. 
 ''Corruption was high on Wolfensohn's agenda, and Wolfowitz has been very, very impressed by that,'' the associate said. ''One of his first passions was development, and when he was ambassador to Indonesia in the Reagan years, he was out there with the chicken farmers, and he's kind of made for this job in some ways.''
 Mr. Sestanovich said that Mr. Wolfowitz would come to his new job ''with a particular argument about what makes development work, and that is that democratization is part of modernization.'' 
 He added: ''What has bothered people about the bank for the many decades it has existed is the concern that it has just fed the preoccupations and prejudices and bank accounts of corrupt elites in backward countries. And the Bush administration comes at that problem with a particular focus on governance, and even more narrowly on democracy, that is going to stir the place up.''
 Critics on the left have been scathing in their denunciations of Mr. Wolfowitz. Ten days ago, after his name circulated as a potential candidate, John Cavanagh, director of the liberal Institute for Policy Studies here, compiled a sarcastic list of Mr. Wolfowitz's qualifications, first among them that he would follow in the footsteps of Mr. McNamara, ''who also helped kill tens of thousands of people in a poor country most Americans couldn't find on a map before getting the job.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz may be easy to caricature but he is harder to categorize. He has already had outsized influence on administration policy. In the first days after the Sept. 11 attacks, he urged consideration of action against Iraq. Mr. Bush deferred the question then, but returned to it with results that are now well known. 
 Now Mr. Wolfowitz is set to embark on a surprise second act, in a theater where the battles will doubtless be different but the policy wars will go on.

HEADLINE: A Wink and a Fraud

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

 BODY:
At the Gridiron Dinner in Washington on Saturday, where Old Media gently mocked politicians with corny songs, I sat next to a presidential gag writer, Landon Parvin. He was saying jokes work best when Republicans make fun of Republicans and Democrats make fun of Democrats. 
 President Bush, looking spiffy in white tie and tails, swung by to talk to Mr. Parvin. He didn't look my way, but proceeded back up to the dais. 
 Suddenly, W. turned around, stopped and looked right at me. Then he flashed a wink, not a flirty wink but a mischievous Clark Gable ''I've got your number and you think you've got mine but I win'' wink. 
 Bush had a cold, but he was feeling pretty hot.
 He started his presidency with a tentative demeanor and a chip on his shoulder. Now, even with the Middle East still roiling and the Democrats still spoiling for a fight over Social Security, W. feels as if he's won a lot of hands and has a big pile of chips.
 He's confident enough to send two unilateralist hawks who specialize in blowing off the globe -- John Bolton and Paul Wolfowitz -- to run global institutions that epitomize multilateralism. (Wolfie's biggest qualification to run the World Bank? His prediction that Iraqi reconstruction would pay for itself with Iraqi oil revenues.)
 In The Washington Post, the reporter Mark Leibovich wrote that the president has been almost like a different person since the Iraqi elections, so loosey-goosey as he tries to sell his Social Security agenda and other programs that ''he is resembling a Texas auctioneer pitching private accounts on the borscht belt.''
 When a woman at an Arkansas town meeting last month told W. she was from De Queen, he replied, ''That is right next to De King.''
 At the Gridiron, Mr. Bush slyly joked that he had the ''dangedest puppy'' who would roll over on command -- but only some of the time. ''I renamed him 'John McCain.'''
 I may have gotten a presidential wink, but I still don't have my regular White House pass back. (Maybe I'd get it back if I became a male escort?) But Bush aides have now decided to let in a blogger. Maybe they're grateful that bloodhound bloggers ran off Dan Rather.
 But this White House may not like New Media any more than Old Media. It's already moved on to Fake Media.
 Here is yesterday's headline on the humorist Andy Borowitz's Web site: ''White House Reporter Turns Out to Be Cheney. Fake Mustache Falls Off Veep During Press Briefing.''
 The White House isn't backing off its plan to replace real news with faux news. The Bushies created their own reality to convince the country that Iraq was a threat to U.S. security. So even though the war has given birth to some of the very evils it was supposed to fix -- like more recruits for Osama, and Saddam's formerly sealed weapons' falling into terrorists' hands -- Bushies like the results of their war.
 Now the White House has its own gulag: C.I.A. agents snatch suspects and fly them to places like Egypt and Syria to be strung up in chains and tortured. And The Times reported yesterday that at least 26 deaths of prisoners in American custody in Iraq and Afghanistan may be criminal homicides. So it also has its own Soviet-style propaganda campaign. 
 At his news conference yesterday, the president bristled a bit when a reporter reminded him that after it was revealed that his administration was paying columnists to shill for agency programs, Mr. Bush had ordered that such tactics cease. 
 But, as the reporter noted, the administration is still using government money to produce stories about the government that are broadcast with no disclosure that the government is producing them.
 David Barstow and Robin Stein wrote in The Times on Sunday that at least 20 agencies had made and distributed fake news segments to local TV stations; the administration spent $254 million in its first four years to buy self-aggrandizing puffery from P.R. firms.
 The president joked that he could tack on an ''I'm George W. Bush and I approved this disclaimer.'' But then he said he wouldn't -- that it was up to local stations to reveal the truth.
 He said his Justice Department had found that the fake news programs are ''within the law so long as they're based upon facts, not advocacy.'' 
 And, of course, this is a White House that never makes up facts to suit its purposes or sell its programs. It serves its propaganda baldfaced, with no hint of its real agenda. 
 At least I got a wink.

HEADLINE: Deal Maker Named by Bush To Lead F.C.C.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
Kevin J. Martin, a telecommunications lawyer known for his pragmatic and independent streak as a Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, was selected by President Bush on Wednesday to become the agency's 26th chairman.
 At a time when Michael K. Powell, who is retiring as chairman, came under criticism for his handling of difficult policy issues, Mr. Martin's political skills and deal making in the last four years made him the practical promoter of deregulation and earned him support from varied and, at times, warring constituencies. 
 Conservatives on social issues like his aggressively hard-line approach to indecency in broadcasting. The regional Bell companies, once embittered by some adverse stances that he took, have since patched things up with him, while smaller rivals to the Bells have found him an important ally on some issues. 
 State regulators find Mr. Martin to be a rare Washington friend at a time when their authority is being pre-empted by other federal regulators. Publishers like his support for eliminating the rule prohibiting a company from owning a newspaper and a broadcast station in the same city. And consumer organizations say he will be more accommodating to their concerns than Mr. Powell was.
 ''His strength is that he's appeared sympathetic to people of differing interests,'' said Gene Kimmelman, a senior director in the Washington office of Consumers Union. ''Now we're going to find out who the real Kevin Martin is.''
 The appointment was praised by the Bell companies and organizations representing large and small broadcasters, cable companies, wireless providers, equipment makers and smaller phone companies. It was also applauded by Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
 ''Kevin has a strong legal background in telecommunications law and has demonstrated a keen understanding of the issues before the F.C.C.,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who heads the Commerce Committee. ''He has traveled throughout Alaska and understands the role of communications in rural America. We have worked in the past with Kevin to address the challenges that rural areas face in the ever-evolving world of telecommunications and look forward to continuing our work in these and other areas.''
 Mr. Martin was also an attractive candidate for the White House because he does not need to be confirmed by the Senate. (Confirmation is required only to become a commissioner.) That made him particularly appealing because of the prospect that the Senate could soon shut down the nominations process, a result of the dispute between Republicans and Democrats over several nominations to the federal courts.
 Other contenders, notably Michael D. Gallagher, a senior official at the Commerce Department, and Becky A. Klein, a former Texas utilities regulator, could have faced months of delay in getting through the Senate.
 The commission faces a thicket of thorny issues. Foremost will be the rewriting of the rules governing the billions of dollars in compensation paid between telephone companies for connecting calls and the reorganization of programs that provide universal telephone service to customers in rural and underserved areas. 
 The agency must also address how to regulate telephone services offered over the Internet. And the commission has yet to respond to a federal appeals court that struck down the effort to relax rules restricting the size of the nation's largest media companies. 
 During debate within the commission over those rules, Mr. Martin argued for greater relaxation of the prohibition on one company's controlling both a newspaper and a broadcast station in the same city. He was also less inclined than Mr. Powell to grant the networks greater flexibility to buy more television affiliates.
 The elevation of Mr. Martin, along with the expected departure of a Republican commissioner, Kathleen Q. Abernathy, gives the White House the opportunity to make two appointments and reshape the five-member commission.
 Mr. Martin, a 38-year-old former White House official and a North Carolina native who looks half his age, drew Mr. Bush's attention as the deputy counsel to his 2000 presidential campaign. He was part of the team of young lawyers who traveled to Florida for the legal contest over the ballots there. He then briefly worked in the White House on telecommunications and economic policy issues before rejoining the commission in the spring of 2001. (During the Clinton administration, he was an aide to Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the most conservative and deregulatory- minded member of the commission.)
 Mr. Martin has taken the most aggressive approach in indecency cases, dissenting from a series of opinions in which the agency either found no violation or did not issue what he believed was a significant enough punishment. For those votes, he was strongly endorsed by some conservative organizations. 
 ''Chairman Martin's leadership record on the indecency issue shows his commitment to serving the public interest,'' said L. Brent Bozell, president of the Parents Television Council, the organization that has filed more indecency complaints than any other group. 
 Mr. Martin also took a different position from Mr. Powell on the rules governing the size of the largest media conglomerates. That forced Mr. Powell to compromise on some elements of that package -- most notably the number of stations that the networks could own -- to find the three votes he needed to try to deregulate in that area.
 (Ultimately, however, Mr. Powell was foiled when a court blocked the agency from imposing the rules, which are again before the commission.)
 Mr. Martin and Mr. Powell have had a chilly relationship. 
 The strains intensified two years ago, when Mr. Martin voted with the Democrats to largely leave in place rules meant to foster local telephone competition by requiring the four regional Bell companies to lease their local networks to their rivals at low prices set by state regulators.
 But Mr. Martin had the political savvy to patch relations with the Bell companies, and Bell executives have said recently that he was their top choice.

HEADLINE: Self-Service Printing Is Redefining the Camera Store, and Even the Maternity Ward

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN

 BODY:
TAMMY JACKSON of the Bronx likes to print her digital photos at the Costco Wholesale store in Brooklyn, where, on a recent Saturday, the lines in front of two Noritsu desktop kiosks moved quickly. That is largely because Costco does not allow editing of 4-by-6-inch prints, priced at 19 cents each, reserving the privilege for more expensive enlargements.
 That does not bother Ms. Jackson. ''I'm a plain Jane,'' she said. ''I don't do a whole lot of fancy stuff.'' She said she preferred the interface on the kiosk at Costco to one she had tried at a drugstore, which asked her to make more choices. ''It's faster,'' she said.
 But not every kiosk user takes Ms. Jackson's approach. At Concord Camera in Concord, N.H., customers are invited to perch on stools and sip coffee while customizing images from their digital cameras on one of the store's five Agfa Image Box desktop kiosks, each placed on its own cafe-style table. Coloring books are provided for children. 
 ''Customers bring friends and show them how much fun it is to make prints,'' said Michael St. Germain, owner of the 2,600-square-foot independent store, where customers pay 39 to 49 cents for a standard-size print, depending on the quantity ordered. That is more expensive than at chain stores in his area and around the nation, where the price for a 4-by-6 print is typically 29 cents.
 Yet business is flourishing at Concord Camera because, the owner says, he allows his customers, mostly women, to work on images at their leisure. He plans to add more kiosks to reduce wait times. 
 Mr. St. Germain invested in his first digital-printing machine seven years ago, fearing what he called the erosion of film as digital-camera sales took off. His hunch proved correct: last year, as film sales nationwide continued a four-year decline, according to Photo Marketing Association International, his store produced 200,000 digital prints on only four kiosks, and he expects the figure to be more than double that this year.
 ''Digital printing is a high-margin product,'' far more profitable than selling cameras, he said. Far bigger companies, too, believe that kiosks could turn film's demise into an advantage.
 And change is afoot in the kiosk industry, as manufacturers and retailers aim to please both the customer in a rush and the one who likes to play. 
 ''A real issue now is lines,'' said Bing Liem, president of Agfa Photo, noting that a growing number of retailers have multiple kiosks. Some Costco stores have six. Kiosks are also appearing in convenience stores, in maternity wards and on cruise ships.
 Eastman Kodak, which now has 15,000 Picture Maker digital printing kiosks in the United States, expects to ship 5,000 to 10,000 more this year. Those figures do not include Kodak's older print-to-print Picture Maker machines, which the company says it has ceased distributing. Some of its new machines will include scanners, but the trend at Kodak and other kiosk makers is in a different direction: equipping the units to accept images from camera phones, now that some, like the 1.3-megapixel Sony Ericsson S700i, take pictures good enough to print.
 ''While all forms of digital printing are growing, none is growing faster than kiosks,'' said Alex Hodges, Kodak's director of kiosks for the United States and Canada. According to Kodak, kiosk printing increased by 356 percent last year.
 A few years ago, nearly all digital printing was done at home. Now, even with the proliferation of home printers designed specifically for photos, many camera owners are content to go out. Last year, Kodak said, 1.9 billion digital images were printed by all methods, with 57 percent done at home, 33 percent at retail locations and 10 percent through online services. The company predicts that by 2007 the number of printed images will rise to 10.7 billion a year and that the share printed at kiosks will grow to 37 percent.
 Market researchers say a single consumer is likely to print at multiple locations, turning out one or two snapshots on a home printer but bringing large jobs to a store.
 Economics is one factor. ''Consumers are saying home printing is O.K., but once they've used up their first batch of paper and ink, they get sticker shock,'' said George Briggs, the president of Pixel Magic Imaging, which supplies kiosks to Eckerd Drugs and Carnival Cruise Lines.
 Francie Mendelsohn, president of Summit Marketing, which follows the kiosk industry, estimates a print made at home with high-quality ink and paper might cost $1. And, she adds, ''it takes time.''
 But kiosk printing can take time, too. In the coming months, consumers could see changes at kiosks, including wider availability of automatic red-eye reduction, eliminating the need to locate problem eye areas individually on a touch screen. Moreover, print speeds will increase for some instant-print kiosks that produce prints through dye-sublimation or other fast-acting processes. (Kiosks networked to a store lab using silver-halide chemicals will most likely remain one-hour photo services, with actual print delivery time dependent on work flow.) 
 Generally, ''if you get your prints instantly, they cost more, and if you wait an hour they cost less,'' said Gael Lundeen, Fujifilm's vice president for photofinishing and Web service. But at Drug Fair, a chain of drugstores in New Jersey, a quick 4-by-6 print on a Sony PictureStation costs 29 cents, the typical rate for one-hour prints in the area.
 Kodak plans a May release of its 5.0 version of Perfect Touch technology, which will let kiosk users select images for automatic detection and correction of red-eye. Fujifilm says it will add automatic red-eye reduction to kiosks this summer, and it is developing an instant-print kiosk with an adjustable screen.
 Dominating the kiosk market with tens of thousands of units each, Kodak and Fujifilm have squeezed out some competitors. But others have entered the arena, including makers of kiosk interfaces and software that market their products under retailers' labels. Among them is Pixology, an English company whose software powers kiosks at Costco and the drugstore chain Duane Reade. Pixology allows automatic red-eye reduction, and has done so for some time, said a spokeswoman for the company, Leanne Tritton.
 Yet even as image correction and print speeds are streamlined, many kiosks will continue to slow the process with options for such things as borders, sepia tones and captions. Such embellishments seem aimed at women, who, manufacturers say, print the most digital images.
 ''Mom is the one who wants to print her memories of Junior's birthday party,'' said Dave Johnson, a senior marketing manager for Sony Electronics, which makes the stand-alone PictureStation. About 60 percent of kiosk users are women, according to a 2004 survey by InfoTrends/CAP Ventures. 
 But fresh from judging new kiosk models at the Photo Marketing Association trade show last month, Mrs. Mendelsohn of Summit Research thinks simple works best. 
 ''Borders are fine, but it's like people shopping for shoes,'' she said. ''If you insist on letting people add text, then charge for it, because it adds time. Don't let me add red or blue, because I'll mess it up. I think it's foolish to let people fool around.''
 The more choices and control for the customer, the longer the process. ''The consumer experience for the person doing the editing is fine,'' Mr. Hodges of Kodak said, but ''the experience for the person waiting in line is something we have to work on with retailers.''
 Indeed, much is left to retailers, whose concerns with security, credit card authorization and point-of-sale systems sometimes seem to defeat advances in kiosk technology. Though called self-service, the units often involve interaction between a customer and a store employee who must punch in a password.
 At times, kiosks seem no more automatic than the old Horn & Hardart Automat restaurants in New York and Philadelphia, where store employees could be seen restocking the pie slices dispensed at coin-operated windows.
 For kiosks networked to one-hour photo labs, the customer may have to copy a kiosk order number onto the same kind of envelope used for film orders. And though most stand-alone units can be configured to accept credit cards, customers must often get in a line to pay at a register, following a wait in the kiosk line.
 Consumers may even discover that a kiosk does not accept their media-storage format. Newer models have slots for various kinds of memory cards, as well as CD and floppy-disk drives. They are also likely to accept input from camera phones through Bluetooth and infrared technology. But they may lack U.S.B. connections for flash drives, in part because some manufacturers say they are more apt to carry viruses. ''We have to work on solving that,'' Ms. Lundeen of Fujifilm said.
 The well-prepared customer comes to the kiosk with images that have been edited and transferred to a CD at home, Mrs. Mendelsohn said.
 Sometimes there are other hurdles. Sony recently introduced a high-speed version of its stand-alone PictureStation that produces 4-by-6 prints in eight seconds, a third of the time of its predecessor. But print speed was not the problem for a recent customer to a branch of FedEx Kinko's, Sony's major retail client -- it was having to flag down an employee to enter a password before each print was made.
 Jay Dellostretto, Sony's vice president for digital photofinishing, says his company turns on password protection at the store's request. ''It offers the retailer an opportunity to make sure the customer is comfortable, or to suggest backing everything up on a CD-ROM.'' It also, of course, deters customers from scooping up their prints and leaving the store without paying.
 Fujifilm can attach a credit card acceptor to its coming Get the Picture stand-alone kiosk, which will have an adjustable tilting screen. But ''the overwhelming majority of retailers would prefer to have people pay at the counter,'' Ms. Lundeen of Fujifilm said, because the kiosk may not be linked to the store's point-of-sale system. 
 Olympus Imaging Systems offers retailers a prepaid card for its TrueTouch kiosks to eliminate passwords. But working out payment systems can be complicated, said Joe Leo, Olympus's director of new business development, because in some cases the kiosk is owned not by the store but by the manufacturer.
 ''There's been some inertia in how photofinishing is presented to the consumer,'' Mr. Leo said. But he believes retailers, and kiosk users, are figuring things out.

HEADLINE: Steadfast? Yes. He Rarely Fails To Reconsider.

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
HOW lucky is Fernando Ferrer? Blessed, really.
 Mr. Ferrer is running for mayor again, and that can be tough because, if you've been around awhile, as Mr. Ferrer has, you have said lots of things, and those words never go away. They sit around in memory, and multiply in cyberspace and so they can come back on a candidate, like a touch of political reflux disease. 
 But imagine a candidate who makes a habit of change. The public might learn to accept that hyper-flexibility as part of the package. No need for Tums.
 Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, is one such candidate. Very flexible. Or forgetful, but probably the former. True, as the dust-up over his remarks this week about the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo amply demonstrated, he has not yet achieved Tums-free status. But it is only a matter of time.
 The super-scrutiny has already begun with Mr. Ferrer's Diallo remarks. Caught by NY1 News at an otherwise little-noted meeting of police sergeants, he said that he did not think the tragic police shooting of Mr. Diallo was a crime, and implied he thought the prosecutor had over-charged the police officers involved. 
 But in 1999, he strongly criticized the Police Department, was arrested at an antipolice demonstration and called for the firing of the officers tried for the shooting of the unarmed Mr. Diallo, even after a jury acquitted them.
 Yesterday Mr. Ferrer said he'd been consistent, that he had always directed his criticism at police policies and practices. If so, his emphasis surely has changed, and that was bound to get attention, since, as the presumed Democratic front-runner, Mr. Ferrer will find his every utterance scrutinized, even more than during his last run for mayor in 2001. 
 Critics of the former borough president suggest that it is no longer in his political interest to take a hard line because, in a four-way primary, he has to appeal to centrists. Some have even accused him of opportunism.
 How unjust. Even in a political world in which most politicians shift positions to reflect changing circumstances or -- yes -- to make blatant appeals to voters, Mr. Ferrer should be recognized for his skill. 
 HE is notably adaptable. In fact, in the 2001 runoff, fans of the ultimately victorious Mark Green demonstrated with flip-flop sandals -- three years before Senator John Kerry's presidential run.
 For instance, Mr. Ferrer has changed his position on the death penalty. Twice. He has changed on abortion rights and on the old Board of Education, and has tweaked his definition of ''the other New York.''
 For years, Mr. Ferrer opposed the death penalty. In 1997, when he was hoping to challenge the tough Rudolph W. Giuliani, he dropped his opposition. Then, in the 2001 Democratic primary and runoff against the liberal Mr. Green, he said he still supported capital punishment for some crimes -- but also a moratorium on its imposition. That is his position today, said his spokesman, Chad Clanton.
 In 1996, after long favoring abortion rights, he raised objections to frequent abortions and late-term procedures. He dropped his reservations in 2001, when, as the only Hispanic candidate in the four-man Democratic primary, he needed black and Latino voters, who are largely liberal on social issues, to catapult him into the runoff.
 A decade ago, he backed the Board of Education's abolition in favor of a borough- and community-based system, then supported its retention while Mr. Green campaigned for mayoral control.
 On ''the other New York,'' he pretty much ran on the two-cities theme during the primary four years ago, prompting some Democrats to accuse him of divisiveness. Then, during the runoff, when he had to broaden his appeal, Mr. Ferrer said, ''We are all in the other New York.'' Today he emphasizes unity and says that his two cities reference was always to economics, never to race or ethnicity.
 Of course, if Mr. Ferrer is to win the primary this time against City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, Representative Anthony D. Weiner and the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, he again has to make a broad appeal for votes that cut across all Democratic lines.
 Some detractors of the former borough president are saying that the political dynamic explains his recent clarifications. 
 But fair is fair. Mr. Ferrer has perfected the art of consistent inconsistency, and soon New York will get it and give him all due credit. In the interim, he might want to stock up on Tums.

HEADLINE: WOLFOWITZ GETS BUSH NOMINATION FOR WORLD BANK

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER and DAVID E. SANGER; Celia W. Dugger contributed reporting from New York for this article, and Katrin Bennhold of The International Herald Tribune contributed from Paris.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
President Bush said Wednesday that he planned to nominate Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense and one of the administration's earliest and most outspoken advocates of using American influence to spread democracy around the globe, to become the next president of the World Bank.
 While Mr. Wolfowitz has been best known in recent years for his role as one of the architects of the Iraq invasion, his background includes years spent on strategies for development. As the American ambassador to Indonesia, he became engrossed in aid projects and later, as the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, he oversaw the training of numerous students who went on to careers in development.
 Mr. Bush cited some of this background in making public his choice of Mr. Wolfowitz at a wide-ranging news conference, saying, ''Paul is committed to development,'' and adding, ''He's a compassionate, decent man who will do a fine job.'' [Excerpts, Page A15.] 
 But the announcement comes on the heels of the appointment of John A. Bolton as the new American ambassador to the United Nations and was greeted warily in many foreign capitals where the Iraq conflict and its aftermath remain deeply unpopular.
 ''The storm of enthusiasm in old Europe is muted,'' said Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, the German development minister.
 Still, initial public responses from several European leaders to the selection of Mr. Wolfowitz were largely positive, including one from President Jacques Chirac of France, who opposed Mr. Wolfowitz and other administration officials on the decision to go to war. Through a spokesman, Mr. Chirac said he would examine Mr. Wolfowitz's candidacy ''in a spirit of friendship and bearing in mind the missions of the World Bank.'' 
 Yet Mr. Chirac's foreign minister, Michel Barnier, said France would look at Mr. Wolfowitz among ''other candidates.''
 Pentagon and White House officials said that among the names being considered to succeed Mr. Wolfowitz were Stephen A. Cambone, the under secretary of defense for intelligence and one of Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's closest advisers, and Gordon R. England, the secretary of the Navy.
 Mr. Bush appeared expansive and almost light-hearted at the news conference, and he was clearly reveling in recent developments in Lebanon and Iraq, where he argued that democratization was on the way. 
 But for the first time he made clear the limits of his patience with Iran, to which he extended modest new offers of American incentives last week to give up its nuclear program. He said it had only one chance to take the deal he has offered along with France, Germany and Britain.
 Iran, he said, ''must permanently abandon enrichment and reprocessing'' of nuclear material, a step the Iranians have so far insisted they will not take. He added: ''The understanding is we go to the Security Council if they reject the offer. And I hope they don't.'' 
 Yet he set no timelines, and said at the end of his news conference that ''there's a certain patience required in order to achieve a diplomatic objective.''
 William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard and a longtime political ally and friend of Mr. Wolfowitz, said he believed the nomination was ''totally good.''
 ''Paul is a neoconservative who actually believes in helping countries develop and improve democracies, not just overthrowing dictators,'' Mr. Kristol said. The United States traditionally picks the head of the World Bank, though the nomination needs approval by its board of directors. While Mr. Wolfowitz seems all but certain to win that approval, his move is likely to have a major effect on the dynamics of the Bush administration, because it removes him from the war cabinet that dominated the first term, and may clear the way for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to take further control of Iraq policy.
 Because the World Bank allocates the resources and sets development policy for much of the third world, Mr. Wolfowitz's candidacy to succeed James D. Wolfensohn, the Australian-born investment banker who has headed the bank for the last 10 years, was viewed with some concern by those who consider the deputy secretary's record on postwar reconstruction in Iraq to be a development failure. 
 His appointment also comes at a time when the disparity between wealthy and poor countries is growing and the amount of foreign aid is diminishing. Those trends have put the World Bank at the center of an international debate over what strategies will work best to lift countries out of poverty, and what kind of resources wealthy nations should commit to that goal. 
 In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Wolfowitz said his nomination should be viewed as a sign of the importance that Mr. Bush places on development and the World Bank.
 ''It is a noble mission to lift people out of poverty and in doing so to strengthen the whole political movement towards democracy, and I hope my critics understand this,'' he said.
 He said he had learned some lessons from missteps made in Indonesia, when the bank was financing huge projects in a country that at the time was run by a dictator, Suharto, who was forced to resign in 1998 in the midst of the Asian economic crisis.
 The bank, he said, ''did some wonderful work'' in Indonesia, but ''it didn't do enough to empower those advocating'' better development strategies against the government. ''The bank itself assessed that money had gone off to places it shouldn't have,'' he said, adding that Mr. Wolfensohn, an old friend of Mr. Wolfowitz, had already done much to link development strategies to the promotion of ''democracy and transparency.''
 While Mr. Wolfowitz's views are often unpredictable -- those who know him say the shorthand label of ''neocon'' that has been used to describe him oversimplifies his positions, some of which anger conservatives -- his role in Washington in the last four years will probably be the focus of the debate on his candidacy. William Easterly, a professor of economics at New York University, who spent a decade as a research economist at the World Bank, said Wednesday that he believed ''the French and the Germans would take it as deliberate provocation or insult.''
 ''The World Bank already had a bad reputation from a decade of structural adjustment of forcing economic reforms down countries' throats by saying you won't get our money unless you do what we tell you to do,'' Mr. Easterly said. ''That really generated huge resistance in Africa and Latin America and some places in Asia.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz, he added, ''is the embodiment of Americans forcing other societies to adopt American values whether they want them or not.'' 
 Mr. Bush said he had already called various foreign leaders, including Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, to make the case that Mr. Wolfowitz will be a strong and effective leader at the World Bank, in part because of his experience helping manage the huge bureaucracy of the Pentagon.
 Foreign diplomats here said that the United States had suggested Mr. Wolfowitz as the nominee to the World Bank's board of directors but that they had asked that more than one name be presented. They said the Europeans were disappointed that instead of presenting more candidates, Mr. Bush had made a public announcement that Mr. Wolfowitz was his choice.
 While the diplomats who raised questions about the choice did so anonymously because of the delicacy of the nomination, Democrats publicly criticized it and wondered what signal it was sending to allies.
 ''It makes you wonder whether all the administration's words about mending fences with our allies are just lip service,'' said Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat. ''After Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz's repeated and serious miscalculations about the costs and risks America would face in Iraq, I don't believe he is the right person to lead the World Bank.'' 
 Some officials of the World Bank said Wednesday that they hoped Mr. Wolfowitz would follow the model of another famous former defense secretary, Robert S. McNamara, who took over the bank after orchestrating the early years of the Vietnam War. At the bank, Mr. McNamara quickly became an advocate of the poor, and was later credited with moving the mission of the bank to find innovative ways to help the world's most impoverished nations.
 While the United States picks the World Bank president, Europe chooses the head of the International Monetary Fund, the other organization in the United Nations family that together with the bank determines international economic and financial policy. Most developing countries want this tradition to change to allow candidates from other nations to be considered and for all the bank's directors to be part of the decision. 
 Mr. Wolfensohn, who was part of the consultations that led to the choice of Mr. Wolfowitz, had high praise for him as his possible successor, saying in a statement that he is ''person of high intellect, integrity and broad experience both in the public and private sectors and has qualifications that would be critical to leading the Bank Group.''
 On a separate matter at the news conference, Mr. Bush acknowledged his administration's policy of ''rendering'' terror suspects to nations that have been suspected of using torture. He defended the practice by saying he never knowingly allowed anyone to be sent abroad so that they could be subject to interrogation techniques not permitted in the United States.
 The United States sends suspects ''back to their country of origin with the promise that they won't be tortured,'' he said. ''That's the promise we receive. This country does not believe in torture.'' But then, almost as an aside, he added, ''We do believe in protecting ourselves.''
 He also left open the door, as he did on Tuesday, for the militant Shiite group Hezbollah to enter Lebanese politics. But he did not budge on the question of labeling it a terror organization. ''Hezbollah is on the terrorist list for a reason, and remain on the terrorist list for a reason. Our position has not changed on Hezbollah.''

HEADLINE: Bush on Iran, Baseball, DNA and Judges

 BODY:
Following are key passages from a news conference yesterday in Washington by President Bush, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. A complete chronological transcript is at nytimes.com/international.

On Wolfowitz Nomination
 I appreciate the world leaders' taking my phone calls as I explain to them why I think Paul will be a strong president of the World Bank. I said he was a man of good experience. He helped manage a large organization. The World Bank's a large organization; the Pentagon's a large organization. He's been involved in the management of that organization. He's a skilled diplomat, worked at the State Department in high positions. He was ambassador to Indonesia, where he did a very good job representing our country. And Paul is committed to development. He's a compassionate, decent man who will do a fine job in the World Bank.

On Iran's Nuclear Program
 Iran has concealed its -- a nuclear program. That became discovered not because of their compliance with the I.A.E.A or N.P.T. but because a dissident group pointed it out to the world. And which raised suspicions about the intentions of the program. You can understand why. It's a nontransparent regime there run by a handful of people. And so suspicions were raised. 
 And as a result of those suspicions, we came together with friends and allies to seek a guarantee that they wouldn't use any nuclear program to make weapons. A lot of people understand that if they did have a weapon, it would create incredible instability, wouldn't be good for world peace. And so the best way to do that -- and this is where we are in the talks -- was to say to the Iranians that they must permanently abandon enrichment and reprocessing. And the E.U.-3 [Britain, France and Germany] meant it. And now we're waiting for an Iranian response.
 The understanding is, we go to the Security Council if they reject the offer. And I hope they don't. I hope they realize the world is clear about making sure that they don't end up with a nuclear weapon.

On Italy's Plans for Iraq
 I called Silvio Berlusconi on another matter. He brought up the issue of Italian troops in Iraq and said, first of all, he wanted me to know that there was no change in his policy, that in fact any withdrawals would be done in consultation with allies and would be done depending upon the ability of Iraqis to defend themselves.
 So I think what you're going to find is that countries will be willing or anxious to get out when Iraqis have got the capacity to defend themselves. And that's the position of the United States. Our troops will come home when Iraq is capable of defending herself. 

On Democracy in Iraq
 There's a lot of work to be done and I'm sure there'll be some opinions about what takes place during the next nine months as the constitution is written, and whether or not the elections move forward as smoothly as some think they should. You know, obviously there's concern now. I read about that -- occasionally reading, I want you to know, in the second term -- that -- your stories, that is -- that you know they haven't formed a government yet. 
 But I take a different look. First of all, obviously there will be a government formed. But I think it is interesting, and to watch the process of people negotiating and worrying about this and worrying about that and people seeking out positions as to their stands on issues that'll be relevant to the future of Iraq. 
 It's a wholesome process and it's being done in a transparent way. I mean, they've got the press corps all over them, watching every move, which is a positive example for others in the region. And that's important. It's important for people in that region to see what is possible in a free society.

On Hezbollah
 I like the idea of people running for office, a positive effect when you run for office, you know? Maybe some will run for office, say, ''Vote for me, I look forward to blowing up America.'' I don't know. I don't know if that'll be their platform or not. But it's -- I don't think so. 
 I think people generally run for office, say, ''Vote for me, I'm looking forward to fixing your potholes or making sure you've got bread on the table.'' But Hezbollah is on the terrorist list for a reason, and will remain on the terrorist list for a reason. Our position has not changed on Hezbollah.

On Suspects Sent Abroad
 In the post-9/11 world, the United States must make sure we protect our people and our friends from attack. That was the charge we have been given. And one way to do so is arrest people and send them back to their country of origin with the promise that they won't be tortured. That's the promise we receive. This country does not believe in torture. We do believe in protecting ourselves. We don't believe in torture.

On Social Security
 Personal accounts do not permanently fix the solution. They make the solution more attractive for the individual worker. And that's important for people to understand, John, and that's why it's very important for Congress to discuss this issue. 
 In terms of timetables: as quickly as possible, whatever that means. The longer we wait, the more difficult it is to solve the problem. 
 And listen, I fully understand it's a difficult issue. Otherwise it would have been solved a long time ago.

On Oil Prices
 I went to the Congress and asked them to join in a comprehensive energy plan, which they have yet to do. I would hope that when members go back to their districts and hear the complaints of people about the rising price of gasoline or complaints from small business owners about the cost of energy, that they will come back and in the spirit of in a proper spirit, get a bill to my desk that encourages conservation and continues to find alternative sources of energy.

On Official News Releases
 There is a Justice Department opinion that says these -- these pieces are within the law so long as they're based upon facts, not advocacy. And I expect our agencies to adhere to that ruling, to that Justice Department opinion. This has been the long-standing practice of the federal government, to use these types of videos. 
 Agriculture Department, as I understand, has been using these videos for a long period of time. The Defense Department, other departments have been doing so. It's important that they be based upon the guidelines set out by the Justice Department. 
 Now I also I think it would be helpful if local stations then disclose to their viewers that that's -- you know -- that this was based upon a factual report and they chose to use it. But evidently, in some cases, that's not the case.

On Baseball and Steroids
 I spoke out and was pleased to see that baseball responded. You know, they've got a testing policy in place for the first time ever, a firm testing policy in place. And it's very important that baseball then follow through and implement the testing and, obviously, deal with those who get caught cheating in the system.

On DNA Evidence
 I still support the death penalty. And I think it's a deterrent to crime. But I want to make sure, obviously, that those subject to the death penalty are truly guilty. And that's why I talked about what I talked about, and why I made the decision I made. I think -- regardless of your position on the issue -- one of the things we've got to make sure is that we use, in this case, technology, DNA technology, is to make sure that we're absolutely certain about the innocence or guilt of a person accused. 

On Gay Marriage
 The court rulings are verifying why I took the position I took, and that is, I don't believe judges ought to be deciding this issue. I believe this is an issue of particular importance to the American people and should be decided by the people. And I think the best way to do so is through the constitutional process. 
 I haven't changed my mind at all. As a matter of fact, court rulings such as this strengthen my position, it seems like to me. People now understand why I laid out the position I did.

On Judicial Nominees
 I believe that I have an obligation to put forth good honorable people to serve on the bench, and have done so. And I expect them to get an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate. This isn't a new position for me -- I've been saying this for the last several years. And they ought to get a vote. 
 They're getting voted out of committee but they're not getting a vote on the floor. And I don't think it's fair to the candidates. And I don't think it's fair to the administration for this policy to go forward. And so, you know, hopefully the Senate will be able to conduct business and also give my nominees a vote, an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate.

HEADLINE: The World Is His Stage; Paul Dundes Wolfowitz

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
After surveying the tsunami-pummeled coast of Indonesia from a Navy helicopter in January, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz appeared shaken at the devastation. 
 ''When you fly over in a helicopter you just begin to get a sense of how enormous this tragedy has been, and when people don't just lose a parent or a brother, but they lose their entire family, it gives a new horrible meaning to what it means to be a survivor,'' he told reporters in Banda Aceh. 
 ''It's also clear,'' Mr. Wolfowitz added, ''that beyond the immediate needs, there are going to be a great deal of work to rebuild, reconstruct.'' 
 In that three-day trip to South Asia to assess tsunami damage and the Pentagon's role in relief efforts, his friends and associates say, the seeds for President Bush's selection of Mr. Wolfowitz to be the next president of the World Bank were planted. Freed, however briefly, from his Pentagon office, the daily drumbeat of violence and American casualty reports from Iraq, and a war of which he was a principal architect, friends say, Mr. Wolfowitz was energized both to be back in Asia -- he was the United States ambassador to Indonesia in the late 1980's -- and to be seen as the harbinger of help, not conflict. 
 ''It did have a huge impact on him,'' said Sean O'Keefe, an old friend and former NASA administrator who is now chancellor at Louisiana State University. ''He was stunned by the human consequences there.'' 
 In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Wolfowitz said the World Bank, which sets development policy for much of the third world, was a logical extension of his longtime goal to spread human rights and political freedoms around the globe. ''Economic development supports political development, and it really came home to me with the Asian tsunami,'' he said. 
 Caricatured as a hawk among hawks in the Bush administration and a lightning rod for its Iraq policy, Mr. Wolfowitz is tougher to pigeonhole under closer examination. As a teenager, he attended the 1963 civil rights march on Washington, and in 2003 he said he remained a civil libertarian and a ''bleeding heart'' on social issues. His soft-spoken personal style belies any fire-breathing image. And his activist vision has defined his career inside and outside government. Besides calling for the overthrow of President Saddam Hussein years before American troops invaded Iraq in 2003, Mr. Wolfowitz advocated arming the Bosnian Muslims in their war against the Serbs and criticized the Clinton administration over its Kosovo policy, contending it waited too long to intervene militarily. 
 His humanitarian impulses have taken him to desolate places. In July 2003, Mr. Wolfowitz sat crossed-legged inside a sweltering reed hut in a tiny dust-choked Iraqi village near the Iranian border listening to tribal elders seeking his help to restore their way of life as marsh Arabs, which Mr. Hussein had taken away by draining the marshes. 
 But Mr. Wolfowitz's critics say his optimism on America's ability to build a better world has often blinded him to the motivations of people like Ahmad Chalabi, the Iraqi National Congress leader whose intelligence on Iraq's unconventional weapons, used as the primary basis for going to war, turned out to be wrong. 
 These critics also say that he failed to prepare a thorough postwar strategy in Iraq and should not be put in charge of a major development agency. ''Paul Wolfowitz has a serious credibility problem,'' said William Hartung, a senior research fellow at the World Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization. ''He understated the cost of the Iraq war, while promoting vast distortions about Baghdad's weapons capabilities as a way to sell the conflict to the American public.'' 
 A former aspiring mathematician turned policy maker, Mr. Wolfowitz has world views forged by family history and in the halls of academia rather than in the jungles of Vietnam or the corridors of Congress. 
 Brooklyn-born and raised in Ithaca, N.Y., Paul Dundes Wolfowitz, 61, is the son of a Cornell University mathematician who left Poland after World War I. The rest of his father's family perished in the Holocaust. 
 At Cornell, Mr. Wolfowitz majored in mathematics and chemistry, but was profoundly moved by John Hersey's ''Hiroshima,'' and shifted his focus toward politics. ''One of the things that ultimately led me to leave mathematics and go into political science was thinking I could prevent nuclear war,'' he said. 
 He has held major posts at the Defense and State Departments, including senior foreign policy adviser to Dick Cheney when he was defense secretary. After the administration of the first President Bush, he was dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. 
 In Mr. Bush's first presidential campaign, Mr. Wolfowitz became one of his earliest advisers on foreign and national security policies. 
 After a meeting at the Treasury Department on Wednesday, he acknowledged the new challenge of reporting to an international board at the World Bank. ''I'm leaving one very big job and going to another even bigger job,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Give Help to India On Atom Site 

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 16 

 BODY:
The United States may help India build one or more nuclear power plants, even as the Bush administration objects to India's proposal to construct a natural gas pipeline from Iran, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her aides said Wednesday during a visit with Indian government leaders in New Delhi. 
 Ms. Rice said the United States needed to do what it could to help India cope with its growing energy needs. The United States maintains a trade embargo against Iran and is now engaged with Europe and the United Nations in an effort to persuade Iran to end what it suspects is a nuclear weapons program. 
 ''We do have our concerns,'' Ms. Rice said at a joint news conference with Natwar Singh, the Indian foreign minister. ''And we have communicated our concerns to the Indian government about gas pipeline cooperation between India and Iran.'' But she added, ''We do need to look at the broader question of how India meets its energy needs.''
 The $4.5 billion pipeline, first proposed more than 10 years ago, would run through Pakistan. Given the tensions between India and Pakistan, the idea advanced only recently, when India and Pakistan began looking for ways to cooperate. 
 India has long courted Iran, despite American objections.
 ''We have no problems of any kind with Iran,'' Mr. Singh said, standing beside Ms. Rice. ''We need a lot of new additions to our sources of energy, and so the pipeline is important.'' 
 He did acknowledge that India might have to rethink its pipeline plan should the United Nations impose sanctions on Iran because of its nuclear program.
 The pipeline disagreement stood out as the only significant snag in a day of meetings that both sides described as warm and amicable. 
 India is an ever more important political and economic power. The Bush administration has worked hard to improve relations, for their own sake and as a balance to the administration's need to grow closer to Pakistan, an important ally in the campaign against terrorism.
 Both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons, but the administration does not chastise either for that. A year ago, President Bush announced a plan for greater cooperation with India, including possible aid for civilian nuclear power plants. Ms. Rice and Mr. Singh both said they had discussed the possible sale of F-16 fighter jets to India, though they said no decisions had been made. Ms. Rice said she expected to have similar discussions with Pakistan, which has an aging fleet of F-16's. For the last three years, the United States has sold Pakistan spare parts for those planes, but now Pakistan wants to replace them.

Musharraf Plans Cricket Visit
 (By The New York Times), NEW DELHI, March 16 -- The president of Pakistan, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, will come to watch his national cricket team take on rival India here in the Indian capital next month, the Indian government announced Wednesday. 
 His trip, though not an official state visit, will include a meeting with the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, potentially opening the door for more serious dialogue between the countries. 
 There is plenty to talk about, including the fundamental issue of disputed Kashmir province, as well as a new squabble over water rights.
 India and Pakistan have fought three wars in the 57 years since independence from Britain and approached the brink of another in 2002. Peace talks began last year, and last month they yielded a significant breakthrough: a bus service that is slated to begin April 7 and allow Indians and Pakistanis to travel across divided Kashmir.
 Mr. Musharraf is scheduled to come for the finale of the six-week-long India-Pakistan cricket series on April 17: the final one-day international match in New Delhi. Pakistani officials, however, would not confirm the date, according to Associated Press of Pakistan.
 General Musharraf was born in New Delhi; his family migrated to what became Pakistan during the violent partition of the subcontinent in 1947.

HEADLINE: SENATE SUPPORTS ARCTIC DRILLING

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
President Bush's long-stalled plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling cleared a major hurdle on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, when the Senate voted to include the proposal in its budget, a maneuver that smoothes the way for Congress to approve drilling later this year. 
 By a vote of 51 to 49, Republicans defeated an effort by Democrats to eliminate the drilling language from the budget. The vote does not ensure that drilling will be approved. But if the budget is adopted, Senate rules would allow the passage of a measure opening the refuge with a simple majority of 51 votes, escaping the threat of a filibuster, which has killed it in the past. [Roll call, Page A26.]
 The vote was a major turning point in one of the most contentious energy debates in Washington at a time when Senate Republicans, using the power of a newly expanded majority, have been pushing through bills that businesses had sought. In another victory for the White House, the Senate also narrowly beat back an effort by Democrats and moderate Republicans to make it harder to extend Mr. Bush's tax cuts for the next five years. [Page A26.] 
 Drilling in the Alaskan Arctic is a central component of President Bush's energy policy. In a statement issued after the vote, Mr. Bush praised the Senate and also called on Congress to enact a comprehensive energy bill, which has stalled over Arctic oil exploration in the past.
 ''This project will keep our economy growing by creating jobs and ensuring that businesses can expand,'' Mr. Bush said, ''and it will make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy.''
 Senate Republicans were ebullient after the vote. ''Another example of where the strength of the majority matters,'' said Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia.
 Mr. Allen, who last year was chairman of the committee responsible for electing Republicans to the Senate, called it ''the best win.''
 At issue is whether oil companies should be permitted to explore in 1.5 million acres of coastal plain on Alaska's North Slope, north of the Arctic Circle, part of the larger 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Proponents of drilling, who include Alaskan development interests and the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group representing oil companies, say drilling would reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower soaring oil prices, which reached $56 a barrel Wednesday.
 ''It's as important to me as the first step Armstrong took when he stepped off on the moon,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who has been working on the drilling issue since the 1950's when he was lawyer in the Interior Department during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The vote was a bitter defeat for environmentalists, who have railed against Arctic drilling for decades, arguing that opening the refuge would threaten the caribou and other wildlife that roam the coastal plain. Opponents said the Senate was subverting its own procedures.
 ''Today we saw a Republican sneak attack on one of our most treasured natural wonders,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who made opposition to drilling a theme of his presidential campaign.
 With 55 Republicans in the Senate, the vote did not break precisely along party lines. Three Democrats -- Daniel K. Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana -- voted in favor of drilling. Six Republicans voted against it. Among them was Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, who was elected in 2002; his predecessor, the late Senator Paul Wellstone, had strongly opposed Arctic drilling. 
 ''I made a campaign promise,'' Mr. Coleman explained.
 The budget language assumes roughly $5 billion over the next five years in oil drilling revenues from the Arctic over the next decade, with the state of Alaska and the federal government to split the money. But advocates on both sides of the debate dispute how much oil is underneath the tundra, and how much the oil companies care about drilling there. Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who has been a leading proponent of drilling, has said the refuge could produce up to one million barrels of oil per day. He and other proponents of drilling say it could be done with modern equipment that would minimize the disturbance to the environment.
 Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said, ''We have the highest environmental standards of anywhere that you will find in the country.'' 
 But opponents, like Senator Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who sponsored the provision that would have eliminated the drilling language, argue that drilling in the Arctic would not substantially reduce American dependence on foreign energy because there is no guarantee that the oil drawn from the refuge could be exported.
 Some cast their opposition in moral, even religious, terms.
 Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, showed pictures of caribou and a polar bear, its reflection shimmering on the ice. ''To me this is a God-given environment,'' she said. Wednesday's vote did not put an end to the drilling debate. The Senate must pass a budget, its budget must be reconciled with the one passed by the House, and then Congress must pass a second budget-related measure that includes the drilling in a larger package of provisions. 
 ''It's a long process,'' Mr. Stevens said.
 But none of these bills can be blocked by filibuster.
 The drilling issue has been raging in Congress at least since 1980, when President Jimmy Carter, in a compromise, signed legislation that both expanded the Arctic refuge and allowed a small slice of it to be opened to oil exploration, subject to Congressional approval. In 1995, Congress gave that approval, using the same budget maneuver that Republicans used on Wednesday, but the measure was vetoed by President Bill Clinton. 
 Two years ago, Republicans tried the maneuver again, but with only 51 Republicans in the Senate, some of whom opposed drilling, it failed.
 In recent weeks, advocates have been conducting an intense lobbying campaign. President Jimmy Carter has also made phone calls urging Democrats, like Ms. Landrieu, who had supported drilling, to oppose it.
 As senators were voting on Wednesday, Ms. Landrieu stood at the back of the chamber, talking to colleagues on both sides of the aisle with a conflicted look on her face. At one point, moments before she cast her vote, she tapped Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who opposes drilling, on the arm and whispered to him. He said later that she told him she would be supporting drilling.
 ''I was disappointed,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''I feel it personally.''

How They Voted on Alaska Drilling
 WASHINGTON, March 16 (AP) -- Following is the 49-to-51 roll-call vote by which the Senate decided to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling. A ''yes'' vote was a vote to remove a refuge drilling provision from next year's budget and kill the measure; a ''no'' vote was a vote to clear the way for the approval of drilling in the refuge. Voting ''yes'' were 41 Democrats, 7 Republicans and one independent. Voting ''no'' were 3 Democrats and 48 Republicans.

HEADLINE: Tax Cut Plan Withstands A Challenge In the Senate

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Anne E. Kornblut contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
President Bush's tax cuts survived an important challenge in the Senate on Wednesday, when lawmakers voted by the narrowest of margins to defeat budget language that would have made it more difficult to extend the cuts for another five years. 
 In a 50-50 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected so-called pay-as-you-go rules, which would have required that any tax cuts or new spending programs be offset with savings in other areas. Last year, the Senate approved the rules, prompting a dispute with the House that ultimately prevented Congress from passing a budget. 
 The defeat on a tie vote came on a roller-coaster day of debate on Capitol Hill over spending and fiscal policy. House lawmakers approved an $81.4 billion emergency spending bill, mostly for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, by a vote of 388 to 43. The House also took up its own budget bill, with a vote on final passage expected Thursday. 
 The Senate also voted Wednesday in favor of a budget provision that would ease the way for oil drilling in an Arctic wildlife refuge and defeated a measure that would have added $1.04 billion to federal financing for Amtrak. The extra Amtrak money was opposed by the White House, which is calling for the end of the railroad's subsidy in its 2006 budget. 
 The closeness of the vote on tax cuts showed how uneasy some Republicans were about extending the cuts as the federal deficit grows. In his proposed $2.57 trillion budget for 2006, Mr. Bush vowed to reduce federal spending enough to cut the deficit in half over the next five years. But advocates of the pay-as-you-go rules say Congress must do more. Joining with the Senate's 44 Democrats and 1 independent to support the rules were 5 Republicans. 
 ''I just don't understand how we can continue to go this way,'' said Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, who was a chief sponsor of the defeated measure. 
 ''We're living in a dream world,'' he added. ''This deficit continues to grow.''
 But with 55 Republicans in the Senate, proponents of tax cuts prevailed. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican of Iowa who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that without the tax-cut extensions ''you are going to have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country.''
 Mr. Bush's proposed budget included $100 billion in tax-cut extensions over five years. The Senate Republican leadership, in an effort to win the support of Republican moderates, balked at that number, reducing the amount of tax cuts in their budget proposal to $70 billion. Their intent was to extend the major reductions, in capital gains and dividend taxes, which are set to expire in 2008.
 But that plan did not go far enough for Mr. Voinovich and Democratic advocates of the pay-as-you-go rules. 
 ''Our Republican colleagues, who used to be fiscally conservative, have now become borrow-and-spend advocates,'' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota. ''They have no intention of doing anything about these budget deficits except add to them.''
 As the House began its own budget debate, the Republican leadership on Wednesday smoothed over what appeared to be the last obstacle to passing a spending plan: a revolt among an alliance of conservatives and moderates who wanted to make it more difficult for the House to exceed its own budget limits. The leadership had opposed the effort, but after several days of negotiations, conservatives settled for the right to challenge any subsequent spending bill that exceeds the amount set in the budget. The objection could be overridden by a majority vote. Conservatives had pushed for a two-thirds vote.
 ''It is one more safeguard against excessive spending,'' said Representative Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who is the majority whip. 
 Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the conservative House Republican Study Committee, which was pushing for the change, called the leadership's offer a ''generous concession.'' 
 He said as many as 30 Republicans had threatened to withhold support without the provision, putting the budget's eventual passage at risk.
 Earlier Wednesday, the House approved an emergency spending bill, but blocked a provision for $590 million to build a United States embassy in Baghdad, Iraq. The Senate is expected to take up the bill next month.

HEADLINE: China's Central Bank Raises Interest Rate on Mortgages

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 16 

 BODY:
China's central bank said late Wednesday that it was raising the interest rate on mortgages, after more signs emerged that the country's economy might be growing at an unsustainable pace as property prices soar. 
 The minimum interest rate for housing loans of five years or more will rise to 5.51 percent, from 5.31 percent. Banks will also be encouraged to require down payments equal to 30 percent of the purchase price, instead of 20 percent, in cities that have experienced especially rapid appreciation lately, the People's Bank of China said in a statement on its Web site.
 The moves come a week after Shanghai began assessing a capital gains tax of 5.6 percent on real estate bought and sold in less than a year, and after delegates to the National People's Congress in Beijing expressed worries in the last week that real estate speculation was becoming out of control and making housing less affordable. 
 Real estate prices have been climbing even faster in China than in the United States, with urban prices escalating 10.8 percent in the fourth quarter after an increase of 8.6 percent in the third quarter. Prices have been rising still faster in Shanghai, where overseas investors have been buying up apartments hoping to profit not only from rising prices but also a possible increase in the value of China's currency against the dollar. 
 The central bank tempered the effects of the rate increase on the overall economy, however, by reducing the interest rate it pays banks for reserves they hold in excess of regulatory minimums. The effect of the decrease, to 99 one-hundredths of a percent from 1.62 percent, is to encourage banks to lend more money, though the banks are still under administrative controls governing the volume of loans to sectors that may be overheated. 
 The actions to cool property speculation come amid a series of unexpectedly strong economic reports so far this year -- in exports, industrial production and consumer price inflation, together with a jump in investments in fixed assets announced Wednesday morning. The flush of solid data is prompting many economists to question whether Chinese leaders can meet pledges to slow the economy's growth to 8 percent this year, from 9.5 percent last year. 
 ''We have an economy that is stronger than we thought -- the slew of January and February numbers is pretty impressive,'' said Jonathan Anderson, a UBS economist here. 
 If growth continues to accelerate in China this year, prices could rise even higher for crude oil and other commodities that China now imports in enormous quantities. Copper prices jumped on Wednesday in London to a record $3,307 a ton as Chinese companies placed large orders, while oil prices hit a record, touching a high of $56.60 a barrel, despite a pledge by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production 2 percent. Oil later settled at $56.46 a barrel. 
 The big question now is whether the Chinese economy's vigor, combined with a huge inflow of both speculative and long-term investment, will feed inflation, which could be socially and even politically disruptive. While consumer prices were 3.9 percent higher last month than a year earlier, some economists are less worried now about inflation than they were in the spring of last year, as the pace of growth has evened out a bit among various sectors of the economy. 
 Construction of new steel mills, which turned into a national fad in early 2004, has slowed. Some of the fastest growth this year has been in exports, while investment has soared fastest this year in areas that were bottlenecks to growth last year, notably coal mining, electricity generation, oil refining and transportation. 
 Liang Hong, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said that she had no plans to increase her 2.6 percent consumer inflation forecast for this year, though she expected growth to exceed the government's 8 percent target. 
 ''It seems to be close to 9 rather than close to 8,'' she said. 
 Qu Hongbin, an HSBC economist, said that Chinese regulators had been effective in persuading banks to slow the annual growth in loans, to less than 15 percent now from 24 percent at the end of 2003. This will start slowing investment spending and the rest of the economy soon, he said. 
 But Andy Xie, a Morgan Stanley economist, was more pessimistic, saying in a research note that China faced an overheating economy and a property bubble. 
 Vigorous economic growth and rising exports combined with currency speculation are increasing the pressure on China to allow greater flexibility in its currency, the yuan, which has been effectively pegged at 8.28 to the dollar for almost a decade. The prime minister, Wen Jiabao, surprised financial markets on Monday by mentioning that if China acted on the currency, it would do so unexpectedly, although he also cautioned that there would be risks to the global economy from any revaluation. 
 China's foreign currency reserves jumped nearly $100 billion in the fourth quarter alone to $609.93 billion as the central bank exchanged yuan for the flood of dollars pouring into the country mostly through unofficial channels. Raghuram Rajan, the research director of the International Monetary Fund, urged China in a speech here Tuesday to let the yuan trade in a wider range, a step that would probably result in its appreciation, saying that steps like interest rate controls, bond sales and capital controls could not indefinitely prevent the inflow of money from feeding inflation. 
 ''The inflation genie can indeed be bottled up,'' he said. ''Eventually, however, it will get out as all these controls lose their effectiveness. Long-term undervaluation is simply too difficult to manage.''
 Investment in factories, office buildings and other fixed assets in urban areas climbed 24.5 percent in the first two months of this year compared with a year earlier, an acceleration from a year-over-year increase of 21.3 percent in December, China's National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. 
 Data for the first two months of the year are often combined in China because of difficulties in adjusting for the dates for Chinese New Year celebrations, which follow a lunar calendar.

HEADLINE: G.M. SEES A LOSS NEAR $1 BILLION; STOCK FALLS 14%

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Jeremy W. Peters, in Detroit, and Jonathan Fuerbringer, in New York, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 16 

 BODY:
General Motors' stock fell to its lowest level in more than a decade Wednesday after the company said it expected to post a loss of nearly $1 billion for the last six months. The news set off G.M.'s largest single-day share loss since the market collapse of 1987 and further darkened Wall Street assessments of the company, the world's largest automaker. 
 The losses reflected an increasingly harsh reality: that General Motors, which three years ago was thought to be the healthiest of the Big Three automakers in Detroit, is now considered the weakest, primarily because it is not selling enough cars at home. The losses also raised questions about the strategy of the company's chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner.
 On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, G.M. fell $4.71, or 14 percent, to $29.01, on volume of more than 59 million shares. It was the Big Board's most active stock, and its closing price was the lowest since November 1994. 
 General Motors' unsettling news led to a broad sell-off of shares in companies whose fortunes decline in a weaker economic climate. G.M. alone accounted for about 35 points of the 112.03-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. [Page C8.]
 Numerous problems are weighing on G.M. in the United States, its crucial home market, where brands like Pontiac, Buick and Saturn are household names yet are sorely lacking in appeal, according to J.D. Power & Associates, the quality and customer satisfaction analyst.
 A wave of new models has not helped stem the company's plummeting sales, even though G.M. spends more than any other automaker on rebates and low-rate financing deals. That has led G.M. to scale back its production in North America in the first half of the year by 300,000 cars, or about 10 percent. 
 Increasing health care costs are also a heavy burden for the company, which is America's largest private health care provider; G.M. covers 1.1 million Americans, or nearly 0.4 percent of the entire population. Rising interest rates and weakening credit ratings are expected to cool its lending business, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, which is its main profit center. And foreign competitors, like Toyota and Nissan, are far more profitable. 
 Mr. Wagoner, who has been chief for five years, did not outline significant changes to his strategy on Wednesday and insisted in a conference call with analysts and reporters that he still had the confidence of the company's directors. 
 ''The board is fully informed on all our strategies, and on that basis supportive,'' he said. 
 And John M. Devine, G.M.'s chief financial officer, declared in an interview, ''The board -- and I've observed it pretty clearly -- it's got full confidence in Rick and the team.''
 Company directors have not returned calls for comment in recent weeks about G.M.'s challenges. 
 In both stock and bond markets, the reaction to Wednesday's news was swift and unforgiving. Merrill Lynch lowered its recommendation on G.M. shares to sell. Fitch, one of the three leading debt-rating agencies, downgraded G.M.'s debt to its lowest investment grade and put the company on a negative outlook for potential downgrading to junk bond status. 
 Standard & Poor's, which already had G.M. debt at its lowest investment rating, changed its outlook to negative. The third major debt-rating company, Moody's Investors Service, put G.M. on review, which means that the bonds could be knocked down to Moody's lowest investment grade as soon as several weeks from now. 
 Thus, one of corporate America's largest debt issuers could soon be selling junk bonds. That would not only drive up G.M.'s borrowing costs, but would also rattle the bond markets more broadly. 
 ''The bad news of this morning certainly outstripped our downside expectation,'' a Standard & Poor's credit analyst, Scott Sprinzen, said, adding that G.M.'s hold on an investment-grade rating was ''tenuous.''
 ''The concern for us is not just this year,'' he said, ''but what that says longer term about how G.M. is going to fare.'' 
 G.M. has 7,600 dealers around the country and operations in 32 states, including plants that employ tens of thousands of workers. It is a top 10 employer in Michigan and Ohio and feeds a wide web of suppliers throughout the Midwest, from its large former parts subsidiary, Delphi, itself one of the nation's largest corporations, to a variety of small businesses. 
 The company said on Wednesday that it expected an operating loss of $1.50 a share in the first quarter of 2005, or about $850 million, compared with its earlier projections that it would at least break even. For the year, G.M. cut its earnings forecast to a range of $1 to $2 a share, down from $4 to 5 a share. 
 Some analysts say that G.M. will be hard pressed to turn a profit this year. ''We don't see anything on the horizon to enable them to make money this year,'' said Sean Egan, a credit analyst at the independent ratings firm Egan-Jones, who has been among the most pessimistic about G.M.'s prospects. 
 Ronald Tadross, an analyst at Bank of America, said that despite the company's heavy spending on purchase incentives, ''we continue to believe G.M.'s products are overpriced'' because resale values of cars are falling.
 The automaker's largest American rival, the Ford Motor Company, reiterated its projections for operating earnings in the first quarter Wednesday, though it said it expected its full-year earnings to come in at the low end of its previously stated range of $1.75 to $1.95 a share. Still, that gave some confidence to analysts.
 ''We believe that the problems at G.M. are really G.M.-specific,'' said John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, ''and while declining market share is affecting Ford, too, the company has a stronger portfolio of products.'' Mr. Casesa maintained a neutral rating on Ford shares.
 The prevailing view of analysts about G.M. has been that the company is not close to having to file for bankruptcy protection because at least by the end of last year, it had $23 billion in cash in its automotive operations against roughly $30 billion in debt that does not come due for years. But the company said that cash flow from its operations this year would shrivel to a deficit of $2 billion from the positive $2 billion that had been projected.
 Mr. Egan sees the risk of bankruptcy as more immediate than some others do. ''The real question is, What's going to turn this around?'' he said. ''They have relatively few levers to pull.''
 G.M. also restated its fourth-quarter earnings to reflect a recent agreement to pay Fiat $2 billion to extract itself from an industrial alliance. As part of the alliance, struck in 2000, Fiat was granted the right to sell its auto business to G.M. at any time over roughly five years. Several analysts have criticized that deal as a gift to Fiat that put G.M. at risk of having to absorb Fiat's badly struggling auto business.
 G.M.'s own European operations have lost money for five consecutive years. Mr. Wagoner had said that the company would make money on the Fiat deal because of parts-sharing agreements. 
 For the fourth quarter of last year, G.M. said it would take an $886 million charge, which turns a relatively slim profit of $1.11 a share into a loss of 17 cents a share. That is equivalent to about $96 million of the nearly $1 billion loss projected Wednesday.
 Mr. Wagoner said the company would largely stick to its previously outlined strategies -- consolidating its global operations into one engineering and manufacturing organization, and continuing an effort to invigorate its car and truck lineup. 
 ''North America is our 800-pound gorilla and today's announcement really shows how important it is that we get this business right,'' he said, adding that products remain ''the first and most important element of this strategy to get North America on track.''
 He and other G.M. executives are convinced that the company's fortunes will substantially improve when a new wave of its most important vehicles -- medium and large-size sport utility vehicles and large pickup trucks -- arrive in 2006 and 2007. But demand for larger S.U.V.'s has been weakening, and analysts are concerned that if gasoline prices remain high, new versions of G.M. mainstays like the Chevrolet Suburban and the Cadillac Escalade will not be the profit sources they have been in the past. 
 ''The real part of the earnings problem,'' Mr. Sprinzen of Standard & Poor's said, ''is what is going on in S.U.V.'s, particularly mid- and large-size S.U.V.'s'' 
 Chris Ceraso, an analyst at Credit Suisse, asked Mr. Wagoner and Mr. Devine on a conference call what steps the company was considering to reckon with the fact that its share of the United States market had dropped to 25 percent in February from close to 33 percent a decade ago. 
 ''What are the thoughts, longer term, about shrinking the business to get more in line with where the market share is?'' he asked. 
 Mr. Devine, the chief financial officer, replied, ''Getting the share back up is our top priority.''
 ''Obviously,'' he added, ''the losses we're looking at in North America right now provide clearly some additional incentive to move faster here.''

HEADLINE: Bolivian President Won't Quit, Citing a Decline in Street Protests

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia 

 BODY:
President Carlos Mesa of Bolivia reluctantly decided Thursday to remain in office despite his threats to quit, saying street protests against his rule had eased enough to allow him to govern.
 ''I'm not going to run away from my responsibilities,'' Mr. Mesa said in a televised address, after keeping Bolivia in suspense about his future for the second time in just over a week. 
 After a long night of meetings with cabinet, military and church officials, Mr. Mesa seemed hesitant about his decision to stay at the helm of a country in turmoil amid a sweeping rights movement by Bolivia's impoverished Indian majority.
 The former TV journalist said he ''profoundly lamented'' Congress' rejection on Thursday afternoon of his request to bring presidential elections forward by two years to August to choose someone to replace him.
 ''But I want to tell the country that I am willing to go down this most difficult of paths, since it makes no sense to hand over power right now. It would not resolve the crisis,'' Mr. Mesa said.
 Earlier this week, Mr. Mesa had said that highway blockades set up by Indian protesters furious over his economic policies had put Bolivia on a path to ''collective suicide,'' and he could no longer stay in office.
 However, the president said Thursday he had been encouraged after protesters recently took down many of the blockades that had stranded thousands of trucks on jungle highways and caused food shortages in major cities.
 ''We have to build on this progress and not let the opportunity escape us,'' Mr. Mesa said. 
 Mr. Mesa had already threatened to quit once last week, then changed his mind after Congress rejected his resignation, fearing his departure could bring even more chaos.
 His approval rating remains above 60 percent in most polls, but his agenda has been stymied by a deadlocked Congress and heavy pressure from protesters that paralyzed the economy.
 The president's relations with both groups seemed unlikely to improve immediately.
 ''We knew he would stay. His threat to quit was just another effort to blackmail the country,'' said Evo Morales, a lower house deputy and a leading Indian protester who wants the government to increase royalties on foreign gas companies to 50 percent. 
 Protests have centered on Mr. Mesa's plans to open Bolivia's energy sector to more foreign investment. They have become a rallying cry for a wide range of grievances including anti-American sentiment and long-simmering racial tensions between Indians and the European-descended elite.
 Mr. Mesa came to power in October 2003 when his predecessor, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, fled the country during a similar Indian revolt that killed dozens.

HEADLINE: Work Whose Medium Is Indeed Its Message

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Power to the people. Those were 1960's words. They were shouted in demonstrations where fists were raised. In some circles, they even became a kind of conversational sign-off, like ''Peace.'' O.K., man. Take care now. Power to the people. 
 Who were ''the people,'' anyway? Blue-collar workers, African-Americans in the civil rights movement, immigrant laborers. Students? Some, though even engaged young people tended to want to help the people rather than be the people. Artists? Again, some, possibly many. Even those who steered clear of group identity understood that they lived in a politicized world and they thought hard about art's place in it. 
 Some artists are still thinking hard about this. Rirkrit Tiravanija, the winner of the Hugo Boss Prize 2004, who has a solo show at the Guggenheim Museum, is one. He's an interesting case. Born in 1961, Thai by descent, son of a diplomat, he is firmly imbedded in the New York art world, where he is best known as the creator -- or perhaps facilitator -- of social events in which art and life cross paths. 
 For a 1992 solo, he transformed 303 Gallery, then in SoHo, into a restaurant where he prepared and served free Thai meals daily to anyone who showed up. And once word went out, many people did show up, to look and eat and schmooze at long tables, family style. 
 Other events followed. He built an empty room-size structure in a gallery for the 1995 Whitney Biennial; it was meant to be used as a practice space for rock bands, including his own. At Gavin Brown's Enterprise, the gallery that now represents him, he installed a replica of his apartment and had students live in it, stopping by himself now and then to cook meals.
 In short, Mr. Tiravanija has developed a remarkable thing: a hands-on, interactive, people-welcoming art of being there. He is well aware of other artists who have done similar work. And one of particular pertinence, it seems to me, is the Thai conceptualist Montien Boonma (1953-2000), whose art was very much of a piece with the Buddhist practice of social generosity, including alms-giving and cooking for strangers at temples and monasteries.
 Many of the people who have experienced Mr. Tiravanija's hospitality have not been strangers. They have been members of the tightly networked art world: artists, curators, dealers and critics, along with visitors to galleries or museums. But the Guggenheim show, organized by Joan Young, an associate curator, is a little different. Called ''Untitled 2005 (the air between the chain-link fence and the broken bicycle wheel),'' it has no live artist-viewer component. Yet at least potentially, it forges a broader and more far-ranging connection between art and life than his earlier work did. 
 The piece consists of a single installation: a low-power television station set up in a gallery. Made with relatively inexpensive materials and using instructions pulled from the Internet, it includes a wooden shed with a few benches and a television set, and a big glass vitrine enclosing an upright metal rod, the transmitter. Cables attached to the rod snake across the floor, first to a section of chain-link fence, then to a video monitor on which a film is playing. The film is what's being broadcast to the television set in the shed.
 I've left some parts out, but those are the basics. And what looks like a glorified science-fair project comes with specific social context. The airwaves, which carry transmissions, are technically United States government property. Unlicensed broadcast is illegal, and licenses, issued by the Federal Communications Commission, are hard to get.
 Federal control of communications resources has further tightened in recent years, inspiring a wave of illegal transmissions from small, improvised stations. (At the Guggenheim, transmission is confined to the gallery, in compliance with F.C.C. regulations.) 
 In certain other countries, guerrilla broadcasting has been a potent political tool. And in the United States, it is part of a widespread protest against perceived restrictions on First Amendment rights.
 Mr. Tiravanija spells all this out in large-print texts, which cover the gallery like wallpaper. They include the words of the First Amendment, a political history of radio and television communication, and instructions for building personal low-power television stations. Much of the same information is also available as a free blueprint-style handout. 
 In addition, the film Mr. Tiravanija has chosen for broadcast in the gallery directly refers to anti-establishment politics of an earlier time. Made in 1971 and titled ''Punishment Park,'' it is a docudrama about the brutal silencing of antiwar protesters during the Vietnam period. Many of the actors were amateurs. The people cast as activists were, in fact, real-life activists; the police were played by former police officers. 
 Their lack of theatrical training gives the film a curious tension, making it seem both authentically documentary and stagy. It feels something like that era's political street theater, which was cropping up all over the United States and Europe at a moment when anger and paranoia were at flood tide. This aesthetic certainly suits the low-tech character of the broadcast facilities, which are pretty rudimentary. When I was there, the film was only sporadically watchable on the receiving television, where the picture was muddy and interrupted by static. 
 But finesse isn't the point. The installation is basically a bare-bones statement of the practical fact that anyone who wants to participate in shaping the communications media that are shaping the world at large can do so. ''Everyone is an artist'' was Joseph Beuys's potent rallying cry in the 1960's and 70's, which made artists and ''the people'' one. Mr. Tiravanija, who has learned much from Beuys, adds his own variation: ''Everyone is a broadcaster. Make this transmitter at home.'' 
 At the same time, he has customized his own version with a couple of features that are not necessarily meant for replication. One is the glass box encasing the transmitter. Its presence is symbolic, a reminder of how resources that should be available free to everyone become the closely guarded valuables of a privileged few. 
 And there is the antenna: a bicycle wheel perched on a stool on the roof of the wooden shed. It evokes Marcel Duchamp's famous ready-made sculpture ''Bicycle Wheel.'' Mr. Tiravanija is wise to summon the spirit of this urbane, clear-eyed, nostalgia-free artist. The 1960's are dead and gone, their liberationist language long since co-opted and corrupted by the social and economic forces it was directed against. Resistance -- even the word sounds musty -- has a different form, at least in art. 
 It isn't about making a big shout. It's about staying alert, keeping a conversation on track and bringing in many voices. It is not primarily about raising fists. It's about extracting things from the world, gently, and then putting them back, but with new meaning, like manipulated ready-mades. Duchamp had a really good grasp of all this, and he's still broadcasting. Mr. Tiravanija, in his own different way, understands it, too. Join this wire of mine to that wire of yours to that wire of theirs. And once we're connected, the power goes on.

''Hugo Boss Prize 2004: Rirkrit Tiravanija'' remains on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, through May 11.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Rise; Jobless Claims Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
An index meant to forecast future economic activity rose in February for the third time in the last four months, while unemployment claims fell, suggesting that the economy is on track to continue expanding into the summer. 
 But optimism about the future was tempered by the increase in crude oil prices, which soared above $57 a barrel for the first time yesterday. 
 ''These higher energy prices are definitely going to take their toll on the consumer,'' said Anthony Chan, managing director and senior economist at JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio. As a result, he said, economic growth might slow in the second half of the year. 
 The Conference Board reported yesterday that its index of leading economic indicators advanced 0.1 percent, to 115.6, in February. Analysts had expected the index to be unchanged. 
 The February increase followed a decline of 0.3 percent in January. The index rose 0.3 percent in both November and December. The index is designed to predict economic activity over the next three to six months. 
 The Labor Department said that the number of new people signing up for unemployment benefits last week declined for the first time in a month, an encouraging sign that the job market may be gaining traction. 
 The department said new applications for unemployment insurance dropped a seasonally adjusted 10,000, to 318,000, for the week ending March 12. The level of 318,000 was the lowest since late February.

HEADLINE: Joblessness in Region Is Off Sharply, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
In a further signal that New York's economy is rebounding from a long downturn, the unemployment rate in the region fell to 5.1 percent in January, down from 6.8 percent in the comparable period in 2004, one of the largest year-over-year declines in unemployment in the nation, according to the federal government. 
 While unemployment was certainly lower during the boom years of the 1990's, this is the largest year-over-year decline in joblessness in the region since 1995. In New York City alone, the unemployment rate in January was 6.2 percent, down from 8.4 percent last year.
 Job gains spanned the metropolitan region, from Midtown Manhattan to the North Jersey suburbs, and industries, from embattled Wall Street securities concerns to restaurants and Madison Avenue advertising shops. 
 ''Based on the information that is out there, the city looks stronger than it did before,'' said Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which released its own data yesterday showing strong economic growth in the city. ''Securities-industry employment looks stronger than it was before, and in a number of sectors you are seeing improvement, from the office market to the housing market to tourism,'' Mr. Bram said.
 Mr. Bram added that although the city looked as if it was headed toward yet another budget crisis a year ago, an increase in revenues has helped the municipal coffers, underscoring that wage growth on Wall Street and in other high-paying sectors is strong.
 The region added 90,900 jobs over the last year, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, across a variety of professions.
 ''That the unemployment rate is dropping all over the metro area and not just the city is interesting,'' said Martin Kohli, a regional economist at the bureau's New York office. ''The fact that the same trends are showing up in both the city and the suburbs indicates that we're not witnessing a statistical fluke in one area.''
 ''We are seeing a big drop in unemployment with a virtually flat labor force,'' he said, ''which is a very different situation than we are seeing in the rest of the nation, where the labor force is growing.'' 
 The data, for a federal region that includes North Jersey, the other New York suburbs and parts of Pennsylvania, were not seasonally adjusted.
 Among regions with more than one million residents, only the San Jose region of California had an unemployment rate fall as much as the New York region, the Labor Department said. ''It's not often that these two areas, which have very different industry bases, behave in the same way,'' Mr. Kohli said. 
 The latest numbers, combined with recently released job figures, present a snapshot of the New York economy at a time of significant changes. For instance, from July 2003 through January 2005, the city lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs, but over the same period gained 10,600 jobs in retailing.
 ''The retail economy here is just amazing,'' said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist at the real estate services and investment management firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which analyzes data from the Labor Department. ''And the tourism economy is also a very compelling story.''
 Retail jobs, as well as those in travel-related businesses, where 15,600 jobs were gained over the last two years, are not as stable and dependable as those in manufacturing, which is why economists and city officials remain concerned about the loss of manufacturing jobs. In January, the Bloomberg administration created an Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses to provide tax benefits and other services.
 One of the most important developments in the city's economy over the last six months is a sharp increase in the number of securities jobs, after several quarters of decline. The city had already been climbing out of its recession before the Wall Street jobs returned, something that had not happened in decades of past recessions, and an increase in securities jobs means better times are almost certainly ahead.
 ''The securities industry is at the top of the food chain,'' Ms. Denham said. ''Those jobs drive a lot of ancillary economic activity. It was the first industry to grow in the 1990's and the first one to shed jobs'' in the recession, she added. It also surprised economists by not being the first industry to recover in employment as the city bounced back last year. ''But in the last six to nine months, it is growing again,'' she said, pointing to the 7,800 jobs added in the sector since July 2003. Other industries that have added jobs in recent months are educational and health services, government, and telecommunications and advertising.

HEADLINE: Lautrec's Life, High and Low

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
''Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre,'' a flawed but enthralling exhibition that opens Sunday at the National Gallery of Art here, frames the famously diminutive painter in the context of fin de siecle Montmartre and the Parisian demimonde. It features more than 120 pieces by Lautrec -- paintings, drawings, prints and posters -- and more than 100 works by others, including striking minor pieces by Manet, van Gogh and Bonnard, and many paintings and posters by lesser-known artists.
 The show argues that understanding the sociology of the place where Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901) started out as a student in the early 1880's and achieved resounding success as a poster artist in the 1890's will add much that a personal biography or a traditional art-historical focus on the work cannot reveal. As T.J. Clark showed in his influential book ''The Painting of Modern Life,'' knowing about topics like urban planning and middle-class leisure in 19th-century Paris can greatly enrich our experience of Impressionist painting. 
 But in this show, organized by Richard Thomson, an art history professor at the University of Edinburgh, Montmartre does not emerge as a very revelatory or even a very clear lens through which to view Lautrec. Nor does it emerge as a gripping subject in its own right. Along with its catalog, the show provides lots of historical and sociological information, as well as ticket stubs, photographs, sheet music and other sorts of memorabilia. But it leaves in place the cast of characters and settings that are at least vaguely familiar to most viewers as the background of Lautrec's cheerfully dissolute life: the singers, dancers, prostitutes, men in top hats, dance halls, cafes and brothels. The show turns paintings and prints by Toulouse-Lautrec and others into illustrations for a baggy popular history lesson. 
 Fortunately, Lautrec is a wonderful enough painter to survive this treatment, and the works by other artists are illuminating. Pictures by Manet, van Gogh and Bonnard show Lautrec's affinities with others who were creating Modernist idioms. And it is interesting to see how much better he was than the many lesser artists with whom he shared conventions of style, theme and subject matter. He was a draftsman and caricaturist of genius, with a powerfully acute sense of pictorial design. And his ability to imbue representations of people -- especially women -- with individuality, vitality and emotional poignancy is on a par with any artist since Rembrandt. 
 Studying this exhibition, you may well conclude that the key to Lautrec is not Montmartre but the women of Montmartre, by whom he appears endlessly fascinated and depicts with remarkable empathy. He does not turn women into stereotypical sex objects, as does, say, Renoir. But neither is he clinically detached like Degas, who was a hugely important influence on Lautrec. Nor does he exoticize women a la Gauguin, or worship them as preternaturally beautiful goddesses, as the academic Bouguereau does.
 If not uniquely, at least highly unusually, Lautrec seems in his art to be interested in women as independent people, free agents and creative artists. His most famous pictures are of female theatrical performers, women like Jane Avril and Yvette Guilbert who, on the stage anyway, are in charge of their own destinies. But he is good with ordinary women, too, and though they may be frumpy, gawky and otherwise less than beautiful, he always seems to like them. 
 Women, for Lautrec, are somehow connected to the spirit of contemporary art itself. ''At the Moulin Rouge,'' one of his biggest and most important paintings, shows a group of men sitting around a table with two women, while a third woman looms forward at the far right side of the canvas, her face bathed in an eerie green light. The two women at the table are also mysteriously spotlighted; the one with her back to us has glowing red hair and the one across the table has a white, masklike face. The men are all dimly lighted, hirsute and wearing top hats (the bearded and top-hatted Lautrec himself is identifiable in the murky background). It seems barely a stretch to read the men as personifications of unenlightened conformity and the women as possibly dangerous promises of creative possibility. It is clear whose side Lautrec is on.
 The woman with her back turned to the viewer and her eyes hidden is a recurrent motif in Lautrec. In a painting from 1888, a red-haired woman sits alone at a cafe table, her back to the viewer and only the side of her face visible. The lone woman at the cafe table is a standard motif for many artists at this time, yet you can sense in Lautrec's picture a particularly tender attraction and curiosity. A painting from 1889 called ''Rousse'' (''Redhead'') offers the naked back of a woman sitting on the floor. She may be a prostitute washing up, but she is viewed with an affectionate intimacy, as though by a friend or a longtime lover. 
 With its light palette, relative flatness and visibly busy brushwork, ''Rousse'' obviously owes much to both Degas and Manet, and it is instructive to compare it with a beautiful picture by Manet in the show: a small painting of a tired-looking young woman in a pink dress seated at a cafe table with a drink. Manet views his subject almost straight-on and his painting is similarly direct in its address to the viewer.
 The shock in Manet, for his contemporaries, was the full-frontal nakedness of his painting as much as his sometimes scandalous images. Lautrec is an artist of indirection and inflection -- of shadows and silhouettes, hints and suggestions, finely tuned shapes and gestures but few details. What made him a great graphic artist was his ability to convey so much so quickly, and so economically.
 Lautrec was an aristocrat, but a bohemian, countercultural spirit animates his art. (He drank himself to death by the age of 36.) As opposed to the competitive aggression and rationalistic regimentation of modern business and industry, he evoked a world of sensual pleasure, personal intimacy, expressive spontaneity and erotic play. A Marxist like T.J. Clark might reasonably argue that the circuses, dance halls, cafes and brothels and the cult of celebrity that so inspired him were already industrialized forms of entertainment.
 But Lautrec did not emphasize the dark side. In his paintings and prints, the circus is an arena of acrobatic joy and the brothel, perhaps paradoxically, a haven from the outer, male-dominated world. In the maisons closes, as the brothels were called, the pace is slow and lazy, familial; men are rarely in evidence and women find romance in each other's arms. He was not the only artist to visit brothels, but he was one of the most empathetic. (Think, by contrast, of Picasso's terrifying ''Demoiselles d'Avignon.'') 
 The women of Montmartre were for Lautrec doorways to the more freely expressive, sensuous and sympathetic part of himself -- to his own inner femininity, you might say. (Excepting the great posters for the cabaret singer Aristide Bruant, none of his pictures of men are nearly as alive.) In his many pictures of women who turn away and hide their eyes, it is as though he is patiently waiting to be let into the feminine world.
 In his famous 1892 print ''The Englishman at the Moulin Rouge,'' the all-purple form of a top-hatted fellow leans toward a pair of women, crowding them into the left-side edge of the picture, as though he were trying to penetrate their secret society and not just proposition them.
 The exhibition includes a curious set of small lithographs by Lautrec all based on a flat, nearly abstract image, like a cloud or a ghost. Look closely and you see it has little stick legs and an elementary head. It depicts Loie Fuller, a dancer famed for swirling around her body the billowing skirts of her gowns, using poles held in each hand. A brief film of Fuller is on view and her act looks so ridiculous it is hard to see what could have been so captivating about her. But in Lautrec's prints she becomes the epitome of expressive immediacy -- the fusion of the dancer and the dance, of form and content -- that he sought and, at his best, found in his own art.

''Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre'' opens Sunday at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, on the National Mall between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, (202)737-4215, and continues through June 12. It will travel to the Art Institute of Chicago (July 16 to Oct. 10).

PERSON: George Frost Kennan

HEADLINE: George F. Kennan Dies at 101; Leading Strategist of Cold War

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER and BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
George F. Kennan, the American diplomat who did more than any other envoy of his generation to shape United States policy during the cold war, died on Thursday night in Princeton, N.J. He was 101. 
 Mr. Kennan was the man to whom the White House and the Pentagon turned when they sought to understand the Soviet Union after World War II. He conceived the cold-war policy of containment, the idea that the United States should stop the global spread of Communism by diplomacy, politics, and covert action -- by any means short of war. 
 As the State Department's first policy planning chief in the late 1940's, serving Secretary of State George C. Marshall, Mr. Kennan was an intellectual architect of the Marshall Plan, which sent billions of dollars of American aid to nations devastated by World War II. At the same time, he conceived a secret ''political warfare'' unit that aimed to roll back Communism, not merely contain it. His brainchild became the covert-operations directorate of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
 Though Mr. Kennan left the foreign service more than half a century ago, he continued to be a leading thinker in international affairs until his death. Since the 1950's he had been associated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he was most recently a professor emeritus.
 By the end of his long, productive life, Mr. Kennan had become a phenomenon in international affairs, with seminars held and books written to debate and analyze his extraordinary influence on American policy during the cold war. He was the author of 17 books, two of them Pulitzer Prize-winners, and countless articles in leading journals. 
 His writing, from classified cables to memoirs, was the force that made him ''the nearest thing to a legend that this country's diplomatic service has ever produced,'' in the words of the historian Ronald Steel.
 ''He'll be remembered as a diplomatist and a grand strategist,'' said John Lewis Gaddis, a leading historian of the cold war, who is preparing a biography of Mr. Kennan. ''But he saw himself as a literary figure. He would have loved to have been a poet, a novelist.'' 
 Morton H. Halperin, who was chief of policy planning during the Clinton administration, said Mr. Kennan ''set a standard that all his successors have sought to follow.'' 
 Mr. Halperin said Mr. Kennan understood the need to talk truth to power no matter how unpopular, and made clear his belief that containment was primarily a political and diplomatic policy rather than a military one. ''His career since is clear proof that no matter how important the role of the policy planning director, a private citizen can have an even greater impact with the strength of his ideas.''
 The force of Mr. Kennan's ideas brought him to power in Washington in the brief months after World War II ended and before the cold war began. In February 1946, as the second-ranking diplomat in the American Embassy in Moscow, he dispatched his famous ''Long Telegram'' to Washington, perhaps the best-known cable in American diplomatic history. It explained to policy makers baffled by Stalin that while Soviet power was ''impervious to the logic of reason,'' it was ''highly sensitive to the logic of force.'' 
 Widely circulated in Washington, the Long Telegram made Mr. Kennan famous. It evolved into an even better-known work, ''The Sources of Soviet Conduct,'' which Mr. Kennan published under the anonymous byline ''X'' in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs, the journal of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the Western world is something that can be contained by the adroit and vigorous application of counterforce,'' he wrote. That force, Kennan believed, should take the form of diplomacy and covert action, not war.
 Mr. Kennan's best-known legacy was this postwar policy of containment, ''a strategy that held up awfully well,'' said Mr. Gaddis.
 But Mr. Kennan was deeply dismayed when the policy was associated with the immense build-up in conventional arms and nuclear weapons that characterized the cold war from the 1950's onward. His views were always more complex than the interpretation others gave them, as he argued repeatedly in his writings. He came to deplore the growing belligerence toward Moscow that gripped Washington by the early 1950's, setting the stage for anti-Communist witch hunts that severely dented the American foreign service. 
 At the height of the Korean War, he temporarily left the State Department for the Institute for Advanced Study. He returned to serve as ambassador to Moscow, arriving there in March 1952. 
 But it was ''a disastrous assignment,'' Mr. Gaddis said. Mr. Kennan was placed under heavy surveillance by Soviet intelligence, which cut him off from contact with Soviet citizens. Frustrated, Mr. Kennan publicly compared living in Stalin's Moscow to his experience as an internee in Nazi Germany. The Soviets declared him persona non grata.

From One Dulles to the Other
 Mr. Kennan was then pushed out of the Foreign Service in 1953 by the new Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, who took office under the newly elected President Eisenhower. Allen Dulles, the new director of central intelligence, then offered a post to the man his brother had rejected -- knowing, as few others did, of Mr. Kennan's crucial role in the formation of the C.I.A. clandestine service. 
 Mr. Kennan had argued for ''the inauguration of political warfare'' against the Soviet Union in a May 1948 memorandum that was classified top secret for almost 50 years. ''The time is now fully ripe for the creation of a covert political warfare operations directorate within the government,'' he wrote. This seed quickly grew into the covert arm of the Central Intelligence Agency. It began as the Office of Policy Coordination, planning and conducting the agency's biggest and most ambitious schemes, and within four years grew into the agency's operations directorate, with thousands of clandestine officers overseas. 
 A generation later, testifying before a 1975 Senate select committee, he called the political-warfare initiative ''the greatest mistake I ever made.'' 
 Mr. Kennan also played a formative role in the foundation of Radio Free Europe. Seeking ways to use the skills of emigres from the Soviet Union's cold-war satellites, he asked a retired ambassador, Joseph C. Grew, to form an anticommunist group called the National Committee for a Free Europe. Backed by the C.I.A., the committee set up Radio Free Europe, which broadcast news and propaganda throughout Eastern Europe. Two prominent dissidents of their times, Lech Walesa in Poland and Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia, praised R.F.E. as highly influential. 
 Mr. Kennan supported the war in Korea, albeit with some uncertainty, but opposed United States involvement anywhere in Indochina long before American troops were sent to Vietnam. He did not include the region in his mental list of areas crucial to American security.
 In February 1997, Mr. Kennan wrote on The New York Times's Op-Ed page that the Clinton administration's decision to back an enlargement of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to bring it to the borders of Russia was a terrible mistake. He wrote that ''expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold war era.''
 ''Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking,'' he wrote. His views, shared by a broad range of policy experts, did not prevail. 
 Mr. Kennan was the last of a generation of diplomatic aristocrats in an old world model -- products of the ''right'' schools, universities and clubs, who took on the enormous challenges of building a new world order and trying to define America's place within it after the defeat of the Nazis and a militaristic Japanese empire.
 With history as a guide, these worldly-wise policy makers ultimately decided against punitive policies toward the losers, instead helping the defeated countries rebuild as democracies. But the diplomatic establishment had no precedent to fall back on as they wrestled with Soviet Communism and a Maoist revolution in China.
 Though Mr. Kennan is often grouped among the ''Wise Men'' who shaped Washington after World War II, he did not share their heritage. ''He was not part of the elite East Coast establishment,'' Mr. Gaddis said. ''He was never wealthy. He worked his way through college, and he lost all his money in the Depression. He always felt he was an outsider, never an insider.''
 Mr. Kennan was often a gloomy, sensitive and intensely serious man. Perennially unable to tailor his crisp intellectual views to political necessity in Washington, and lacking the political and bureaucratic skills needed to survive there, Mr. Kennan appeared to those who knew him to be happy to find a long-term home in Princeton, where Albert Einstein and other leading thinkers also honed their ideas.

Ever the Policy Maker
 From that perch in 1993, Mr. Kennan recommended, characteristically, that the United States needed an unelected, apolitical ''council of state'' drawn from the country's best brains to advise all branches of government in long-term policies. He proposed the council in a very personal book, ''Around the Cragged Hill'' (Norton 1993), which revealed his core social conservatism as he reviewed the evolution of America. 
 He fretted that the population of the United States was growing too fast and that, environmentally, the country was ''exhausting and depleting the very sources of its own abundance.'' He blamed cars and the suburban sprawl they created for the death of not only a magnificent railway network but also the ''great urban centers of the 19th century, with all the glories of economic and cultural life that flowed from their very unity and compactness.''
 But Mr. Kennan was most preoccupied with society's effects on making foreign policy, an increasingly shrunken intellectual field in an age when American diplomacy itself has been driven to penury by a dominant new breed of post-cold-war America-Firsters. He saw American policy by the end of the 20th century as unfocused, adrift and subject to too many (sometimes conflicting) domestic political pressures, with a host of players who have diminished the role of the secretary of state at a moment in history when the United States stood alone in its world power.
 ''It is not too much to say that the American people have it in their power, given the requisite will and imagination, to set for the rest of the world a unique example of the way a modern, advanced society could be shaped in order to meet successfully the emerging tests of the modern and future age,'' he wrote in ''Around the Cragged Hill.'' 
 Among his other well-known works were ''American Diplomacy 1900-1950''; ''Russia Leaves the War,'' winner of the Pulitzer prize for history in 1957 and the Bancroft and Francis Parkman prizes and a National Book Award; and two volumes of memoirs, in 1967 and 1972, the first of which won another National Book Award and another Pulitzer. Mr. Kennan was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, by President George H.W. Bush in 1989.

The Modest Beginnings
 George Frost Kennan was born in Milwaukee on Feb. 16, 1904, the son of Kossuth Kent Kennan, a lawyer who was a descendant of Scotch-Irish settlers of 18th-century America and who was named for the Hungarian patriot. His mother, the former Florence James, died two months after his birth.
 When he was 8, he was sent to Germany in the care of his stepmother -- his father had remarried -- to learn German in Kassel, because of the purity of the language there. It was the first of numerous languages he would eventually master: Russian, French, Polish, Czech, Portuguese and Norwegian. 
 Educated at St. John's Northwestern Military Academy in Delafield, Wis., and at Princeton University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1925, he decided to try for the Foreign Service rather than return to Milwaukee. ''It was the first and last sensible decision I was ever deliberately to make about my occupation,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kennan served as a vice consul in Geneva and Hamburg in 1927 and was on the verge of resigning to go back to school when he learned that he could be trained as a linguist and get three years of graduate study without leaving the service. He went to Berlin University and chose to study Russian, partly in preparation for the opening of United States-Soviet relations, which occurred in 1933, and partly because another George Kennan, his grandfather's cousin, had devoted himself to studying Russia.
 While in Berlin, Mr. Kennan met Annelise Sorensen, a Norwegian, and they were married in 1931. They had four children. He is survived by his wife and their children -- Grace Kennan Warnecke of New York, Joan Kennan of Washington, D.C., Wendy Kennan of Cornwall, England, and Christopher J. Kennan of Pine Plains, N.Y. -- and by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. 
 In the five and a half years between Mr. Kennan's decision to become a specialist on Soviet affairs and his first assignment to Moscow in 1933, he served in a number of posts on the periphery of the Soviet Union. He was third secretary in the embassy in Riga, Latvia, when he was assigned to accompany William C. Bullitt, the first United States ambassador to the Soviet Union. 
 During his career, he was assigned to Moscow three more times -- as second secretary in 1935 and 1936, as minister-counselor from 1944 to 1946, first under W. Averell Harriman, then under Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, and finally for a brief term as ambassador in 1952. 
 When he was appointed to the embassy in Moscow in 1944 as minister-counselor, he described his return after a six-year absence as an unsettling experience because of the hostility and suspicion he found in the official circles of a wartime ally.
 ''Never,'' he wrote, ''except possibly during my later experience as ambassador to Moscow, did the insistence of the Soviet authorities on the isolation of the diplomatic corps weigh more heavily on me. We were sincerely moved by the sufferings of the Russian people as well as by the heroism and patience they were showing. We wished them nothing but well. It was doubly hard in these circumstances to find ourselves treated as though we were the bearers of some species of the plague.'' 
 Mr. Kennan, convinced that it would be folly to hope for extensive Soviet cooperation in the postwar world, was frustrated by the development in Washington of what he saw as an increasingly naive policy based on notions of Soviet friendship. He wrote analytical essays, but these won little or no attention in the State Department. 
 It was not until the United States Treasury, stung by Moscow's unwillingness to support the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, asked the State Department for an explanation of its behavior that Mr. Kennan was able to make his points in the ''Long Telegram,'' which arrived in Washington on Feb. 22, 1946. It was so well-received that ''my official loneliness came to an end,'' he wrote later. ''My reputation was made. My voice now carried.'' 
 Regrettably, in Mr. Kennan's view, the warnings that had fallen on deaf ears for so long found receptive ones partly for the wrong reasons, and he felt that the idea of a Soviet danger became as exaggerated as the belief in Soviet friendship had been. 
 He held that the Soviet Union should be challenged only when it encroached on certain areas of specific American interest, but he did not accept the view that this could be accomplished only by military alliances or by turning Europe into an armed camp. He felt that Communism needed to be confronted politically when it appeared outside the Soviet sphere. 
 Publicly, he was sharply critical of emigre propaganda calling for the overthrow of the Soviet system, believing that there was no guarantee that anything more democratic would replace it. In the 1960's and 70's, he concluded that the growing diversity in the Communist world was one of the most significant political developments of the century. But ''he missed the ideological appeal of democratic culture in the rest of the world,'' Mr. Gaddis said, as the slow rot of Soviet Communism undermined the cold war's architectures.

The 'X' Article on Containment
 Mr. Kennan had returned to Washington in 1946 as the first deputy for foreign affairs at the new National War College, where he prepared a paper on the nature of Soviet power for James V. Forrestal, then secretary of the Navy. In July 1947, that paper, drawn largely from his Moscow essays, became the ''X'' article. The article, advocating the containment of Soviet power, was not signed because Mr. Kennan had accepted a new State Department assignment. But the author's identity soon became known. 
 Mr. Kennan was attacked by the influential columnist Walter Lippmann, who interpreted containment -- as did many others -- in a military sense. 
 In his memoirs, Mr. Kennan said that some of the language he had used in advocating a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies ''was at best ambiguous and lent itself to misinterpretation.'' He had failed to make it clear, he said, that what he was talking about was not the containment by military means or military threat, but the political containment of a political threat. 
 As chairman of the planning staff at a time when planning still played a large role in policy-making, Mr. Kennan helped shift the United States to political and diplomatic containment. 
 He contributed an overall rationale to a series of actions like Greek-Turkish aid, under what became known as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and the creation of the Western military alliance. 
 Taking an active interest in the occupation of Japan and Germany, he incurred considerable criticism by opposing the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, arguing that the United States should not sit in judgment with the Soviet Union, where millions had been killed by their own government. 
 He also argued against basing American troops in Japan under long-range agreements, feeling this would antagonize the Soviet Union, which might feel its eastern flank threatened. 
 In 1950, having left the planning staff to become a counselor to Secretary of State Dean Acheson, Mr. Kennan was at odds with the State Department over the American military role in Korea and other issues. He asked for a leave of absence and moved to Princeton at the invitation of his friend J. Robert Oppenheimer, who headed the American development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, to join the Institute for Advanced Studies. He and his family divided their time between a home in Princeton and a farm in New Berlin, Pa. Later they added a family home in Norway. 
 After General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was dismissed by President Truman in 1951, Mr. Kennan was asked by the State Department to sound out Yakov A. Malik, the Soviet delegate to the United Nations, about a possible settlement of the Korean War. Secret meetings took place between the two men in June 1951-- Russian was spoken -- and formal talks leading to a cease-fire followed, a sequence that, in Mr. Kennan's view, underlined the value of secret diplomacy conducted by professionals. 
 Mr. Kennan's entire career had seemed to be preparation for his 1952 appointment as ambassador to Moscow, but his tour ended after five months when he was declared persona non grata -- on Stalin's whim, he thought -- for a chance remark to a reporter in West Berlin who had asked him what life was like in the Soviet Union. He drew a comparison to his imprisonment earlier by the Nazis, adding, ''Except that in Moscow we are at liberty to go out and walk the streets under guard.'' Left in limbo by the State Department on his return to Washington, and with policy disagreements growing between him and Secretary of State Dulles, who viewed containment as too passive, Mr. Kennan retired from the Foreign Service in 1953. This difficult period was made even more painful by McCarthyism. Many of Mr. Kennan's old colleagues and friends -- among them Professor Oppenheimer, John Paton Davies, John Stewart Service and Charles W. Thayer -- came under attack. He testified repeatedly in their defense and wrote and spoke against what he termed the malodorous tide of the times. During a pleasant academic year in 1957-58 as Eastman professor at Oxford, he was invited to deliver the BBC's annual Reith Lectures, radio talks to which all intellectual Britain is attuned.

A Surprising Offer to the Soviets
 He attracted great attention by proposing that the time was right to begin negotiating with the Soviet Union for mutual troop withdrawals from Germany. It was an idea acceptable to only a small body of left-wing opinion, as was his further suggestion that the demilitarization be achieved through the guarantee of a neutral, unified Germany. His views came under immediate fire all over Western Europe and in North America. 
 Called back into government service in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, Mr. Kennan was named ambassador to Yugoslavia and became embroiled in arguments over the proper role of Congress in foreign affairs. He sought unsuccessfully to dissuade Mr. Kennedy from proclaiming Captive Nations Week in 1961 -- as required by a Congressional resolution of 1959 -- on the ground that the United States had no reason to make the resolution, which in effect called for the overthrow of all the governments of Eastern Europe, a part of public policy. The next year Congress voted to bar aid and trade concessions to the Yugoslavs, so Mr. Kennan felt he could no longer serve usefully in Belgrade. 
 In 1966 Mr. Kennan, who had returned to Princeton in 1963, was called to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Vietnam War, an American involvement he felt should not have been begun and should not be prolonged. In 1967 he took part in a Senate review of American foreign policy. 
 For Mr. Kennan the Vietnam years were what he later characterized as instructive. His views on what he saw as almost entirely negative Congressional interference in foreign affairs altered as Congress moved to curtail the American role in Southeast Asia, an area where he believed the American interest was not at stake. In an interview at the time of his 72nd birthday, he said that he had been ''instructed'' by Vietnam, and that he now agreed that Congress should help in determining foreign policy. He added that given that reality, the United States would have to reduce its scope and limit its methods because Congressional control of foreign affairs deprives the Government of day-to-day direction of events ''and means that as a nation we will have to pull back a bit -- not become isolationist, but just rule out fancy diplomacy.'' 
 Opposed though he was to United States involvement in Southeast Asia, he was critical of the student left in the 60's. In a speech at Swarthmore College in December 1967, he assailed the students' methods of protest and their failure to present a coherent program of reform. 
 Later in life, Mr. Kennan turned his attention to support of Russian and Soviet studies in the United States, feeling that scholarship was one of America's most productive links with Moscow. ''They are impressed by our work,'' he remarked in an interview. ''It keeps Russian intellectuals from thinking we are all a nation of flagpole-sitters.'' 
 In 1974 and 1975, while in Washington as a Woodrow Wilson scholar, he helped to establish the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies in the Smithsonian complex. Recalling the ancestor who led him to study Russian, he said, ''When my colleagues gave it a name, they had in mind both George Kennans.''

HEADLINE: The Ugly American Bank

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You can say this about Paul Wolfowitz's qualifications to lead the World Bank: He has been closely associated with America's largest foreign aid and economic development project since the Marshall Plan. 
 I'm talking, of course, about reconstruction in Iraq. Unfortunately, what happened there is likely to make countries distrust any economic advice Mr. Wolfowitz might give. 
 Let's not focus on mismanagement. Instead, let's talk about ideology.
 Before the Iraq war, Pentagon hawks shut the State Department out of planning. This excluded anyone with development experience. As a result, the administration went into Iraq determined to demonstrate the virtues of radical free-market economics, with nobody warning about the likely problems.
 Journalists who spoke to Paul Bremer when he was running Iraq remarked on his passion when he spoke about privatizing state enterprises. They didn't note a comparable passion for a rapid democratization.
 In fact, economic ideology may explain why U.S. officials didn't move quickly after the fall of Baghdad to hold elections -- even though assuring Iraqis that we didn't intend to install a puppet regime might have headed off the insurgency. Jay Garner, the first Iraq administrator, wanted elections as quickly as possible, but the White House wanted to put a ''template'' in place by privatizing oil and other industries before handing over control.
 The oil fields never did get privatized. Nonetheless, the attempt to turn Iraq into a laissez-faire showpiece was, in its own way, as much an in-your-face rejection of world opinion as the decision to go to war. Dogmatic views about the universal superiority of free markets have been losing ground around the world.
 Latin Americans are the most disillusioned. Through much of the 1990's, they bought into the ''Washington consensus'' -- which we should note came from Clinton administration officials as well as from Wall Street economists and conservative think tanks -- which said that privatization, deregulation and free trade would lead to economic takeoff. Instead, growth remained sluggish, inequality increased, and the region was struck by a series of economic crises.
 The result has been the rise of governments that, to varying degrees, reject policies they perceive as made in America. Venezuela's leader is the most obstreperous. But the most dramatic example of the backlash is Argentina, once the darling of Wall Street and the think tanks. Today, after a devastating recession, the country is run by a populist who often blames foreigners for the country's economic problems, and has forced Argentina's foreign creditors to accept a settlement that gives them only 32 cents on the dollar. 
 And the backlash has reached our closest neighbor. Mexico's current president, Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, is a firm believer in free markets. But his administration is widely considered a failure. Meanwhile, Mexico City's leftist mayor, Manuel Lopez Obrador, has become immensely popular. And his populist rhetoric has raised fears that if he becomes president he will roll back the free-market and free-trade policies of the past two decades.
 Mr. Fox is trying to use a minor violation of the law to keep Mr. Lopez off the presidential ballot. If he succeeds, many Mexicans will believe that democracy was sacrificed on the altar of foreign capital.
 Not long ago, the growing alienation of Latin America from the United States would have been considered a major foreign policy setback. So much has gone wrong lately that we've defined disaster down, but it's still not a good thing.
 Where does Mr. Wolfowitz fit into all this? The advice that the World Bank gives is as important as the money it lends -- but only if governments take that advice. And given the ideological rigidity the Pentagon showed in Iraq, they probably won't. If Mr. Wolfowitz says that some free-market policy will help economic growth, he'll be greeted with as much skepticism as if he declared that some country has weapons of mass destruction.
 Moises Naim, editor of Foreign Policy, says that the Wolfowitz nomination turns the World Bank into the American Bank. Make that ugly American bank: rightly or not, developing countries will see Mr. Wolfowitz's selection as a sign that we're still trying to impose policies they believe have failed.

HEADLINE: When OPEC Speaks, Not Everyone Listens

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran, March 17 

 BODY:
While OPEC ministers were being feted by Iran's president on Wednesday with Persian food and Kurdish music, traders in the oil pit of the New York Mercantile Exchange sent them an unexpected message.
 Hours after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which was meeting in Isfahan, Iran, decided to increase its production ceiling by half a million barrels a day, prices in New York spiked to a new high. On Thursday, oil futures in New York rose sharply, hitting $57.60 before closing 6 cents below the Wednesday close, at $56.40. 
 The new quota of 27.5 million barrels a day was seen as a signal that OPEC was trying to push prices down. In terms of actual oil production, however, the new quota did nothing, since the cartel is already producing 27.7 million barrels a day. 
 Crude prices have risen by about 50 percent in the last year. Some analysts say $100 a barrel is a possibility in the event of a major disruption in supplies, another war in the Middle East, for example.
 For OPEC, the situation is paradoxical since the group is uncomfortable with today's high prices. The OPEC president said he did ''not accept this'' while Saudi Arabia, the cartel's most powerful member, favors oil at $40 to $50 a barrel. 
 But there is not much OPEC can do. Its 11 members are pumping close to 29 million barrels a day and do not have much more production capacity left to tap. Saudi Arabia, which has been pumping 9.5 million barrels a day since the beginning of the year, can add another million barrels or so, but the oil is mostly heavy crude that is less in demand.
 All the others in OPEC can do is count their record revenues and plan expansions. But as it is, some countries -- including Iran, Indonesia, Venezuela and Libya -- are struggling to meet production quotas.
 OPEC's president, Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah, said Thursday that if prices remained at their current highs for another 10 days, the group would lift its ceiling by another half a million barrels a day. 
 ''The market has not absorbed OPEC's decisions,'' said Mr. Sabah, adding that the jump in prices in the last two days ''could be a result of fears or a shortage in products.''
 Societe Generale's analysts said in a note that OPEC members clearly ''hoped to reassure the market, talking prices down and they failed.''
 So for international markets this year seems to be heading much the same way as last year -- runaway demand, tight supplies, political uncertainties, bullish investors and OPEC's incapacity to rein in prices. And much like last year, these factors are feeding into each other.
 To be sure, the increase in nominal prices has not reached the levels of 1981, when crude rose to around $80 a barrel in today's currency. Today's economies are better protected against high prices because they have managed to squeeze oil out of much of their industries, substituting nuclear energy, natural gas or even coal.
 Still, the increase in prices is worrying consumers and their governments. The United States and Europe have repeated calls for producers to pump more oil. And the Bush administration finally scored a victory this week on its plans to expand domestic production when the Senate authorized drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
 But that will not be enough. Production in most regions outside of the Persian Gulf is declining or being kept steady by billions of dollars in costly recuperation technology.
 International oil companies, starved of potentially oil-rich regions to explore, are handing back huge amounts of cash to shareholders instead of drilling new fields.
 The world, meanwhile, is consuming oil at a record pace, straining the ability of producers and refiners to deliver gasoline. This year, global oil demand is expected to grow 2.2 percent, or 1.81 million barrels a day, to 84.3 million barrels. This follows last year's estimated growth of 3.4 percent. 
 OPEC ministers argue that this means that oil markets are going through a fundamental transformation. (In recent years, the average growth in oil demand was around 1 percent.)
 ''There has been a huge change in the structure of the market,'' Mr. Sabah, who is also Kuwait's oil minister, said on Wednesday. ''The market is not missing supplies, but prices are going higher.''
 Many of the objective factors that drove growth last year are still around. Crude oil exports out of Iraq remain unreliable; Nigeria's biggest oil region is in the middle of a political and social conflict; Venezuela keeps sending contradictory signals about its intention to supply the United States; and Russia is still embroiled in the handling of its biggest oil producer, Yukos.
 In addition, China continues to surprise analysts by the resilience of its export industries and its internal oil consumption rate. While Chinese demand for oil is slowing from last year's 15 percent growth, it is expected to rise by 7.9 percent in 2005, or around half a million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency.
 ''The reality is that oil consumption has caught up with installed crude and refining capacity,'' the energy agency said in its last monthly report, released earlier this month. 
 With demand expected to climb to 86 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter, oil traders in New York are signaling that they see no ceiling on prices. OPEC, meanwhile, is enjoying its dinner.

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Managing Retirement, Many People Simply Can't

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The ''ownership society'' envisioned by President Bush from creating private Social Security accounts is nothing new for the many millions of Americans already investing for their retirement through 401(k) plans and the like.
 One thing stands out from that quarter-century of experience: those with relatively large surpluses to invest -- mostly those at the top of the earnings ladder -- have managed to amass enough wealth to serve them well in retirement. But farther down the income scale, a number of workers have been unable to handle money intended for their old age as successfully. 
 ''If you look at the whole generation it is doing a very good job managing its retirement savings,'' said Craig Copeland, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit policy research organization. ''But a significant portion are not doing a good job and some have done a horrendous job.'' 
 According to new research by Mr. Copeland, more than half of all Americans born from 1931 to 1941 -- the generation that retired over the last decade or so -- increased their wealth by more than 50 percent from 1992 to 2002. 
 While most workers did well, roughly 15 percent, mainly in the lower reaches of the income scale, depleted more than half their total wealth over that decade. 
 Elinor Sheridan of Westlake, Ohio, who retired in 1998 from a job as a risk manager at a hospital, reflects that experience. Ms. Sheridan, who will say only that she is in her 70's, started saving for retirement later in life, after a long stint as a stay-at-home mother. She was never able to invest much after a divorce and the death of her former husband. 
 In 17 years at the hospital, she managed to put together a modest personal account, worth some $60,000 when she retired. But now ''it's gone,'' she laments. ''I made the last withdrawal last summer.''
 Ms. Sheridan, who lost over a quarter of her savings when the stock market plunged in 2000, says she can survive on a combination of Social Security and a small pension from the hospital, which adds up to less than $20,000 a year. But she's now looking for a job and would like to earn $400 to $500 a month. 
 About half the American work force is covered by some sort of company pension. Until a quarter of a century ago, it was usually a defined-benefit plan, which provided specific monthly payments based on a formula reflecting an employee's earnings history and years of service. 
 But in the 1980's, under the spur of federal legislation authorizing tax-advantaged 401(k) accounts, American companies began to shift from defined-benefit plans to so-called defined-contribution plans. They encouraged the change through a combination of carrots (by providing matching funds to supplement individual contributions) and sticks (withdrawing traditional pensions or substantially cutting back on their benefits). 
 Between 1980 and 1999, the fraction of covered workers who had a traditional defined-benefit plan dropped by half, to 40 percent from 80 percent, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. And the percentage of workers with a 401(k) or similar retirement savings plan jumped, to 85 percent from 40 percent.
 Many workers have come out well ahead, enjoying the substantial benefits from their initial tax deductions and the advantage of deferring taxes on gains until withdrawal while riding the stock market booms of the 1980's and 90's to build up substantial nest eggs. 
 ''I feel pretty comfortable,'' said Chuck Desiato, 61, who retired four years ago from a 32-year career at the Gates Corporation, a hose and belt manufacturer in Denver. In his working life, he spent 15 years earning a traditional pension and 17 years building up about $300,000 worth of savings in a 401(k) account. 
 Mr. Desiato estimates he needs about $3,000 a month on top of his $1,200 pension to maintain the standard of living he and his wife are used to. Combined with Social Security, he figures that a 7 percent to 8 percent return on his investments will provide enough income for him and his wife without ever having to touch his principal.
 ''I think I did a good job of planning,'' Mr. Desiato said.
 Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University, found that the average pension wealth of workers aged 47 to 64 -- the value of their defined-contribution plans and what remained of their defined-benefit pensions -- soared 67 percent between 1983 and 2001, to $170,800 after accounting for inflation.
 But that overall gain was tilted by the outsize profits of mostly affluent employees like Mr. Desiato. According to Mr. Wolff's analysis, the median pension wealth of employees between the ages of 47 and 64 -- a point more representative of the typical retirement nest egg, where half of workers have more and half have less -- increased by only 18 percent over the period. That amounts to a gain of less than 1 percent a year, to $50,000. 
 This growth, moreover, was accompanied by a reduction in other savings. The median wealth of workers, including pensions and other sources, declined 2.2 percent in the 18 years covered by the study. And this was through one of the strongest stock markets in history. 
 ''The 401(k) is a lot more unequal than the defined-benefit system,'' Mr. Wolff said. ''The continuing transformation of the pension system will exacerbate the trend.''
 For many Americans, the ownership society already involves a host of complex decisions. Employees must decide whether to participate in a savings program, how much to contribute, how to invest their portfolio and whether to cash out when changing jobs. 
 ''In defined-benefit plans the investment risk is pooled across all workers,'' said Annika Sunden, an economist at Stockholm University in Sweden who is associated with Boston College's retirement center. ''With 401(k)'s, individuals themselves bear the financial risk, and have the responsibility for a whole range of decisions on saving.''
 Ms. Sunden and Alicia Munnell, director of the Boston College retirement studies center, estimated that a worker making the minimum ideal contribution of 6 percent of wages to a 401(k) plan, with a company match of a further 3 percent, could do better than with a traditional pension.
 If the account achieved a 4.6 percent annual return on top of inflation, the assumption adopted by President Bush based on historical returns, a worker retiring at 62 after 30 years of savings and a final salary of $52,650 would amass more than $350,000. This could provide annuity income for the rest of the person's life of roughly $31,000 a year, higher than the $26,500 such a worker would get from a typical defined-contribution pension.
 But not many middle-income Americans -- juggling buying a home, paying for college for their children, handling catastrophic medical expenses and other such unexpected costs -- manage to consistently save that much. ''Ten to 12 percent of their salaries?'' said Ms. Sheridan, the retiree in Ohio. ''Ha, ha.''
 In 2001, the most recent year for which comprehensive figures are available, the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances found that the median savings in a 55-to-64-year-old American's 401(k) or individual retirement account added up to $42,000, less than one-eighth the amount needed at 62 to achieve the retirement income estimated by Ms. Munnell and Ms. Sunden.
 Retirement account balances have increased since then, in line with the stock market's gains. Yet according to a survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, by the end of 2003 the 401(k) balances of people in their 60's were still 9 percent lower than at their peak in 1999, before stocks took a dive. 
 Fewer than 10 percent of eligible workers contribute the maximum amount to their 401(k), and about a quarter contribute nothing at all. Many younger workers empty their 401(k) accounts when they change jobs -- postponing saving for retirement.
 Low savings are not the only problem. After they retire, workers must manage their savings, a task often complicated by unexpected expenses.
 When Robert Stacy took an early retirement package from US West more than six years ago, at 53, he had a traditional pension. But he took only half as an annuity, worth $900 a month, and the other half as a lump sum. His total savings at the time, including his 401(k) and the proceeds from the sale of his house, added up to almost $600,000.
 The Stacys expected this money would be enough to roam through the country carefree in their new R.V. But six years later, the stash is down to $400,000. And the couple is facing higher health expenses since Qwest, which took over US West in 2000, started charging hefty premiums on its retirees' health plans. So the Stacys, too, decided to take up jobs in retirement. ''If I had to choose again,'' Mr. Stacy said, ''I would have taken it all as an annuity.''


CORRECTION-DATE: March 19, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the managing of retirement savings referred incorrectly to the assets used in a study of people born between 1931 and 1941. The study examined the change in their total wealth between 1992 and 2002, not just their 401(k) assets.


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''For Some, Struggling to Stay SolventA study of people born between 1931 and 1941 found that those who had at least $40,000 in 401(k) assets in 1992 still had most of their money in 2002.

But about a third of those with less than $40,000 saw their net worth decline and many of them lost all of their savings.401(k) assets in 1992Among people born between 1931 and 1941Change in 401(k) assets over 10 yearsLess than $40,000COMPLETELY LOST: 10.2%MORE THAN 50% DECLINE: 24.9MORE THAN 50% INCREASE: 58.4Change in 401(k) assets over 10 $40years,000-$99,999COMPLETELY LOST: 0.5%MORE THAN 50% DECLINE: 13.0MORE THAN 50% INCREASE: 54.4Change in 401(k) assets over 10 $100years,000-$249,999COMPLETELY LOST: 0.2%MORE THAN 50% DECLINE: 9.5MORE THAN 50% INCREASE: 55.4Change in 401(k) assets over 10 $250years,000 or moreCOMPLETELY LOST: 0.2%MORE THAN 50% DECLINE: 13.6MORE THAN 50% INCREASE: 44.0(Source by Employee Benefits Research Institute)

HEADLINE: Shares Stabilize Despite Gyrations in Crude Oil Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street stabilized yesterday, closing little changed, although another jump in oil prices sent many investors to the safety of the bond market. Scattered bargain hunting after the previous session's slide kept selling to a minimum. 
 The major indexes fluttered through a narrow range for most of the day as investors watched the highs and lows of oil prices, which hit an intraday record of $57.60 before retreating 6 cents, to settle at $56.40 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Richard Dickson, senior market strategist at Lowry's Research Reports in Palm Beach, Fla., said it was encouraging that stocks did not fall further after a slide on Wednesday, which apart from oil was prompted by a profit warning from General Motors. 
 But Mr. Dickson added that ''we haven't seen prices fall far enough to generate enough enthusiasm to make them break out of this funk.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.72 points, or 0.06 percent, to 10,626.35. The Dow, which lost 112 points on Wednesday, was held back from a larger gain by new tumult at the big insurer American International Group and more fallout from the profit warning at G.M. 
 The broader indexes managed narrow gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.14 points, or 0.18 percent, at 1,190.21, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 0.67 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,016.42. 
 OPEC this week pledged to increase its output, but said yesterday that the growing economies of the United States, China and Japan would keep demand ahead of supply this year. 
 Investors worry that high energy prices could hurt economic growth and stoke inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to turn more aggressive in raising interest rates. 
 There was also uncertainty about Standard & Poor's plan to rebalance its 500-stock index on Friday to make it better reflect the number of publicly traded shares of each company. 
 For instance, the weighting of Microsoft will decrease because a large number of its shares are not available for trading. Exxon Mobil, already the largest stock in the index, will have its weighting increased because all its shares are publicly traded. The change means funds based on the index will have to buy and sell stocks to make their holdings match the new weightings. 
 Exxon Mobil rose $1.20, to $61.49, while shares in Microsoft slipped 9 cents, to $24.54. 
 G.M. fell 66 cents, to $28.35, in a second day of selling after it substantially lowered its earnings forecasts, while A.I.G. lost $2.10, to $60.80, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company might need to restate how it reported revenue on certain insurance policies. 
 Viacom climbed 33 cents, to $37.33, after it said it was considering splitting itself into two companies to increase shareholder value. 
 Toys ''R'' Us rose $1.23, to $26, after it said it would be acquired for $26.75 a share, or $6.6 billion plus assumed debt, by an investment group including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 11/32, to a price of 96 10/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.46 percent from 4.51 percent on Wednesday.

Broadway

+* 'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. The well-oiled, highly polished 10-actor ensemble is led by James Naughton and Richard Thomas. (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Is there room on Broadway for another odd couple of singing con men? On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' directed by Jack O'Brien and starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a queasy slouch. Though shot through a rowdy spirit of self-parody, the show (with songs by David Yazbek) seems to believe in its own brazen agenda only when the criminally talented Mr. Butz commands the stage. (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $41.25 to $101. 25.

++* 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.

Off Broadway

'AFTER ASHLEY' If the last two hours of Gina Gionfriddo's play were as fine as the first 15 minutes, we'd have something to cheer. But the spark of interest ignited by the fresh first scene, a disarming and funny heart-to-heart between a confused mother and her teenage son, is all but extinguished by the time this finger-wagging satire has concluded. Ms. Gionfriddo's target is America's taste for blood, and its tabloid-tinged, sex-crime-addicted popular media. Despite some fine work from Anna Paquin and particularly Kieran Culkin, the director Terry Kinney's production is sabotaged by the conflicting impulses in the writing (2:15). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50.
CHARLES ISHERWOOD

+* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion. Staking no claim to artistic significance, it makes a nice sound, looks pretty (if you like pretty boys) and sends you home with a smile. The show comprises a dozen sly parodies cooked up by the skilled songwriters Gary Adler and Michael Patrick Walker, with winking choruses like, ''Girl, you make me want to wait.'' All the guys have terrific voices and nimble limbs, and each gets a moment to linger in the solo spotlight. (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $66 to $69.

++'ENDGAME' Tony Roberts, the actor often used by Woody Allen to epitomize suave charm in contrast to his own hapless shlubbery, moves into new territory as Hamm in this middling revival of Samuel Beckett's caustic comedy about man's fumbling reckoning with extinction. Mr. Roberts's urbanity is naturally translated into Hamm's imperiousness. But this production is sharper at etching the play's mordant humor than outlining the heaving shoals of dread on which it should rest. Nevertheless, it's also notable for the performance of Alvin Epstein, a superlative Beckett interpreter, as Nagg (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212)727-2737. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $50.

'GHETTO SUPERSTAR (THE MAN THAT I AM)' Midway through this musical autobiography, Billy Porter describes the moment that changed his life: His teenage encounter, via the Tony Awards telecast, with Jennifer Holliday's galvanizing performance of ''And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.'' Those emotions play roles in this unabashedly sentimental show, but they ultimately take a back seat to righteous flamboyance. The hallmarks of Mr. Porter's personal history will not be revelations to theatergoers who have accompanied other gay men in the performing arts on similar journeys through shame and confusion to self-acceptance. But Mr. Porter's performance of various pop songs, show tunes and original compositions is vibrant and enjoyable. (1:40). Public Theater, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Thursday through Monday at 7 p.m.; Saturday matinee at 2. Tickets: $45.

'HIDING BEHIND COMETS' The dynamics of the guy-walks-into-a-bar play are tricky. Inject a set of twins into the mix, as Brian Dykstra does in his play, and you've pretty much doomed the venture. In fiction they too often seem like a cheap gimmick. The twins here are a male-female pair, 20-somethings named Troy (Robert Mollohan) and Honey (Moira MacDonald). They mind their father's dingy bar. The stranger who intrudes is Cole (Dan Moran), an elliptical older fellow with a temper. After much verbal sparring, and a lot of sex talk that isn't very sexy, the point emerges: Cole was supposedly at Jonestown during the mass suicide there in 1978, and he has dropped by the bar to force Honey and Troy to rethink their parentage. Mr. Dykstra's script sounds as if it's banking on the shock value of Jonestown, hoping that the audience, like the idiot twins on the stage, will not have heard of it. Way too early for that (1:45). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, (212)868-4444. Thursdays through Mondays at 8 p.m.; matinee on Saturday at 3. Tickets: $35; $40 for Fridays and Saturday evenings.

* 'HOUSE/LIGHTS' The Wooster Group made the right choice when it selected ''House/Lights'' to embody its three decades of work. This technically dazzling production, based on a Gertrude Stein libretto, uses simulcast video monitors and voice-layering synthesizers to spin everything that is said and done into an orbit of multiple effects. The effect is as exhilarating as it is disorienting, capturing the impact of technology-driven life in a way that flat film and computer imagery never can. The subject may be dehumanization, but the cast is among the most vital and theatrically disciplined you will ever see. (1:10) St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718)254-8779. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays; $37 Fridays through Sundays.

'I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE' The prolific British novelist J. B. Priestley was fascinated by the concept of time, and his play suggests that individuals repeat their life cycles until they break free from past mistakes. Based partly on the author's readings of the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky, the theory is described in the play by the mysterious German emigre Dr. Gortler. Dr. Gortler, like the five other characters at the Black Bull Inn on the moors of North Yorkshire in 1937, is a mechanical device for the working out of the Priestley-Ouspensky puzzle. And as demonstrated by the Pearl Theater Company cast, in what the troupe says is the first revival of the play in New York since it appeared on Broadway in 1938, where it flopped, there isn't much wiggle room when you are a device instead of a character. Symbolism aside, the pleasure of the evening is in watching the players move about with easy familiarity (all have worked together before at the Pearl), under Gus Kaikkonen's direction, on the snug, rose-colored set by Takeshi Kata, with its four clocks that tick and chime at melodramatic moments. (2:30) Pearl Theater Company, Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $50.

+'INKY' Beware the nanny with bruised knuckles. That's the only cogent conclusion to draw from Rinne Groff's peculiar and unfocused comedy about the competitive ethics of the 1980's. The title is the odd nickname for the odd main character, a Manhattan au pair obsessed with Muhammad Ali. Inky is played by a talented newcomer to the New York stage, Jessi Campbell. The play traces her influence on her employers, a harried young businessman and his demanding wife. Unfortunately, Ms. Groff is too vague in her use of boxing symbolism, and too loose in her observation of character, for her ideas about the aridity of the rat race to hit home (1:20). Women's Project, at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $47.
ISHERWOOD

'THE LAST DAYS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT' This latest work from the author of ''Jesus Hopped the A Train'' brings to mind an unusually lively senior-class project. Thank heaven -- a subject much discussed in this debate of a drama about the Bible's most famous betrayal -- that at least the person in charge is the class cutup. And that he is popular enough to recruit some really cool friends (including Eric Bogosian, Sam Rockwell and the show's director, Philip Seymour Hoffman). Still, the colorful vernacular speech and flashy performances can't disguise the impression that the play is a heavily footnoted position paper on a big, big subject (2:40) . Public Theater/Martinson Hall, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50.

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: Things will look a lot more impressive than they actually are if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind ''Lazer Vaudeville,'' a show with lots of color, not much substance and a future asterisk: it is the last production in the John Houseman Theater, slated for demolition. The show is a hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by Carter Brown, Cindy Marvell and Nicholas Flair, who are moderately engaging but don't seem to be having quite enough fun. Ms. Marvell is a first-class juggler and never disappoints, and there's a funny little hat fandango involving all three, but some of the men's bits and ensemble pieces don't have much wow factor. Perhaps the three know they are short on razzmatazz, because they constantly shut off the lights and let their glow-in-the-dark ropes and batons do the talking. It looks cool, but, left alone in the dark once too often, some may find themselves forced to admit, ''Doggone it, that's just a guy twirling a rope'' (1:30). John Houseman Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 11 a.m., 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $45.

+'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in the case of ''The Musical of Musicals!'' Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $56 to $59.50.
MARGO JEFFERSON

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success. Mr. Pendleton, an actor and acting teacher, reimagines this theatrical footnote as a quietly momentous turning point in the emotional and professional lives of everyone involved, including Olivier's outgoing and incoming wives, Vivien Leigh and Joan Plowright, and the critic Kenneth Tynan. While Mr. Pendleton smartly exploits the frailties of these graying artistic lions for comedy, there is an abiding respect and affection in his irreverence and in the fastidious performances of director David Cromer's fine cast (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: 55.

'ROMANCE' Listen up, you mugs. Nobody makes fun of David Mamet, see, because David Mamet can take care of that all by hisself. In the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, Mr. Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either. Neil Pepe directs an irreproachable but ineffective cast that includes Larry Bryggman and Bob Balaban (1:35). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.
BRANTLEY

++* 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories from the mid-19th century, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest. Directed by Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott, and featuring bizarrely beautiful songs by Martyn Jacques, ''Shockheaded Peter'' manages to wallow in and tear apart our enduring appetite for scaring ourselves. Though styled as a Victorian peep show, this British import makes contemporary self-spoofing horror exercises (like Wes Craven's ''Scream'' movies) look like, well, child's play (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Thursdays at 10 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $21.25 to $66.25.

'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.
PHOEBE HOBAN

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45.
ISHERWOOD

+'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson and directed by Casey Childs, the play is gaudy and moderately fun, basically a big chunk of theatrical costume jewelry. It concentrates, as these borderline morbid celebrity showcases often do, on the declining arc of its subject's worldly career, and gives us the usual generous doses of dysfunction and despair beneath the glittering resume. Ms. Ruehl gives a vigorous, enjoyably big performance, but even her hard work can't inflate the flatter stretches in the writing (1:40). Promenade Theater, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25.

'GORILLA MAN' The usual afflictions befalling teenage boys -- acne, scuffed skateboards, the indifference of that girl in homeroom -- pale in comparison to the plight of Billy, the hero of this pop musical by Kyle Jarrow. Billy wakes one morning to find he is turning into a man-eating beast. Lonely and confused, he sets out to find the father who bequeathed him the genes that brought on this misfortune. On a deeper level, he seeks an answer to the profound question that has stumped philosophers, theologians and adolescents for at least a couple of millennia: ''Why me?'' There are many laughs in Mr. Jarrow's self-consciously silly book and well-tailored pop-rock songs, but the show's overall conception, which layers horror-movie melodramatics over a pseudo-earnest inquiry into questions of fate and free will, is ultimately juvenile (1:20). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Thursdays through Saturdays at 9 p.m.; Sundays at 6 p.m. Tickets: $15.
ISHERWOOD

'PENTECOST' The Barrow Group's inaugural production in its new theater couldn't be much more ambitious: the New York premiere of ''Pentecost,'' a 1994 drama by the British playwright David Edgar. Written in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the play tackles everything from the origin of Western Renaissance art to America's pop-cultural hegemony to hostage negotiations. The writing is engaging and the staging keeps things moving. It's too bad, though, that Mr. Edgar didn't just stick with revolutionizing art history rather than trying to revolutionize the world (2:45). Barrow Group Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Mondays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $40.
HOBAN

'PULLMAN, WA' This new avant-garde work by Young Jean Lee has the deadpan simplicity of the plays of Richard Maxwell and the awkward, secretly suffering angst of a teenage diarist working through an identity crisis. Artifice is the enemy. There are no props or set (outside of two chairs); the lights never change; and the costumes look like the clothes that the actors might have worn to the movies earlier in the day. The play begins when Pete Simpson, a dead-eyed and strangely hypnotic actor, walks onstage and tells the audience that he know how to live. Don't get your hopes up. The entire play could be seen as a send-up of the self-help industry, a dry comment on its tough love and easy answers. It will surely not win over many who are already skeptical about experimental theater. But while this is not a major work, it is an honest one that takes itself seriously -- and that is refreshing (1:00) . Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288. Thursdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $15.

Last Chance

'A MAN'S BEST FRIEND' At the beginning of Jeffrey M. Jones's crackpot farce, ''A Man's Best Friend,'' a clown with white makeup smeared across his face nonchalantly walks onstage and asks the other five members of the cast, ''Do I smell?'' They all make faces as if the answer is obvious and then quickly exit. This is only the first joke of the evening, but it provides a very precise indicator of the brand of humor that you're in for during the 80 minutes of this juvenile comedy. Mr. Jones is constantly throwing new oddities into the mix, even if they don't serve any purpose. You may often find yourself wondering, what's the point of this scene? Best not to ask too many questions of this kind of show, which seems more determined to be wacky than anything else. Its style is somewhere between David Lindsay-Abaire's ''Fuddy Meers'' and a Coney Island sideshow. (1:20). Walker Space, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $15.
ZINOMAN

'A VERY NAUGHTY GREEK PLAY (UTOPIA PARKWAY)' How do you update a 2,400-year-old comedy? The Aquila Theater Company's answer: create a version of Aristophanes' ''Wasps'' that has some of the dumbness of ''Saturday Night Live'' and the zaniness of Monty Python, without being as funny as either. From rubber chickens to inflatable sex mannequins played like air guitars, the piece brings in an arsenal of comedy gags to drive home this story about a politically conservative father (named Kokkos, or ''Red'') and his liberal son Huakinthos (''Blue''), arguing over a political leader named Thamnos (''small, leafy shrub'' -- a Bush by any other name). It's a shame to see so much talent and energy expended for so slender a result. (1:25). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 5 and 9 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 and $45; $15 for stageside ''Greek Seats,'' from which audience participants are drawn.

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. (It won five Oscars, including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett.) Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 1920's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.
MANOHLA DARGIS

'BE COOL' Directed by F. Gary Gray. Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Christina Milian (PG-13, 112 minutes). In ''Be Cool,'' Mr. Travolta, wearing black and the glazed look of the overly pampered and chronically bored, returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in Barry Sonnenfeld's 1995 adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel ''Get Shorty.'' That movie arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction,'' a film that in turn owed a serviceable debt to Mr. Leonard's oeuvre. But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, largely propelled by Mr. Travolta's star presence and a screenplay from Scott Frank, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty, fueled by nothing more than the faintest of vapors left over from those earlier successes. The new film was written by Peter Steinfeld, whose draggy, generally unfunny screenplay packs in a lot of the same characters from the Leonard novel (the sequel to ''Get Shorty'') and too much of its overworked, conceptually anemic plot.
DARGIS

'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' Starring Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai. Directed by Gurinder Chadha (PG-13, 111 minutes). Because Ms. Chadha knows how to sell multiplex multiculturalism -- her last feature was ''Bend It Like Beckham'' -- the pitch for her new film probably ran something along the lines of: ''Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' recontextualized as a Bollywood musical (only shorter) and set against the backdrop of the new global economy.'' Whatever the case, the new film -- which transposes Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India, with layovers in swinging London and sunny Los Angeles -- is as high concept and rife with cliche as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. Think ''My Big Fat Sari Wedding'' tricked out with clumsy song-and-dance numbers and delivered with much finger-wagging about cultural tolerance. The kicker here being that the wagging finger belongs to the story's heroine, here called Lalita (Ms. Rai, radiantly beautiful but inert), and the object of her high-mindedness is none other than a wealthy American, Will Darcy (Mr. Henderson, just inert).
DARGIS

'CONSTANTINE' Starring Keanu Reeves. Directed by Francis Lawrence (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Mr. Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. He is John Constantine, who travels back and forth between our world and the one below, working as a kind of freelance border guard, sending stray demons back into the fiery depths. But something big is brewing, involving rebel angels, the son of Satan, and a whole lot of pseudo-biblical mumbo jumbo. Assisting Mr. Reeves are Rachel Weisz, as a Los Angeles police detective whose sister has jumped off a roof, and Shia LeBoeuf as an eager dabbler in the occult. Tilda Swinton is the angel Gabriel, doing a bit of slumming after boffo work in Milton's ''Paradise Lost.'' A.O.
SCOTT

'DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN' Starring Kimberly Elise, Tyler Perry and Cicely Tyson. Directed by Darren Grant. (PG-13, 116 minutes). This movie is so oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce. As the story of a cruelly abandoned wife's reascendance zigzags from soap opera to slapstick to church sermon and back, it goes from A to Z on the all-things-to-all-people meter: Cinderella meets Amos 'n' Andy in Sunday school, so to speak.

'DOWNFALL' Starring Bruno Ganz. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (No rating, 155 minutes; in German, with English subtitles). Mr. Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses around him, and the Red Army closes in. Surrounding him are his followers, some fanatically loyal, others wavering in the face of defeat, who must all play out the endgame of their ghastly world-historical project. Mr. Hirschsbiegel's film, taking place at the moment when the energies of Nazism turned from murder to suicide, is engrossing and well made, but it does not generate much feeling beyond a queasy, prurient fascination. Its most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it.

* 'GUNNER PALACE' Directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. (PG-13, 86 minutes). Mr. Tucker spent several months in late 2003 and early 2004 in Baghdad recording the lives and words of members of the Army's 2/3 Field Artillery division (known as the Gunners), who were living in an opulent, bomb-damaged palace that once belonged to Uday Hussein. The resulting film is raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. We accompany them on raids and patrols, witness their moments of leisure, and hear their own conflicted responses to their experiences, conveyed through jokes, video diaries, poems and hip-hop freestyling. Whatever your opinions of the war in Iraq, this film will provide a necessary jolt of confusion, which is the first step toward an unsentimental understanding of who the American troops are and what they face.

'HOSTAGE' Directed by Florent Siri. Starring Bruce Willis and Kevin Pollak (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Mr. Willis's fading career as an action hero. The star plays a former hostage negotiator who has exiled himself to a quiet southern California town after a botched standoff. He springs back into action when the cliff-hugging mansion of a crooked book-cooking corporate accountant (Mr. Pollak) is simultaneously invaded by a posse of teenage punks and by a S.W.A.T. team of high-tech gangsters. The fiery demolition of this architectural monstrosity in which the accountant lives with his two children is the only thing worth applauding in this mess of film.
HOLDEN

'IN MY COUNTRY' Directed by John Boorman. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of the high-minded but hopelessly wooden film that examines the public hearings conducted by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the late 1990's. At the hearings, victims of human rights abuse during Apartheid confronted the perpetrators in court, both sides seeking ''ubuntu,'' or forgiveness instead of revenge. Mr. Jackson is an American reporter who brings his own angry racial agenda to the hearings. The screenplay, by Ann Peacock, who adapted the story from Antjie Krog's memoir, ''Country of My Skull,'' makes the fatal mistake of turning characters into mouthpieces engaged in stiff, point-counterpoint moral debate.

* 'INTIMATE STORIES' Directed by Carlos Sorin. Starring Javier Lombardo (not rated, 92 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The modest gem of Argentine film, set in Patagonia, conveys starkly and unemotionally what it really feels like to live in a wilderness with next to nothing. For the characters who wouldn't understand the concept of upward mobility, this is simply the way life is. The story interweaves vignettes of travelers from the same rural village bound for the provincial capital 200 miles away. One is an old man (Antonio Bendectis), who takes to the road to find his runaway dog; another is a single mother (Javiera Bravo) who becomes a contestant on a TV game show; the third (Mr. Lombardo); is a traveling salesman. The journey promises redemption to one, riches to another, and true love to a third.

'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (NC-17, 90 minutes). It was the image seen -- cheered and jeered, canonized and demonized -- around the world. In 1972 Linda Lovelace, nee Linda Boreman, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat,'' played the role that would bequeath her a tawdry and lasting celebrity. With a single act of extreme fellatio, this dazed and often confused 23-year-old became a pinup for the party animal's sexual revolution and, in time, a martyr in the crusade against pornography. But as is clear from this lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary, Ms. Boreman was also little more than a pawn, an empty vessel for opportunists from both sides of the pornography divide. The documentary is a ''slam, bam, thank you, ma'am'' trifle of an entertainment, one strategically packaged for Generation A.D.D.
DARGIS

'THE JACKET' Directed by John Maybury. Starring Adrien Brody (R, 102 minutes). Mr. Brody plays Jack Starks, a soldier in the first Gulf War who survives a bullet wound to the head, fixes a pickup truck in Vermont, and is then sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. There, things get really weird, as a sinister doctor (Kris Kristofferson) straps him into a jacket and shoves him in a drawer, in the name of some misguided therapeutic ideal, or perhaps just because he is a sadistic brute. The drawer, or maybe the jacket, enables Jack to propel himself forward in time, where he meets Keira Knightley, playing a lonely, hard-drinking waitress. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks, and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. In his less hyperactive moments, Mr. Maybury is able to conjure a mood of tenderness and menace, and Mr. Brody's haunted intelligence goes nicely with Ms. Knightley's jumpy intensity. The picture starts out trying to be craftily clever and ends up artlessly dumb, which is to say that it improves as it goes along, sliding from jumped-up paranoia into squishy sentiment.
SCOTT

* 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliche, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004. (It won Oscars for best picture, best director for Mr. Eastwood, best actress for Ms. Swank and best supporting actor for Mr. Freeman.)
SCOTT

* 'MILLIONS' Directed by Danny Boyle. Starring Alex Etel (PG, 97 minutes). When it comes to making movies, Mr. Boyle is usually up to no good, which is something this visual stylist does with great ostentatious flair. Best known for ''Trainspotting,'' a grungy entertainment about the gleefully down and out, and for the shiver-filled zombie flick ''28 Days Later,'' Mr. Boyle is the sort of creative type in whom the milk of human kindness often seems to curdle rather than flow. Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves his stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. Pegged to a motherless child named Damian (Alex Etel, making a sensational debut), ''Millions'' is about the secret world of children, in particular that miraculous, tragically brief interlude when the young imagination -- not yet captive to crippling adult conventions like time, space and rational thought -- takes boundless flight.
DARGIS

'THE PACIFIER' Directed by Adam Shankman. Starring Vin Diesel (PG, 97 minutes). In the primary visual gag of ''The Pacifier,'' a Navy Seal, on a top-secret babysitting mission, retrofits his gun and grenade holders to keep baby formula and diapers at the ready. Despite the specter of boogeymen, Disney's new family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. As a special-ops warrior with a heart-thawing assignment, Mr. Diesel succeeds as a genre-switcher through the help of an able ensemble. The mayhem should delight kids, just as the imposed order will please parents. Anyone else, however, might feel as though they are, in Mr. Diesel's words, merely ''burning daylight.''
NED MARTEL

'ROBOTS' Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha. With the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and Robin Williams (PG, 89 minutes). Like so many other non-Pixar computer-animated family movies, this one, from Fox's Blue Sky Studios, runs on visual novelty and narrative familiarity. The setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination, as are the characters, an assortment of dented heroes and sleek, silvery villains. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions, cool soundtrack music and heartwarming lessons about being yourself and following your dreams. There is, it must be said, a certain honesty to the story, which suggests that recycled, second-hand junk is superior to the latest high-tech upgrades, a moral the movie at once upholds and refutes.
SCOTT

'UP AND DOWN' Starring Petr Forman and Emilia Vasaryova. Directed by Jan Hrebejk (R, 108 minutes; in Czech, with English subtitles). This engaging, unruly mix of comedy and melodrama follows the mood swings suggested by its title. Tracing the generally unhappy doings of a dozen or so loosely connected people in contemporary Prague, it skips from buoyant satire to domestic melodrama, leaving behind a curious mix of emotions. It is not often you see a movie so bracingly pessimistic about the human condition that dispenses its dose of bad news with such good cheer. A baby is illegally adopted by a former soccer hooligan; an emigre returns for a reunion with his broken family -- all in an atmosphere of petty crime, anxiety about immigration and general puzzlement at the state of the world (or at least the Czech Republic) -- 15 years after the end of Communism.
SCOTT

'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' Directed by Mike Binder. Starring Joan Allen, Kevin Costner, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Mr. Costner and Ms. Allen to do some marvelous work. Both performances are somewhat familiar: Mr. Costner, once again, is an athlete past his prime, and Ms. Allen is a brittle, unhappy suburban housewife, but the actors slip into their characters with ease and wit, and complement each other beautifully as they explore a haphazard friendship that turns into a love affair. The downside is that Mr. Binder does not give them enough of a dramatic context to work in, and undermines their efforts with a surprise ending that very nearly destroys the whole movie. Ms. Witt, Ms. Christensen, Ms. Wood and Ms. Russell play Ms. Allen's daughters, but their characters are as thinly conceived as figures in a television pilot, and it is hard to believe that the four of them and Ms. Allen add up to a family.

* AMORPHIS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. This Finnish band embraces a style some people call melodic death metal, matching gravelly vocals and (sometimes) whiplash tempos with big, often heroic melodies and precise guitar lines that evoke progressive rock. Sunday night at 7, with Beyond the Embrace, Into Eternity, Single Bullet Theory and With Passion; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 at the door.
KELEFA SANNEH

* DANIEL BELL, CABANNE, downstairs at Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. A minimalist dance party starring two DJ's who like their tracks stripped-down and twitchy. Mr. Bell, a longtime minimal techno producer, is known for his sleek but restless style, and for an excellent 2000 compilation, ''The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell'' (Tresor), a surprisingly warm disc full of precise party music. The 2003 follow-up was ''The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!''(Logistic), which included a pair of mischievous, rubbery tracks from Cabanne, a French producer and DJ who is also on tonight's bill. Tonight after 9, with Spinoza and Movement; admission is $5.
SANNEH

LIZ CARROLL AND JOHN DOYLE, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. Liz Carroll, one of the finest Celtic fiddlers in the United States, has won an All-Ireland fiddling championship as well as a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. She isn't afraid to let a little of the Celtic diaspora into her Irish fiddle tunes; touches of bluegrass technique put an American twinkle into the old jigs and reels. She has teamed up with the guitarist and singer John Doyle, formerly of the group Solas, who brings a deep Celtic flavor to the modal syncopation of his guitar and his finely ornamented singing. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $18 in advance, $20 tomorrow.
JON PARELES

CELTIC FIDDLE FESTIVAL/ROSHEEN, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. Celtic Fiddle Festival is a trans-Atlantic alliance with three fiddlers. Kevin Burke grew up in an Irish family in England and has become one of the most authoritative traditional Irish musicians alive, sweet and lightning-fast. Christian LeMaitre plays the Celtic music of Brittany, and Andre Brunet comes from the French Canadian group La Bottine Sourriante. They're accompanied by the guitarist Ged Foley. They share the bill with Rosheen, a seven-member Celtic group from Quebec started by the singer Lynn Vallieres, who sings in English and French. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $22.50 in advance, $25 tomorrow.
PARELES

EL GRAN COMBO, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, (212)239-2672. El Gran Combo was formed in 1962 and has been consistently on the Latin charts ever since. By now, it's an institution, still singing about matters close to the heart of Puerto Ricans on the island and far away. Tomorrow night, doors open at 10; admission is $25.
PARELES

* ODETTA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. Odetta has been a blues powerhouse since the 1950's, strumming hard and singing with a deep, leathery voice that harks back to field hollers and sprituals. She gives her songs the authority of archetypes. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $30.
PARELES

* OM, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. Matt Pike, formerly of the excellent slow-motion metal band Sleep, now leads his own loud and utterly hypnotic band High on Fire. The other two former Sleep members play together in OM, a bass-and-drums duo that celebrates its buzzy, bleary new album, ''Variations on a Theme'' (Holy Mountain), at this show -- the album consists solely of three long tracks, so expect a long, cyclical set. Tomorrow night at 7:30, with Hidden Hand and Unearthly Trance; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door.
SANNEH

OZRIC TENTACLES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. England has jam bands, too, and Ozric Tentacles may be the most well-traveled one of them. Its songs start with the suite-like complexities of progressive rock, and take off from there. Tomorrow night at 9, with Lotus opening; tickets are $20 in advance, $23 tomorrow.
PARELES

PSARANTONIS/HAINIDES ENSEMBLE, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536. This double bill of Greek music from Crete features, Psarantonis, the scion of a long line of musicians who has been making albums since 1964. He sings and plays the lyra--an upright, throaty-toned fiddle capable of fierce, danceable melodies or husky laments--and leads an ensemble that includes his daughter and two sons. Hainides, the group sharing the bill, is an ensemble of younger musicians who play both Cretan traditional music and music from across Greece. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $45, or $15 for students.
PARELES

TOSHI REAGON, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680.

With her band Big Lovely and, in a show to mark the imminent closing of Fez, unannounced guests. Tonight at 8; tickets are $15.
PARELES

LES SANS CULOTTES, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, (212)505-3733. The light-headed charm of the 1960's French rock known as ''ye-ye'' is concept enough for Les San Culottes, a Brooklyn band. Campiness is virtually built in to the fuzz-toned guitars, electric organ, cooing female voices and know-it-all male growls. Tomorrow night at 11:30, with Gaijin a Go Go at 10:30, the Dansettes at 9:30, Locksley at 8:30 and the New Rags at 7:30; admission is $8.

He left the group in January to resume his solo career, dipping into Western swing, rockabilly and 1960's rock. Tonight and tomorrow, three sets start at 10; admission is free.

* SPRING BLING, Wild Palm, 1601 Bronxdale Avenue, off East Tremont, the Bronx; dancehallreggae.com. This reggae party plays features a pair of big-name DJ crews, Massive B (led by Bobby Konders and Jabba, the team behind Hot 97's long-running Sunday night reggae show) and the mighty Jamaican sound system Stone Love. Expect to hear lots of the sweet (and, for that matter, salty) neo-roots reggae records that are currently all the rage in Kingston -- in reggae, these days, everyone's feeling nostalgic. The old-school hip-hop star (and current Hot 97 radio personality) Jazzy Joyve is to serve as host. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $20.

THE TEMPTATIONS/THE FOUR TOPS, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)749-5838 or (212)864-0372. A double bill from the glory days of Motown. The Temptations were Motown's vehicle for both virile pleading (as in ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'') and funk-driven realism (as in ''Papa Was a Rolling Stone''). The Four Tops were a paragon of group longevity, with the same lineup from 1954 until the death of Lawrence Payton in 1997. They still have Levi Stubbs's dynamic baritone to charge through Motown classics like ''Reach Out I'll Be There'' and ''I Can't Help Myself.'' Saturday and Sunday nights at 8; tickets are $37 to $67.

RHONDA VINCENT/JIM LAUDERDALE, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. A pair of mavericks with country roots. Rhonda Vincent sings, plays mandolin, and pushes bluegress in some modern directions without forgetting standards like ''Muleskinner Blues.'' The rangy-voiced singer Jim Lauderdale has collaborated with everyone from the bluegrass patriarch Ralph Stanley to the jam band Donna the Buffalo, and on his 2004 album ''Headed for the Hills'' (Dualtone), he wrote songs with the Grateful Dead's lyricst Robert Hunter. Tonight at 6:30 and 9; tickets are $25.
PARELES

JIMMY WEBB, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. As the writer of hits like ''Macarthur Park,'' ''By the Time I Get to Phoenix,'' ''Where's the Playground, Susie'' and ''Wichita Lineman,'' Jimmy Webb is a patriarch of lachrymose, existential pop epics with soaring tunes. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35.
PARELES

ZEN TRICKSTERS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700. The Zen Tricksters got started two decades ago playing Grateful Dead songs. While they now have their own songs to jam on, they haven't forgotten their early repertory; no less a figure than Phil Lesh of the Dead has called on their expertise. Tonight, playing two sets that start at 10:30, with CatWalkBlue opening at 8:30; tickets are $14.

BETTY BUCKLEY, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)744-1600. The unifying thought behind the singer's new show, ''Smoke,'' is the evanescence of perfect moments, often romantic ones, that we can't hold onto try as we might. The signature number in this smart, carefully balanced program that embraces jazz, country, bossa nova, pop standards, soft rock and art songs is Mary Chapin Carpenter's pop-country ''When Time Stands Still.'' Ms. Buckley's pianist, Kenny Werner, makes a formidable musical contribution. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $90; no minimum.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

* BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.
HOLDEN

* 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30 with a $10 minimum at a table.
HOLDEN

* TIERNEY SUTTON, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. Ms. Sutton is a pure jazz spirit who respects a song. Even when going out on an improvisatory limb, she never lets its essence slip away. The singer and her trio with whom she has worked for years -- Christian Jacob on piano, Kevin Axt on bass and Ray Brinker on drums -- have refined the kind of rapport that could only be achieved over time. Her deep, lingering renditions of chestnuts like ''Blue Skies'' and ''Without a Song'' are especially impressive for the sense of quiet joy she breathes into them. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30 p.m. Cover: $50, with a $20 minimum; a $50 prix fixe dinner is required at the early shows.

* PETER BERNSTEIN TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. Mr. Bernstein is fluidly improvising guitarist in the post-bop tradition, with control over harmony and a beautiful sound; he performs here with Larry Goldings on organ and Bill Stewart on drums. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 tonight and tomorrow night, $20 on Sunday.
BEN RATLIFF

* FLY, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. An excellent co-operative trio, with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard. Some of its music sounds chamberlike, some Latin, some funky; some, with breathtaking long-line improvisations and tight group communication, seems to propose a new model for saxophone trios. Tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.
RATLIFF

* HENRY GRIMES-MARSHALL ALLEN, Vision Club, Clemente Soto Velez Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side; www.visionfestival.org.A duet. The saxophonist Marshall Allen has led the Sun Ra Arkestra since Sun Ra's death, and at times he's a great player, sly and nuanced, taking in the smooth glissandos of Johnny Hodges, as well as the hard-driving, self-contained Chicago R&B style and the squeal of free jazz. Henry Grimes, the bassist, played in some of the greatest groups of the late 50's and 60's, including Sonny Rollins's and Albert Ayler's, before going below the radar for a long period in the 80's; he has recently been rebuilding a career. Tomorrow at 10 pm; admission is $10 for one set, $15 for both.
RATLIFF

* ROY HAYNES QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. An hour spent with Roy Haynes is an hour spent learning about drum sounds. Mr. Haynes was one of the first bebop drummers, having recorded with Bud Powell in 1949, and he plays bop patterns superbly when he wants, charging along with the music to support the frontline players. But more often he guts his playing of bebop cliches, changing his phrasing with every measure. He prefers startling single or double hits to rolling patterns across the drums; he often uses a very low-tuned bass tom and an even lower tympanum. In his late 70's now and still a bandleader in charge of agile young players, he is vitality itself. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover, $25, minimum, $10.
RATLIFF

JOHN HICKS TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. A presence in New York since the 1960's, Mr. Hicks is a steamroller of a mainstream-jazz pianist, loading up the music with thick chords as if he wanted to do McCoy Tyner one better. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.; cover, $25.
RATLIFF

ROSA PASSOS, Le Jazz Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455. Ms. Passos is a Brazilian singer well-versed in the subtleties of Joao Gilberto's art, and there's so much to admire about her: an impeccable control over a light-gauge voice, a precise sense pitch, a mastery of the complexity and freshness in bossa nova rhythm. Sets tonight and Sunday at 7:30, and tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.; $50 cover, tonight and tomorrow, $40 on Sunday.
RATLIFF

BOBBY SANABRIA AND QUARTETO ACHE, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Sanabria, the drummer and percussionist, is a great Latin-jazz practitioner and historian; he flips through Cuban and Brazilian and African rhythmic idioms and takes excellent jazz musicians along with him. Sets tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20, minimum, $10.
RATLIFF

DR. LONNIE SMITH QUARTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)258-9800. Dr. Smith -- who always appears wearing a turban, to confuse you a little -- is a master of slow, weird ideas on the Hammond organ; working in a setting of good-time, saloon-style jazz, he can turn it into a seance. His band includes the ex-James Brown band trombonist Fred Wesley, the guitarist Rodney Jones and the drummer Lennie White. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, and there is a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.

Opera

'CANDIDE' Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide'' opened on Broadway in 1956 at the 1,300-seat Martin Beck Theater. Watching the New York City Opera's production that opened on Tuesday night, a revival of the acclaimed 1982 staging by Harold Prince last seen at the company over 15 years ago, I only wished that this mostly delightful production of Bernstein's richest musical theater work, with a book adapted from Voltaire by Hugh Wheeler, could be played in a much smaller auditorium than the 2,700-seat New York State Theater. There is much to like about the City Opera's revival, especially the appealing cast headed by two musical theater veterans in top form: John Cullum in the double role of Voltaire and Dr. Pangloss, and Judy Kaye as the earthy Old Lady, with her vaguely Jewish-Polish accent, who is missing a buttock and full of tales about the calamities of her life. George Manahan conducted a refreshingly relaxed account of a score, giving the music room to breathe and the words space to be spoken clearly. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105.
ANTHONY TOMMASINI

'ORLANDO' With the sturdy and expressive countertenor Bejun Mehta in the title role (and thus in the mad scene), chances are good that the New York City Opera will continue its run of successes in Handel operas. Chas Rader-Shieber directs, and Antony Walker conducts. The strong cast also includes Amy Burton, Jennifer Aylmer, Matthew White and David Pittsinger. Sunday at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)307-4100. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50.
JAMES R. OESTREICH

'DER ROSENKAVALIER' Strauss's much admired opera has returned to the Met with some familiar and fresh faces in the cast. Susan Graham is in fine form for her signature role as Octavian, and the pure-voiced Laura Aikin sings Sophie. The newcomer here is the German soprano Angela Denoke, who brings an affecting sense of vulnerability to the world-weary Marschallin. Her high notes don't project as much as they waft gently into the house. In the pit, Donald Runnicles stirs up the Met Orchestra, as if to remind us that ''Rosenkavalier'' has its modern edges, too, but he is also not afraid to bask in the more nostalgic moments of this beautiful score. The Met is still getting mileage off of Nathaniel Merrill's popular production, over three decades old and counting. Tonight at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.
JEREMY EICHLER

'SAMSON ET DALILA' The portrayal of Samson by the Argentine tenor Jose Cura is the main reason to see the Metropolitan Opera's revival of its 1998 production by Elijah Moshinsky. Mr. Cura had not been back to the Met since his 1999 debut, and in the years since he has maximized his strengths and minimized his shortcomings as a singer. Though purists will still fault his vocal rawness and sometimes rough legato, he gives his all in this role, singing with passion, burnished sound, fearless attack and energy. And with his hunky physique and bold physicality, he commands the stage. Though the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves is a gorgeous and alluring Dalila, and her rich and warm voice is ideal for the role, her singing on opening nights was sometimes shaky and insecure. Bertrand de Billy was the impressive conductor. And, though the bacchanal scene may go down in Met history as a camp classic, audiences will surely enjoy ogling the scantily clad roster of muscled and sexy dancers and extras. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.

Classical Music

CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA If you missed the fine performance of Bach's ''St. John Passion'' on Tuesday at St. Thomas Church, or if you came away from it wanting more, here is the solution. Kent Tritle, who has turned the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola into a thriving center for early music, sacred music and more, leads the church forces in the ''St. John.'' James Archie Worley is the Evangelist and Matt Boehler sings Jesus in what promises to be an excellent event. Tonight at 8, Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520. Tickets: $30 and $40; $20 for students and 65+.

DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY This great Russian baritone cuts an exotic figure, with his flowing silver mane, but more to the point, he brings a rich tone and a powerful expressivity to his work on both the opera and recital stage. He is at his best in Russian music, and is singing plenty of that tonight, including Mussorgsky's ''Songs and Dances of Death'' and groups of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff songs. For a change of pace, he is also singing a selection of chansons by Duparc. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $25 to $89.
ALLAN KOZINN

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT Tonight the Metropolitan Museum of Art's resident chamber ensemble comprised of excellent musicians, either young in fact or young in spirit, presents the second of three concerts this season at the Grace Rainer Rogers Auditorium, a wonderfully intimate hall for chamber music. Picking up with a series focus on recent music from Eastern Europe and Russia, the ensemble offers Avro Part's ''Summa'' and Giya Kancheli's ''Time and Again.'' A novelty, Rossini's String Sonata, and a rousing Romantic work, Mendelssohn's Piano Sextet, complete the program. The cellist Edward Arron is the artistic director of the series, and primarily responsible for the fresh programming. Tonight at 7, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $20; students with valid ID, $5.

METROPOLITAN OPERA NATIONAL COUNCIL GRAND FINALS CONCERT This popular yearly event presents the ten young finalists from the Metropolitan Opera's national auditions. Each will perform two arias with the Met Orchestra. Hear the stars of tomorrow today. And if this seems an exaggerating, consider that among the finalists in 1988 were four fledgling singers named Renee Fleming, Ben Heppner, Susan Graham and Heidi Grant Murphy. Ms. Graham serves as host. Guest artists include Sondra Radvanovsky, Jennifer Welch-Babidge and Garret Sorenson. The guests usually sing while the judges are picking the five ''winners,'' though everyone who makes it to this concert is a winner. Sunday at 3 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $25 to $100.
TOMMASINI

SOHEIL NASSERI A recent recital of Beethoven sonatas showed this young Californian pianist to a thoughtful, inventive interpreter and, where the music demands it, a technical powerhouse. His recital tomorrow evening includes the premiere of ''Dance Suite'' by Avner Dorman, a 25-year old Israeli composer who studied with John Corigliano at the Juilliard School, as well as Beethoven's Sonata No. 22 in F (Op. 54), Schubert's Sonata in B (D. 575) and Schumann's ''Humoreske'' (Op. 20), all works that test a player's imagination. Tomorrow at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $33 to $45, $10 for listeners under 25.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The orchestra is kicking off a monthlong festival that seems on the surface something of a grab-bag but may make sense in the end. It is titled ''Visions of the Beyond,'' after Messiaen's ''Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela,'' which comes later, and includes works as diverse as Bach's ''Art of Fugue'' and Gyorgy Ligeti's ''Atmospheres.'' But it starts here with Mendelssohn's incidental music for ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' with a semistaged performance of excerpts from the play, directed by Edward Berkeley. Neville Marriner cionducts, and the cast includes Campbell Scott, Marcia Gay Harden and Hope Davis. The start of something big? Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.
OESTREICH

ORPHEUS This conductorless chamber orchestra devotes its Sunday evening concert in the Medieval Sculpture Court of the Metropolitan Museum to sacred works. The program's centerpiece is Pergolesi's Stabat Mater -- a setting that (along with Pergolesi himself for undertaking it) was disparaged by Stravinsky, but is lovely all the same. Also on the bill are some of Salamone Rossi's magnificent Psalm settings, in Hebrew. The vocal soloists are Christine Brandes, soprano, and Beth Clayton, mezzo-soprano. Sunday at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $50.
KOZINN

'SOLOMON' Handel's oratorio about the great biblical king touches on several of the principal episodes of his reign -- the visit of the Queen of Sheba, whose arrival is accompanied by some of this score's most famous music, for example, and the incident in which two women claim a single baby as their own. Johannes Somary and his Amor Artis Chamber Choir are known for their fine performances of the Handel oratorios, and tonight they offer ''Solomon'' with the support of a period instrument orchestra. The soloists include Terrence Barber as Solomon; Michael Steinberger as Zadok the Priest, Julianne Baird as the Queen of Sheba, and Cynthia Richards Wallace as Solomon's Queen -- or one of them; Handel didn't take into account that he had roughly 1,000 of them. Ms. Baird and Ms. Wallace also portray the baby-disputing harlots. Tonight at 8, Church of the Blessed Sacrament, 152 West 71st Street, (212)874-4513. Tickets: $20, $15 for students and 62+.
KOZINN

TRIGON STRING TRIO Miller Theater and the Trigon String Trio are attempting to pick up where Mozart left off. The composer took portions of Bach's trio sonatas (written for organ) and arranged them for violin, viola and cello. In three concerts over the course of this season, this ensemble will offer all six trio sonatas as string trios. Tonight's concert, the second in the series, will also feature a Mozart Divertimento (K. 563). Tonight at 8, Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $25.
EICHLER

ZEHETMAIR TRIO This ensemble is usually a fine string quartet led by the resourceful Austrian violinist Thomas Zehetmair, but the group has been traveling as a trio since Matthias Metzger, the second violinist, withdrew from its current tour due to illness. The reconfigured program includes Schubert's great B-flat Major String Trio as well as works by Mozart and Gideon Klein. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $42.

JENNIFER DUNNING

ALEXANDRA BELLER AND ALETHEA ADSITT Ms. Beller has moved on from danced Chekhov to Sartre and his ''No Exit,'' set to a soundscore by Robert Poss with a set filled with green balloons. Her characters are a frustrated Broadway diva in a scuba suit, a murderous debutante, a murdered pacifist and a tap-dancing lesbian. Ms. Adsitt has settled for exploring how humans absorb and navigate a hyper-urban environment, in her new ''Blink: The Indelible Blue Wall Coda.'' Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)253-8899. Tickets: $15.

To start, the dancers include him, the exquisite Wendy Whelan and the young City Ballet up-and-comers Andrew Veyette and Sean Suozzi.

CLARE BYRNE AND AMY LARIMER We're shy about telling you the title, which could be misinterpreted, for this raunchy-sounding piece about ''dance-world jaded lizards.'' The part-dance, part situation-comedy work will be presented on a program shared with the performance-artist Sara Juli.

MOB PRODUCTIONS AND ROBBINSCHILDS Two groups offer a double feature of premieres. Mollie O'Brien's ''This Is What I Would Have Felt,'' for her company, MOB Productions, uses the body to express sensations of illness that may be verbally indescribable. ''Half Space,'' by Sonya Robbins and Layla Childs depicts empty places, public spaces and imagined time travel with the aid of carpet runners, piles of chairs and a big chandelier. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $20. (Related review, Page Page 3.)

NAYIKAS DANCE THEATER Billing itself as New York's first resident dance theater company specializing in the Indian classical Odissi form, the troupe will perform the director Myna Mukherjee's ''Glow,'' a new multimedia dance and theater piece that draws on the glowing sensuality of women. Tonight at 7 p.m. and tomorrow at 3 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344. Tickets: $25; $18 for students and 65+.

They venture to the South Pole with the aid of recorded bird calls, documentary film footage and actual pieces of ice. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $20. (Related review, Page 4.)

* PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY In its closing weekend, the company is presenting one of its best programs tonight, when Mr. Taylor's wonderfully humane, closet-pyrotechnians will dance his powerful and haunting ''Last Look,'' his sly ''Cloven Kingdom'' and his delectably goofy ''Offenbach Overtures.'' Two Taylor classics (''Aureole'' and ''3 Epitaphs'') will be performed tomorrow night on a program that also includes a season premiere (''Dante Variations). The other premiere will be performed on Sunday on a program that ends with another Taylor classic, ''Esplanade.''

Museums

* 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression, the emotions that reveal themselves after her best pictures leave their first impression, which is often alarm. She captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and -- this probably applies as much to Arbus as to any other photographer of the second half of the last century -- she captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some maddeningly dark, dense and absurdly theatrical galleries, like chapels, of memorabilia. That said, touches her favorite subjects with grace. Even the shocking photographs of retarded women are sympathetic, implying that the world is full of wondrous things, if our eyes are open enough to recognize them, and that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $7 and 65+, $10.
MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

'BASQUIAT,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)683-5000, through June 5. In the 1980's, the hyper-talented Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame, usually on the same surface. His loquacious, ugly-elegant ''letters to the world'' (Emily Dickinson's phrase), were in step with the 80's interest in collage and in redirecting the avant-garde strategies of Post-Minimalism into painting. But Basquiat also had an urgent subject: blackness, whose glories, histories and pain his art elucidates with extraordinary complexity, in volatile mixtures of ideas, emotions, colors and images that expand the viewer's experience of time and space. This generous retrospective has a few glitches -- too many works borrowed from too few collections and a slightly too empty look in some galleries -- but nothing really detracts from its power. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.
ROBERTA SMITH

* THOMAS DEMAND, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400, through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, so as to take his own cinematic photographs. He is really a sculptor, making models of places, to produce pictures that have the presence of paintings. His subject is more than just photography's inherent unreliability, its slipperiness as truth. It also entails memory. He has reconstructed, from photographs, the blown-up room where plotters failed to kill Hitler, and the studio of an artist whom Baader-Meinhof terrorists assaulted during the 1970's in order to blow up the house of a prosecutor who lived next door. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students; children 16 and under and accompanied by an adult, free. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. Hours and admission: see above.
KIMMELMAN

* TIM HAWKINSON, Whitney Museum of American Art, Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212)570-3676, through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Tim Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, sprawling in no obvious order across the museum's fourth floor, hopscotches from one dexterous tour-de-force to the next. Each requires some head-scratching decipherment, inviting admiration for its doggedness, while not straining too hard to earn a viewer's love. Feats of physical fancy, when so dizzily executed, can be their own justification. Mr. Hawkinson's larger purpose, you might say, is simply wonderment. At the same time the art borrows a healthy strain of ludicrous wit from Samuel Beckett, who knew a thing or two about how to clown around smartly. Hours: Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Friday 1 to 9 p.m.; closed Monday and Tuesday. Admission: $12; 62+, $9.50; New York City students with valid ID and children 11 and under, free.
KIMMELMAN

* 'PETER PAUL RUBENS (1577-1640): THE DRAWINGS,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through April 3. The show is sublime. It makes not the slightest difference that it has no grand thesis, provides no narrative arc, offers up a few newly discovered drawings and fresh, solid scholarship but no radical twist on the artist. If there is any artistic justice, the exhibition ought to inspire the sort of mobbish devotion that the Met show of Leonardo's drawings did two years ago. Reviewing the work seems a bit silly. What is there to say, except that the drawings illustrate the limits of what is humanly possible with a piece of chalk and a pen and paper? It is profoundly heartening. Rubens loved to draw and loved that he could draw like a god, and his joy is ours, in looking at what he drew. This includes a few drawings by other artists with which Rubens fussed, sticking in angels here, touching up a beard there. Rubens regarded drawings, other people's and his own, as organic, to be learned from and endlessly improved upon, like life. Hours and admission: See above.
KIMMELMAN

Galleries: Uptown

NINA MUSHINSKY, Janos Gat, 1100 Madison Avenue, between 82nd and 83rd Streets, (212)327-0441, through April 2. Ms. Mushinsky is a New York-based painter who makes labor intensive, all black and white pictures based on photographs she has taken in Central Europe. Her paintings of subjects like an antique dress in a history museum, a bleak highway ramp or blurry laughing people in a leafy backyard can take as long as two years to complete. They have a smudgy, dreamlike hyperreality.
KEN JOHNSON

Galleries: 57th Street

SIDNEY GEIST: 'PHASES OF SCULPTURE,' Jason McCoy, Inc., 41 East 57th Street, (212)319-1996, through April 1. In work that goes back to the 1930's, Mr. Geist -- a sculptor as well as a teacher and writer noted for his studies of Brancusi -- has reached out to many different cultures and individuals for inspiration, from tribal art to Picasso and David Smith. The show is populated by tall, totemic structures of carved and painted wood, including a bosomy bright red ''Goddess,'' 8 1/2 feet high, but there are many smaller works like ''Rise,'' a biomorphic, Arp-esque piece of two sensuous curves, one smaller than the other, joined by a narrow isthmus. Brancusi is most significantly saluted in ''Homage Without End,'' a tall, skinny piece in raw wood whose title and structure of repetitive modules derive from the sculptor's series of ''Endless Columns.'' Mr. Geist has tried his hand at a forest of styles without ever arriving at a distinctive ''signature'' mode. Is that bad? No. Credit him with the fervor of an explorer.
GRACE GLUECK

NANCY GRAVES: 'A RETROSPECTIVE,' Ameringer & Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through April 2. Graves, who died of cancer 10 years ago, first drew attention in the late 60's for her life-size, hyper-realistic camels. This retrospective includes a prehistoric camel skull and spine from the period that was later cast in bronze. The most convincing work remains the airy, playfully disjunctive and colorfully and loosely painted assemblages of the 80's made of found objects cast in bronze, including parts of plants, mechanical fragments, tools and food products.
JOHNSON

R. B. KITAJ: 'HOW TO REACH 72 IN A JEWISH ART,' Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900, through April 2. Mr. Kitaj's overpopulated mess of an exhibition is as interesting as it is exasperating. His ongoing visual autobiography tracks his life as a Jewish intellectual, eccentric Modernist and wild old man with Biblical white hair and beard in erotic encounters with pretty young women. The subject matter is intriguing but it is realized in drawings and paintings with such sketchy impatience you wish he'd just slow down and paint nothing but still-lifes for a while.
JOHNSON

Galleries: SoHo

'BODY PROXY: AN EXHIBITION BY NORMA JEANE,' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through March 26. Norma Jeane is the fictive persona in whose name a group of anonymous people produce works of conceptual art. This show includes a motorcycle that starts up and roars increasingly loudly as you approach; a 100 kilometer long strand of hair on a spool made by knotting together hairs from one person's head; and a round, flesh-colored sofa said to be saturated with sexually provocative pheromones that will get into your clothes if you sit on it.
JOHNSON

Galleries: Chelsea

'JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT: IN WORDS ONLY,' Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through March 26. This excellent show concentrates on the cornerstones of Basquiat's art: language and a blocky, concise handwriting that amounts to a personal, almost digital typeface. The only images here are words, names, lists and phrases, often appropriated from odd places, like the index of a book on jazz or the title of a painting by Ter Borch. One nine-sheet work is simply a rewriting of the prolonged table of contents of ''Moby-Dick,'' suggesting a kind of poem.
SMITH

CHRISTIAN MOELLER: 'HEAVEN,' Frederieke Taylor, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-0992, through March 12. A professor of design/media arts at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Moeller is known internationally for interactive sound, light and architectural installations. Here he presents a comparatively simple installation of fluorescent light works in which shadowy words like heaven, goat, lick, tryst and vodka emerge mysteriously from banks of thin, white parallel tubes. It is literally the brightest show in town.
JOHNSON

'KA/VH:RA/AG,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through March 26. It's always good news when artists like work that doesn't resemble theirs. Thus, the motley appearance of this four-person exhibition, which resulted when two 5BE artists -- Richard Aldrich and Kamrooz Aram -- each invited another artist to show with them. But Mr. Aram's sly, lush recyclings of decorative and religious Persian, Chinese and Christian motifs share with Van Hanos's relatively Gothic vision an interest in mystical power and paint's physicality. And Mr. Aldrich's fragmentary abstract drawings share a studied, 1970s-based nonchalance (and, here, a darkened space) with the Amy Granat's film installation, which uses scratched film and scratchier sound to reshape space, and is the show's standout.
SMITH

IMRE KINSZKI, Klotz/Sirmon, 511 West 25th Street, (212)741-4764, through March 26. Born in Budapest in 1901, Kinszki was a well-connected Modernist photographer whose works could stand up with pictures by more famous Hungarian peers like Andre Kertesz, Brassai and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. The tiny, velvety contact prints from the 20's and 30's in this show are formally exquisite and often emotionally poignant. They include a monumental close-up of chess pieces; studies of buildings and shadows; and a heartbreakingly lovely picture of a sleeping baby. Kinszki never left Hungary, and he died in a concentration camp in 1945.
JOHNSON

CHERYL LAEMMLE, R. Duane Reed, 529 West 20th Street, (212)462-2600, through April 2. People who were around in the 80's may remember Ms. Laemmle's zany paintings of humanoid figures made of white birch logs. This exciting comeback show, the artist's first in New York since 1994, presents weirdly elegant paintings of strangely distorted cartoon birds, predatory cats and children perched on tree branches. The imagery looks like it was lifted from an antique children's book, and it is painted with an economical yet sensuous touch on unprimed linen.
JOHNSON

CORNELIA RENZ, Goff + Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212)675-0461, through April 16. This Berlin-based artist draws large, provocative cartoon images of chubby, exotically costumed young girls with adult characteristics of sexuality and aggression. Ms. Renz draws with felt-tip markers on both sides of big sheets of acrylic glass as well as on underlying white panels, creating much linear complexity. And she encloses her pictures appropriately in clinical white plastic frames of her own devising.
JOHNSON

LARRY ZOX: 'FIVE DECADES,' Stephen Haller Gallery, 542 West 26th Street, (212)741-7777, through April 5. Larry Zox's distinctive, color-drenched hard-edge canvases that made a splash in the Color Field movement of the 1960's form the bulk of this mini-retrospective, which covers his work from the late 50's to now. The signature 60's work, revealing his association with the group that included Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland, was based on a tricky geometrical scheme involving the interplay of diamonds and diagonals, which he worked with many variations and impressive results. His technique has since become much freer, and in his most recent, more emotive work color seems more important than structure.
GLUECK

Other Galleries

PETER CAINE: 'DOMO ARIGATO, MR. ROBOTO,' Jack the Pelican, 487 Driggs Avenue, Brooklyn, (718)782-0183, through March 27. There is something to offend if not necessarily amuse everyone in Mr. Caine's hyperkinetic exhibition of electronically animated mannequins and crude handmade effigies.

'ANDY MESSERSCHMIDT: HOODWINKERS, FAUXS, IMPOSTORS AND SNAKEOILERS,' Plane Space, 102 Charles Street, West Village, (917)606-1268, through March 27. The deception alluded to in this exhibition's title may reflect that the bright, patterned paintings turn out to be elaborate combinations of doilies, lace, fabric, plus well-placed paint. Their intensely decorative, symmetrical intricacies and occasional excursions into delicate drawing are all a little too current. But 45 watercolor collages, each 10 inches square, while more conservative, suggest that the artist, a 2002 M.F.A. from the University of Minnesota, has other options.

Last Chance

CHINATSU BAN, Marianne Boesky Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)680-9889, closing tomorrow. Brightly colored underpants drift through the air, are worn by little girls and their boxy guardian elephants in the slightly-too-sweet paintings and sculpture with which this talented young Japanese artist is making her New York debut. Possibly demonic apple halves occasionally threaten, and the total effect is of a freshened up mythology. All is enhanced by the artist's delicate but assured painting skills, which suggest an uncanny, intuitive fusion of Color Field painting, Japanese screens, Paul Klee and Indian miniatures.

ALISON FOX, ATM Gallery, 170 Avenue B near 10th Street, East Village, (212)375-0349, closing on Sunday. The clunky abstracted still lifes, pervaded by an interest in the textile arts, that fill this young New York artist's first solo make capable although hardly groundbreaking use of familiar quantities, operating in terrain bordered by Dana Schutz, Jessica Stockholder and the British painter Howard Hodgkin. She is at her best in ham-handed Cubistic works like ''Voodoo Lady'' and ''Johanna's Party'' whose crowded colors, impastos, wet-on-wet flourishes and overlapping forms seem to cry out for a larger surface. Luckily they seldom get it.
SMITH

ROBERT MORRIS: 'SMALL FIRES AND MNEMONIC NIGHTS,' Leo Castelli, 18 East 77th Street, (212)249-4470, closing tomorrow. The co-founder of Minimalism's surprising new, easel-size encaustic paintings look like they were made by Edward Hopper under the influence of Magritte and de Chirico. Images of nocturnal, moonlit rooms with fires and explosions in the distance convey feelings of loneliness and grief; and images of public sites like "Boys Room" or "Union Station" are like places from the artist's own past revisited in dreams.
JOHNSON

LANE TWITCHELL: 'HERE & THERE,' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, closing tomorrow. Mr. Twitchell continues to produce astoundingly intricate patterns by folding and cutting into sheets of paper as large as six feet square. Close examination discovers all kinds of cultural signifiers and underpainting and overpainting enhance the complication. The only problem is the greasy-looking resin in which the cut-outs are submerged; there must be a better way to preserve and protect Mr. Twitchell's wonderfully delicate and expansive filigree.

JOHN WALKER: 'COLLAGE,' Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550, closing tomorrow. This English artist who now lives in Maine produced the six powerfully imposing Cubist collages featured here while living and teaching in New York in the mid-70's. Each measures 10 by 8 feet and has leathery surfaces of painted, irregularly cut-up pieces of canvas. Today they seem old fashioned, even a little academic. Still, the rumbling, viscerally physical energy they exude remains exciting.

HEADLINE: At A.I.G., It Seems Chief's Departure Was Exaggerated

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Just days after Maurice R. Greenberg stepped down as chief executive of the American International Group, he continues to hold a powerful sway over the management of the insurance giant.
 Mr. Greenberg's unusual control stems largely from his role as a top executive of two related, private entities, C.V. Starr and the Starr International Company. As a result, he holds the reins over the vehicles that dole out compensation to A.I.G. executives. Mr. Greenberg is also still chairman of Starr Foundation, one of the nation's largest private foundations, which makes contributions to organizations and charities run by the company's directors. 
 Mr. Greenberg still has ''an inordinate amount of control for an ousted C.E.O.,'' said Gerald Silk, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann who specializes in litigating shareholder class-action cases on behalf of investors.
 With shares of A.I.G. down 17 percent since the company disclosed on Feb. 14 that it had received subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general, investors clearly want A.I.G.'s new management and board to demonstrate their independence from Mr. Greenberg. But his continuing control over the two Starr entities makes such independence difficult to achieve.
 ''I think it would be better to make a clean break in terms of trying to re-establish credibility,'' said Kathy Shanley, an analyst with Gimme Credit, an independent research firm that specializes in high-quality corporate bonds. ''Obviously someone new can't begin to establish his own presence and style until he's clearly the one at the helm.''
 Mr. Greenberg retired as chief executive of A.I.G. on Monday, under pressure from regulators who had uncovered a transaction he had struck in 2000 and 2001 that helped bolster A.I.G.'s financial position. Mr. Greenberg, who will turn 80 in May, battled to retain the title of chairman, at least for now. Mr. Greenberg is traveling to Beijing to attend a forum.
 Howard I. Smith, the company's former chief financial officer, also took his leave late Monday.
 Taking over for Mr. Greenberg was Martin J. Sullivan, former co-chief operating officer. But while most companies whose chief executives retire suddenly under pressure make a fresh start with a new management team, Mr. Sullivan and other A.I.G. executives remain much beholden to Mr. Greenberg under the terms of their long-term compensation plan, which he oversees.
 According to filings, since 2001, the amount of long-term compensation allocated to executives of A.I.G. through Starr International totaled $270 million, pretax. And going back to 1999, the long-term compensation allocated to A.I.G. executives in the plan had totaled $440 million, before taxes.
 ''Although it is hard to say how much of that is related to current A.I.G. employees, there appears to be an awful lot of money on the table over in the corner in Bermuda,'' said Brian Foley, a compensation specialist in White Plains. Starr International lists a post office box in Bermuda, but it is registered in Panama, adding to its obscurity.
 Under the terms of the Starr International plan, A.I.G. executives typically do not receive the money that has accrued for them until they retire. If they leave A.I.G. before retiring, they cannot take the money with them. The plan currently has about 700 partners, all A.I.G. executives and managers, according to the company's 2003 annual report. 
 Starr International has A.I.G. stock worth $19 billion that is ''available for future distribution,'' according to the filing. It also says that Starr International has already paid out 2.9 percent of A.I.G. stock to plan participants over the last 28 years.
 Undisclosed to A.I.G. shareholders, Starr International also holds an additional $1.4 billion in A.I.G.'s common stock, according to a person close to the company. The additional stock can be used for purposes other than compensation of plan participants, the person said.
 ''He's more than just the chairman -- he still has a direct impact on the salaries that many of these people take home,'' said Mr. Silk of Bernstein Litowitz. ''That to me means the other directors on the board of A.I.G. need to be very watchful.''
 According to the most recent proxy statement, Mr. Greenberg, Mr. Smith and Mr. Sullivan are directors of Starr International, as is Donald P. Kayak, A.I.G.'s newly appointed chief operating officer. The Starr International board decides who can participate in the plan but Mr. Greenberg holds the purse strings, according to people briefed on the plan. 
 And then there are the contributions made by the Starr Foundation to organizations affiliated with A.I.G. directors. For example, last year's proxy statement noted that the foundation had donated $1.325 million in both 2001 and 2002 to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is headed by Martin S. Feldstein, an A.I.G. director.
 In 2003, Schiff's Insurance Observer, an industry newsletter edited and written by David Schiff, noted that from 1999 to 2001, the Starr Foundation contributed $36.5 million, or 6.6 percent of its grants during that time, to the American Museum of Natural History. Ellen Futter, an A.I.G. director since 1999, is president of the museum.
 C.V. Starr, a low-profile, privately held insurance company that does business with A.I.G., is also a conduit of compensation for its 80 partners, the top executives of the American International Group. Mr. Greenberg is president and chairman of C.V. Starr.
 C.V. Starr is registered in Delaware, and does not disclose details of how it makes money and disperses it. The company pays out benefits quarterly, unlike Starr International.
 One institutional shareholder of A.I.G., the Teachers Retirement System of Louisiana, has sued the company's board members in Delaware Chancery Court, contending that A.I.G. breaches its fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders by engaging in related-party transactions with C.V. Starr and Starr International, and by failing to disclose much information about the two private companies. The board members say both C.V. Starr and Starr International are valuable tools for recruiting executives and that they engage in legitimate business that is of value to A.I.G. shareholders.
 Still, there is little public information available about the two affiliates. What happens to directors like Mr. Greenberg when they are no longer officers of A.I.G. -- presumably covered in the bylaws of Starr International -- is not disclosed. 
 The two entities are also major shareholders of A.I.G. Starr International holds 11.9 percent of the outstanding common stock, or more than 311 million shares, according to filings. Mr. Greenberg has 8.3 percent beneficial ownership of Starr International. He also outright owns 1.74 percent of A.I.G. common stock.
 C.V. Starr owns a 1.8 percent stake. But there is even a further level of control. Half the A.I.G. shares that C.V. Starr owns is held in a trust run by Mr. Greenberg; Mr. Smith, the former chief financial officer; and a third company insider who could not be identified, according to the person close to the company. 
 The trust controls the pace and rate at which Starr benefits are doled out.

HEADLINE: In Shift, Bloomberg Doubles Schools' Capital Spending

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
Facing election-year criticism from parents and public officials, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced plans yesterday to double the amount of money the city will spend this year to repair and improve school buildings. 
 The extra money would bring the city's contribution toward such projects to $2.6 billion in the fiscal year that ends this summer, fending off cuts to projects like building science labs and fixing broken windows.
 In announcing his five-year, $13.1 billion capital plan for the city school system more than a year ago, Mayor Bloomberg had made clear that he was counting on $6.5 billion from the state, which is under a court order to spend more money on city schools. 
 When it became clear, however, that the state money would not be forthcoming -- not now, at least -- Mr. Bloomberg sought to amend the capital plan, delaying those immediate projects that the state would have paid for. Education Department officials, led by Kathleen Grimm, the deputy chancellor for finance and administration, insisted that even if the projects were delayed, all the improvements would eventually take place. 
 But at news conferences and public hearings, City Council members and others noted wryly that pushing projects to Year 6 of a five-year plan amounted to cutting them. 
 Eva S. Moskowitz, chairwoman of the Council's Education Committee, said yesterday: ''That was clearly just a line, a turn of phrase that they had come up with to make it look like it was not a cut.'' 
 The mayor's new plan would not actually raise the city's overall contribution to the five-year plan. Instead, the extra $1.3 billion to be spent in 2004-05 would be taken from the amount the city had planned to spend in the following four years.
 Nonetheless, Ms. Moskowitz welcomed the mayor's change of heart, saying, ''At the end of the day, we can't abandon our kids because Albany is in paralysis.'' She added: ''People change their minds frequently in an election year.''
 In a statement explaining the change, Mr. Bloomberg criticized the state for failing to comply with the court order, which stemmed from a lawsuit filed by a group called the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. 
 ''Albany's failure to fulfill the obligations of the C.F.E. lawsuit should not impact our school children,'' the mayor said. ''While the delays in capital work caused by the state's failure to provide the capital money have been minimal up to now, our children deserve the best facilities we can possibly provide.'' 
 Yesterday, the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, and more than a dozen council members, held a news conference at City Hall to claim credit for pressuring the mayor to make up the shortfall. Mr. Miller, a Democrat seeking to unseat the Republican mayor, also vowed to continue fighting in Albany to secure more state aid for the city's schools. ''Today, we can say that we got a little bit closer to a school system that we can all be proud of,'' he said. 
 C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president and another Democratic mayoral contender, called Mr. Bloomberg's new plan a ''stopgap measure,'' saying through a spokesman, ''The mayor needs to be more aggressive with the Legislature and the governor to make sure that the New York City schools get their fair share of funding.'' 
 Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said the mayor had decided to put more city money toward school repairs this year after recognizing that Albany was more focused on Medicaid than school financing. ''It's not pressure from the City Council or anyone else,'' he said.

HEADLINE: On Texas Coast, a Laboratory for Private Accounts

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex., March 13 

 BODY:
As governor of Texas, George W. Bush had an up-close look at what many advocates of individual Social Security investment accounts consider a laboratory for how such a system might work: Galveston County's retirement system.
 In 1981 officials in Galveston, a seafront city on the Gulf of Mexico opted out of Social Security along with neighboring Brazoria and Matagorda Counties and chose instead to plunge their county governments into the unknown territory of offering private retirement accounts.
 Hundreds of employees in these counties have since retired under the system and more than 4,000 current employees make deposits into their private accounts each month. 
 But there is intense debate over what lessons to draw from Galveston's experience and whether a government retirement system should help adjust income disparities.
 Some prominent retired officials swear by the system, saying it has allowed them to retire richer than if they had stayed with Social Security. 
 ''You basically get back what you put in,'' said Ray Holbrook, 78, a former county judge who retired in 1995. Mr. Holbrook had been an early supporter of the plan.
 Others, mainly retirees with lower income, have found their small nest eggs eroded by inflation or gone altogether after choosing a lump-sum payment instead of monthly checks. 
 ''I don't know what I would do without Social Security,'' said Norma Samuels, 61 , a retired food services manager who took the $22,000 she had put in her account over eight years as a lump-sum payment because her husband had died and amassed unpaid medical bills.
 Ms. Samuels still receives Social Security through survivor's benefits and is waiting to collect her Social Security benefits from a previous job when she turns 65. The Galveston plan also includes survivor and disability benefits that sometimes exceed those of Social Security.
 Still, few of the participants in the plan are explicitly critical of the system, perhaps because many say they feel they have greater control over their investments. Most county employees here also benefit from a separate county pension, which gives them a cushion.
 The Houston investment firm that designed the Galveston plan invests employees' money mostly in safe but low-yielding securities, providing participants with quarterly updates on their investments and the opportunity to withdraw their money in a lump sum upon retirement or in installments over several years.
 ''I have the luxury of completely forgetting about Social Security,'' said Kirk Greene, 42, an information technology manager who began working full time for Galveston County with a salary of about $14,000 a year in 1986, five years after it adopted the system. 
 Mr. Greene said he now had about $120,000 in the Galveston plan in addition to some $130,000 in the county's pension plan. Mr. Greene, who earns about $75,000 a year, said he expected to retire in nine years. 
 ''I'll be going fishing when many of my friends will still be working,'' said Mr. Greene, cherishing his ability to start drawing his money at 51, an option not available under Social Security. ''I feel able to benefit from the money that I myself put in.''
 Under the Galveston plan employees put about 6.1 percent of their salaries into their accounts, roughly the same as the 6.2 percent withdrawn from most workers' paychecks for Social Security. In addition, the three county governments then pay about 7.7 percent of employees' salaries, slightly higher than the 6.2 percent deposited in Social Security by most employers. 
 The majority of the plan's money is invested in annuities, financial securities sold by insurance companies that provide fairly predictable rates of return. The exception is in Brazoria County. Some employees there are smarting after losses in their accounts because of an investment option, created around the time of the stock market's peak in 2000, allowing them to put some of their money in stocks with higher risks. Most of those losses have been recuperated in the last few years.
 The insurance company, rather than the plan's participants, pays a management fee of less than 1 percent of the plan's assets. First Financial Benefits of Houston, the creator and administrator of Galveston's plan, estimates that the plan has earned an average of 6.5 percent in annual returns since its inception, though that figure was influenced by the relatively high interest rates of the 1980's. The plan currently returns about 4 percent a year.
 Richard F. Gornto, the president of First Financial Benefits, helped design the plan and said his estimates showed that all retirees would do better financially under the county's plan than they would have under Social Security. But others who have studied the plan and used different assumptions disagree.
 Critics contend that employees with higher incomes do much better than those with lower incomes and that over time the fact that the returns are not indexed for inflation make them a worse deal than Social Security. 
 A study in 1999 by the Social Security Administration, for instance, found that after 20 years of retirement, all of the plan's benefits, even for wealthier retirees, would be lower relative to Social Security.
 Eric R. Kingson, a professor of social work at Syracuse University who has studied the Galveston plan, also says it is a threat to the ''quiet redistribution'' of wealth under Social Security that provides poorer retirees with a higher share of their pre-retirement wages than it does to their richer counterparts. 
 For instance, the study by the Social Security Administration found that married low-income workers retiring in 2045 under the Galveston plan would receive initial benefits equivalent to about 60 percent of Social Security while a single high-income worker would receive payments equivalent to about 140 percent of Social Security.
 In 1983 Congress ended the option of allowing counties to drop out of Social Security but exempted those who had already left it.
 Another study of the Galveston plan, by the Government Accountability Office in 1999, projected that a low-income worker retiring in 2026 after 45 years would receive $1,028 a month under the Galveston plan compared with $1,366 under Social Security. 
 The G.A.O. also found that those with larger incomes did better. A worker with a median income would receive $1,367 a month under Social Security as opposed to $2,024 under the private plan. An employee in a higher income range would receive $1,898 in Social Security compared with $4,089 a month under the Galveston Plan. (The G.A.O. defined a low-income salary as $17,124, median income as $25,596 and high income as $51,263.) 
 Mr. Gornto, of First Financial Benefits, said that if a plan like Galveston's were tried on a national scale, it could always be altered to deal with any problems. He noted that the plan had already made changes to features deemed unwise, recently eliminating the option of hardship withdrawal.
 ''Some people like to see us here in Texas as unsophisticated, with chewing tobacco in our mouths,'' Mr. Gornto said in an interview.
 ''The opposite is true. We can do our own quiet redistribution within the plan if that's needed,'' he said, explaining that a formula could be used to shift some of the plan's resources to poorer retirees.
 For all the debate, participants in the plan tend to have few complaints about returns as long as they know that their accounts are gaining in value.
 ''It's known that we've got one of the best retirements in the law profession in Texas,'' said Robert Dodd, 36, a sheriff's deputy who recently moved to Galveston. 
 A 22-year-old colleague, Dustin Helms, on a cigarette break with him, took that thought a bit further.
 ''Social Security's a joke, and everybody knows it,'' Mr. Helms said. ''By the time I retire it's not going to be around. I might as well stick around here.''

HEADLINE: Workers for U.S. Invest Part of Their Nest Eggs. The Results Vary.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE and RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
Brenda Barnett, an electronics technician for the Federal Aviation Administration in Oklahoma City, offers one model for how Americans may fare under President Bush's plan for private Social Security accounts. 
 Her retirement account, part of the pension system for federal employees, has had an average return of just over 6 percent a year since 1997, achieved through a mixed investment in stocks and Treasury securities. ''On the whole, I've made money, not a ton of money, but enough,'' she said. 
 Jason O'Dell had a much different experience. Mr. O'Dell, 29, went to work for the government in 1999 as a sheet-metal mechanic at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. He joined the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees two years later, put most of his savings in a stock fund, and got caught in the market's steep decline. His account lost nearly 30 percent of its value. 
 The experiences of Ms. Barnett and Mr. O'Dell, who are among two million civilian employees of the federal government enrolled in the thrift plan, show how giving investors control over their retirement savings can have widely varying results. 
 ''It is all very dynamic, and to take this dynamic thing and translate it into actual average returns is impossible,'' said Thomas Trabucco, chief spokesman for the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which administers the accounts. ''You have to go case by case.''
 President Bush holds up the federal savings program as a model for the retirement accounts he wants to add to Social Security. He is counting on those accounts to earn enough to offset the cuts that his plan calls for in the current fixed Social Security pensions.
 The federal thrift plan, however, differs in an essential way from the retirement accounts that the president wants to carve out of Social Security. The thrift accounts are on top of a generous fixed pension for federal employees, while President Bush's proposal envisions the accounts replacing a substantial part of Social Security's fixed pension.
 The thrift system functions like a 401(k)-type plan. Each of the five funds in the plan has done well enough to meet President Bush's minimum goal of an average annual return of 3 percent, adjusted for inflation.
 Over the 18-year life of the plan, even the most conservative fund, invested in Treasury bonds, has returned, on average, 6.6 percent annually before inflation, partly because the fees are kept below what Wall Street charges. (That compares with an annual inflation rate in that period of nearly 3 percent.) Near the high end, a fund that tracks the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had an average return of 12 percent a year.
 The last 18 years, however, are not a template for the future. Nor do the performances of the five funds mirror the actual experiences of individual investors. Whether a federal employee can earn more than Mr. Bush's inflation-adjusted 3 percent a year over a 30-year to 40-year career depends on the mix of investments that the employee chooses and, above all, on a factor beyond anyone's control: the behavior of stocks and bonds. 
 ''The last two decades have been fantastic for the markets, which does not necessarily mean that the next two decades will be as good, or good at all,'' said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School and the author of ''Stocks for the Long Run'' (McGraw-Hill, 2002). 
 Many investors in the thrift accounts have hurt themselves. As stock prices soared in the 1990's, they took money out of government securities and put it into the S.&P. 500-stock index fund. By the year 2000, the stock fund accounted for nearly 64 percent of all investments, up from 6 percent in 1991, the fund's first year. Then, as stocks fell, money flowed back into Treasury bonds. 
 ''We have always known that people tend to put more money into the stock market toward the peak and are scared out when the market starts to drop,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''What they should do is sell stock as the market rises and hold on when it slides. Just buying and holding and not getting scared is a sound plan.''
 The president's calculations also do not address another issue that government officials have raised, which is the danger that a worker approaching retirement with, say, $200,000 in his savings account might suddenly lose 30 percent or 40 percent of that amount in a market plunge and no longer have the time to recover the loss. The S.&P. 500 fund lost 43 percent of its value from 2000 through 2002. 
 ''The real risk is that someone is holding an investment and it goes down at the wrong moment, just as they are approaching retirement,'' said Patrick Purcell, a specialist in social legislation at the Congressional Research Service.
 Under President Bush's proposal, people would be asked, in effect, to take some of their Social Security payroll tax and invest it in the expectation that the return would be enough to offset the money diverted to the private accounts. A smaller return would reduce retirement income below the present level of Social Security pensions.
 Whatever the outcome, adding private accounts does not overcome any benefit cuts that might be imposed to help close the long-term financing gap facing the Social Security system.
 Congress created the Thrift Savings Plan in the 1980's as part of a new retirement system for federal employees similar to private pension plans, which were beginning to change, too. At the time, many companies were offering fixed corporate pensions, which they increasingly supplemented with 401(k) plans. 
 Ms. Barnett, 37, currently contributes 10 percent of her $52,000 salary to her thrift account, and the government, as an incentive, matches the first 5 percent. She could put in as much as 14 percent, but she is divorced, raising two children and her expenses are high. ''The public schools even want you to pay for computer paper,'' she said.
 She considers herself a smart, if cautious, investor. Right now, she has 50 percent of her $39,600 in a Treasury fund and 30 percent in a nearly-as-safe fixed-income bond fund. Only 20 percent is invested in a stock fund, and 10 years before she retires she plans to shift that money into the Treasury fund, she said.
 The thrift investment board applauds that sort of behavior. To encourage it, the board intends to offer later this year a new investment option, called a life-cycle fund. As an investor ages, it automatically shifts the mix from riskier stocks with their potentially higher returns to a safer and steadier investment in government securities. It is also intended to correct for too much caution when workers are young. 
 Too much money channeled into Treasury securities defeats a goal of the accounts that Mr. Bush is proposing. The Social Security Administration already invests its payroll tax revenue in Treasury bonds. The retirement accounts in a changed Social Security system are supposed to beat the return on these ultrasafe investments to justify the risk. 
 Richard Strombotne, a 71-year-old former physicist who worked for the Transportation Department in Washington, was earning in the low six figures when he retired in 1996 with more than $150,000 in his thrift account. But he could have done even better, he says. Through all the years of saving, Mr. Strombotne kept the money in the Treasury fund, not thinking interest rates would stay so low or stocks would do so well. 
 ''I am a Depression baby and a conservative investor for the most part,'' he said, ''and after the stock market crash in 1987, it certainly would make you cautious about investing in stocks.''
 By contrast, Mr. O'Dell put much of his money in a stock fund. From 2001 to 2003, he contributed 10 percent of his annual salary, which is now $41,000. But the legal expenses of a custody battle for his 9-year-old son overwhelmed him and he stopped saving, after putting away more than $10,000, including the government match. The balance today is only $7,545, all of it in the stock fund.
 ''With me being my age, I think I'll leave the money in the stock fund,'' Mr. O'Dell said.
 Still another issue in setting up private Social Security accounts is resistance to change. Mr. Bush's proposals would allow people to stay with the present system or switch to his new mix of a fixed pension supplemented by a private account. Federal employees were offered a similar choice in 1987. They had the option to stay with the old Civil Service Retirement System or shift to the new one, with its mix of fixed pension and thrift savings. 
 More than 97 percent declined to switch, among them Edwin Dean, a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics earning in the low six figures. The old system offered larger fixed pensions for higher-income workers, including Mr. Dean. If they had made the switch, they would have had to make up the difference through the thrift savings accounts. 
 ''The point that I made to myself is that you ought to have a substantial core pension, and I was not going to take a chance on jeopardizing that core retirement income,'' Mr. Dean, 71 and now retired, said. 
 The resistance to switching reflected a cautiousness common to many investors. ''We've discovered in behavioral economics that people don't want to get rich with their retirement money,'' said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at the University of Notre Dame. ''They just want it to be there.''
 Jonathan Frenkel, 39, an official in the Department of Homeland Security, said he winced when he reviewed his thrift statements in recent years. ''It's tough when you get your statements and the returns are negative,'' Mr. Frenkel said.
 He has been putting 10 percent of his earnings into the plan since joining the government in 1998. He started out with 90 percent of his savings in the S.&P. 500 stock fund and decided to diversify, shifting some money out of that fund as the stock market declined, and investing in both the Treasury fund and in a fund specializing in small-capitalization stocks. 
 In Mr. Frenkel's view, the results could have been much worse. ''Outside the plan,'' he said, ''I invested in individual stocks, and they have all taken a dive.''

HEADLINE: Congressman From Ohio Is Chosen For Trade Post

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
President Bush announced on Thursday that he had selected Representative Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who is one of his closest friends in Congress, to be the next United States trade representative.
 Mr. Portman, a former international trade lawyer and one of the few Republican leaders in the House who works well with Democrats, was hailed as a strong choice by lawmakers of both parties and by many trade groups.
 In making his announcement in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Mr. Bush referred to Mr. Portman as a ''good friend, a decent man and a skilled negotiator.'' 
 Then the president listed the ''bold agenda'' facing Mr. Portman if he is confirmed by the Senate -- among the objectives, winning passage of new regional trade agreements and negotiating a global treaty that could require a reduction in farm subsidies.
 Mr. Portman said that he, too, believed that ''open markets and better trade relations were key components to a more peaceful, a more stable and a more prosperous world.''
 With the United States trade deficit at record levels -- it reached $617 billion in 2004 -- even Mr. Portman's friends say that he will need to use all his skills to win approval of new trade agreements from a Congress that is increasingly skeptical about the administration's stance that more trade deals will help reduce the deficit.
 An Ohio Democrat, Representative Marcy Kaptur, expressed delight that another Ohioan had been chosen for the trade position, but said she was concerned that he was ''inheriting an absolute mess.''
 ''I hope he is true to his state and negotiates trade agreements that raise our standard of living,'' she said in an interview, ''but we have never had worse trade deficits or more questions about the consequences of trade.''
 Republicans seemed happy with the announcement, especially because it helped shift the focus in Congress away from the president's nomination of Paul D. Wolfowitz to head the World Bank, a choice that was criticized by many Democrats.
 ''I don't know if this was planned or not, but Rob's nomination couldn't have come at a better time,'' a Republican lawmaker who spoke on condition of anonymity said.
 Mr. Portman will succeed Robert B. Zoellick, who left the post nearly a month ago to become deputy secretary of state. In the meantime, foreign trade leaders, including Peter Mandelson, the top European Union trade official, have expressed worry that without an American negotiator in place, trade talks would falter.
 Supachai Panitchpakdi, director general of the World Trade Organization, had even traveled to Washington last week in hope of engaging the critical stage of current global trade talks with a new American representative.
 From his office in Geneva, Mr. Supachai said that he warmly welcomed the president's announcement and ''very much'' looked forward to working with Mr. Portman.
 Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, has worked more closely with Mr. Portman than many Republicans. He said his old friend, a fellow member of the Ways and Means Committee and the other sponsor of the Portman-Cardin pension reform laws, will have to start at running speed.
 ''You couldn't have a person with a better relationship with Congress and the president,'' Mr. Cardin said. ''He is ideal but that doesn't diminish the issues, which are huge.'' 
 Mr. Cardin and Republican lawmakers emphasized Mr. Portman's reputation as a sincere, decent negotiator who manages to gain passage of legislation with support from both parties and in a more open fashion than is usual on Capitol Hill.
 ''He doesn't come from a law firm or a large company or some other government agency,'' said Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who often works closely with Mr. Portman. ''He comes from Congress where he represented an Ohio constituency with manufacturing and agriculture. I like the idea of a guy like that at the table who understands our constituents.''
 Unlike many predecessors, Mr. Portman has a working knowledge of Spanish and French, which he spoke in Latin America and Brussels negotiating trade deals as a private lawyer.
 But it was his standing at the White House that propelled him to this new position. A friend of Mr. Bush for 17 years, Mr. Portman is credited with helping the president win Ohio's 20 electoral votes in a close contest in November. He is on a first-name basis with Karl Rove, now deputy chief of staff for policy at the White House, and Joshua B. Bolten, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who regularly consult him on domestic issues. 
 Mr. Portman served on the White House staff of the first President George Bush and was elected to Congress in 1993. He was an early stalwart of the current president's 2000 campaign, where he became a bridge for bringing together warring Republicans from his state.
 Lawmakers said he would need the president's confidence if he was to recreate a bipartisan trade policy in the face of the ballooning deficit. His first test will be this spring when he tries to win Congressional approval for the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Most Democrats and some Republicans have raised serious objections to the deal, which touched off increasingly violent protests this week in Guatemala, where some fear that the trade agreement will hurt poor people in their country.
 Willis D. Gradison Jr., Mr. Portman's predecessor in Congress from Ohio's Second District, said he had no doubt that Mr. Portman would be an outstanding trade representative. For one thing, he never forgets his friends.
 ''Rob called me first thing this morning and left me a message,'' he said. ''He wanted to make sure I knew before the White House announcement.''

HEADLINE: The Do-Nothing Conspiracy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If you want an image that captures what American politics will be like over the next few decades, imagine two waves crashing down upon us simultaneously, each magnifying the damage caused by the other. 
 The first wave is the exploding cost of the entitlement programs. The second wave is the ever-increasing polarization of the political class. The polarization will make it impossible to reach an agreement on how to fix the entitlements problem. Meanwhile the vicious choices forced on us by entitlement costs will make the polarization even worse. 
 The realities of the first wave -- the looming fiscal crisis -- are pretty well known. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will consume 14 percent of national output in 2030 and 21 percent in 2075 -- up from about 8 percent today. Partly as a result, the federal government will have to come up with an extra $50 trillion just to pay for the promises it's made as of today. 
 To cover these costs, federal officials will have several options, all of them horrible. If they acted immediately, according to the economists Kent Smetters and Jagadeesh Gokhale, they could increase federal income taxes by 78 percent; they could double payroll taxes; they could cut Social Security and Medicare in half; or they could do some combination. 
 Tax increases on that scale would decimate the economy. Benefit cuts would cause pain. Doing nothing would lead to enormous deficits, an immobilized government and stratospheric interest rates. It would mean the end of the United States as a great economic power.
 The realities of the second destructive wave -- polarization -- are also widely recognized. They can be measured by the increase in party-line voting in Congress, the bitter political atmosphere in Washington, the political segmentation of media outlets and the emergence of rigid donor and activist bases in each party that use their power to inflict Stalinist party-line orthodoxy on potentially independent leaders. 
 We're seeing polarization in action in the Social Security debate. It's a straightforward problem compared with Medicare, but Congress is deadlocked. We see polarization in action in the looming fight over judges, which is producing talk about nuclear options and threats to shut down the Senate. A political class that can't make a deal on a few judges is not going to be able to cooperate when it comes to filling a $50 trillion hole.
 Over the next several years, the parties will differ violently over what to do about the entitlement problem while doing very little to actually address it. This past Thursday the Senate even rejected a proposal that would have made a sliver of a trim in the growth of Medicaid. 
 But over time, the entitlements crisis will begin to transform politics. The parties will grow less cohesive. The Democrats are held together by the common goal of passing domestic programs that address national needs -- like covering the uninsured. But with all the money going to cover entitlements, there will be no way to afford new proposals. Republicans, meanwhile, owe their recent victories to the popularity of tax cuts. But those will be impossible, too. Both parties will lose a core reason for being.
 At the same time, Americans will grow even more disenchanted with the political status quo. Not only will there be a general distaste for the hyperpartisan style, but people will also begin to see how partisan brawling threatens the nation's prosperity. They'll read more books like ''The Coming Generational Storm'' by Laurence Kotlikoff and Scott Burns and ''Running on Empty'' by Peter Peterson. They will be more aware of the looming disaster. As the situation gets worse, the prospects of change get better, because Americans will not slide noiselessly into oblivion.
 The party alignments have been pretty stable over the past few generations, but there's no reason to think they will be in the future. The Whig Party died. The Progressive movement arose because the parties seemed stagnant a century ago. I wouldn't be surprised if some anti-politician emerged -- of the Schwarzenegger or Perot varieties -- to crash through the current alignments and bust heads.
 I wouldn't be surprised if many of today's politicians decided to reorient their careers. I meet too many who are quietly alarmed by the looming fiscal catastrophe and who know that if their party doesn't tackle this problem, it simply won't be relevant to the issue that will dominate politics for years to come.

HEADLINE: Russian Denies War Games With China Are a Signal to Taiwan

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 18 

 BODY:
Yuri Baluyevsky, Russia's top general, outlined plans with Chinese officials this week for the first joint military exercises between the countries and played down concerns that they could further aggravate rising regional tensions.
 General Baluyevsky, speaking Thursday during the first day of his four-day China visit, said the war games reflected the countries' shared desire to develop closer strategic military ties and were ''not targeted at any third country,'' according to Chinese state news media.
 He also denied a report in the Russian press that China hoped to use the games as a training exercise to simulate a military action against Taiwan. 
 The general's visit began three days after China passed a so-called antisecession law that could authorize Chinese leaders to begin a military attack if they believed that Taiwan had moved too far toward independence.
 The United States, Taiwan and Japan have criticized the law as unnecessary and provocative at a time when relations between China and Taiwan appear to have been warming. But Russia's ambassador in Beijing told the official Chinese news media that his country welcomed the law as a tool to maintain peace.
 The military exercises with Russia are part of a growing effort by China to improve its armed forces by conducting operations with other nations. Last year, China and India conducted a limited joint naval exercise. China has also held exercises with Pakistan.
 Robert Karniol, an Asia expert with Jane's Defense Weekly, said, ''The Chinese have become much more comfortable with the idea of multilateral solutions, and to having foreign troops on their territory.'' 
 China's military modernization, financed by annual double-digit increases in government spending, is the subject of growing concern in the United States and Japan. The war games with Russia are scheduled for the second half of the year on a peninsula that juts off China's northeastern coast into the Yellow Sea, state media reported. 
 The scope appears to be limited, with the official Chinese press reporting that each side would have only 100 participants. Yet the same reports noted that the exercises would be a coordinated operation involving the each country's military forces. 
 ''Russian paratroopers, marines and other forces will take part in the exercise,'' the Russian general told the state media.
 The exercises were announced in December and are part of a broader cooperative effort by Russia and China. On Monday, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China said at a news conference, ''In recent years, Chinese-Russian relations have had their best-ever period in history.''
 But Shi Yinhong, an expert on international relations at People's University in Beijing, said that the image of growing closeness should not be overstated.
 ''There are people, mostly outside the military, who want to depict this as part of a new strategic partnership,'' Dr. Shi said. ''But I think, on the contrary, the relationship is much more complicated than this outward image of strategic cooperation.''
 Indeed, China's economic rise has engendered the same envy and wariness in Russia as it has in other Asian nations. Russia has chosen not to run a planned oil pipeline to China, instead choosing one to the Sea of Japan that is favored by Japan. And this week, China's Foreign and Commerce Ministries criticized the Russian police for confiscating $9.7 million worth of shoes from Chinese traders in Moscow.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Unexpectedly Falls

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence unexpectedly declined this month, and import prices rose in February as oil surged and drove up the cost of gasoline.
 The University of Michigan's preliminary index dropped to 92.9, the third consecutive decline and the lowest since November, from 94.1 in February, yesterday's report showed. 
 Import prices rose 0.8 percent last month, including the biggest gain in foreign petroleum costs since October, the Labor Department said.
 The higher prices reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark overnight bank lending rate next week, the seventh consecutive increase since June, to head off faster inflation. The Fed is expected to raise the rate a quarter of a percentage point, to 2.75 percent.
 Imported petroleum prices rose 3.9 percent in February; compared with February 2004, the cost of petroleum was up almost 30 percent. Excluding oil, the monthly index rose 0.2 percent.
 Crude oil prices have risen for a sixth consecutive week and settled at $56.72 a barrel yesterday.

HEADLINE: Oil Wealth Wasting Away in Indonesia

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: BALONGAN, Indonesia 

 BODY:
Roaring all day from the top of a chimney at a state-owned refinery here, a 30-foot-high roiling column of orange flames spewed vast clouds of black smoke visible for miles around. A 12-year-old compressor had broken down, refinery officials explained, and huge quantities of valuable propylene were being burned off for safety reasons.
 Indonesia's oil industry, like the refinery, has been burning money for years, squandering the nation's mineral wealth through underinvestment, bureaucracy, corruption and a wariness of multinational companies.
 So few new wells have been drilled in the last decade that annual production has dropped by more than a third. And the draining of existing fields has brought Indonesia, one of the oldest members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, to the ignominy of having to import oil in the last four months of 2004. 
 As OPEC struggles with how to respond to oil prices rising above $56 a barrel, Indonesia's failure is more than just a tragedy for a poor developing country that has failed to take advantage of a potential windfall. As OPEC's only Asian member, Indonesia should be ideally positioned to meet soaring demand from China and the rest of Asia.
 Instead, its increasingly meager output has forced officials in Beijing and other Asian capitals to look farther afield, relying more on pariah states like Sudan and bringing more oil through the Strait of Malacca, where pirates have been preying on tankers and where governments worry increasingly about possible terrorist attacks. Now, Indonesian officials say they are determined to make their country an exporter again. They have raised prices and cut subsidies for gasoline and diesel to discourage waste. They have passed new laws and tax policies to encourage multinational companies to invest.
 And while populists are calling for Indonesia to withdraw from OPEC, in part to save nearly $2 million a year in membership fees, Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the country's oil minister and the holder of OPEC's rotating presidency in 2004, has been holding them off by setting up a committee to study the issue and promising a brighter future for Indonesia's oil industry.
 ''Indonesia is expecting to produce more oil in the future,'' Mr. Purnomo said. ''Even if we become a net importer for one year, or less than one year, what does it mean?" 
 A turnaround may not be so easy, though, and Indonesia's subsidies are especially ruinous. Because of them, Indonesians have been burning cheap fuel by the tankful, contributing to urban sprawl and traffic jams in Jakarta that rival those in Los Angeles. 
 At the same time, factories rely heavily on diesel generators. The electricity from the generators would be more costly than electricity from coal-fired power plants if diesel fuel were not subsidized. 
 The question is whether Indonesia is doing enough. While new laws and tax rules have been passed, regulations that would put them into effect have not been issued.
 More seriously, a 29 percent increase in retail gasoline and diesel prices on Feb. 28 still leaves both fuels selling for less than $1 a gallon. And the price increase assumed that oil would cost $35 a barrel in 2005. This means that the subsidies, which absorbed one-sixth of government spending in 2005, will cost even more. 
 "It's going to have a huge impact,'' said Ramesh Subramaniam, the principal economist for Indonesia at the Asian Development Bank. 
 Already, the 29 percent increase has provoked large street demonstrations and even fistfights on the floor of Parliament. The political debate in Indonesia now is over whether to roll back the increase or simply form a committee to study whether to roll it back. Further increases in fuel prices are no longer even under public discussion. 
 Mr. Purnomo said in an interview that he hoped to reverse a slide in production, which fell to 950,000 barrels a day late in 2004 from 1.6 million barrels a day in 1991. Mr. Purnomo said that he expected production to rebound to at least one million barrels a day and stay there. 
 OPEC rules require that members be exporters of crude oil, but do not specify what happens if a country temporarily becomes an importer. Mr. Purnomo said that he had an understanding with OPEC that Indonesia would be given a chance to resume exports, with no deadline set; OPEC officials declined to comment.
 The scale of Indonesia's troubles, in energy terms and in environmental terms, can best be seen in its oil fields and refineries. Here in Balongan, the huge refinery run by Pertamina, the state-owned oil company, towers over a small Javanese fishing village. Young men sit on the decks of dozens of 25-foot wooden boats in the mouth of a muddy river, mending fishing nets.
 Oil spills from the oceanfront refinery have severely depleted local stocks of fish. Warnipan, a 40-year-old with three grandchildren, said that a recent two-night trip with three other fishermen brought in only 73 pounds of fish, a third of their previous normal catches.
 After costs for food, fuel and the large chunk of their catch they owe the boat owner, the sailors found they had earned 50 cents each on the trip. ''Sometimes we can't catch any fish at all,'' said Mr. Warnipan, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
 The problem for Indonesia's oil production is that few people have the education and training to take jobs in Pertamina's nearby oil fields or refineries. So, while there is great demand in the oil industry, large numbers of unemployed young men loiter here and in neighboring communities of northern Java. As for women workers, despite the oil wealth under the ground here, this region has become best known as a source for desperately poor prostitutes for Jakarta's many brothels.
 Pertamina executives did not respond to more than a dozen phone calls and faxes requesting interviews. Pertamina's refinery managers said that there had been problems in the past but that they were planning to improve environmental safety, and they cautioned that overfishing and other factors might have also affected fish stocks. 
 The managers also said that they hoped to build a concrete platform soon to prevent leakage from thousands of aging barrels holding toxic catalysts and other materials. The barrels currently sit in piles directly on the dirt, a practice avoided at refineries in industrialized countries.
 Pertamina has been slow to look for new oil fields on its own even as older fields run dry. Multinational companies are wary of investing, troubled less by the terrorism that produced the bombing in Bali and the recent attacks in Jakarta than by the political unrest that accompanied the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 and by recent contract disputes with the government in Jakarta.
 Indonesia ''has been relying pretty much on early 90's investment in oil and gas,'' said Thomas L. Soulsby, a director of PT Energi Mega Persada, a publicly traded Indonesian oil company. ''Committees sitting in Houston, London or even Sydney decided to put their investment dollars elsewhere, and Indonesia really suffered.''
 This part of northern Java has only one of Indonesia's large oil fields. But while local residents have complaints about the operation, at least the field and refinery here have been developed.
 Exxon Mobil found a large oil field in eastern Java at Cepu more early in this decade, in an area where Pertamina and other companies had failed to find oil. Exxon Mobil geologists re-examined old data and then drilled deeper wells than anyone had tried before, finding oil in quantities that could increase Indonesia's annual output by a fifth.
 But production has yet to begin as the Indonesian government, seeking a greater share of the revenue, has tried to renegotiate the terms of Exxon Mobil's contract, which runs until 2010. 
 The most important step Indonesia can take to attract investment is to have clear rules for contracts, said Maman Budiman, the vice president for planning, commercial and public affairs at Exxon Mobil Oil Indonesia.
 Developing oil fields in Indonesia is expensive, making energy companies leery of signing away too much of the revenue once production begins. The Cepu deposits are unusually deep, four miles underground, and industry officials say that other deposits in Indonesia may be similarly deep.
 ''When you combine tough production-sharing terms with government uncertainty, the big players are reluctant,'' said Jeff Brown, an oil analyst at the International Energy Agency in Paris. ''Typically, they have to get better terms to produce in harsh environments.''

HEADLINE: Police Say Man Abused 7 Children at Former Home

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE; Ann Farmer in Queens and Angela Macropoulos in West Hempstead contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
An unemployed mechanic who moved last month to Long Island with his family was arrested yesterday and charged with raping and sodomizing seven children in his former neighborhood in College Point, Queens, the authorities said.
 Queens prosecutors said the suspect, Michael Flory, 48, of West Hempstead, N.Y., was charged with the sexual assaults of five girls and two boys, ages 7 to 11. The police said some victims lived near and played in the house Mr. Flory had shared with his wife; their 4-year-old daughter; and two other children they raised since birth, the 11-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter of the sister of Mr. Flory's wife. 
 The authorities said they were investigating whether Mr. Flory had abused his own daughter and two stepchildren and whether his wife was aware of the molestation. Her children remain in her care. 
 The authorities also said that while the family lived in the first floor of the College Point home for at least five years before moving to West Hempstead, Mr. Flory had also lived in Whitestone, Queens; East Orange, N.J.; and Danbury, Conn. They said they were circulating Mr. Flory's picture in those communities to see if he had abused other children. 
 He was scheduled to be arraigned last night.
 Neighbors of Mr. Flory in both the College Point and West Hempstead communities described him as an affable man, generous with his time. He went to church, fixed friends' cars for free, and offered to take children to the park, his neighbors said.
 ''He was the good neighbor, the neighbor who would take the kids to school, the neighbors whose children played with other people's children,'' said Deputy Inspector Ann Marie Connell, who oversees the police Special Victims Division. 
 She said that Mr. Flory had no criminal record and that the family had no known history with city agencies. Anthony Reyes, who lived two doors from the Flory family in College Point, described the suspect as ''a standup kind of guy.'' 
 ''I've never seen him in a sexual way with boys,'' Mr. Reyes said. ''I've never even seen him carrying his own kids.'' 
 Prosecutors said the abuse dated back at least a year and took place mainly in the Flory home in College Point or in a van parked outside. 
 A law enforcement official said each child was abused more than once.
 Investigators said they became aware of the sexual abuse on Thursday when two victims, a 7-year-old girl and her 10-year-old brother, told their parents, who called the police and alerted other parents whose children had played at the Flory home. The police arrested Mr. Flory just after midnight Thursday at the West Hempstead house where he and his family had moved a few weeks ago after being evicted from the College Point home. 
 He was taken to a station house in Queens where, the police said, he gave both oral and written confessions, and expressed little regret about his actions. ''He thinks it's O.K.,'' said Paul J. Browne, deputy commissioner for public information for the Police Department. ''No remorse.''
 One of Mr. Flory's neighbors, Tina Porcari, 73, said he and his family had lived rent-free for several months after their landlord, who had lived upstairs in the same house, died in July. The landlord's daughter had to take Mr. Flory to court to evict the family, she said, describing Mr. Flory as ''a taker -- take, take, take -- from the system and everything else.'' 
 In West Hempstead, where a yellow ''Children at Play'' sign is just down the street from Mr. Flory's new home, neighbors said they were glad he was arrested soon after moving there. One woman, who said her 11-year-old son had played with Mr. Flory's stepson just last week, was shocked. 
 ''I'm devastated,'' said the woman, who lives one block from the Flory family and asked not to be identified because of the nature of the charges. ''I'm shaken.''

HEADLINE: The Irish Peace Process

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The fury of ''Bullies of Belfast'' (editorial, March 12) is hard to fathom. You have seized on a murder committed by drunken members of the Irish Republican Army to unfairly mock its leader, Gerry Adams, and what remains of the Irish peace process. The references to ''a wave of crimes,'' ''growing fear and despair'' and cover-ups provided juice but not justice. 
 The disbanding of the I.R.A. is effectively provided for in the 1998 Belfast agreement. Why is it unmentioned in this editorial? You claim that there is ''dancing around the promise to begin formal disarmament'' by I.R.A. and Sinn Fein leaders. The destruction of I.R.A. weapons began four years ago under Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada. But Britain and its loyalist allies cannot abide a peace process that would end the military and economic subsidy of the North. The International Monitoring Commission was created last year to bring the demilitarization process to a halt.
 Using tragedy to score cheap political points in this conflict is frequent and despicable. The murder of Robert McCartney has started a media frenzy. But it brings no comfort to those who mourn and want London and Dublin to restore a functioning democracy, justice and the rule of law.

HEADLINE: Senate Budget Shows Signs Of G.O.P. Strain With Bush

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Richard W. Stevenson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
In its last-minute flurry of votes before approving a budget Thursday night, the Senate added $5.4 billion in education spending for 2006 -- just one more sign, members of both parties said on Friday, that President Bush could not get all he wanted on Capitol Hill despite the strengthened Republican majority.
 Mr. Bush had sought to impose strict spending restraints on lawmakers, and the weeklong budget debate was a test of his strength on Capitol Hill. The $2.57 trillion Senate budget resolution, which differs sharply from the budget passed by the House, gave Mr. Bush much of what he asked for: tax cut extensions, a provision allowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, cuts in farm subsidies and reductions in the growth of some entitlement programs. 
 But on some key votes, enough Senate Republicans joined Democrats to defy the president. In a blow to Mr. Bush, the Senate stripped from the budget all $14 billion in proposed spending cuts in Medicaid. Senators also restored $2 billion in cuts to a popular urban renewal program and approved the extra money for education, to help middle-class families pay for college.
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who offered the education amendment, said the vote, coupled with the Senate's decision on Medicaid, indicated that Republicans were uneasy about cutting social programs too deeply.
 ''On issues in education and health and investment, there is a concern that the administration is going too far,'' Mr. Kennedy said. 
 But a senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the White House was pleased over all. In a statement released Thursday night, President Bush praised the House's budget, which closely resembles his own. On Friday, the administration official said that in the Senate, ''there were some good developments, the most important being that they passed the budget resolution.''
 This official added: ''We've demonstrated that we have the votes or are within a couple of votes of what we need. If you have only one or two votes to make up, that's not a bad place to be.''
 The competing budgets passed by the House and Senate raised questions about whether the two versions could be reconciled into one document that both chambers would approve. In an interview Friday, Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, seemed reluctant to make any predictions.
 ''Clearly, there's some fairly significant differences to resolve,'' Mr. Gregg said, ''but we're all on the same team, hopefully.''
 The budget resolution sets tax and spending guidelines, but Congress has been unable to pass a budget for two of the last three years. This year, passing one is essential for the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill. With the federal deficit at a record high, President Bush and Republicans have campaigned on a theme of fiscal responsibility, and failure to pass a budget resolution would be an embarrassment to the White House and Congress.
 At the same time, there will be real consequences for the Republican agenda. The budget provides procedural protections that enable lawmakers to adopt the tax-cut extensions, reduce entitlement spending and open the Arctic refuge to oil drilling without the threat of a filibuster in the Senate. If the budget does not pass, those measures are all but doomed.
 Finally, the budget sets limits on spending that cannot be exceeded without a 60-vote majority in the Senate. The last time Congress passed a budget, for 2004, it included caps for two years. Now the caps are about to expire; the 2006 budget will renew them for three years.
 One of the debate's most surprising twists came when the Senate, by a vote of 55 to 45, approved $64 billion in added tax cuts, a measure intended to repeal a 1993 law taxing 85 percent of Social Security benefits for individuals who earn more than $34,000 and couples earning more than $44,000. Afterward, some senators seemed confused about what they had voted on.
 Mr. Gregg said the repeal of the Social Security tax was not likely to survive the House-Senate conference. He said senators regarded it as ''a message amendment,'' intended to signal that they oppose the tax. 
 Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota was among the Republicans supporting Democrats on some issues. He backed Mr. Kennedy's education amendment, led the effort to restore urban development money and opposed drilling in the refuge. But he voted for the final budget.
 ''In the end,'' Mr. Coleman said, ''the most important vote is the last vote.''

HEADLINE: Russian and European Leaders Discover Common Ground on Lebanon and Iran

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: PARIS, March 18 

 BODY:
The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Spain gathered for an informal meeting here on Friday and issued a joint statement urging Syria to withdraw troops and security services from Lebanon. They also said they were united in their desire to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 
 The meeting, preceded by a lunch between President Jacques Chirac of France and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was meant partly to bolster Russian-European Union relations and overcome growing unease with Mr. Putin's increasingly authoritarian governance. Recent restrictions on the Russian news media and increasing economic recentralization, in particular, have raised concerns in Europe. 
 The United States has already made its concerns known. At a meeting between the Russian leader and President Bush last month in Bratislava, Slovakia, Mr. Bush reportedly rebuked Mr. Putin behind closed doors and then gently chided him in public.
 But the dynamics are somewhat different in Europe: France, Germany and Spain appear more willing to overlook Russia's blemishes in favor of stronger relations that might serve to strengthen their hand with the United States later on. 
 Though there is growing American unease with Russia over Iran, which is developing a nuclear power capability with Russian help, no friction was apparent on Friday. 
 ''There's no contradiction between the Russian position and the position that England, Germany and France are trying to negotiate,'' Mr. Chirac said at a news conference after the meeting. France and Germany, together with Britain and the European Union, are trying to dissuade Iran from pursuing technology that would make it capable of building nuclear weapons. 
 Russia has signed an agreement to supply Iran with low-enriched uranium for its reactors that requires Iran to return all of the spent fuel, preventing them from enriching it to weapons grade or reprocessing it to recover weapons-grade plutonium. 
 The leaders at the meeting on Friday also found common ground on lifting the European Union embargo on arms sales to China, a move that the United States strongly opposes. Russia is China's main arms supplier, and Mr. Putin said that while he would not welcome the competition, he said he was sure Russia and Europe could work together in the Chinese arms market. 
 Mr. Chirac's lunch with Mr. Putin, without support staff or note-takers, according to the Elysee Palace press office, was the venue for Mr. Chirac to be most frank about European apprehensions. But whatever was said was left discreetly behind closed doors. ''We evoked all of the problems that are the order of the day between our two countries,'' was all Mr. Chirac would said say about the meeting. 
 Mr. Putin's meeting with Mr. Chirac, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany was as much one of reassurance that he was welcome in Europe than of communicating concern. In a sign that Russia is still in the club, Mr. Chirac took Mr. Putin on a tour of the heart of French air defenses 20 miles northwest of Paris. The tour was in reciprocation for an April 2004 visit to Russia's Krasnoznamensk space flight control center.
 Mr. Putin also said he would work for stability in Ukraine, where Moscow's initial opposition to the election of Viktor A. Yushchenko as president brought international criticism. He will visit the country on Saturday for the first time since Mr. Yushchenko came to power.

PERSON: Sol Myron Linowitz

HEADLINE: Sol M. Linowitz Dies at 91; Businessman and Diplomat

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

 BODY:
Sol M. Linowitz, a confidant of Democratic presidents who became renowned for his achievements in each of his three careers -- lawyer, businessman and diplomat -- died yesterday at his home in Washington. He was 91. 
 His death was reported by his family.
 A courtly and graceful figure on the Washington scene for nearly four decades, Mr. Linowitz was one of the handful of people who truly fit the description ''wise man,'' applied to those in Washington whose counsel was regularly sought by presidents, senators and others in power. Among the complex jobs he filled were negotiator for the Panama Canal treaties and special presidential envoy for the Middle East. 
 When he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998, President Bill Clinton told the White House audience that getting ''advice from Sol Linowitz on international diplomacy is like getting trumpet lessons from the angel Gabriel.'' 
 As a young lawyer and businessman he achieved acclaim as a principal developer of the Xerox Corporation and he became its chairman. His first call from the White House seeking advice came from President John F. Kennedy. Senator Robert F. Kennedy also consulted Mr. Linowitz and once urged him to run for governor of New York. Mr. Linowitz later said that he did not like the idea of asking people to vote for him, especially since he had no great quarrel with the state's leadership under the incumbent Republican he would have to challenge, Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
 Mr. Linowitz over the years became a trusted counsel to Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter before he served in that role for Mr. Clinton. Although most of his years in Washington were as a private lawyer, he was often called upon to take on delicate diplomatic tasks.
 He served in the government as a lawyer in the Office of Price Administration during World War II, but he was first lured to a senior policy post by President Johnson who made him the United States representative to the Organization of American States, the international organization that was the principal conclave for Washington to deal with Latin America. 
 For Mr. Linowitz, his term at the O.A.S. from 1966 to 1969 was the beginning of an involvement for the remainder of his life with the region's political and economic issues and its relations with the United States.
 His autobiography, ''The Making of a Public Man'' (Little Brown, 1985), recounted several anecdotes of President Johnson at his cajoling and bullying best. He noted that when Mr. Johnson obliquely criticized him in front of several cabinet members early in his tenure, he sought a private conversation in which he told the president that he would resign if that happened again.
 Mr. Linowitz wrote that he had determined that the best way to do his government job was to always believe and let others know that he could ''pick up his marbles and go home.''
 He wrote that President Johnson replied: ''Hell, boy, you're getting upset over nothing.'' After that the president was generally solicitous of him, except for one occasion when Mr. Linowitz told him he thought the Vietnam War was going badly and Mr. Johnson snapped, ''I don't want you to talk to me about that subject.''
 In 1977, President Carter asked Mr. Linowitz to be one of the two negotiators for the Panama Canal treaties with Ellsworth Bunker, who had been ambassador to Vietnam. It was a long political fight and one that earned Mr. Linowitz the unending enmity of many conservatives, notably Jesse Helms, then a Republican senator from North Carolina who led the opposition to turning the canal back to Panama.
 Once driving down Constitution Avenue, Mr. Linowitz saw himself hanging in effigy as part of a protest by conservative opponents of the treaty. He said that to get through what was a particularly painful time he lived by a phrase from ''The Aeneid'' by Virgil, translated as: ''One day it will please us to remember even this.''
 In 1979 he was named special ambassador to the Middle East by President Carter and found himself embroiled in the complex issues, notably Palestinian autonomy, that followed the Camp David peace accords. When he was asked to take the job, he told President Carter that he was uncertain if his heavy involvement in Jewish organizations and causes would be an obstacle. 
 He noted that his predecessors in the position, Robert S. Strauss and Henry A. Kissinger, were Jewish but were more secular. His concerns were largely allayed when he learned that one of his biggest supporters was Ashfraf Gorbal, Egypt's ambassador to Washington. 
 As a lawyer in Rochester, he became friends with Joe Wilson, who owned the Haloid Corporation and who had come across a promising invention called electrophotography. Within a dozen years, they had built a company they called Xerox that changed the way the world did business. 
 The inventor Chester F. Carlson had devised a way to copy documents, and by 1956, Mr. Linowitz, as vice president in charge of patents, obtained all rights to the Carlson invention. 
 Mr. Linowitz was named Xerox's chairman in 1960 and the next year the company's revenue surged to $176 million. By the time he resigned in 1966 to accept President Johnson's ambassadorial appointment, the corporation's annual operating revenue had reached half a billion dollars.
 Mr. Linowitz was a partner in the Coudert Brothers international law firm from 1969 until his retirement in 1994. Over the years, he become something of a preacher to lawyers. In speeches, and eventually a book, he expressed considerable dismay about what he said were the changing mores in the legal profession. His recommendations included fundamental changes in legal education, including greater emphasis on ethics and humanities, some of which were adopted at his own alma mater, Cornell Law School, where he was a trustee.
 He also took an interest in the nation's cities, serving as president of the National Urban League. 
 Mr. Linowitz is survived by his wife, Toni, and by four daughters: June Linowitz of Bethesda, Md.; Anne Mozersky of Ottawa; Jan Linowitz of Wynnewood, Pa.; and Roni Jolles of Great Falls, Va.; and eight grandchildren. Other survivors are three brothers, R. Robert Linowes and David S. Linowes, both of Chevy Chase, Md., and Harry M. Linowes of Bethesda.
 Sol Myron Linowitz was born Dec. 7, 1913, in Trenton to immigrants from Russia. His father was a wholesale fruit merchant who suffered badly in the Depression and never fully recovered. Mr. Linowitz went to Hamilton College, in upstate New York, one of only a handful of Jews at the small liberal arts college. He said that forced him to look more closely at his religious heritage. 
 While at Hamilton, he appeared in college productions and was urged to take up the stage professionally by Alexander Woolcott, then the college's drama director. He helped meet his expenses by playing violin in the Utica Symphony Orchestra and summer dance bands.
 As part of his scholarship he was given a job to read to Elihu Root, the former secretary of state and an alumnus of Hamilton, who had chosen to spend his final years at the college. Root interrupted the reading once to ask what Mr. Linowitz would do when he graduated. Mr. Linowitz said he was considering being either a lawyer or a rabbi.
 ''Become a lawyer,'' Mr. Linowitz said he was told. ''I have found that a lawyer needs twice as much religion as a minister or rabbi.''


CORRECTION-DATE: March 31, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the businessman and diplomat Sol M. Linowitz on March 19 misspelled the surname of a critic and essayist who was an alumnus of Mr. Linowitz's alma mater, Hamilton College, and misstated the man's postgraduate affiliation with it. The alumnus was Alexander Woollcott, not Woolcott. He was visiting the campus when he saw Mr. Linowitz in a student production and urged him to take up the stage professionally; he was not the director of the school's drama program.

HEADLINE: Europe and U.S. Still Deadlocked On Jet Subsidies

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
Government officials said on Friday evening that talks with the European Union had broken down over how to control billions of dollars in subsidies that each accuses the other of giving to its biggest civilian aircraft maker. 
 With three weeks left to negotiate an agreement, Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, said through a spokesman that Washington no longer believed that Europe wanted to give up its subsidies to Airbus, which competes with Boeing in supplying most of the world's large commercial jetliners. 
 ''Despite our best efforts, it is clear that the European Union is unwilling to eliminate launch-aid subsidies,'' Mr. Zoellick said in a statement. Until recently, Mr. Zoellick was the United States trade representative and he has continued to play the lead role in negotiating the issue. 
 The talks broke down, according to the spokesman, during a telephone conversation late Friday afternoon between Mr. Zoellick and Peter Mandelson, the top European trade minister.
 But Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the European Union in Washington, said that Mr. Mandelson was ''completely surprised that such a statement should be given to the press.''
 ''There are clearly difficult issues at stake,'' Mr. Gooch said, but Mr. Mandelson ''doesn't recognize the portrayal of the state of play as offered by the U.S. side.''
 ''If Mr. Zoellick is announcing that the negotiations are at an end, Mr. Mandelson has not been informed of this development.'' 
 In his statement, Mr. Zoellick stopped short of breaking off talks but said that if the European Union ''either breaks or refuses to extend the terms of the Jan. 11 agreement we will return to litigation.''
 This would mean Europe would have to agree to indefinite suspension of all subsidies until an agreement is reached, even if the negotiations go past the self-imposed April 11 deadline for reaching a deal.
 The April 11 deadline is important because the United States is concerned that Europe will give new subsidies, or launch aid, to the A350, a midsize airplane that Airbus is designing to compete directly with Boeing's new 7E7 Dreamliner airplane. Early this year, the United States and the European Union were poised to file formal complaints against each other at the World Trade Organization over government support given to Boeing and Airbus. But in advance of President Bush's trip to Europe the sides agreed to engage in private negotiations to try to resolve the issue. 
 If the breakdown continues and the two sides end up arguing before the W.T.O., it will be the biggest case ever heard by the group's dispute settlement arm and could lead to a ruling that might seriously damage the profitability of an important industry for both continents. 
 In disclosing the breakdown, the Bush administration accused Brussels of changing the terms of the negotiations. Instead of discussing the subsidies alone, the administration said, Europe also insisted on discussing the immediate elimination of tax cuts for American exporters, including Boeing, that were declared illegal by the W.T.O. 
 The Europeans also wanted Japanese subsidies given to aircraft production to be part of the negotiations. The United States wants European countries to end direct loans to Airbus, which it says has been the beneficiary of as much as $40 billion in government aid through low-interest loans used to help finance the development of new commercial aircraft. 
 The Europeans said that they were pursuing ways of reducing what they see as subsidies for Boeing but refused to go into details.
 Boeing officials were caught by surprise at the announcement but said that they had full confidence in Mr. Zoellick. 
 ''Boeing remains hopeful that an equitable agreement can be reached,'' Amanda Landers, a spokeswoman for Boeing, said, ''but the company continues to support the U.S. government's resolve to take any necessary steps to bring an end to subsidies.''
 Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, where Boeing employs thousands of people at its aircraft assembly plants, issued a statement Friday night applauding Mr. Zoellick.
 ''Today's move by the U.S. is the bold action we need to protect our workers and send a strong message to Europe that enough is enough,'' she said.
 The dispute stems from a 1992 agreement that outlined how governments could support their airline industries. Talks to review that agreement broke down last year over how to define government subsidies and whether the goal was complete elimination of those subsidies or simply restraint of them. 
 In their counterclaim to the United States' original filing at the W.T.O., European trade officials said the United States paid Boeing ''massive illegal subsidies that damage Airbus.''
 Since the original agreement, Airbus has surpassed Boeing as the world's leading supplier of commercial aircraft and the two companies are now poised to compete over a new generation of aircraft.

HEADLINE: President Bush's Debt

 BODY:
Last week, as Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain unveiled the commission on Africa's report to tackle poverty, Bob Geldof, the Band Aid star-turned-humanitarian, walked to the microphone with expletive-filled advice for how Mr. Blair and the British chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, should get the American president, George Bush, to step up to the plate on aid to Africa. Saving Africa, Mr. Geldof said, would cost ''half a stick of chewing gum a day'' for each citizen of the Group of 8 industrialized nations. 
 ''Tony and Gordon have to prepare to ring up George and say, 'Do this, George, do this one thing for me, it's going to cost you [nothing], do it for me,'' Mr. Geldof said. Any thoughts that Mr. Blair would disapprove of Mr. Geldof's rant were dispelled when the prime minister walked on stage and backed the aging rocker. ''Because I'm a politician in a suit, I wince at the occasional word, but, actually, what he said is really what I think.'' 
 As everyone knows, Mr. Blair has made Britain an unwavering member of President Bush's coalition of the willing in Iraq, at his own political peril. The favor he asked in return was a noble one -- for America to join other wealthy countries in substantially raising aid to Africa to cut poverty there. He and the architects of the United Nations' Millennium Development Project, to which America has signed on, say the number of people living in poverty around the world -- 1.1 billion -- can be cut in half by 2015 if rich countries donate 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to development.
 Mr. Blair's report calls for African leaders to take responsibility for the part they have played in grinding the continent into the dust. It demands that they move faster toward democracy and stamp out corruption. But it also points out that wretched dictators and autocrats have been propped up by bribes, paid willingly by international corporations. 
 The aid and attention that have gone to Africa from Europe, Japan and America pale in comparison with what rich countries have been willing to squander on far less noble causes than providing drinking water for a 3-year-old in Chad. The report asks for an additional $25 billion a year in aid by 2010. With the right tools, Mr. Blair says, Africa has the same economic potential as Asia. 
 Mr. Blair will most likely be able to get most of his European colleagues on board this year. Less certain are Japan and -- most iffy of all -- America. So what will Mr. Bush do? Well, he will certainly point to his Millennium Challenge Account, which ties development aid to good governance. Indeed, the Millennium Challenge Account on Monday approved its first project -- $110 million to help finance, among other things, microcredit agencies, agricultural building centers and land title programs in Madagascar. 
 The Madagascar project and, indeed, the Millennium Challenge Account are both very worthy projects, and we applaud the Bush administration for the initiative. But they are not enough. They are not even close to what America can afford. It is long past time for Mr. Bush to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Blair on Africa, just as Mr. Blair stood with Mr. Bush on Iraq. 
 Bob Geldof's language was over the top, but his point was right.

HEADLINE: A Republican Stalwart Takes It on the Chin

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
JAMES A. GARNER, the mayor of the Village of Hempstead and one of the highest-profile black Republican mayors in the nation, lost his re-election bid last week, giving the Democratic and Working Families Parties a major victory in Nassau County.
 Wayne Hall, a Democratic village trustee who ran on the Working Families line, will become the first Democrat in decades to run the village when he takes office next month. He will also preside over a Village Board that for the first time in history will be made up entirely of Democrats. Mr. Hall's running mates, Lenora Long and Henry Conyers, won the two vacant board seats. 
 Mr. Garner was a four-term incumbent and had become prominent on the national and Republican stages in recent years. He is the immediate past president of the United States Conference of Mayors and was the Republican candidate for Congress last year in an unsuccessful race against the Democratic incumbent, Carolyn McCarthy.
 Desmond Ryan, a Republican lobbyist, said that while the village election was a relatively small race that drew just over 5,000 voters, it was a big blow to the Nassau Republicans. ''James Garner was the official that Republicans utilized to show that they were inclusive, that they could attract an African-American into their political tent,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''But it looks like they got him into the tent and then forgot about him.''
 Even Democrats thought that Mr. Garner might easily win re-election because the Democratic vote was likely to be split three ways since he was being challenged by Mr. Hall and two other Democratic trustees. But with an alliance forged between the Democratic and Working Families Parties, Mr. Hall rode to an overwhelming victory, with 2,334 votes to Mr. Garner's 1,546. Mr. Hall was listed only on the Working Families line, and its victory was its first in Nassau County.
 Mr. Hall railed against the village's high property taxes and its uncertain finances, with a credit rating that hovers near junk-bond status. Everywhere he went and in his campaign literature, Mr. Hall blamed Mr. Garner for taxes that have increased by 239 percent in his 16-year tenure and criticized him for doubling his salary to $118,000 while more and more streets fell into disrepair.
 ''These are the things that residents were talking about on the street,'' Mr. Hall said. ''And a lot of people just believe that it is time for a change.''
 Mr. Garner stood by his record. ''I have no remorse,'' he said on Wednesday. ''I've taken a suburban village and made it a thriving business center. I've put a brand new face on the village.'' He pointed to $400 million in economic development that he brought to the village and the building of new train and bus stations.
 Just days before the election, Mr. Garner announced plans to open a Costco Wholesale store on Main Street as part of his continuing urban renewal efforts. But Mr. Hall has consistently opposed urban renewal plans because they involve condemning and relocating homes and existing businesses. He said last week that he would re-evaluate the Costco plan, adding, ''That's a big question mark now.''
 Joseph N. Mondello, the chairman of the Nassau Republican Party, said Mr. Garner's defeat is the village's loss. ''He's done a great job over the time he's been in office,'' he said. Mr. Garner's failed run for Congress may have hurt him, Mr. Mondello said, with voters seeing it as a sign that he was ready to move on. 
 He said the Republican Party did not support Mr. Garner financially, but ''we supported him with people as best we could.'' But with Democrats outnumbering Republicans nearly 3 to 1 in the village, he said, ''it's been a growing difficult area for us.''
 Stanley Klein, a political science professor at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University, said that even if the Republican Party did not put any money into Mr. Garner's race, ''This is one that the Republican chairman of Nassau County can't duck.''
 The Town of Hempstead has always been the party's base, he said, and it has always won in the village despite high Democratic enrollment. ''This could presage impressive things for the Democrats countywide,'' he added.
 Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the Nassau Democrats, said Mr. Hall's victory ''demonstrated in a very difficult small race that the Democratic ascendancy in Nassau County is solid -- it's not fleeting.''
 Mr. Jacobs credited the partnership of Democrats, the Working Families Party and a community group, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn, for the victory. He said the Democratic Party helped pay for campaign mailings while the Working Families Party and Acorn provided the ground troops that campaigned door-to-door and made sure voters made it to the polls on Election Day. The Democrats endorsed and supported Mr. Hall, but chose not to run him on the Democratic line to avoid a divisive primary.
 Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party, said Mr. Hall's win is a big boost for his party, which has an enrollment of only about 250 voters in Nassau County. ''This may be the only time this has happened, but we were Row A on the ballot, and we beat a 16-year incumbent,'' he said. ''That's huge for us. It's our first high-profile race in Nassau County.''
 Mr. Cantor said his party decided to target Mr. Garner after he defeated a proposed ''living wage'' ordinance four years ago. ''This just shows that people are hungry for elections with content and that are driven by issues,'' he said.
 Mr. Ryan, the Republican lobbyist, said the election illustrated the growing influence of smaller political parties. ''This shows that these independent lines can't be taken for granted,'' he said. ''They have become an integral part of the process.''

HEADLINE: What Rising Young Designers Have Up Their Sleeves

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
WHILE it's not quite WrestleMania or ''The Iron Chef,'' a big auto show gives ambitious up-and-comers a chance to flaunt their skills and challenge the industry's established heavyweights.
 At the New York International Auto Show, on the level playing field of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, second-string automakers will flex their muscles against the giants on more or less equal footing. Here, a brilliant design study for a future model that fires the public's imagination can set the career of a young designer on an upward arc.
 The show, which opens to the public on Friday, affords trend watchers an opportunity to preview the work of the young designers who will be imagining the cars of tomorrow -- before they become the industry's stars of tomorrow.
 The designs that make it to auto shows are the best, said Geoff Wardle, associate chairman and director of advanced mobility research at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. Getting a car onto the spinning turntables can supercharge a young designer's career. ''It's a very competitive business,'' he said. ''It's certainly a good start to have a show car or production vehicle attributed to your name.'' 
 Many of the industry's top design executives first won notice in their 20's and 30's with their visions of brash, innovative cars. 
 J Mays designed the Concept 1, which became the Volkswagen New Beetle, in his mid-30's; now, as vice president for design at the Ford Motor Company, he oversees the look of eight brands, from Aston Martin to Volvo. Bryan Nesbitt, General Motors' executive director for design in Europe, was 27 when he came up with the design for the Chrysler PT Cruiser. At 28, Anne Asensio found success at Renault in her native France with the concept for the Mgane Scnic minivan; she is now G.M.'s director for advanced design. More recently, the Chrysler 300's success made its 30-something designer, Ralph Gilles, a hometown hero in Detroit.
 In an effort to identify some promising but still unsung talents, The New York Times solicited names and examples from prominent designers and auto industry executives. Here are six -- others are profiled at nytimes.com/autos -- who were singled out, and the cars they will have at the New York show:

KENNETH LEE
NISSAN AZEAL
 When he was 5, Kenneth Lee was drawing cars on his Magna Doodle. In his fourth-grade journal, he wrote ''car designer'' in answer to the question, ''What do you want to be when you grow up?''
 His ambitions never changed. Now 27, he works at a sketch pad at Nissan Design America's new studio in Farmington Hills, Mich. He was there sketching when Shiro Nakamura, Nissan's senior vice president and design director, walked by, glanced at Mr. Lee's pad and sent the Azeal concept car on its way.
 Alfonso Albaisa, design director for Nissan Design America, said: ''To do a little coupe is not earth-shattering -- there's a million of them -- but every once in a while there's a design that just is so natural, and something that is all about what it is to be Nissan. We said, 'Let's go for it. Let's make a really beautiful coupe.'''
 Mr. Lee, who spent his childhood in Hong Kong before moving to California, graduated from the Art Center College of Design in 1999. He was at Ford's studio in Australia before joining Nissan less than two years ago. 
 The Azeal was designed to be a sporty entry-level coupe for someone who couldn't afford the Nissan 350Z or Infiniti G35 sports cars, Mr. Lee said. It hints at the design direction for a car smaller than the Sentra that Nissan has said it will produce in a couple of years.
 Mr. Lee noted that entry-level cars tend to have slab-sided bodies and tiny wheels tucked inboard of the fenders. ''We are doing the extreme opposite of that, pulling the wheels out to the corners,'' he said. ''The sloping roofline, the big fender flares, those are things you don't normally see on an economy car. I don't see why it can't be done in an entry-level car.''

AARON PIZZUTTI
JEEP HURRICANE
 Aaron Pizzutti's idea, which arrived rudely in the middle of the night, scared his wife half to death. But in the end his inspiration left Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, thrilled to death. 
 It all began in January 2004 when Mr. Zetsche issued this assignment: Come up with a vehicle that would be the ultimate expression of the Jeep brand. The ideas had to be ready by the end of the month.
 It was an important, daunting assignment for Mr. Pizzutti, 30, a Jeep enthusiast since high school and a designer at Chrysler for five years. ''You are pretty much thinking about it nonstop,'' he recalled. ''Day and night.'' The question was, What is the ultimate Jeep? The answer arrived one night around 1 a.m. 
 ''It honestly scared the death out my wife,'' he recalled. ''I sat up in bed and said, 'Oh my goodness, this is it! This is it! This is it!' I clicked on the lamp next to the bed, grabbed a piece of paper out of the nightstand and scribbled it down. My wife was like, 'That's fine. Now go back to sleep.'''
 So what was ''it''? A Jeep that could spin around on itself like a tank, with two big Hemi V-8 engines (one in front, one in the rear) and a body of exotic ultralight carbon fiber. In concept-car form, the Jeep Hurricane has a turning circle of absolute zero and a crab-steering mode that lets it move sideways without moving forward. Anyone who has done any off-roading, a passion of Mr. Pizzutti since his teens, knows those functions could come in handy. 
 ''These things don't happen all that often,'' said John Sgalia, Mr. Pizzutti's boss and director of the Interior-Exterior Jeep Studio. ''It was a wonderful creative moment that Aaron came up with it. Once we see that kind of gold, we've got to mine it.''
 Mr. Pizzutti, a Philadelphia native, has an engineering background and a design degree from the Cleveland Institute of Art. With that schooling, he understands the priority of function, Mr. Sgalia said, adding: ''At Jeep we are more function-driven. We design for a purpose as opposed to designing for pure emotion.''
 The Hurricane's abilities make it the most maneuverable, most capable and most powerful Jeep ever, and it met with the chief's approval.
 ''When Dieter saw that car for the first time, within five minutes -- in his three-piece suit -- he was lying on the ground underneath it,'' Mr. Pizzutti said.

VICKI VLACHAKIS
SATURN SKY
 The interior of the Sky roadster, which goes on sale early next year, posed some special challenges, but the interior designer, Vicki Vlachakis, had some special qualifications.
 By the time she joined G.M. in 2000 she had already worked for Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart for four years. She also had an internship in Munich with Audi Design, renowned for the attention to detail in its interiors. ''She had perspective from a European company that is known for its design quality,'' said Clay Dean, G.M.'s design director for small and midsize cars. 
 It also made sense to have her as the interior designer on the Sky -- a crucial assignment, given G.M.'s hope that the two-seater will give Saturn some sex appeal -- because she had worked on the interior of its companion vehicle, the Pontiac Solstice.
 Differentiating the Sky's interior from the Solstice's was also a challenge, since the cars share some parts. But in another way it was easy, she said, because the Solstice uses classic feminine shapes while the Sky is more masculine.
 Ms. Vlachakis, 32, knew that designing the interior would be a challenge. ''A convertible is a special type of vehicle because you do see so much of the interior, so the form language had to meld together,'' said Ms. Vlachakis, who grew up in Pasadena.
 In design-speak, that means that the interior should reflect the themes of the exterior.
 ''On the exterior there are a lot of jewelrylike elements, with the chrome bar in the front and a lot of detail in the headlamps and taillamps,'' she said. ''We tried to bring the same sort of chrome, jewelrylike look to the interior.''
 Working from the design of an earlier European roadster concept, she fought to preserve that car's stylish interior trim, like the piano-black lacquer finish on the dashboard and console and the ''cobalt red'' accents on the leather seats, steering wheel and dashboard. The juxtaposition of the red against the glossy black lacquer and chrome ''is an impressive combination,'' she said. 
 Mr. Dean noted that Ms. Vlachakis struggled to get materials that would both provide the look she wanted and be suitable for mass production.
 ''You don't want to try to do something if you know you can't execute it correctly,'' he said. ''What it took was finding better finishes and better solutions so that it could be executed.''
 ''She really had to fight,'' he said. She did, and won.

GEORGE SARIDAKIS
FORD SHELBY GR-1
 Thanks to George Saridakis's passion for sleek design, the show-stopping Shelby GR-1 came to life in just three sketches over a weekend. Mr. Saridakis, 33, was born and reared in Crete -- his mother is Scottish and his father is Greek -- and he was just 8 or 9 when he saw a silver Citroen that made a big impression.
 ''It was a sleek-looking, bullet-looking thing,'' he recalled. ''It was like a spaceship at the time, very different from the cars I was familiar with. It really grabbed my imagination, and I just started drawing cars.''
 After earning a degree in aerospace engineering in Glasgow, he felt ''a wee bit cold, uninspired and somewhat unfulfilled.'' So he went on to design school and then spent three years at Toyota before joining Ford.
 The GR-1 is based on the Ford Shelby Cobra concept car from last year. ''We talked about doing something very sexy and very different from the roadster, said Mr. Saridakis, who speaks with a Scottish accent. ''I just started drawing these coupes.
 ''I ended up with three drawings very, very, very quickly. It was a joy, because the emotion was in my head: the feel of the car, the true nature of the car.''
 When it was finished, the look seemed familiar. ''I was drawing this car since I was 6 years old,'' he said. ''When I look at my schoolbooks back in Scotland or Greece, they are full of cars like this.''
 The front end resembles the Ford GT, but as a concept car -- a design study not necessarily destined for production -- ''it proposes a direction for Ford design,'' Mr. Saridakis said.
 Even now, with the gleaming GR-1 on display at auto shows -- it flaunts a shimmering skin of polished aluminum -- Mr. Saridakis is still surprised and perhaps bewildered by how quickly the design came to him.
 ''That's never happened before,'' he said. ''I just hope that happens again.''

JOSE PARIS
FORD SYNUS
 When Ford started looking for a design that would work on a car smaller than the Focus, it didn't want something that looked cheap or cute -- those approaches hadn't worked in the American market. Instead, designers wondered if the ''Built Ford Tough'' theme could work on a small automobile.
 Discussions led to the idea of an ''urban armadillo,'' a car with a tough-looking body but a warm interior. Jose Paris, 33, got the job of designing the exterior. 
 ''Jose did a very successful job of portraying toughness in a very small package,'' said Mr. Mays, Ford's vice president for design. ''In the sketch that I saw, the exterior looked almost like a Brink's truck. Then he took it to the next level by making it look modern.'' 
 The result was the SYNus, which stands for Synthesis-Urban Sanctuary. Synthesis refers to the combination of a tough exterior and an interior that is practically a cocoon.
 Although Mr. Paris has drawn cars since he was 3 or 4, his career began in architecture. But he kept drawing cars and eventually won a full scholarship to Art Center College. After graduating in 1998, he spent some time at Audi. He started with Ford in 2000.
 ''The best thing that I learned from architecture was to think,'' he said. ''They taught me, before you put your pen on the paper, you have to think about what you are doing and why you are doing it. Think about all the aspects of the project before you start.'' 
 Mr. Paris's background and life style gave him an advantage, Mr. Mays said, adding: ''He was born in Madrid and lives in what I can only describe as a very urban environment in the middle of L.A. So he understands urban environments probably as well as anyone in our design group, which was perfect for the SYNus.''
 The SYNus has been criticized for the image it conjures of American cities -- specifically, the perceived need to drive an aggressively styled armored vehicle as secure as a bank vault. But Mr. Paris disagrees. He describes it as having an attitude of ''don't bother me'' rather than ''get out of my way, little man.''

IAN CARTABIANO
TOYOTA FT-SX AND 2005 AVALON
 In 1994, when Toyota introduced the first-generation Avalon sedan, Ian Cartabiano was in his first year at the Art Center College of Design. As a 19-year-old he wasn't impressed. 
 ''I was more into sports cars, muscle cars,'' he said. ''I liked the Supra and Celica -- and the trucks.'' 
 Now 30, Mr. Cartabiano, who grew up in Torrance, Calif., practically in the backyard of Toyota's American headquarters, has designed the exteriors of both the new 2005 Toyota Avalon and the FT-SX crossover sport wagon concept. He was chosen to design the Avalon's exterior because ''his sketch really hit the mark,'' said Kevin Hunter, vice president for design at Calty Design Research, Toyota's California studio.
 ''It was an amazing, beautiful sketch,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''It was very elegant, very powerful, very sporty.''
 Without alienating the Avalon's core of older customers, Toyota wanted to give the car a more ''exuberant, expressive and sporty appearance'' to attract younger buyers. Mr. Cartabiano's creativity and enthusiasm ''helped us get to a new level,'' Mr. Hunter said.
 The challenge was to keep the familiar style of Toyota's flagship while making the Avalon look new.
 While his American bosses were enthusiastic, Mr. Cartabiano acknowledges that he was somewhat worried. He was competing within Toyota against designs from a Japanese studio.
 ''We had set out in the beginning with the key words 'American beauty,''' he said. ''We wanted to make an unabashedly American car, and we weren't afraid to say that. You're taking kind of a gamble. In a global company it's a risk to say, 'I'm going to make something that is American in almost everything.'''
 In the end, Mr. Cartabiano's American beauty won the pageant, and Toyota describes his Avalon as its ''most American'' vehicle: designed in California, engineered in Michigan and built in Kentucky.

HEADLINE: States and Communities Battling Another Round of Base Closings

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19 

 BODY:
For the first time in a decade, communities across the country are bracing for a major round of military base closings, and they are mounting aggressive lobbying campaigns to stave off cuts and other changes that some independent experts say could dwarf the previous four rounds combined. 
 Pentagon officials say all 425 domestic bases are under scrutiny, as the military looks to squeeze efficiencies and billions of dollars in savings from a cold-war network that has nearly 25 percent more capacity than what the armed services say they need. 
 After more than two years of exhaustive study, Pentagon analysts are putting the finishing touches on a list of recommendations that Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld will present to a nine-member independent commission for review. Scores of Pentagon analysts and auditors have been poring over data and dozens of options as part of an effort that is intended to mesh with Mr. Rumsfeld's broader goals to make the military more agile and responsive to security threats. 
 ''We know we have too much,'' Philip W. Grone, the deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment, said in an interview. ''We know that we have capacity in the wrong place, either over or under. We're not well matched to the mission need.'' 
 State officials are rushing to preserve their installations, which provide thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to local and state economies. Florida, under Gov. Jeb Bush, has a $50,000-a-month contract with a consulting team that includes Dick Armey, the former House majority leader, and William S. Cohen, the former defense secretary. 
 Military officials assert that the Pentagon has no preconceived notions about which bases to close or consolidate, or the amount of annual savings. But senior military officials say the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines are likely to end up sharing more bases, laboratories, depots and training ranges in an approach consistent with Mr. Rumsfeld's philosophy that the armed services should fight and operate jointly. 
 One prominent military analyst, Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute, said the military's excess industrial capacity made bases like the Army's Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois and the Watervliet Arsenal in New York, and the Marine Corps' logistics center in Albany, Ga., ripe for realignment. Such bases, while not widely known, employ large numbers of civilians.
 Mr. Rumsfeld will submit his list of recommended base closings, consolidations and realignments to the commission by May 16. A final roster of cuts and other changes, prepared by the commission, is due Sept. 8. Previous base-closing commissions have endorsed 85 percent of the Pentagon's recommendations. President Bush and Congress must then accept or reject the list by Nov. 7. 
 The Senate this week approved Anthony J. Principi, a former secretary of veterans affairs, as head of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, widely known as the Brac. The White House also nominated the other eight members, which includes two retired four-star officers and two former congressmen.
 The four previous rounds of base closures, in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995, eliminated 97 bases and several hundred smaller facilities, and reduced overall capacity by 20 percent. These changes yielded savings of $28.9 billion through 2003, with recurring savings of $7 billion annually after that, according to the Government Accountability Office. This is the last scheduled round of closings, under the current model begun in the late 1980's, putting even more pressure on the decisions to come.
 Adding to the uncertainty of this year's round are the open-ended military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon's plans to bring 70,000 troops and 100,000 dependents in Europe back to bases in the United States, and a sweeping review of the military's strategy, forces and missions as required by Congress every four years.
 ''It's a new paradigm: we're at war and we're bringing people back,'' said Chris Kelley Cimko, a former Senate and base-closing commission official who is a member of a panel to save bases in Virginia. ''Have they been able to account for all of the thinking they're going to have to do to be effective in the future, and to have what might be the mother of all Brac rounds?'' 
 Mr. Rumsfeld last week offered comfort to some communities fearing closings, saying the large number of returning troops could soften the blow. Some bases may even expand with the troops' return. ''The number of bases that might be closed or adjusted downward in some way will be considerably fewer because we already have solved the problem of what we're going to bring back,'' Mr. Rumsfeld told the House Armed Services Committee. Legislators, lobbyists and consultants are ramping up campaigns, some of which have been two years in the works, to protect bases. 
 In Florida, Governor Bush and the state's Congressional delegation are waging a campaign to protect 21 installations that generate $44 billion a year for the economy, behind only tourism and agriculture in the state. 
 In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed a California Council on Base Support and Retention, whose co-chairman is Leon Panetta, the former Democratic congressman and White House chief of staff. Mr. Schwarzenegger has also hired Clark & Weinstock, a Washington consulting firm headed by the former congressmen Vic Fazio and Vin Weber, to help protect California's military installations. Of California's 91 major bases in operation when the base closings began in 1988, 29 have been closed or realigned.
 During a recent conference of the National Governors Association in Washington, several governors, including George E. Pataki of New York, took part in a series of meetings with Pentagon officials to make pitches for their bases. 
 Gov. Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky has dedicated $660,000 from the 2004 to 2006 budgets to promote and preserve military installations in the state, including Fort Knox, which some state officials fear is vulnerable. In an effort to make her state's bases less vulnerable to closing, Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington plans to propose next week that the state set aside $10 million over two years to help repair or replace infrastructure around bases and to buy private property near bases to ensure an adequate buffer zone. 
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are lining up behind their installations. Last Wednesday, the Texas Congressional delegation summoned Mr. Grone and his top aides to voice support for the state's 17 bases and 150 smaller facilities, including Ingleside Naval Station, Goodfellow Air Force Base, and the Red River Army Depot, all of which survived previous closings but are considered vulnerable. 
 The process has generated anger among some lawmakers who say the Pentagon should not be considering closing bases when the nation is at war. Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, in an op-ed article in USA Today this month, called the base-closing commission ''a Congressional cop-out'' that depends on ''a paranoia-driven process that wastes time and money.'' 
 Proponents of the base-closing process say that since 1988, 107,000 jobs have been created in the communities where installations were closed or realigned. 
 Lawmakers and community leaders are searching for clues for what the Pentagon considers the most vulnerable bases, but any leaks of information have all but dried up because hundreds of military and Pentagon employees working on the process have been required to sign oaths of secrecy. 
 ''Far more than in the past, I think it is impossible to predict what will be on the list,'' said David Berteau, a consultant for Clark & Weinstock and a former Pentagon official whose responsibilities included overseeing base closings.
 The bulk of the analysis in the Pentagon is being carried out by seven groups of military and civilian officials who are organized to focus on these pivotal functions or organizations: industrial activities, supply and storage, headquarters and support, education, intelligence, medical and training. 
 The Pentagon teams are using several criteria to assess a base's value, including the base's mission, cost savings, availability of land and air space, and economic impact on local communities, aides said. 
 ''The outcome of Brac is going to be determined based upon a very extensive analytical effort that is examining capacity issues and military value issues and then the economics of the change,'' Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, told reporters in January. ''In other words, I'm not remotely interested in changes that don't produce money.'' 
 In this round, Pentagon officials said, the Defense Department is looking at more shared or consolidated basing arrangements, either for cost savings or operational reasons. This could involve merging contiguous bases like Fort Bragg in North Carolina, headquarters of the 82nd Airborne Division, and Pope Air Force Base. Under some situations, Marine or Navy aircraft could fly from Air Force bases.
 It has been 10 years since the last batch of base closings, largely because Republicans accused President Bill Clinton of politicizing the 1995 round when he objected to the commission's decisions to close maintenance depots at McClellan Air Force Base in California and Kelly Air Force Base in Texas. Republicans said the administration was seeking to curry favor with voters in those big states by preserving those jobs. In the end, Mr. Clinton grudgingly approved the list. 
 In part because of that controversy, the rules were changed to require seven of the nine panel members to agree to any proposed additions to the defense secretary's list. A simple majority of its members may preserve a base that is a target of Mr. Rumsfeld.
 Congress created the base-closing process in the late 1980's as the military reduced in size in response to the collapse of the Soviet Union. With Congress unable to agree on which bases should be closed, a bipartisan Congressional group proposed turning the selections over to an independent commission.

Chart: ''The Road Ahead For Military Bases''
Pentagon officials say they are looking at all 425 military installations in the United States for the coming round of military base closings. The process will be handled by an independent commission, working from a preliminary list from Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld.

Main deadlines in the process

Secretary Rumsfeld
MAY 16 -- Rumsfeld must send his list of proposed closings to the commission and Congress.

Base-closing commission
JULY 1 -- G.A.O. must issue its analysis of the list to Congressional defense committees.

President Bush
SEPT. 8 -- Commission must send its list to President Bush.

SEPT. 23 -- Mr. Bush must either accept or reject the list in its entirety.

OCT. 20 -- Commission must issue revised list if Mr. Bush had objections.

NOV. 7 -- President must forward revised commission list to Congress.

Congress must disapprove of the list within 45 legislative days or before adjournment; otherwise it becomes binding.

HEADLINE: Playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey Just Won't Do

BYLINE: By JENNIFER ALSEVER

 BODY:
WHEN Chris Szarka threw a party for her daughter's first birthday at their home in Denver, the guest list included goats, ponies, chickens, rabbits and pigs.
 Ms. Szarka paid $275 for this personal petting zoo as part of an elaborate celebration for her daughter, Morgan, and about 60 human guests. Ms. Szarka handed out cowboy hats filled with barnyard toys and helped 20 children build their own stuffed horses.
 Years ago, birthdays were simple, with a handful of children playing in the backyard while mom lit the candles on the cake. Today, birthday parties are bigger and more elaborate than ever, with the guest list spanning entire preschool classes and price tags that can reach $1,000 or more. 
 And, as in so much of life, the pressure is on not to be outdone. Jennifer Neglia, a homemaker in the affluent community of Randolph, N.J., worries that her own children will think their parties are boring if she doesn't follow suit.
 ''It's almost competitive at this point,'' she said. ''I wouldn't expect to see favors at a party. But I feel like I have to have them at my party.''
 Ms. Neglia spent $350 on an elaborate tea party when her daughter turned 6. Her husband rented a tuxedo and served 18 girls who wore white gloves, ate finger foods, played whisper games, decorated straw hats, made pearl bracelets and had their photographs taken on a wing-backed chair. 
 ''It probably cost more than I wanted,'' she said. ''But we had a really good time.'' 
 It's tough to quantify how big the birthday business is for vendors, entertainment centers and suppliers, because no single organization tracks the children's birthday industry. But business appears to be booming. 
 The once-bankrupt Chuck E. Cheese leads the way, having opened about 30 restaurants a year for the last five years to reach 495 restaurants and sales of more than $654 million. The restaurants offer both walk-in dining for families and space for big parties. Rivals with names like Pump It Up and Monkey Bizness are opening in warehouses and strip malls, with amenities like 5,000-square-foot play areas and inflatable slides.
 But the definition of play area is expanding. Youngsters now celebrate with tea parties at bed and breakfast inns and visit nail salons for makeup and manicure parties.
 Hundreds of vendors rent inflatable castles with enclosed trampolines for backyard events, and parents can hire ice cream sundae caterers, storytellers, magicians, professional photographers, snake handlers and puppeteers. ''The market is exploding,'' said Frank Price, who owns Birthday University, a company in Raleigh, N.C. He gives business seminars to birthday service providers nationwide. 
 Working parents with two incomes but increasingly less time help fuel the trend. Parents have doubled their party budgets in the last three to four years, even as the economy has faltered, Mr. Price said. 
 ''Families and parents are looking for something unique and different that will give their child a lasting memory, and they're willing to spend almost anything to do it,'' he said.
 Perhaps most extravagant is the guest list. Today's parties can easily swell to 60 people, with children, siblings and parents. Some families invite the entire class so no child feels left out. 
 Susan Fagerstrom, a mother of two in Beaumont, Tex., said, ''You don't want 40 kids in your home.'' Many parents move the parties elsewhere so they can enjoy them, she said, and ''they don't think, 'I have to get the cake' or 'I need to clean this up.'''
 Ms. Fagerstrom said she and her two daughters, 5 and 7, attended 20 parties in the last seven months.
 ''I've been to parties at the movie theater, Chuck E. Cheese's, backyards with blowup slides, makeup and accessory parties, minigolf parties, puppet show parties, tea parties at home, roller skating and bowling parties,'' she said. 
 The multitude of invitations can also mean a multitude of gifts, and more pressure on parents. ''You want to give a nice gift,'' said Christine Driscoll, a mother in Ridgewood, N.J. ''You have 20 kids in a class. You get invited to 20 parties, and at $20 a pop, it just gets expensive.'' 
 Ms. Szarka, of Denver, admits that she has gone over the top on birthdays for her daughters, now 4 and 3.
 For her younger daughter's first birthday, she and her husband paid $50 to rent a clubhouse, $200 for machines to dispense cotton candy, hot dogs and popcorn, and $250 for a woman to give a Little Mermaid performance. 
 For another birthday, Ms. Szarka hired a $100 face painter for 20 guests, as well as a tea party organizer for $300, so the kids could don princess costumes and enjoy a tea party with miniature fine china.
 ''I like making my kids feel special,'' she said. ''It's the one day of the year where the focus is all on them. We spend a lot, but we don't buy them as many toys and we only do it once a year.'' 
 Parents like Ms. Szarka were clearly on Charlotte Cassese's mind when she opened a birthday party center called Glam Jam last spring in Randolph.
 For $300, parents can give a party for 10 girls at Glam Jam's warehouse operation, where guests create their own lotions, lip gloss and eye shadow. The girls, ages 6 and up, can then get their faces painted and dress up in boas and sunglasses for a red-carpet fashion show. A big-screen TV projects their images as they strut down the carpet. Parents can buy their own video of the show before they leave the event.
 ''YOU'D be amazed at what people will do for their birthday parties,'' Ms. Cassese said. One mother wanted a party for 40 children, but Glam Jam's limit is 20. So the woman held two parties -- one with 20 children on a Saturday and another the next day for 20 more. She spent a total of about $1,200.
 In the last two years, the warehouse area surrounding Glam Jam has seen the rise of a gymnastic center, rock climbing center, indoor soccer arena, ice-skating rink and two indoor play areas -- and all play host to frequent birthday parties. 
 ''This is the party place of Morris County,'' said Karl Lens, who runs Time In, a nearby 5,000-square-foot warehouse play area that has slides and equipment similar to those at a McDonald's. Mr. Lens, a father of three, started the business three years ago and is trying to open other locations through franchises. He said he runs about 600 parties a year, charging an average of $400 apiece. During the week, parents use the warehouse as a play space for smaller groups or individual children. But his expenses are substantial. Mr. Lens said he paid about $1,200 a month for insurance, while a single play system costs $50,000 to $100,000.
 Some families still prefer an old-fashioned approach. Christine Walker of Chicago, a mother of three, celebrated her son's fourth birthday last July at home. The children played in the backyard, with no organized games or entertainment. 
 ''We thought they'd have more fun playing with each other and in the yard, which they did,'' she said. ''I tell my kids what you have is really great -- not necessarily better, but certainly as good as other people's parties. I'd rather put $500 toward a 529 college savings plan.''

QUICK READ
Parents have a broad array of professional party planners to choose from. Here's a sample:

Dozens of home-based businesses offer to bring dress-up clothes and costumes to the house. Emily's Make Believe in Huntsville, Ala., will deliver up to five themes, including superhero garb and evening gowns, for $150. Noah's Ark Animal Workshop, in Crestwood, Ill., has sales representatives across the country who bring supplies to the home and help guests create their own stuffed animals. The price: $13 to $32 a person. AZ Little Chefs, in Phoenix, will send party hostesses to homes for $160 to help six guests decorate cookies or cakes or make meals like pizza and twice-baked potatoes.

A new generation of play centers offer inflatable or foam toys that children can bounce, jump and slide on. One nationwide business called Pump It Up has 65 franchised locations that play host to parties for about $250. American Girl offers parties at its New York and Chicago stores, with birthday packages for $32 a guest. Girls can enjoy three-course meals with their dolls in a private dining area.

HEADLINE: How to Get Young People to Care About Old Age

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
TELL anyone under 30 how to save their money, and one of two responses is likely to surface: hot-blooded scorn or cold indifference. 
 Maybe that's why, despite his college tour, his bar graphs, statistics and stabs at humor, President Bush can't seem to persuade young voters to fight for his plan to partially privatize Social Security. 
 Recent polls show that the vast majority of 18- to 29-year-olds have only a hazy understanding of the White House's proposals, and more than 80 percent say they do not think the system is in crisis. Their response, at best, has been one big ''Whatever.'' 
 But according to marketing executives, economists and experts on youth culture, there are many ways to get young people to turn off their iPods and start paying attention. The key, they said, was understanding that young workers have a different psychological profile, one that embraces anger, celebrity and risk. 
 This generation has been shaped by turbulence. They soaked up the go-go, change-the-world Kool-Aid of the dot-com boom -- and watched it all go bust. They've seen superpowers self-destruct and witnessed the horror of Sept. 11. They've watched Fortune 500 companies implode, seemingly in days (Enron), and admired entrepreneurs who became billionaires in what seemed like nanoseconds (Google). Everywhere they look, individuals seem more empowered, while top-down institutions seem to be in decay and decline. 
 As a result, ''young people are as a whole more libertarian,'' said Bill Hillsman, chief creative officer of North Woods Advertising, which has created ads for Minnesota politicians like Jesse Ventura and Paul Wellstone. ''They love the notion of self-determinism.''
 Government, then, looks a bit boring and ineffective. And young workers, if they are planning for retirement at all, are surely not counting on Social Security. 
 ''This generation doesn't believe Social Security will be real for them,'' said Jack Schnirman, 27, the campaign director for United Leaders, a nonpartisan nonprofit group mobilizing voters 25 and under. 
 So the debate about ''saving Social Security'' seems irrelevant, he said, another example of an out-of-touch political culture, dominated by gray-haired stiffs who can't even set up their own e-mail accounts, let alone balance the budget. 
 ''It's not being fought about at our level,'' Mr. Schnirman said. ''It's at the grass tops, or Astroturf -- big phony 527's against other big phony 527's, like the AARP against USA Next,'' he said, referring to independent groups that run issue advertising. 
 Such cynicism, of course, is partly why politicians tend to ignore young people in the first place. But the president lacks that option, because he needs all the support he can muster. So, according to Mr. Schnirman and others, the first thing he needs to do is get out of the way. 
 Mr. Hillsman also placed emphasis on who delivers the message to young people. ''If you've got a demographic group that rejected or didn't embrace the chosen spokesperson for what you're trying to sell, you better find a better salesperson,'' he said.
 Some suggest replacing Mr. Bush with a star offering broader appeal -- like Donald Trump or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Or, the advice goes, the administration should focus on generational peers. ''Typically, young people themselves have more credibility, talking to each other,'' said William Galston, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, a youth-focused political research group. 
 But others argue that it's more important to change the message. Mr. Schnirman points out that the current White House sales pitch is dominated by stilted speeches and blobs of numbers about payouts, trust funds and dates like 2018 and 2042. ''You can't taste it or touch it,'' Mr. Schnirman said. ''It's very abstract.''
 A better approach, said Jennifer Colman, director of strategy for Wieden & Kennedy, the advertising agency for Nike, ESPN and Powerade, would be to hammer exclusively on the costs that are already being paid. Identify the Social Security deductions that shrink the salaries of every waitress, administrative assistant and entry-level analyst in the country, and make that money matter today, right now. 
 ''If the dialogue was about that line item,'' Ms. Colman said, ''that amount in your paycheck that you're not getting and may never get, that's the only sense of immediacy you can get with Social Security. That's probably the only hope, because it's an immediate concern.'' 
 Or why not try capitalizing on cynicism? Anti-smoking groups exploited that emotion effectively with their ''Truth'' advertisements, which highlighted the lies and dubious tactics used by the tobacco industry. A study found that those ads prevented about 300,000 youths from becoming smokers between 2000 and 2002.
 ''When you can point out to young people that someone is trying to pull the wool over their eyes, that works,'' Mr. Hillsman said. 
 Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman, said the administration is considering an array of options to reach young workers. ''We're very sensitive to it,'' he said. ''We will be doing lots of new and different messaging over the coming week, and talking to young people more directly.''
 And Republicans are aware that liberal advocacy groups will provide lots of competition. In a March 1 memo on Social Security, Rick Santorum, the No.3 Republican in the Senate leadership, wrote, ''We must be ready to defend against the MTV crowd and its partnerships with AARP, Moveon.org and the like.'' 
 Indeed, Rock the Vote, a liberal group that opposes the president's plan, will soon roll out an Internet and television ad campaign with the theme, ''Don't get ripped off.'' 
 To compete, the White House might want to up the ante. Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist and author of ''Irrational Exuberance,'' an examination of the 1990's boom, said that for this generation, the investment options Mr. Bush's plan will probably offer -- low-risk bonds and stock-index funds -- are ''pretty dull,'' especially compared to the freedom people have when they invest online or with their 401(k) plans. 
 Young workers, he said, are likely to see the plans as paternalistic, designed by and for their parents. The White House, Mr. Shiller said, might consider offering economic transformation, in the form of more money to invest, or more options. 
 ''Young people today are captivated by poker,'' Mr. Shiller said. ''All this excitement that the president wants young people to feel can only happen when they are playing the game.''

HEADLINE: Williamsburg Reinvented

BYLINE: By ANNA BAHNEY

 BODY:
IN the last decade, Williamsburg in Brooklyn has been a first stop for young people new to the city, just out of college. As they have grown up, the neighborhood has too, evolving from dive bars and movie rental joints to chic sushi restaurants and designer furniture emporiums. 
 Most of these Williamsburg devotees are now young professionals, often working in creative fields. They tend to be in their 20's and 30's and earning $60,000 to $150,000 a year, according to David Maundrell, president of Aptsandlofts.com, a real estate company in Williamsburg. 
 ''It is a small town of late 20- to 30-somethings,'' said Mr. Maundrell, who is 30 and grew up in East Williamsburg. ''They recognize people on the train going to work in the morning. Saturday mornings you go to walk your dog and get your coffee at 8 in the morning and someone else has the same routine.'' 
 In an area with little real estate to buy, these renters have been hungering for some equity of their own in a neighborhood that has become home, and not just a stopping-off point. 
 They are about to get their wish.
 This little hamlet is going to get bigger. Like a whole town bigger. Imagine all the owner-occupied housing stock of a town like Princeton, N.J., moved to this part of Brooklyn. Twice.
 More than 130 buildings are currently planned in Williamsburg and Greenpoint, the neighboring area to the north. They are but a curtain raiser for the large-scale waterfront developments that are anticipated with the proposed rezoning along the East River that will transform 75 blocks from industrial to residential use. Last Monday, the plan was approved by the New York City Planning Commission and now makes the next and last stop in the City Council before an expected approval in May. 
 The buildings under construction now -- some small, and tucked between low-slung neighbors, others rising above the rooftops with more than 200 apartments -- are just the beginning of a transformation that will some day make the neighborhood look very little like Brooklyn, and more like parts of the far West Village, with sleek glass high-rise buildings and waterfront residences. 
 Elan Padeh, the president and chief executive of the Developers Group, a consulting and marketing firm with 30 projects currently planned in this area, estimates that in the next two years there will be 3,000 to 4,000 new units in Williamsburg and Greenpoint. ''In the next four to five years,'' he said, ''10,000 to 12,000.''
 For people who are not only priced out of Manhattan, but shut out of the brownstone neighborhoods of Brooklyn like Park Slope or Brooklyn Heights because of price creep, the idea of a deluge of new construction is seductive: it will sell for $500 to $700 a square foot, half the price of Manhattan, and the tax abatements of 15 to 25 years will lower monthly costs. With a 30-year fixed mortgage on a $399,000 two-bedroom apartment with a tax abatement, buyers will spend about $2,500 a month, about the same as they would spend on rent in the neighborhood.
 But it isn't just economics. It is also aesthetics. 
 ''I like to design and build my space,'' said Jennifer Chan, 30, an architect who recently signed a contract on a one-bedroom apartment with high ceilings and a mezzanine in the Union Lofts building on South Second Street, around the corner from where she has lived for four years. ''It seemed like enough of a blank slate.''
 She said she had looked in Queens and other areas of Brooklyn for something that she could renovate, but after weighing the money and time decided that ''it seemed a lot more affordable to buy new construction.'' And she wanted to stay in Williamsburg. ''I'm very attached because my friends are there, the base of my social network,'' she said.
 Mr. Maundrell said he sees it all the time in his buyers. ''These people don't want to live in brownstone Brooklyn,'' he said. ''They are individuals or young couples. They aren't going to have much in common with the 50-year-old couple in Brooklyn Heights. Park Slope is another world. They look in Dumbo a little. But Dumbo doesn't have the sense of community.'' 
 Other brokers agree. ''Aesthetically, Park Slope is beautiful, but if you don't want to live in a house from 1860 and don't like gargoyles, it isn't for you,'' said Kara Kasper, an agent with the Corcoran Group who specializes in Williamsburg. ''To people coming from the East Village, Williamsburg feels like home and Park Slope feels like the suburbs.''
 But with so many developers breaking ground across the 11222 and 11211 ZIP codes and hiring architects with typically contemporary notions, will that community and cultural sensibility be maintained? Or will it run out in a wash of construction?
 They are building from Broadway in South Williamsburg, where the smoky aroma from the Peter Luger Steak House wafts, to the far northern reaches of Greenpoint and deep into East Williamsburg, where leafy streets like Ten Eyck and Scholes Streets recall ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' by Betty Smith. With most of the vacant lots already built on, three-story vinyl-clad houses and two-story garages are being replaced by glass towers that mimic those sprouting in Manhattan. 
 Many developers are rushing to get foundations laid to take advantage of existing zoning. New height limitations will go into effect when the new zoning plan is approved. Others are simply trying to capitalize on the interest in the market. 
 The neighborhood has come a long way in the past five years. Developers were long dubious that anyone would do anything but rent in Williamsburg. Originally, the conversion of the Smith Gray Building at 138 Broadway in 2001 was conceived as rentals. Mr. Padeh, who was with the Corcoran Group at the time and worked on the project, said that when the owner decided to sell the units, the expected price was $375 a square foot. The building sold for an average of $455 a square foot. (A 1,997-square-foot, three-bedroom penthouse is now available for $1.55 million, or $776 a square foot.)
 ''Based off of that success, the Gretsch Building was developed,'' Mr. Padeh said. ''No one would have taken a shot if 138 Broadway would have flopped.''
 The Gretsch Building, a 130-unit luxury building at 60 Broadway, was first offered for sale at the end of 2003 and sold for an average of $575 a square foot.
 Many of the largest developments in Williamsburg have not been done in the neighborhood's prime areas, which Mr. Padeh describes as the area immediately surrounding the L line subway station at North Seventh Street and Bedford Avenue, the streets on the perimeter of McCarren Park and, of course, the waterfront.
 Those who do sell apartments in the prime areas will get a premium. One building, an eight-unit building at 171 North Seventh Street, about 20 steps from the subway, recently sold for $735 a square foot. 
 Not long ago, North and South Williamsburg were areas where people could find deals. Now, they are just another option. The best bargains are in East Williamsburg, where buildings in territory better known as ''second stop'' and ''third stop'' on the L are selling out in a matter of days. 
 During an open house last week in East Williamsburg at a new condo building called the Nola, young buyers traipsed out into the cold and cooed at the view as the skyline of Manhattan turned pink on its jagged edges. 
 By the end of his first weekend of showings at the Nola, Mr. Maundrell, whose firm is selling the apartments, had accepted offers for seven of the eight units ranging from $399,000 to $650,000. Mr. Maundrell keeps a list of interested buyers and holds open houses for people to have an advance look at property coming to market. Next week he will have an open house for those on the reserve list for an 11-unit building on Ten Eyck Street with views of Manhattan called Tower 78. His list is already 200 people long.
 East Williamsburg became a viable place to sell, he said, when Manhattan went ''through the roof.'' And it helps, he said, that the new buildings have appealing design.
 Robert M. Scarano Jr., an architect based in Dumbo whose 60-person firm is leading the way, is working on 100 buildings in East Williamsburg alone. With a following mainly gained through word of mouth and support from developers who have seen the firm's work, Mr. Scarano does not have an exclusive broker for the properties but works with Corcoran, Prudential Douglas Elliman, the Developers Group and Aptsandlofts.com. ''We're like a Switzerland,'' he said.
 But the firm is really more like a young United Nations with architects, whose average age is 29, pulled from around the world. Thumbing through a two-inch-high pile of papers on a file shelf he said: ''This? This year's resumes.'' Moving to the shelf below it with a similarly intimidating pile, ''Last year's resumes.'' 
 It is no surprise. Mr. Scarano bestows an incredible amount of responsibility on his young staff, whom he wisely dispatches to design for people like themselves. 
 When Carmen Larach, a 25-year-old Honduras-born architect at the firm who lives in Greenpoint, finished designing 171 North Seventh Street with double heights and mezzanines, she knew exactly which unit she would love to live in. The top level, east side. ''The developers said, 'Let me make money on this one.' Maybe next time I can have one,'' she said. 
 In Mr. Scarano's office, one wall is all but covered with renderings. The mode for Scarano projects in Williamsburg and Greenpoint is a layered contemporary exterior with glass curtain walls. The quality of the finishes varies, based on the building, but stainless-steel appliances and granite countertops are practically standard issue. Buyers also want high ceilings, lots of light and outdoor space, he said. 
 Mr. Scarano is excited about the future of the waterfront and anticipates building in the rezoned area. He credits the likely changes to Amanda Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission. She ''is doing for Williamsburg what C. Virginia Fields did for Frederick Douglass Boulevard'' in Harlem, he said. 
 Of course, with so much building, everyone involved is wary of saturation. 
 Karl Fischer, the architect who designed the conversion of the Gretsch Building, has two of the most ambitious current projects: four buildings on Bayard Street, which runs along one side of McCarren Park, and a waterfront complex, Schaefer Landing, a joint venture with Gene Kaufman, an architect. He expects that the market will be flooded within a year or two after the rezoning takes effect. 
 ''It will actually be very good for the buyer,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''They will be able to shop around and have lots of product to choose from. Developers will have to try different things to compete.''
 For all its emulation of that island across the river, this northern knob of Brooklyn will remain the anti-Manhattan in at least one sense: it's a buyer's market.

What's Available in Williamsburg

HEADLINE: All-Garden Alert! Aliens Have Landed!

BYLINE: By TOVAH MARTIN

 BODY:
MOST gardeners realize that when they plant a new patch of valerian, they risk offending some people's nostrils or they might disturb many of the neatniks in the neighborhood. But most residents of Connecticut aren't aware that if they purchase and transplant Valeriana officinalis (aka garden heliotrope), they are also in violation of Connecticut law.
 Valerian is one of the more commonly grown of the 61 non-native plants banned in Public Act No. 04-203 that came into effect in October 2004. Many of these plants with weedlike tendencies already have a longstanding reputation as thugs. 
 The law inflicts a $100 fine per plant for importing, moving, selling, buying, distributing and transplanting the banned plants. At present, thought, no person or agency enforces the law, and the fine is as contentious an issue as the ban. 
 Their crime? The banned plants are all non-natives (horrific though poison ivy might be, it is native and therefore is not on the banned list; ditto for the wild grape). All these aliens have become naturalized or occur without being planted. In other words, they've broken loose from gardens; they are wild. They spread rapidly by many reproductive methods under all sorts of growing conditions. And, here's the rub: they bully out natural plants. A full list is available on www.hort.uconn.edu/cipwg. 
 Oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum) and garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) commonly stage such reprehensible territorial takeovers that they've sullied their character with most people marginally aware of plant identification. Such ne'er-do-wells are not commonly on the market and no one in their right mind plants them on purpose. However, some of the flowering plants, vines, shrubs and trees on the list of offenders will come as a surprise perhaps even a shock to many state residents.
 Even the most astute gardeners might not realize that their Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), Scotch thistle (Onopordum acanthium), ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea), dame's rocket (Hesperis matronalis), cypress spurge (Euphorbia cyparissias) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi) are botanical bandits. These and many other plants occasionally found in gardens are on the banned list. 
 Those gardeners who innocently add these botanical disciplinary problems to their yards not only court disaster on their own plot of land, but they can also wreak havoc elsewhere if seed is dispersed by wind, birds or other methods. As a result, invasive plants are deemed the second greatest environmental problem in the state, right behind the decline of open spaces.
 To tackle the issue, the Connecticut Invasive Plants Council was established in 2003, a committee of nine members representing diverse constituencies. The council studies and makes recommendations on which plants are invasive. 
 After much research ''the homework has definitely been done,'' according to Les Mehrhoff, of Willington and one of the council members, about the 61 plants shown to be such nuisances or potential nuisances to the environment that legislation was warranted.
 Although the banned plants are not economically important crops in this state, the 20 to be added in October of this year concern the nursery industry. Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), border privet (Ligustrum obtusifolium), yellow iris (Iris pseudacorus) and Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) are among those commonly sold by nurseries but soon to be banned . The council is expected to recommend banning 15 additional plants, which will likely be a more volatile issue for nurseries. ''Some of these are big sellers,'' said Dr. Mehrhoff. ''But there has been a lot of work done documenting the invasiveness of these species. I don't understand how people can still say that these plants are not causing an environmental problem.''
 In the near future, there will be discussion concerning the banning of Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii) and its cultivars, which account for estimated annual retail sales amounting to nearly $5 million in Connecticut alone. The industry chalks up $4,490,000 in annual retail sales of burning bush (Euonymus alatus), also on the verge of being banned. 
 Many nurseries and merchants feel that they have been unduly targeted. 
 Bob Heffernan, executive director of Connecticut Green Industries, said, ''For the past three years, the state's response to the invasive plants problem has drifted off in a counterproductive direction, sadly preoccupied with penalizing and targeting flower shops, greenhouses, garden centers, nurseries and landscapers, instead of investing its energies and resources in solutions that really work.
 ''Management, eradication and public education -- those would be methods that work,'' he added. 
 Mr. Heffernan is strongly opposed to the ban approach, arguing that ''over 95 percent of the spread of invasive plants occurs naturally and innocently by wind, birds and uninformed people. No law can regulate a natural force.'' 
 Before the ban, Oliver Nurseries of Fairfield enacted their own voluntary moratorium of trees, shrubs and plants on the state's list of invaders. 
 ''We haven't experienced any loss of sales,'' said Jed Duguid, nursery manager at Oliver Nurseries. 
 Instead of such problematic plants as barberry and burning bush, Mr. Duguid steered his customers toward aronia, itea and spiraea. 
 In the case of barberry and burning bush, there are many varieties of the two plants sold at nurseries. Many in the nursery industry believe that the varieties, or cultivars, aren't as invasive as the parent species of the plant and they should be allowed to sell them without penalty. 
 Dr. Mehrhoff strongly disagrees. ''You can't separate the invasive tendencies of cultivars from species until scientific evidence proves otherwise,'' he said. In other words, he feels that cultivars are guilty until proven innocent.
 All agree on the necessity of public awareness and education about the problem. No money has been appropriated by the state toward that goal, but several Web sites are dedicated to informing about invasives. In addition to the Web site of the Invasive Plant Working Group, there is also the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England site at www.ipane.org. 
 In December, the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History opened an exhibition on Connecticut invasives. Titled ''Landscape Under Siege: Invasive Plants of Connecticut,'' which will be at the museum for a year. It features botanical paintings by members of the Greater New York Chapter of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators coupled with commentary on the problem . Posters and flyers will also soon be distributed to increase public awareness and aid with identification.
 No one expects homeowners to eradicate all the Japanese knotweed or other banned plants from their property overnight and homeowners would not be fined if the plants were found to already be on their property. 
 ''Nobody's out to make it difficult for land owners on any level,'' Dr. Mehrhoff said. ''But, from this point on, we're going to be more logical about what we're putting on our landscape.''

HEADLINE: Walls That Speak of Status

BYLINE: By GARY SANTANIELLO

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT'S earliest stone walls were, in essence, linear landfills -- haphazardly stacked, post-Colonial piles of stone laboriously cleared from rocky fields by upland farmers. 
 The newest stone walls are a different story. The majority are beautifully designed, carefully crafted complements to residences ranging from million-dollar mansions to modest Capes. And they are ubiquitous. 
 ''Every time you turn around, you see a new one going up,'' said John Giunta, a contractor in Westport who has been building walls for 43 years. 
 Keith Manca, a Danbury home builder who does most of his work in Fairfield, said that in lower Fairfield County stone walls had become a status symbol, like driving a Mercedes-Benz. ''The last couple of years it's been out of control, the amount of stonework going on,'' he said. 
 Many factors are driving this trend. A superheated real estate market is forcing builders to provide additional amenities while motivating homeowners to improve their property. There is a much greater availability and variety of stone, as well as more tradesmen doing the work. There is a renewed appreciation for the iconic ''farmer's walls'' that still cover the state, reminders of its agricultural past. And there is a familiar suburban motivator: envy.
 ''It's almost like trying to keep up with the Joneses,'' said Bill Osborn of Easton, a landscaper who built his own 200-foot wall from stone on his property. 
 Edgar Avila, who learned masonry from his father in his native Ecuador and has owned a masonry and landscaping business in Danbury for six years, said that clients were asking for more than just walls.
 ''People are asking for patios, steps and pillars in the driveway with the stone they see in old-fashioned New England-style walls,'' he said.'' They want them to look like they've been up a long time. Some of my customers are asking for the new kinds, but they don't like it if it looks too perfect.'' 
 Real estate agents explain the phenomenon in terms of curb appeal. 
 ''If you look at how property values have escalated, curb appeal has a lot to do with the value of a property,'' said Joyce Robinson, an agent with William Raveis Real Estate in Westport, ''and stone walls in general are a very appealing part of Connecticut.''
 What is remarkable, real estate agents and builders said, is the extent of stonework being done, particularly in new construction. 
 ''A good portion of the total project now is being spent on stonework,'' said Janet Perreca, an agent with Coldwell Banker Mabel Lamb in New Canaan. ''Buyers are expecting more than a few little bushes when it comes to extras. They want stone walls and pillars.'' 
 Louie Ten, a landscaper based in Westport for 17 years, said, ''Go to any new development, you'll see they're trying to incorporate some stonework into it.''
 Depending on the quality of the home, such masonry can constitute 1 percent to 10 percent of a home's value. ''On a $2 million home, if you spend money on stonework, you'll get a quicker sale and a happier customer,'' Mr. Ten said. 
 Although opinions vary on whether the higher-end demand is builder- or buyer-driven, there is agreement that customers are increasingly demanding and savvy.
 ''In this town especially, people want a certain thing,'' Ms. Perreca said of New Canaan. ''They expect certain things, like stone fronting and expensive detail when they purchase a $2 million starter home.'' 
 Before Lance and Pamela Graber built their house in Westport in 2001, ''We knew we wanted a fair amount of stonework,'' Mr. Graber said. ''We wanted to do something different from what, at the time, was being built around town, which were center-hall Colonials.'' 
 The Grabers also wanted a formal wall in front that reflected the look of the house and blocked noise from the street. 
 ''It's funny, but when we built it we thought it was a little unique,'' Mr. Graber said. ''People always are looking to do something different from what other people are doing, but as more and more do it, there will come a point when everybody's doing it.'' 
 Alyssa and Raymond Mocco had lived in a house on Morehouse Road in Fairfield for four years before having a wall built in front two years ago. Part of the reason was to prevent their young son from wandering into the busy street, but not all of their motivation was practical. 
 ''I grew up with stone walls,'' Mrs. Mocco said. ''My dad, an electrical engineer, built them all over our property in Trumbull. My husband's from New Jersey, and he loves seeing them in the woods all around here.'' 
 ''I just love the way they look,'' she added. ''I love being outside, and unlike a fence, which is man-made, a stone wall makes us feel like we're a part of nature.''
 When Bill Shaffer, an architect in Westport, renovated his house to incorporate an office, he also added a gently sweeping, flat-arch wall made from three kinds of granite fieldstone to the new front of his house. 
 ''As an architect, stonework has always been a big part of my thinking,'' he said. ''There's a timeless quality to it. It gives a home character and permanence that today's materials don't. I think professionals are pushing stone because it's a beautiful material. It's natural, and you don't have to worry about maintenance.'' 
 It is also one of the few building materials that look better over time. ''The older it gets, the better it looks,'' Mr. Manca said. ''It disappears into the landscape.'' 
 Mr. Ten characterized the interest in stonework as a ''follow the leader type of thing.'' After he built a stone wall along the sides of his 300-foot driveway, he said: ''Every single neighbor came up to me and said, 'Can you do something like that for me?' They can see it's a dramatic change.'' 
 The cost varies widely. For her 150-foot-long, 3-foot-tall wall, Mrs. Mocco received estimates from $9,000 (labor only) to $25,000 (labor and materials).
 Depending on the stone, the terrain, the experience of the mason and the complexity of the wall, the overall construction can cost from less than $10 per square foot to more than $100, and Mr. Giunta said his rates had run as high as $150 per square foot because of the stone involved. 
 Mr. Giunta said that although it seemed as if every landscaper were doing stone walls, ''there are a lot of skilled people out there doing it now.''
 ''Some of the people from Brazil and Mexico are craftsmen,'' he added. ''They're good.'' 
 Mr. Ten said there was much ''phenomenal work being done; a lot of techniques, a lot of styles.'' 
 ''But,'' he added, ''there are some walls, a deer clips its hoof on the wall and part of it falls down.'' 
 The stone, including used or reclaimed stone, is readily available from suppliers throughout the state. Because of the popularity of old stones, though, some have been stolen from existing walls. Robert Thorson, a geology professor at the University of Connecticut and author of three books on stone walls, said he had heard many accounts of such pilfery, including one in which a woman noticed a commuter stopping at her wall and taking one old stone each day.
 Although the majority of the newest walls are built with aesthetics or economics in mind, some arise from more prosaic reasons. When Mr. Osborn found himself with surplus stone, he started rebuilding a wall on the edge of his property that had fallen into disrepair. ''It's almost up to my chin in some places, and the base is five feet wide,'' he said. ''I call in the Great Wall of China -- you can walk on it.'' 
 From an 800-foot wall on Beachfront Avenue in Westport to a job in Redding that took more than two years to complete (''Fireplaces, terraces, the whole package''), Mr. Giunta has done all kinds of high-end masonry, indoors and out. ''I've even done waterfalls inside people's houses,'' he said. 
 Still, the quality and the distinctiveness of the walls today amaze him. ''It's incredible,'' he said, ''how stone is being used now.''

HEADLINE: Markets Take a One-Two Punch and Stocks Fall

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Beset by rising oil prices and a report that consumer confidence has been declining, the three major stock market indexes dropped again last week.
 Crude oil and retail gasoline prices both climbed during the week, while the University of Michigan's preliminary confidence index fell in March, the third consecutive monthly decline. 
Federal Reserve policy makers are expected this week to raise interest rates by another quarter of a percent. 
 Trading volumes were high on Friday because of the expiration of futures and options contracts and a shift in Standard & Poor's method of calculating indexes. 
 Exxon Mobil gained 2.6 percent for the week, the biggest advance in the Dow Jones industrial average. General Motors, which forecast a big quarterly loss, fell 16.7 percent. 
 For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 10.43 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 1,189.65. The Dow fell 144.69 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 10,629.67. The Nasdaq composite index shed 33.81 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 2,007.79. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.51 percent from 4.54 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Crowds? No, Thanks. Same for Grants.

BYLINE: By HUGH EAKIN

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS 

 BODY:
IT sounds like a familiar story. On April 17 the Walker Art Center here will unveil a head-turning $92 million expansion designed by the hot Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. Along with spectacular galleries, it will offer a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, a Wi-Fi-networked lounge and enough sex appeal to turn the place into the most talked-about new building between the coasts.
 In other words, just another museum banking on some iconic real estate to enhance its brand and ramp up its gate revenues. Or is it? 
 Actually, the point was never to draw huge crowds. The celebrity of the chosen architects was accidental, even a matter of concern. And while one of the most distinctive features of the new building is a technologically sophisticated performance space, it can't hold even 400 people. 
 Welcome to the contrarian world of the Walker, a place that prefers artful provocation to blockbuster entertainment, privileges the obscure and experimental over the tried-and-true, and cultivates a willful insouciance about the forces that govern most big museum establishment. 
 ''We did wonder at times about our sanity,'' said the Walker's director, Kathy Halbreich, as she showed a visitor a new $25 million underground parking garage, punctuated from above by the boxlike housing of a new James Turrell installation. ''But once that retaining wall went in, it was very hard to turn back.'' 
 Like so many other institutions, the Walker has decided to grow a size or two, with all the usual trimmings. But Ms. Halbreich, whose colorfully nonconformist views about contemporary art and its audience have shaped the project from the beginning, has made sure that is where the similarities end. 
 ''Of course it's risky,'' she reflected. Plain-spoken and down-to-earth, Ms. Halbreich, 55, wears her elite-museum-director status lightly. On a recent late-winter morning she was dressed in a beige sweatshirt over jeans. She might easily have passed for one of the workers still hammering away at the building were it not for a pair of chandelier earrings and a large bracelet.
 But she doesn't hide an uncompromising vision and a firm conviction that a free-spirited institution in the Upper Midwest, well away from the East and West Coast bastions of the art world, is best equipped to carry it out. Among other things, her insistence on creative independence has meant turning down a chance at tens of millions of dollars in state support, despite a financial crisis that has crippled the Walker's endowment and led to painful staff cuts. 
 ''There are very few places that would be as idealistic as we are in building this,'' said Ms. Halbreich, who was raised in New York City and was the first curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston before taking over the Walker in 1991. Although she has been a curator of acclaimed shows of marquee artists like Bruce Nauman and Chantal Ackerman, she is fond of ripping into hierarchies of taste, prestige and genres that often prevail elsewhere. (At a recent panel discussion she playfully contradicted two fellow museum directors, Glenn D. Lowry of the Museum of Modern Art and Philippe de Montebello of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, commenting that ''part of the alienation people feel'' from the art world is the ''authority that our institutions bear almost to a fault.'')
 But idealism has a long pedigree at the Walker, which has evolved in a city known for its outsize arts patronage. For decades the center has flourished as an alternative to conventional art museums and rarely witnessed excessive lines at the ticket counter. (It attracts more than 400,000 people a year, healthy by contemporary art standards.) 
 Under Martin Friedman, the former director, the center became one of the most exciting places to see emerging talent. Merce Cunningham and John Cage performed here in the mid-1960's , when they were not much more than a wandering bus caravan. In 1986 the Walker presented the first museum show devoted to the designs of a still widely unknown Frank Gehry. More recently Ms. Halbreich -- with an ambitious new team of curators -- has embraced non-Western art, introducing visitors to such world talent as the Ethiopian artist Julie Mehretu and (later this year) the Chinese painter Huang Yong Ping, while encouraging established names like Dan Graham and Shirin Neshat to explore different genres.
 At the same time, she has introduced programs to draw teenagers, local artists and members of Minneapolis's booming immigrant population. 
 ''Kathy has created a completely utopian institution that also happens to be a large, well-functioning museum,'' said the New York art dealer Barbara Gladstone. 
 But by the late 1990's the Walker had long since outgrown its restrained modernist home, designed in 1971 by Edward Larrabee Barnes. The challenge of the expansion, Ms. Halbreich said, was to create a physical form for the Walker's open-ended programming -- and figure out how to pay for it. Museum officials quickly hit it off with Mr. Herzog and Mr. de Meuron, but they kept looking because, as the chief curator, Richard Flood, explained: ''It was too good. They seemed too gemutlich with us, too soon.'' 
 There was also the issue of the Swiss architects' reputation: having already designed the much-hyped Tate Modern in London, they hardly qualified as the emerging talent that the Walker prides itself on. ''They agonized about this,'' said Thomas Fisher, dean of the architecture college at the University of Minnesota. 
 There was some consolation in the fact that the Herzog and Meuron studio was not a household name -- this will be its first completed American museum. The new structure makes for an exuberant contrast to the building it adjoins. Sheathed in a facade of perforated metal panels interrupted by trapezoidal windows, it is angular but unpredictable; its primary element is a twisted, cantilevered cube that pokes fun at the traditional museum box. 
 Inside, the building is intended to raise similar challenges to museum orthodoxy, with a layout dictated by a system of interconnected moderately sized public passageways rather than by the galleries. Minneapolis suffers from a dearth of indoor public spaces; the Walker's design team set out to make a building that small groups would want to linger in, whether or not they were there for the art.
 ''I've been criticized for saying we looked at Mall of America, and we did,'' Ms. Halbreich said. ''It's not that we wanted to be that, but we wanted to understand it.'' (Mr. Herzog, the architect, prefers to compare the spaces to an Arab bazaar.)
 In the galleries, the Walker deploys its rich holdings in areas like Minimalism, Arte Povera, video and the Fluxus movement to challenge the dominant New York narrative of postwar art. For example, a group of Abstract Expressionist works in the new installation will segue into a series of Gutai action paintings that appear to draw on much the same language but were created by Japanese artists with no knowledge of what was happening in New York. 
 Perhaps the most striking feature of the addition, aside from a museum store that is smaller than before, is the sui-generis performance space. A hybrid of intimate black-box theater and massive high-end stage, it has all the flyspace and technical capabilities of a large contemporary auditorium or opera house, with perhaps a tenth of the seats. The idea is that artists can come to try out new works, which, if successful, can be sent on the road without retrofitting for bigger stages. But there will be no pressure to do crowdpleasing fare. ''If we get 50 people, it will seem like a good audience,'' said Philip Bither, the performing-arts curator. 
 Such artist-centric features are bound to help the Walker keep its creative edge, but who is going to pay for them? 
 Early on Ms. Halbreich decided that the capital campaign for the project should be privately financed, although the state of Minnesota has given sizable support to other arts institutions. With the state government's recent swing to the right, the move has been praised by leaders in traditionally liberal Minneapolis. ''The N.E.A. controversies of the 1990's'' -- fueled by a now-infamous performance piece at the Walker by Ron Athey, an H.I.V.-positive gay man -- ''demonstrated that government help can also mean government interference,'' said R.T. Rybak, the mayor of Minneapolis. (The Walker still receives a modest amount of operations funds from the state and the National Endowment for the Arts.)
 Still, the picture began to look a lot different after 9/11 and the stock market downturn. The Walker's endowment plummeted $62 million -- almost one-third --and attendance fell by a similar margin. The board considered canceling the expansion. In the end, Ms. Halbreich settled on a one-year salary freeze, and, in May 2003, eliminated the Walker's new-media art program and the job of its curator, Steve Dietz. 
 The decision led to an international outcry and called into question whether the Walker was staying true to its mission after all. Instead of spaces devoted to changing shows of new-media art as planned, the new building will offer only a few interactive work stations, designed primarily as learning tools. 
 While calling it ''the toughest personnel decision I have ever made,'' Ms. Halbreich said she did not regret it, and still hopes to revive the program. (Mr. Dietz, contacted by e-mail, declined to comment.)
 Since this setback, Ms. Halbreich has nonetheless been successful in selling her purist mandate to deep-pocketed patrons. The center has raised $87.5 million of its $92 million goal, a large part of it from trustees. And for all her stubborn resistance to market-driven concerns, she has managed to woo such Minneapolis-area corporations as Target, Medtronic, Best Buy and General Mills, several of which are represented on her board. ''It's somewhat counterintuitive,'' said Nazie Eftekhari, a Walker trustee and vice chairwoman of the capital campaign committee. ''Kathy has these conservative organizations acting in a very progressive manner.'' 
 By her own account, Ms. Halbreich has a good deal more business sense than she lets on. But it also doesn't hurt, she said, simply to be forthright. ''I'm honest. People know what my values are,'' she said. 
 She added, ''All we're trying to do is create this very sensuous wrapper for new ideas about the world.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 20 about the expansion of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis under the leadership of its director, Kathy Halbreich, credited her incorrectly with a first. The first curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, was Kenworth Moffett, who held the title part time from 1971 to 1978.

HEADLINE: What? They Never Heard Of WorldCom?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WHAT a week. 
 Bernard J. Ebbers, founder of WorldCom, got to add felon to his already colorful curriculum vitae. Maurice R. Greenberg, dictator in chief at American International Group, the global insurance giant, was toppled after almost 40 years at his post. The Federal Reserve told Citigroup it could not make any major acquisitions until it cleaned up its compliance act. And General Motors laid a big, scary earnings egg. 
 Isn't it nice to know these incidents are anomalies and that most American companies are chugging along, reporting good solid earnings?
 Sure would be. But contrary to popular belief, the quality of corporate earnings is on the slide again and, as a result, Richard Bernstein, chief United States strategist at Merrill Lynch, is advising investors to tread carefully.
 ''There is an impression that the quality of earnings has improved dramatically,'' he said. ''That is true relative to the worst levels of post-bubble reporting, but relative to history, the absolute quality of earnings is quite poor.'' 
 And getting poorer.
 Mr. Bernstein reaches this depressing conclusion by analyzing the difference between the earnings that Standard & Poor's 500 companies have reported under generally accepted accounting principles and operating earnings, the figures companies typically trumpet because they do not include write-offs and other unusual items. 
 The difference between the two figures, Mr. Bernstein says, is the G.A.A.P. gap. 
 And it is widening. In the most recent period -- the fourth quarter of 2004 -- the gap was 13.7 percent. In other words, operating earnings were on average 13.7 percent higher than reported earnings. While that figure is well down from the 40 percent gap reached in 2002, it is much higher than the long-term, pre-bubble average of 6.7 percent. 
 The result: while stock valuations may not be so high as they were before the bubble burst, the quality of earnings appears to be worse. 
 Of course, none of this might matter if investors bought stocks based on G.A.A.P. earnings. But too many buy shares based on what companies report in their press releases and on their quarterly conference calls, which are often heavily skewed to earnings before the bad stuff. 
 ''The fact is, stocks trade on press releases, on what the headline number is,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''And on the conference calls, companies talk about whatever numbers they want to talk about. Investors should still be very skeptical of the quality of earnings.''
 Mr. Bernstein said that he thought the recent downturn in earnings quality began, not surprisingly, a couple of quarters ago, when the profit surge started to subside. ''If times are good, companies are not under pressure to keep their growth profile up,'' he said. ''In tough times, when you get a cyclical company that has been coined by the Street as a growth company, it feels pressure to keep up that profile.'' That's when the earnings games usually begin.
 By focusing on operating earnings, rather than on more stringent reported figures, companies try to steer investors away from mistakes such as asset write-downs or restructuring charges. But these factors reflect bad choices by managers -- such as overpriced acquisitions -- and should definitely not be excluded from investors' analyses. 
 ''The difference between operating and reported earnings is an indication of how well executives are managing the balance sheet of their company,'' Mr. Bernstein said. This is often lost on investors who pay little heed to the balance sheet. 
 The five companies with the widest gap between reported earnings and operating income currently, according to the Merrill Lynch analysis, are: Eastman Kodak; Georgia Pacific, a paper products company; Rowan Companies, an oil drilling concern; Ford Motor; and Clorox. 
 Mr. Bernstein said the vast majority of companies with the biggest gaps between reported earnings and operating income are of lesser-quality, those whose common stocks are ranked B or below by S.&P.; among the five with the widest gap, all are rated B or below except Clorox, which is rated A. So investors can often limit their exposure to earnings shenanigans by sticking with high-quality issues. 
 But such a strategy won't offer full protection. As Mr. Bernstein noted, 22 percent of the companies with the largest gaps between reported and operating earnings were rated B+ or better by S.&P. 
 Mr. Bernstein said he thought the earnings games would be curtailed sharply if the Securities and Exchange Commission required that all company communications with investors reflected figures computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Then there would be no confusion among investors about what a particular company really earned in a quarter. 
 ''The reason you have G.A.A.P. is so investors have consistent clear information,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''The U.S. has always prided itself on having the most transparent financial markets. 
 ''But over the past 5 to 10 years, the U.S. market has become more opaque, and foreign markets have become more transparent. That has huge implications for the economy as a whole and for the cost of capital.''

HEADLINE: Understudies Get to Play a Leading Role

BYLINE: By Tanya Mohn. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ON a brisk afternoon recently, six actors and a stage manager arrived promptly for auditions at Middle School 201/Star Academy in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. The actors were not trying out for roles on Broadway or in a film; they were hoping to land jobs as substitute teachers.
 In an environment where finding qualified teachers is hard enough, and finding good substitutes even harder, a program based in the heart of the South Bronx has begun recruiting professional actors as substitute teachers to help children improve literacy and gain self-confidence. 
 ''They exchange hats, learning from each other,'' Howard Katzoff, a teacher and the coordinator for the program, Starrr Drama, an acronym for Substitute Teachers for the Arts and the three R's, said of the two seemingly disparate groups: trained actors in need of regular income and students in need of enrichment. 
 Instead of a nonproductive day, which is often the norm when teachers are absent and substitutes are brought in, students learn playwriting and storytelling and the actors gain valuable training and flexible work that pays $127 a day.
 John Herrera, who has been a substitute teacher for more than a year in the Starrr program, appeared last spring in the New York Philharmonic's production of ''Candide'' at Lincoln Center and was able to teach during the day and perform at night. He returned to the classroom after spending most of last fall performing out of town in ''Anna in the Tropics.''
 He recently taught a class of eighth graders at M.S. 201, one of several schools where he regularly substitutes, gearing his lesson around ''The Green Bean Patch,'' a short story that was set in East Africa during a famine and was excerpted from a play by Jonathan Kariara.
 In the morning, the class read the story aloud, then broke into groups to write scripts based on the story. After lunch, some students read the draft scripts aloud while others listened and critiqued.
 ''I never knew I could do it,'' said Ada Cuevas, 13, whose brief performance as a woman whose son dies brought a noticeable hush to the room. 
 Isaac Ofori, also 13, was the lead playwright for one script chosen to be performed. He said that when his class usually has substitute teachers, ''it's the same old thing, day in, day out.'' 
 But, he added, ''When we get a sub like this, we learn something new and even fun.'' 
 Mr. Herrera stayed after class to meet with the actors who had come to try out for jobs as substitutes, explaining that he chose an African folk tale because he felt that the students, who come from different backgrounds, could relate to it. He also told the actors how he used theater exercises -- including having the students clap and stamp their feet in patterns -- to help them develop their concentration and to relieve stress at the end of a long day. 
 ''Sometimes you feel like you're doing missionaries' work,'' Mr. Herrera said, explaining that few in the class had ever gone to a play. ''But by the afternoon, they were actable.''
 The seven substitute-teacher candidates who auditioned had selected a Langston Hughes poem to show how they would teach literacy skills.
 ''It's a workout for acting skills,'' Mr. Katzoff said, explaining that the challenge for the actors is in interpreting works imaginatively and holding the attention of their young audience.
 Mr. Katzoff said he first considered hiring retired teachers as substitutes, but a drama teacher suggested actors. New York had struggling actors on every corner with the confidence and the communication skills to work in a classroom, Mr. Katzoff thought, and hiring them would also allow him to bring some drama instruction to schools that did not have regular programs. 
 Mr. Katzoff ''showed up on my doorstep,'' recalled Kathy Schrier, managing director of the Actors' Work Program, which is run by the Actors' Fund of America. The program founded Starrr in partnership with Region 2 of the New York City Department of Education. 
 A pilot program that was started in February 2003 in two schools has grown to include 14 elementary and middle schools. Fifty actors have been trained and licensed as substitute teachers. Some have gone on to become full-time teachers.
 ''The bottom line is, it's a program that works,'' Ms. Schrier said. ''Everybody benefits.''

HEADLINE: Gabreski Proposal Faces Hurdles

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

DATELINE: WESTHAMPTON BEACH 

 BODY:
SUFFOLK COUNTY and the Town of Southampton Town have joined forces to develop a 58-acre commercial and industrial park at the county-owned Gabreski Airport. They predict that the continued presence at the airport of the Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing and New York State's proposed homeland security training center would help attract defense-related businesses.
 The problem is, the training center is supposed to be built upstate, and the 106th Rescue Wing has been identified as a possible target of a federal commission charged with identifying military installations that should be closed or consolidated. 
 At a news conference on Monday, Steve Levy, the county executive; Patrick Heaney, Southampton's town supervisor; and a contingent of county officials outlined the reasons they hoped that a section of the 1,400-acre airport, largely neglected by county officials in the past, would be transformed into a thriving economic hub. 
 They said the county and town have resolved longstanding differences over zoning restrictions and potential uses for the land. The master plan the town expects to finish by mid-May calls for 14 lots and about 350,000 square feet of industrial space on the west side of the airport, which is between Sunrise Highway and the Long Island Rail Road tracks. If fully leased, the park could bring 600 to 900 new jobs to Long Island, they said.
 Mr. Levy said that $2.5 million in county money was earmarked for infrastructure improvements, that an additional $3.5 million was available to promote the park to high-tech companies, and that the potential existed for economic and tax incentives to prospective tenants. And, he said, prospective tenants, including Northrop Grumman, have already begun inquiring.
 ''This spot is an economic development jewel,'' Mr. Levy said. ''We consider this an incredible untapped potential.''
 But in his State of the State address in January, Governor Pataki named the Mohawk Valley as the location for the homeland security training center. 
 The airport's neighbors, who have been vehement in their complaints about noise from planes, are leery of further development. Noting that the zoning change would allow higher-density development, Albert Algieri, the president of the East Quogue Association, wondered aloud how residents would benefit.
 ''I find it very hard to believe it won't increase airplane traffic,'' Mr. Algieri said. ''That airport would be a major asset to a plan like this, so why wouldn't the tenants take advantage of it?''
 Sharon Frost, the president of the residents association of Hampton West Estates, across the street from the airport, said she did not see how a homeland security training center or a commercial and industrial park would be compatible with the semi-rural neighborhood.
 ''I understand the importance of creating professional jobs here,'' she said. ''I hate to think my sons have to move away to get decent jobs. But compatible growth in a small community doesn't mean adding 900 new jobs.'' 
 Ken Brown, a spokesman for the state's Office of Homeland Security, said the state had allocated $1 million in federal money to develop a plan for a center where police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers would be trained. ''Currently the state is focused on a centralized training center located in the Mohawk Valley,'' he said.
 Mr. Levy said that two weeks ago he wrote to the governor and to state legislators from Long Island to promote Gabreski as a possible training center site. He acknowledged that a lobbying effort would have been more likely to bear fruit if the governor had not already expressed a preference for the Mohawk Valley. But he said that a mix of businesses with defense contracts, an airport, the 106th Rescue Wing and major transportation routes would create a synergy that would be hard for the state to ignore.
 And in case there's no changing the governor's mind, Mr. Levy said he would push for a Gabreski annex to the training center. 
 Mr. Levy said he was optimistic that the 88-acre Air National Guard base would survive the next round of closures, the sixth since the base closure commission was established in 1988. Hank Beck, the head of the Gabreski Rescue Initiative Partnership, an organization of business and civic leaders, insisted that the 106th could be saved by an intense yearlong lobbying effort directed at the Pentagon, which will submit to the closure commission a list of bases that could be closed. 
 ''If you asked a year ago, I would have said I was cautiously pessimistic,'' said Mr. Beck, who is also the president of the Greater Westhampton Chamber of Commerce. ''That's improved to cautiously optimistic.''
 New York's two senators, along with federal and state legislators and Governor Pataki, want to keep the 106th Rescue Wing on Long Island. Though the Coast Guard has primary responsibility for searches at sea, the 106th, which has 1,275 employees, is the closest search-and-rescue helicopter unit for most of the waters around Long Island. The nearest Coast Guard choppers are in Rhode Island and New Jersey. 
 Mr. Beck said his group had 20,000 signatures on its petitions and a study outlining the base's economic benefit to the community. But the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission was designed to be immune to lobbying and political pressure. It is expected to make its recommendations to President Bush in September on which bases to close. If the president approves, Congress would then have until November to accept or reject the list, but not to edit it.

HEADLINE: Up for Re-election, And Maybe More

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
SURPRISES were absent from the agenda Thomas R. Suozzi described in his State of the County address on Monday. Not that he needed any. In most circles, fixing Nassau County, fixing Albany and reinventing the concept of suburbia would be considered a full plate.
 Although much of his agenda has been known for months and much of it concerns long-range projects, Mr. Suozzi, the county executive, has a long to-do list in 2005. The announced tasks include lobbying for a cap on the counties' share of Medicaid expenditures, pushing ahead with the Nassau Hub project and laying out what he described in his speech as a ''master plan for the future development of all of Nassau.''
 But there are other items he didn't mention in the speech. Undoubtedly, Mr. Suozzi has set his sights on being re-elected in November, and he invariably tells questioners that he is focused on his job as county executive. But such assurances have not slowed the rumor that he's thinking about a run for governor in 2006. Whether true or not, the rumor is already playing a role in how his actions are perceived, and might be a factor in the 2005 election. 
 In keeping with the scale of his ambitions, he quoted Teddy Roosevelt on Monday on the subject of daring mighty things. But some look at the agenda with skepticism, seeing it as an attempt to create an instant legacy that will propel him to statewide attention and then to the governor's office in 2006. They assert that a ''too much too soon'' agenda cannot be sustained for long.
 ''He's got more balls in the air than a circus juggler,'' said Desmond Ryan, a Republican lobbyist.
 Both the plans and the criticism go back some time. The Fix Albany campaign, opposing the rapid growth of state-mandated expenses and threatening political retaliation against officials who support it, is more than a year old now. Likewise, Mr. Suozzi has been honing his concept of ''new suburbia'' -- maintaining quality of life in a suburban county that has ceased to grow -- since the first year of his term. 
 But much has happened since then. Fix Albany drew its first blood when Mr. Suozzi's hand-picked candidate defeated a Democratic incumbent in a State Assemby primary in Mr. Suozzi's home district last September. Some Democrats were angered by Mr. Suozzi's tactics, but reform became the buzzword in Albany, a development Mr. Suozzi claims is at least partly a result of his pressure.
 In December, Mr. Suozzi became president of New York State County Executives Association, and immediately engaged in backroom negotiations about Medicaid with Governor Pataki and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly, Joseph Bruno and Sheldon Silver. Though he will not comment on what went on in these discussions, he points out that Medicaid was the centerpiece of the governor's state of the state address in January. Some legislators and other county leaders, on the other hand, say that the struggle over Medicaid has been going on for years.
 For the past few weeks, Mr. Suozzi and other county executives have been holding news conferences and rallies across the state to draw attention to their demand for a cap on the local share of Medicaid. On a snowy Wednesday morning earlier this month, he was standing on a small stage at the civic center in downtown Syracuse, surrounded by county officials from around the state. Mr. Suozzi delivered a speech about the burden of local property taxes on New York citizens, citing a flurry of statistics buttressing his argument that Medicaid programs in other states are fairer to county governments. Flanking the stage were maps of New York State that showed which state legislators had pledged support for a cap on county Medicaid expenses, and which had not.
 At a later news conference in Rockland County, Mr. Suozzi said that legislators who did not support Medicaid reform would be held accountable. Asked if that meant he could be targeting more incumbents, Mr. Suozzi said yes, but emphasized that that was his position, not the position of the county executives' association.
 The fruits of this crusade will be known in the coming months when the Legislature passes a budget. What was clear from Mr. Suozzi's upstate excursions was that Medicaid is already the principal concern of many county governments. Despite his Fix Albany success and his activism as head of the association, Mr. Suozzi may have a hard time being seen as the leader on the issue statewide.
 Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive and one who has been mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for governor should Mr. Pataki choose not to run, declared at the Syracuse conference that he had become ''the poster child for Medicaid reform.'' And after the event was over, Mark W. Thomas, the Chautauqua county executive and a former president of the county executives association, disagreed with the characterization that the push for Medicaid reform was led by Mr. Suozzi. 
 ''This year we had all decided as county executives that what we want to do is make the pressure much more public,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''That wasn't Tom's decision. That was our decision as county executives.''
 Mr. Suozzi has been mentioned as a possible candidate for statewide office as far back as the late 1990's, when he was still mayor of Glen Cove. He was said to be mulling over a 1998 run for the United States Senate against Alfonse M. D'Amato, a race that Charles Schumer eventually won. Whatever Mr. Suozzi is thinking now, many are convinced that he will try to move up the political ladder. 
 While Nassau Democrats insist that Mr. Suozzi has not announced any plans, they admit that a run for higher office is not unthinkable.
 ''He would tell you straight out himself that he's ambitious,'' said Lisanne Altmann, the legislator representing Great Neck. ''We need to be sure that if people start moving up or around or whatever the heck happens, that we have enough potential candidates to continue what he's doing,'' she said, adding that she would be interested succeeding Mr. Suozzi as county executive.
 Republicans, for their part, have already folded Mr. Suozzi's purported ambitions into their campaign strategy. In the statement last month announcing his candidacy, Mr. Suozzi's Republican opponent, Greg Peterson, pointedly remarked that he had ''no further personal political agenda.'' 
 Ed Ward, a Republican spokesman, said the Republicans would be bringing up the issue during the 2005 campaign. ''Voters generally evaluate a candidate as to whether they'll deliver on their promises,'' Mr. Ward said. ''If he's not going to be around in 2006 or he's looking to get out soon after the election for county executive, well, that's going to leave a bad taste in the voters' mouths.'' 
 Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the Nassau County Democrats, said Mr. Schumer's overwhelming victory in his recent Senate race amid talk that he would run for governor was proof that voters understand that ''public officials may, at some time in their future, move on to some high elected office that also serves them as the public.''
 Mr. Jacobs suggested that the conjecture actually works to the county's advantage, and that Mr. Suozzi realizes that. 
 ''I think that Tom is really playing it smart by allowing all of this speculation,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''Is someone more influential if they're under consideration for something higher, or less influential? Would people in high places pay more attention to their needs and requests, or less attention?''
 By far the most daunting obstacle for Mr. Suozzi in a run for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2006 would be Eliot Spitzer, who has declared his candidacy, has the backing of most of the state's Democratic leaders and has drawn national media attention during his aggressive tenure as the state attorney general.
 ''Spitzer is presumptively the candidate,'' said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at SUNY-New Paltz. Dr. Benjamin said a gubernatorial bid by Mr. Suozzi in 2006 would put his name on the map, but that his real chance would be the 2010 election.
 On the other hand, Dr. Benjamin said, Mr. Spitzer's high-profile prosecutions of Wall Street firms have created a wealthy group of antagonists. ''A credible candidacy by Suozzi is financeable because Spitzer has so many people who don't like him,'' Dr. Benjamin said. ''There's big money that will come to any credible opponent.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer has already raised $7.8 million for his gubernatorial run. Mr. Suozzi has $3.1 million on hand, an impressive amount for a Nassau County executive, but he will have to use at least some of it for his re-election campaign.
 Joseph Mondello, the leader of the Nassau Republicans, has pledged to raise $3 million for the November elections. Gary DelaRaba, the head of the Policeman's Benevolent Association, has also said he will raise $3 million to fight candidates whom he considers weak on law-enforcement issues -- a list that would surely include Mr. Suozzi, who has battled Mr. DelaRaba over cuts to the police budget. 
 A variety of political observers, Republicans as well as Democrats, agree that Mr. Suozzi is in a good position for re-election, given the fact that, with the help of a state-imposed fiscal watchdog agency, his administration has pulled the county government back from the brink of bankruptcy. Even the Republicans have acknowledged the county's newfound fiscal health, though they take issue with the tax increase and service cuts, proposed by Mr. Suozzi and backed by the County Legislature's Democratic majority, that made the turnaround possible. 
 Mr. Suozzi has pointed to several indicators of the county's fiscal health: a quick succession of bond rating increases, consecutive budget surpluses and a declining reliance on ''one shot'' revenues to balance the budget. 
 ''That isn't small potatoes,'' Dr. Benjamin said, adding that it could even be enough of an accomplishment to launch a run for governor. 
 On Monday, Mr. Suozzi described his budget-balancing, and the attempt to go three years without raising property taxes, as ''conservatism in the true sense.'' And that raises another election-year issue: the 9,828 registered Conservatives in Nassau County.
 In addition to touting the conservatism of his fiscal policy, Mr. Suozzi spoke at a Conservative Party conference at the end of January. Despite Mr. Suozzi's party affiliation and despite the fact that Mr. Peterson has had the Conservative nomination for all but one of his races in the past, Democratic, Republican and Conservative party officials all agree that this year Mr. Suozzi has a chance at the nomination.
 ''I think his budget is conservative and I think he has had a fiscal conservative outlook during his tenure as county executive,'' said Roger Bogsted, the head of the Nassau Conservative Party and the county's consumer affairs commissioner. Mr. Bogsted denied that he was influenced by his position in Mr. Suozzi's administration.
 Mr. Suozzi has been introducing big-idea proposals over the past year that go far beyond his original mission of righting the county's fiscal ship. 
 ''New Suburbia is a risky strategy because people will try and misrepresent what I've been saying,'' Mr. Suozzi said in an interview as he was riding up to Rockland County for the Medicaid news conference. ''A lot of my advisers suggested I not talk about New Suburbia and next-generation housing.''
 Next-generation housing is Mr. Suozzi's phrase for what many people call affordable housing, and it's an issue taken up by many business and political leaders who are concerned that rising real estate prices are making most of Long Island unaffordable to the workers who form the backbone of the Island's economy. Talk of these issues, and his embrace of Charles Wang's plan to overhaul the Nassau Coliseum and build a 60-story tower next door, have already invited charges that Mr. Suozzi has plans to urbanize Nassau County and bring in low-income housing.
 ''All of these things are designed to boost Tom Suozzi's name recognition and approval and perhaps to use that as leverage to go on from the county executive's office,'' said Bradford O'Hearn, a Democratic consultant.
 Mr. Suozzi says that these ideas are primarily about one thing: taxes. He draws a direct line between the need for Medicaid reform and the growth of local property taxes. He describes New Suburbia as a way to increase tax revenues. 
 In fact, Mr. Suozzi said he was considering holding community forums about tax issues sometime in the future. Already he has been touring the county with his New Suburbia concept, holding forums in 35 ''economic development zones'' charted by his administration.
 A week after the trip to Syracuse, Mr. Suozzi was standing in the auditorium of the New Hyde Park Road School for the 31st forum. New Hyde Park is a traditionally Republican stronghold, one of the few areas in the county that he did not carry in 2001. Some in the crowd seemed hostile to the New Suburbia idea. Others had different priorities; when he opened the floor to discussion, the popular subjects were street sweeping and garbage collection. But everyone agreed in the end, by a show of hands, that the forum had been a good idea.
 Joseph Schilly, a retired Port Authority supervisor who lives in New Hyde Park, said he has yet to make up his mind about Mr. Suozzi but voted for him in 2001 because he was unhappy about the county's direction under the Republican, Thomas S. Gulotta. 
 Before the forum began, Mr. Schilly said the little that he knew about this New Suburbia idea bothered him. When it was over, he said Mr. Suozzi's presentation made some sense, but he still needed some convincing.
 ''We do need things that will enhance our revenue, it's true,'' Mr. Schilly said. ''I just don't see where the revitalization of my little village is going to do that.''
 But he complimented Mr. Suozzi for his persuasiveness. ''If I had six new pairs of good shoes and he was a shoe salesman, I think he could sell me another pair,'' Mr. Schilly said, laughing. ''And I'm very hard on salesmen.''

HEADLINE: Within Commuting Distance of Everywhere Else

BYLINE: By CLAIRE WILSON

 BODY:
WHEN John and Deirdre Hartz were married last summer and wanted a place that was bigger than Mr. Hartz's $650-a-month rental in Queens, there were two things on their wish list. First, that the new apartment be in the Bronx where Ms. Hartz was a teaching fellow. Second, that it be on the No. 6 subway line so Mr. Hartz would have an easy commute to his public relations job in Manhattan. 
 Thinking there might be a nice neighborhood at the end of the No. 6 line like those they knew at the end of the Nos. 1 and 9 lines (Riverdale), and the N and the W lines (Astoria), Ms. Hartz took a ride one Wednesday afternoon to check it out. 
 ''She walked all around the neighborhood, then called me from Pelham Bay Park and said, 'This looks beautiful; we should look for a place here,''' Mr. Hartz recalled. 
 Within weeks, they signed on a spacious $850-a-month one-bedroom apartment in a three-story brick building in Pelham Bay, about a one-minute walk from the Buhre Avenue subway station. The noise from passing trains was a bit unsettling at first, but they were quickly distracted by the convenience to both their jobs and to the park, where the couple trained together for last fall's New York City Marathon and where they jog or ride bicycles on weekends. 
 ''In the summer, I run all the way to Orchard Beach, take a swim in Long Island Sound and run back,'' Mr. Hartz said. It takes him about an hour.
 The rush-hour commute to Manhattan likewise takes about an hour, either by an express bus that costs $5 one-way or by subway from the Pelham Bay Park subway stop, which is also a major local bus hub. This proximity to mass transit as well as to a network of major roadways is a big part of the appeal of the enclave. 
 ''You can go anywhere from here,'' said Dorothy DeMarco, a sales agent and co-owner of Town and Country Homes and Properties. ''Manhattan is 15 minutes by car, Connecticut is 15 minutes and Route 95 to Westchester is accessible.'' 
 The character of the neighborhood has changed little in 35 years, according to many longtime residents who have been in the same spot for decades. Detached and semiattached houses in a broad range of ages and styles on skinny lots line wide streets that are shaded with mature trees. The mix also includes some low-rise apartment buildings and a handful of co-ops and condos. Two- and three-family homes are prevalent and increasing in number as older houses, particularly single-family detached ones, are knocked down to make way for attached and semiattached units with rental incomes. 
 New construction has aggravated an already serious parking problem in the area, and prompted local officials to call for the kind of down-zoning slowly taking effect in Throgs Neck as well as in parts of Queens and Staten Island. According to James Vacca, district manager for Community Board 10, who is running for the City Council seat to be vacated this year by Councilwoman Madeline Provenzano, proposed regulations would help cap population density and require more off-street parking. 
 ''We have higher density housing than we would like and we do not have sufficient parking,'' said Mr. Vacca, who grew up in Pelham Bay. 
 The motto for Pelham Bay could well be, ''Build it and they will come'' -- and buy it. Brokers maintain waiting lists of potential buyers and nothing stays on the market very long, according to Phyllis Basilone, an associate broker with Prudential Kafcos Realty. 
 ''If something is priced right, it sells immediately,'' Ms. Basilone said. When an offer she got fell through recently on a $480,000 five-bedroom two-family detached house, she resold it within days and had a back-up offer to boot, she said. 
 Currently, the prices on older two-families run between $425,000 and $490,000, while new two-families with amenities like fireplaces, several baths, laundry rooms and off-street parking can range from $625,000 to $700,000. Two older, single-family-detached homes now on the market include a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath side hallway colonial for $379,000, and a 1,300-square foot, three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath colonial for $389,000.
 High demand fueled by low mortgage rates and attractive 8- and 15-year tax abatements on new construction have helped double the price of Pelham Bay houses in the last five or six years, according to George Bookis, an owner of Aztec Realty. Taxes that are much lower than in Westchester have buyers returning south. 
 New condominiums in the area include a 21-unit, seven-story building on Parkview Avenue. One-bedroom, one-bath units sold for $175,000 to $205,000, while two-bedroom, one-bath units sold for $175,000 to $305,000. 
 Area co-ops are less expensive, with one-bedroom units ranging from $85,000 to $92,000 and two-bedroom units from $115,000 to $125,000, according to Bill Rizopoulos, a broker with Pel-Bay Realty, who said most buyers for co-ops and condos tend to come from the Bronx and want to stay in the borough. 
 The majority of rental units are in two- and three-family homes, and start at $850 for a one-bedroom, while a studio would be slightly less. Two-bedrooms run about $1,200 per month, and three-bedrooms are about $1,500 per month. 
 Area families have their choice of schools, which include Public School 14 on Bruckner Boulevard, which teaches kindergarten through Grade 5 and where among fourth-grade students 79.3 percent performed at or above grade level in math, and 49.5 per cent performed at or above grade level in English. Of fourth graders at Public School 71, 72 percent performed at or above grade level in math and 56.3 percent performed at or above grade level in English. 
 Most Pelham Bay children move on to attend Intermediate School 192 on Hollywood Avenue, which teaches Grades 6 to 9. Of all eighth-grade students, 27.7 percent performed at or above grade level in math and 28.1 percent scored at or above grade level in English. Then it's on to Herbert H. Lehman High School, on East Tremont Avenue, where for those students taking the 2003 SAT reasoning test, the average score was 451 in math compared with a statewide average of 510; and 431 on the verbal test, compared with 496 statewide. 
 Roman Catholic schools in the area all teach prekindergarten through grade 8. They include St. Benedict's School on Edison Avenue, Our Lady of the Assumption School on Parkview Avenue, and St. Theresa School on St. Theresa Avenue. 
 At 2,764 acres, Pelham Bay Park is three times the size of Central Park and a virtual paradise for joggers, dog walkers, bike riders and sunbathers. The park also has nine miles of shoreline, part of which includes Orchard Beach. 
 It's the many restaurants in his new neighborhood that do it for Marcos Torres, an investment banker who grew up in Harlem and last year bought a new two-family house in Pelham Bay with fireplaces, balconies and skylights for about $680,000. His favorite brunch spot is the Cross Town Diner on Interstate 95, but for dinner it is Patricia's Pizza and Pasta II on East Tremont Avenue. 
 ''It's such good stuff I feel like I've been lying in the sun for five hours getting a full body massage,'' Mr. Torres said. 
 A newly spiffed up Key Food is the supermarket of choice in Pelham Bay to which the closest major shopping areas are Bay Plaza and the Mall at Bay Plaza on Bartow Avenue, a few miles away. But stores there like Old Navy, J.C. Penney, and Kmart offer little to rival the family-owned businesses along Crosby and Westchester Avenues, where merchants and waiters know their customers by name. 
 Business has never been better at the Pelham Bake Shop & Cafe, where Maria Fumaso, who owns the shop with her husband, Victor, is too busy to think much about the economics of the real estate that surrounds her. 
 ''We have four banks, three Catholic churches and two butchers here, and where there are four banks, there's money,'' she said. ''But real estate around here? That's crazy.''

What Not to Miss
 They may leave the Bronx, but customers always come back to the Pelham Bay Bake Shop and Cafe to stock up on holiday specialties or, year-round, for an espresso and a flaky sfogliatelle, or a creamy cannoli, a bargain at $1.75.

 BODY:
ASK Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey about the surprisingly swift disintegration of the state's negotiations with the New York Giants over a new football stadium in the Meadowlands, and he expresses cautious optimism.
 ''I'm not getting upset about it,'' the governor said in an interview last week. ''At the end of the day, I think we do a deal.'' 
 But mention Xanadu --a five million-square-foot retail, entertainment, hotel and office complex featuring a chocolate waterfall, artificial ski slope and paintball range -- which has butted up against the Giants' plans, and Mr. Codey is considerably less sanguine. 
 ''It's a tough one for me because the Giants have the right to block it,'' said Mr. Codey, who has made it a priority to reach a deal with the Giants, and yet has stated his support for Xanadu. ''And with all due respect to the sports authority,'' he said, referring to the state agency that oversees the Meadowlands Sports Complex, ''that should have been dealt with ahead of time. I was handed a bad deck there.''
 Sensing that he still had not adequately explained the state's handling of Xanadu -- a $1.3 billion complex being developed by the Mills Corporation and Mack-Cali Realty -- he quickly added, ''I would have preferred if the sports authority had gotten signoff from teams before they were off on this adventure, and it can be called an adventure.''
 If nothing else, Mr. Codey's comment was illustrative of how the Xanadu project has become a seemingly unstoppable force, even as it complicates the state's position in the Meadowlands and threatens to turn it into a quagmire of conflicting promises, visions and interests. Indeed, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority gave Xanadu final approval last week.
 Ever since the Giants declared negotiations at a standstill little more than a week ago, the situation has been characterized by wild speculation and every scenario from the Giants moving to a stadium in Manhattan to what turned out to be an offhand joke -- the New York Jets buying Giants stadium. 
 While the Giants have done their menacing best to look sincere about leaving, sports authority officials have signaled their indifference by feeding the media a steady diet of alternate plans involving the Jets. Such possibilities are as likely to be bargaining ploys as serious plans.
 At the moment, the state is awaiting a response from the Giants to a request filed in court to determine the precise nature of its obligation to upgrade the stadium to ''state of the art.'' But if the financing disputes are a simple matter of negotiation and arbitration, the Xanadu question promises to be more intractable.
 According to Giants officials, they were set to come to an agreement with the state, leaving their concerns about the congesting effects of a huge shopping and entertainment complex on game days to a sort of final negotiation with the developers of Xanadu. But to hear them tell it, the talks imploded when the state suddenly demanded that the Giants sign off on Xanadu without addressing concerns that the team says violates the terms of the lease.
 ''There's no way in hell we're going to sign off on Xanadu before we come to agreement with them on how we coexist, especially on the day of the game,'' said Pat Hanlon, a spokesman for the Giants. ''We're not going to invest in a new stadium and hope that with Xanadu and Giants Stadium in operation on game day, that somehow it all works out. It's a known fact that's its already difficult enough to get in and out of this facility.''
 Mr. Hanlon also said he was convinced that there was more than logistical considerations and cold hard logic behind the state's position on Xanadu. ''My sense is that politics and money play a big part in it,'' he insisted.
 With the backing of some of the most powerful political figures in the state dating to the administration of acting Gov. Donald DiFrancesco and carrying on through Gov. James E. McGreevey's abbreviated tenure, the project's momentum has been inexorable, whether faced with opposition from environmental groups, National Football League franchises or even the odd elected official who expressed reservation about the complex.
 There are, of course, many proponents of the project who have pointed to its economic potential. Mr. McGreevey earned wide public praise when he appointed George Zoffinger to head the sports authority with a mandate of weaning the agency from public subsidies and increasing the profitability of the Meadowlands. 
 Mr. Zoffinger quickly became a firm backer of Xanadu, signaling an end to the era when the state -- desperate for a sports identity -- bent over backward to accommodate sports teams instead of seeking the best economic deal for itself.
 But the plan quickly became a magnet for controversy as cost estimates rose, environmental complications emerged and questions multiplied over the bidding process. Then last year, the resident teams of the Meadowlands began doing their best to pour gasoline on the fire by threatening to sue the state or even leave if Xanadu went ahead as planned.
 Mr. Codey -- a sports fan who has no intention of watching idly as New Jersey loses its football, basketball and hockey franchises -- came into office last November with the intention of ordering a comprehensive review of the state's plans for Xanadu. He said at the time: ''If we don't do anything, what does the place become? Is it just a dying football stadium, a racetrack and a place for shopping? I don't think that's right.''
 But soon after making those and other similar comments, Mr. Codey released an uncharacteristically formal-sounding statement of his support for the project, bringing his vision suddenly into line with that of the project's longtime supporters.
 Critics have consistently claimed that state officials were under enormous political pressure to back Xanadu. ''There are more inside political deals, connections and money going on with Xanadu than probably with any other project in New Jersey,'' said Jeff Tittel, president of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club and a longtime opponent of the project. ''Xanadu is the palace of pay to play.'' 
 Mr. Zoffinger, Xanadu's most tireless public proponent, insisted last week that the forces driving the project were purely economic. ''I re-emphasize to everyone every day that when this Xanadu project is completed it will be an engine that drives the economy of northern New Jersey,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''This is not about politics.''
 He said that he was hopeful that Xanadu could co-exist with one or even two professional football franchises. But if he had to choose -- football or paintball -- he left little doubt where his allegiance lay. 
 ''I guess my attitude is that it's so difficult to get anything done in New Jersey nowadays that when you have an opportunity to build something that is going to provide the kind of job growth and economic development that this project will bring to New Jersey, you've got to do everything you can to put your head down and get it done.''

HEADLINE: How Open Is Open Space?

BYLINE: By TERRY GOLWAY

DATELINE: HOBOKEN 

 BODY:
THERE is an unsightly pile of rubble in a vacant lot along Monroe Street in the northwest corner of this waterfront city. Developers say that one day the rubble will give way to a beautiful swimming pool and a two-story community center.
 Of course, that is not the only construction the developers have in mind along this bleak stretch of old, industrial Hoboken. The swimming pool and community center are part of a much larger project, one that would see the construction of a 12-story, 125-unit apartment building adjacent to the Ninth Street Light Rail station.
 The developers, Tarragon Realty Investors Inc. and the URSA Development Group L.L.C., have built several other residential projects in the western part of this densely packed city. 
 Now, with the support of Mayor David Roberts, they are looking to transform an 11-acre industrial site into a high-rise residential development that will include more than five acres of open space for the public. City law requires builders to set aside 10 percent of a tract as open space, and the open space to be set aside for the Monroe Street project will amount to nearly half the property. 
 Still, some Hoboken residents are crying foul, saying that the entire site ought to be preserved as open space and municipal parkland in a city whose 38,000 residents do not have enough parks and playgrounds. Critics used the same argument against another high-rise proposal in the western part of the city, but the City Council approved that 11-story, 113-unit residential building on Jackson Street earlier this month.
 While the dispute is a common tale of developers confronted by residents, it also has policy implications in a state where public officials are trying to combat sprawl by making urban redevelopment more attractive. 
 The site -- dominated by a trucking company terminal and old warehouses surrounded by parking lots pitted with puddles -- would seem ripe for redevelopment. In fact, both William S. Friedman, the chief executive of Tarragon, and Fred M. Bado, director of community development for Hoboken, cited the proposal as an example of anti-sprawl, smart-growth development. 
 ''This is a site that is near public transportation and shopping, in an old industrial area,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''It corresponds to all the ideas behind smart growth.''
 But residents of the state's crowded cities may be as reluctant to part with potential open space as suburbanites weary of strip malls and townhouse construction.
 ''Our elected officials just don't get it,'' said Ron Hines, executive director of Fund for a Better Waterfront, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in Hoboken. ''This is not something that resulted from thoughtful planning. This is a developer-driven proposal.'' 
 The proposal has also drawn criticism from residents of Jersey City and Union City, who live atop the Palisades overlooking Hoboken. They contend the proposed building will block their views and strain the resources of Hudson County. 
 ''From my point of view, the project will affect our line of sight to New York City, and would affect our quality of life in general,'' said Martin McBride, who lives in the Doric, a high-rise apartment building atop the Palisades in Union City.
 Opponents braved bone-chilling temperatures and wind gusts on the steps of Hoboken City Hall about two weeks ago to demonstrate against the proposal, which would require a zoning variance to allow high-rise construction. The developers have agreed to pay the city $80,000 to finance a study that will determine whether the tract should be included in Hoboken's redevelopment zone. If the study finds that site should be redeveloped, the developers could be granted a variance to build higher than the current limit of four stories.
 Mr. Hines and other critics are not mollified by the prospect of a community center, swimming pool and promises of accessible park and recreation areas akin to a smaller version of Battery Park City. 
 ''That is not how you design a public park,'' he said. ''We know this is not going to work.''
 But Mr. Bado, the Hoboken development official, insisted that critics who believe the entire tract should be dedicated as open space ''are not being realistic.'' He estimated that the cost of purchasing the land and then transforming it into usable open space could run as much as $100 million.
 The developers point out that about half the tract will be open to the public, and they hold out visions of tree-lined walkways and bicycle paths leading to playgrounds, a dog run and other passive recreational facilities, like park benches. In addition, the nearly 27,000-square-foot community center would house dance and art studios, a gymnasium, exercise rooms and a space for social functions. A 25-yard pool and a smaller children's pool would be built adjacent to the community center.
 Michael Sciarra, a principal in URSA Development, said the pools and community center ''will make a qualitative difference in the lives of Hoboken residents.''
 Nonetheless, many residents who do not live in Hoboken think the project will make a difference in their lives, too, but not in the positive way Mr. Sciarra suggested.
 ''The views we enjoy from the parks in Jersey City Heights should be valued and considered a Hudson County resource,'' said Moyna McCarty, a Jersey City resident who believes the development will spoil those views. 
 Ms. McCarty criticized Hoboken officials for not considering the effect of the proposed development on neighboring communities and on the Palisades. And she is concerned about the building boom under way along the Hoboken stretch of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Line. 
 ''A lot of people think the light rail is a great thing, but it is also an attraction for development,'' she said.
 Becky Hoffman, who is also a Jersey City resident and president of a civic group called the Hudson County Alliance, complained that the development would ''wall up the Palisades'' and ''create a precedent for additional high-rise buildings'' that will block views from the communities above Hoboken. 
 As Ms. Hoffman put it, ''This is a natural resource, but Hoboken continues to present high-rise projects at the base of the Palisades.''
 It has been hard for supporters of the development not to notice the number of non-Hoboken residents weighing in on a local land-use issue. 
 ''Their objective isn't about creating open space,'' Mr. Bado said. ''Their objective is to stop development. That's why residents from Jersey City and Union City are coming down here. They feel that development in Hoboken will block their views, so they don't want development.''
 The land-use issue also promises to become a political issue this year, with a critic of the development, Councilwoman Carol Marsh, opposing the re-election of Mayor Roberts in May. Ms. Marsh was one of two members of the City Council who voted against a plan to allow Tarragon/URSA to finance the redevelopment study. (The motion passed, 6-2.) And the development's opponents have noted that URSA contributed more than $35,000 to Mayor Roberts' campaign since 2001.
 For his part, the mayor has dismissed the suggestion that the developer's contributions have played a role in the redevelopment plan. And Mr. Bado said that in his 30 years ''on the public side of development, I've never made a deal.''
 ''We just feel this is the way to go,'' Mr. Bado said. ''The city has to be innovative in creating open space. That's why we looked at this area.''

HEADLINE: Despite Property Tax Furor, Little Is Likely to Be Done

BYLINE: By David Kocieniewski. 
David Kocieniewski is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
With the possible exceptions of traffic jams and crooked politicians, nothing gets New Jerseyeans as riled as property taxes.
 Homeowners here pay the highest taxes in the nation, and after a decade of escalating complaints, state residents have been rewarded with escalating property taxes. Now, as spiraling real estate prices drive property taxes even higher, the furor has set off a swirl of activity by elected officials.
 Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey's proposal to roll back the property tax rebate has touched off a nasty battle with fellow Democrats -- especially Assembly members, who fear that voters will punish them if the rebates are eliminated. 
 A bill to convene a constitutional convention on property taxes is inching through the Legislature. And the Republican contenders for governor are lobbing the issue like a dirty bomb at each other and at Jon Corzine, the Democratic candidate.
 Yet despite all those political rumblings, there are plenty of reasons for voters to suspect that little will be done. And the most important reason is the voters themselves.
 New Jersey's property taxes, more than $17 billion last year, are high because they pay for 75 percent of the cost of operating the state's bureaucracy-laden schools and local governments. To make any meaningful rollback, the state can either cut costs, raise taxes or find another revenue source. While those options might sound simple in a campaign, trying to enact them can be difficult and politically perilous.
 One proposal occasionally floated is to increase the sales tax from its current 6 percent (and begin taxing a litany of exempt items -- from luxury boxes at stadiums to food and clothing) and use that revenue to relieve property taxes by providing more school and local aid. 
 Well, a two-cent increase in the sales tax would raise slightly more than $2 billion a year, about enough to cover the property tax increases in the past two years. Many experts contend that sales taxes are regressive, unfairly hitting poor and middle-income families. 
 Merchants argue that a higher sales tax will punish retail businesses, especially shops near the state border, which derive considerable sales from out-of-state-residents. If sales fell significantly, so would sales tax collections, meaning that the state might find itself cutting local aid, pushing property taxes up again.
 An increase in the income tax is another option. But the state already increased the rates on wealthy, and some economists worry that another rise could hurt the state's competitive position and drive away businesses and residents. Given the uprising when Gov. James Florio increased taxes in 1990, legislators are understandably squeamish.
 The prospect of making substantial spending cuts is even riskier. Every elected official likes to promise fiscal restraint and, sometimes, they do find ways to economize. Mr. Codey's budget proposal for next year trims spending by 2 percent. Leonard Lance, the Senate minority leader, has advocated challenging the court order that forces New Jersey to finance low-income schools at the same level as the state's wealthiest districts. That move could save $500 million a year by some estimates, but would face opposition in the Legislature and might be struck down by the State Supreme Court.
 The most obvious way to make substantial savings would be to consolidate the state's hodgepodge of local governments. New Jersey has 566 municipal governments and 611 school districts, some of which don't even operate schools. Each entity has to pay for secretarial costs and office space, computers and paper clips. Some of Mr. Codey's top economic advisers say that consolidation could save $2 billion a year -- allowing property tax deductions of 10 percent or more.
 Of course, one man's bureaucracy is another's income. Streamlining local governments and school boards would cost some public employees their livelihoods and strip hundreds of local politicos of their fiefs. Even if the convention were to embrace such a plan, the battle to implement it would resemble a civil war.
 ''Consolidation always sounds like a good idea -- as long as it only involves someone else's school or community,'' said Ernest C. Reock Jr., a professor emeritus at Rutgers University, and a member of the group that drew up a plan for a convention.
 Some policy analysts are hopeful that the problem is reaching critical mass. Jon Shure, who worked in the Florio administration and now heads a liberal research organization, says voters are tired of the problem and may accept a profound change.
 Inside the State House, most elected officials and political operatives are doubtful. Legislators say the bill for a convention stands a good chance in the Assembly -- providing Democrats cover during the campaign -- but is likely to die in the Senate. The gubernatorial candidates will keep clubbing each other with the issue and, whoever is elected will have to gauge which is more perilous: doing nothing or facing an uprising by doing something drastic.
 But barring any political sea change, homeowners are likely to face the thing they detest but are reluctant to change: higher property taxes.
