HEADLINE: A Gay Camelot Goes Home to Find It's True

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 28

 BODY:
At the opera as in life, the story of the assassinated homosexual politician Harvey Milk is filled with bigotry and repression, violence and guilt.
Only in San Francisco, perhaps, could such an opera be greeted as an occasion for nostalgia and celebration. 
 "In some ways, this was a kind of gay Camelot, a bright shining moment when all things were possible," the work's librettist, Michael Korie, said of the early period of civil rights activity by the city's gay population. That enthusiasm has been revived here in recent weeks with the San Francisco Opera production of "Harvey Milk." "Some people here still remember that," Mr. Korie said.
After opening at the Houston Grand Opera in January 1995 and enduring a notably bumpy run at the New York City Opera that April, the production has come to San Francisco to bask in a reception that has been far more enthusiastic, if at times slightly surreal.
Part of the difference, critics have said, is in the work itself: Mr. Korie and the composer, Stewart Wallace, have restructured and tightened it at the urging of the San Francisco Opera's general director, Lotfi Mansouri. Another part, no doubt, is the warmth of decidedly partisan audiences at the Orpheum Theater here.
But the opera, which was sometimes faulted for tracking its hero too closely and credulously to notice all the ironies and dramatic opportunities in his story, also seems to have found a greater distance from the issues and events that it depicts.
Eighteen years after Dan White, a tightly wound former policeman who sat with Mr. Milk on the city's Board of Supervisors, shot and killed both Mr. Milk, whom he saw as his rival, and the Mayor, George R. Moscone, the political power that Mr. Milk dreamed of has been established in this city as it is nowhere else in the United States.
Many of Mr. Milk's once ragged confederates are now old political hands and pillars of the community. The rabble-rousing Teamsters leader who got Mr. Milk to enlist gay bars in a boycott of Coors beer in 1973 arrived at the opera's premiere on Nov. 9 looking as if he could have just come from a Lions Club meeting. The gay marijuana dealer who once helped recruit hippies to Mr. Milk's cause was decked out in a coat and tie, celebrating the victory of a ballot initiative he had organized to legalize the drug for medical use. Between acts, the woman who once managed Mr. Milk's political campaigns as a motorcycle-riding lesbian was calling home on her husband's cellular telephone to check on the kids.
"The whole political fabric of the city is so different now from the way it was when Harvey Milk was trying to break down the door," said Dick Pabich, a 41-year-old political consultant who worked for the former supervisor. "Gay people are represented on every board, on every commission. It's just not an issue now. Whatever homophobia exists keeps to itself."
The assassinations, which came only days after scores of people from the San Francisco Bay area died at the Guayanese cult encampment of the Rev. Jim Jones, are often taken as the beginning of a dark era in the life of the city, particularly for its many gay and lesbian citizens. The country's politics moved to the right, isolating San Francisco in its liberalism, the economies of the city and state were battered by recession, and thousands of gay men fell to the AIDS virus.
Against that backdrop, the operatic Milk's emergence from his closeted life as a stock analyst on Wall Street and the opera's enthusiastic scenes of gay sexual liberation have come across to some younger migrants to San Francisco a bit as "Hair" might play to the grunge crowd: part campy revival, part history lesson.
"I ask some young people, 'Do you know who Harvey Milk was?' " said one of his former aides, Jim Rivaldo. "And they'll say, 'Yeah, wasn't he the guy who killed the Mayor?' "
The baritone Robert Orth, who again sang the title role, observed that the collective memory may be nearly as weak when it comes to the knowledge that young women have of early feminist struggles or the understanding of the early civil rights movement among young blacks. But Mr. Pabich noted a distinction.
"The gay community hasn't had many mechanisms for transmitting that history," he said. "It's certainly not taught in the schools."
The killings are commemorated each year with a candlelight march through the city's Castro District, retracing the quiet, spontaneous demonstration that drew some 40,000 people on Nov. 27, 1978. This year, some people in the crowd of several hundred said, there was more energy to the event than there had been in years, and the march ended in front of the Orpheum Theater in time for the 8:30 performance.
Although "Harvey Milk" was commissioned by the San Francisco Opera along with the companies in Houston and New York City, there has been a measure of relief about its run here, a full year and a half after it closed in New York.
To some in the city's gay artistic set, the excuse given for the delay -- that schedules had already been booked solid for 1995 when the commission was made -- made less sense than the notion that some stuffed shirts at the opera company might be uncomfortable with the performance of a "gay" opera at the city's august War Memorial Opera House. With the 3,176-seat Opera House undergoing earthquake renovations this year and next, the company is putting on smaller works at the 2,500-seat Orpheum and more expansive ones at the 4,177-seat Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. While not admitting to any stuffing in his shirt, Mr. Mansouri, the company's general director, did acknowledge an element of truth to the rumors.
"I felt that 'Harvey Milk' would work better in a theater like the Orpheum," he said. "I was not excited about presenting it in the War Memorial. It's more of a music-theater piece; it lends itself to a more intimate setting."
Mr. Mansouri also insisted on having enough time for extensive rehearsals and for the overhaul of the work itself. Although the Dan White character had been critically praised in earlier productions, the role was pared back to bring Harvey Milk more into focus. The third act, in which the title character leaps into his role as an elected official, was also trimmed, and the orchestration was tightened throughout.
With the musical director Donald Runnicles conducting, "Harvey Milk" will make its next stop in a studio to be recorded by Teldec with money raised by the San Francisco Opera. The last of its nine performances in San Francisco will be Saturday night.
The favorable reviews have been especially gratifying to the composer, librettist and cast after what they considered a debacle in New York, where the general director, Christopher Keene, was sick with AIDS much of the period when "Harvey Milk" was being rehearsed.
"Christopher was very committed to this, but my hair went gray," Mr. Korie, the librettist said. "The chorus never learned the music. The stage manager was never around. But we hung on, and I'm happy with the way it's turned out. I think the opera has found its true shape."

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Securities Are Higher in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities gained in quiet trading yesterday as the market closed early.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 30/32 , to 10131/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.35 percent, from 6.42 percent on Wednesday. The Treasury market was closed on Thursday in observance of Thanksgiving and closed yesterday at 2 P.M. The yield on the long bond is at its lowest level since March 4, when it was 6.33 percent. 
 Bond prices were bolstered yesterday by overseas buying, short-covering, end-of-month buying by portfolio managers and by economic data that were in line with expectations.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that consumer spending rose five-tenths of 1 percent in October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.20 trillion, following an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent in September. But personal income rose only one-tenth of 1 percent. The results largely matched analysts' expectations.
 Analysts expect the market will be monitoring closely yesterday's official start of the holiday shopping season for any signs of a pickup in retail sales, which would run counter to expectations of continued weakness in the economy.
"The holiday shopping season is upon us," said Dr. Michael Evans of Northwestern University, "and its success will be key to the economy's performance in the fourth quarter."
As the economy has shown signs of cooling in recent weeks, and the yield on Treasury securities has declined, foreign investors have added to their Treasury debt holdings.
Analysts note that despite the rally in bonds, United States yields are still higher that those in other developed countries. Japan's 10-year bond, for example yields 2.52 percent, that is 356 basis points below the current 10-year Treasury note, which closed at a price to yield 6.04 percent yesterday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Dr. Evans of Northwestern, who compiles a business outlook index for the American Production and Inventory Control Society Inc. of Falls Church, Va., said yesterday that his index pointed to a further slowdown in the economy.
The index fell to 46.8 in November from 49.1 in October.
He said that the index appeared to be signaling a downturn in manufacturing activity in early 1997. This view was supported, he said, by the fact that all four of the future component indicators, new orders, unfilled orders, production planning and the actual to desired level of inventory-sales ratio, moved below 50 in November. "The upcoming decline in manufacturing sector activity is not expected to turn into a recession," Dr. Evans said.

HEADLINE: Good Sign for Merchants: Spending Rebounds

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Consumer spending rebounded by a larger-than-expected five-tenths of a percent in October, and economists took the increase as a sign that Americans were ready to spend during the Christmas season after a summer lull.
The Commerce Department said today that the rise in personal consumption spending -- which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity -- was led by a big jump in demand for personal services, like transportation, housing and recreation. 
 The big rise in spending was not accompanied by a similar increase in incomes, which were unchanged during the month. Still, analysts said this was expected, considering that wages and other forms of incomes had posted strong gains of six-tenths of a percent in both August and September.
Given the strong labor market, with unemployment near a seven-year low, and consumer confidence at the highest levels in nearly a decade, analysts believe all signs are pointing toward a good Christmas sales season.
"When consumers are happy, they tend to spend money," said Paul Getman, senior economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. "Everything seems to be in place for a good holiday season."
The nation's retailers, remembering dismal Christmas sales last year, hope that forecast proves accurate. Normally, they ring up half their sales during this time of year.
After growth in the gross domestic product fell during the summer to a moderate 2 percent pace because of a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, analysts said the October rise in spending provided evidence that the consumer had been simply taking a summer breather.
Cheryl Katz, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said the economy was not poised for runaway growth, considering that many consumers were still carrying high levels of personal debt. She predicted the G.D.P. would expand by about 2 percent for all of 1997.
Many economists had expected an October increase in consumer spending of about three-tenths of a percent. Consumer spending had eked out a gain of one-tenth of a percent in September.
The rise in consumer spending totaled $27.5 billion, at an annual rate, in October with three-fourths of that strength coming in purchases of services, which rose by seven-tenths of a percent.
Purchases of durable goods, everything from cars to appliances, were up by four-tenths of a percent while purchases of nondurable items rose by three-tenths of a percent.
The unchanged performance for personal incomes in October was the weakest showing since it also showed no gain in July.
Private wages and salaries actually decreased at an annual rate of $8.9 billion in October, after a gain of $28.2 billion in September. The October drop reflected a decline in average weekly hours, which more than offset an increase of employment during the month.
Disposable incomes, the money left over after taxes, was also unchanged in October after a gain of six-tenths of a percent in September. Real disposable incomes, which adjusted for inflation, fell by three-tenths of a percent in October, the first decrease since a drop of two-tenths of a percent in July.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Young Entrepreneur Makes Food, Not War

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
Daniel Lubetzky has a talent for bringing things together. This 28-year old entrepreneur coined "sprate," a word that combines spread and pate, to describe a line of products that his New York company, the Peaceworks, is marketing successfully in the United States.
The company itself is based on conciliation, the notion that Jews and Arabs can cooperate for economic advantage. The sprates, which come in an array of trendy flavors like sun-dried tomato, olive and ginger, have cute caricatures of a Jew and an Arab, Moshe and Ali, on the labels. They are made in Israel by a company owned by a Jew, Yoel Benesh, who buys all his ingredients from Israeli Arabs and Palestinians. 
 "There is no better way to create political stability than by having people work together and giving them economic incentives," Mr. Lubetzky said. "It's the only way to break the vicious cycle that leads to desperation and anger. It may not be the most popular thing to be doing in this region, but it makes sense."
Mr. Lubetzky -- who was born in Mexico City and raised partly in Texas, and whose father, Roman, is a Holocaust survivor -- began to realize the sense of it after he graduated with a law degree from Stanford University. In 1993 he visited Israel on a fellowship to do research for a law journal article about the Arab-Israeli conflict and the potential for economic joint ventures.
While there, he bought a small jar of sun-dried tomato spread. "I was hungry," he said. "I didn't even know what sun-dried tomatoes were. But it was delicious." Convinced that if he liked it so much, others -- even in the United States -- would, too, he went to buy more. But the store was sold out.
He discovered that Olivia, the manufacturer, was about to go out of business because of distribution problems and had disconnected its phone, but he tracked down Mr. Benesh, who had created the product.
"They had been trying to penetrate the American market for five years," Mr. Lubetzky recalled. "Here I was, some young kid attorney who wanted to change their lives. They thought I was crazy."
But anyone who meets Mr. Lubetzky soon realizes that this affable young idealist who speaks six languages and believes in cooperation is also a relentless nudge. He persuaded Mr. Benesh to let him try to market the spread. They signed a preliminary agreement.
In March 1994, with $10,000 of his own money, Mr. Lubetzky started the Peaceworks, which would be the American distributor, based in New York. He spent the next three months traveling between New York and Israel, working with Mr. Benesh on quality control, labeling, packaging and other details.
Back in New York, he went around to some well-known fancy-food stores with the spreads he named "sprates." His gift for nudging helped. So did a booth at the Fancy Food Show in New York in July 1994.
That year the Israeli company exported 200 cases of the sprates to the United States, about 2 percent of the total production, and the Peaceworks sold them to nearly 30 stores nationwide -- including Zabar's, on the Upper West Side.
This year, the product line has expanded to 15 items, including cilantro pesto and Mediterranean barbecue sprate, and is handled by 45 American distributors with accounts at 2,600 retailers. Mr. Lubetzky, whose company now does only the importing and marketing, estimated that this year the Peaceworks would import about 200,000 cases, or about half of Olivia's total production, to the United States. Annual American gross sales now exceed $1 million.
The Peaceworks is no longer run out of a basement room; it has larger second-floor quarters and three employees.
At Zabar's, the Peaceworks has its own freestanding rack as well as a display at Bloomingdale's. "We're up there with the big boys like Perugina," Mr. Lubetzky said.
The Peaceworks has also started marketing charcoal briquettes made from olive wood, called Olive Branch Briquettes. They are made by Hiolive, a company co-owned by Mr. Benesh and an Israeli Arab, Imad Salaimi, who also does some product development work for Olivia. Mr. Lubetzky has become a minority partner in Hiolive.
"Without Peaceworks I would not be selling products in the United States," Mr. Salaimi said. "Companies like this are good for the Arab people, better than making war. If all goes well I will really start making money in about a year."
This fall Mr. Lubetzky recruited a board of 11 advisers from the banking, food, international relations and academic fields as unpaid consultants.
Ben Cohen, a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, which is renowned for its corporate beneficence, needed no nudging to agree to serve. "What Daniel is doing is harder than donating a percentage of the profits to some cause or other," he said. "It takes this kind of thing in a new direction."
Another member of the board, Ziad Abdelnour, a Lebanese Christian and the founding partner of a venture investment concern, Interbank/Birchall Private Capital L.L.C., said: "There are a number of partnerships between Arabs and Israelis now -- it's a trend. But most are in high-tech, finance and service companies. He's the only one in food, with a down-to-earth consumer product. He will succeed. But he will need more capital and create new partnerships. His advisers can help him."
Mr. Lubetzky said the board was more ambitious than he was, suggesting ideas for jewelry, skin care products, toys and other items that can be produced cooperatively in a number of countries. Mr. Lubetzky is considering a project to produce a line of food products in Chiapas, the state in southern Mexico that has recently undergone political turmoil.
Current political conditions in Israel also cause problems. "Right now the situation is not clear," Mr. Salaimi said. "But it's not that good for business."
Mr. Lubetzky said those difficulties made projects like his more important than ever. "Economics and social issues have to drive the process," he said. "I got into this because I want to see Israel survive and not as a garrison state for the next century pitted against hundreds of millions of Arabs."
But that is not his only reason for making the Peaceworks succeed. "I'm having a lot of fun," he added.

HEADLINE: Day 1 Arouses Retailers' Hopes That Christmas Is on the Rebound

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
By 9:30 A.M. in Atlanta, there were no more Tickle Me Elmo dolls at an F.A.O. Schwarz. At midmorning in Houston, a Target store was nearly toaster-less. And in New York City, J. Crew filled with shoppers by 11:30, while the rest of SoHo was still rubbing sleep from its eyes.
Nationwide yesterday, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, mall parking lots were jammed, sales clerks punched madly at registers and shoppers cruised stores, sniffing perfumes and turning over price tags seeking markdowns. 
 Though no specific figures were available, an informal survey of stores and shoppers seemed to show that sales were moving more briskly than last year, when retailers suffered through one of the poorest selling seasons in recent memory.
Retailers are counting on factors like high consumer confidence, easing debt levels and the surging stock market to inflate substantially their sales and profit margins this year.
So on Black Friday -- as the day after Thanksgiving is known because retailers hope the ink in their books will turn that color -- merchants crossed their fingers, shoved their Santas out on the floors and prayed for good weather.
While Black Friday has become less important to retailers as shoppers have held off until later in the season in recent years, it still provides a good signal of what is to come. This year, with a late Thanksgiving and five fewer shopping days than last year, yesterday was particularly crucial.
Some winners and losers were emerging at the starting gate. Department stores and discount outlets, many decorated with sale signs, pulled shoppers in, but salespeople in specialty stores had a bit more free time on their hands. Women's clothing at mass-market prices was moving, but the higher end was somewhat sluggish. Computers and related items did not appear to top many shoppers' lists.
Many shoppers loaded up on goods early in the day and said they were planning to have a bigger spread under the Christmas tree this year.
"We're buying more this year, because our incomes have increased," said Tim Rice, who came to New York from West Chester, Pa. with his wife, Coni, to shop yesterday."I think that speaks a little bit to what is happening in the market."
Lori Strutman, 33, was trying on diamond rings in St. Louis, the type of rings she and her husband, Dennis, had been unable to afford when they married six years ago. The couple, who live in Cuba, Mo., own three small businesses that they said had thrived this year.
Many merchants hoped that more customers would be willing to pay full price this year than did last year, when many waited for sales, but shoppers again seemed to be hunting for good buys. The mantra in the retail industry this fall has been "no preseason promoting," and many retailers said their inventories were thinner than Kate Moss.
By yesterday, though, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Lord & Taylor, the electronics retailer Nobody Beats the Wiz and others had already taken out at least one full-page newspaper advertisement in New York boasting of price reductions. The fourth floor of the Barneys New York store on 17th Street in Manhattan was awash in sales signs.
Joy Hartnett, 42, interviewed in a mall in Los Angeles, said: "I've kind of been watching the sales, to see if the day after Thanksgiving is really the big sale day. And it actually is."
At the Galleria shopping center in Houston, Macy's and Marshall Field's were offering early-bird specials, drawing in shoppers as early as 8 A.M. In Atlanta, Rich's offered many goods for 50 percent off. At a Limited store in the Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles, clothes were going for 40 percent discounts.
"Unless a store had a sign on the door that said, '50 percent off on selected goods,' that store was basically empty," said Kurt Barnard, editor of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, who chatted from his usual Black Friday spot: the food court of a New Jersey mall, cellular phone in one hand, a cinnamon roll in the other.
At Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, a mass of people, their faces twisted in determination, crowded the ground floor, mostly in search of accessories and other small items rather than pricier goods. Women pushed through the crowd to cosmetics counters for free facials, snapping up eye shadows and creams on their way out. Armies of women in black smocks offered to spray perfume on shoppers, and by 1 P.M. the entire floor had taken on an odd fruity scent.
Just a few floors up, however, expensive women's clothing salons resembled museums, as though there was a sign that read, "Please do not touch the cashmere."
Indeed, throughout the country, it was the mid- and lower-end department and discount stores that seemed to sell the most clothing. Many specialty merchants sat relatively silent. One exception was Old Navy, which packed shoppers in again this year with the fleece sweatshirts and glycerine soap sold in other stores at higher prices.
One category that may have trouble on its hands is computer retailing, if yesterday's store traffic is an accurate indication. Shoppers said that they had either had their fill last year of computer goods or were simply not interested.
"No computers; we've done that already," said Judith Cordova, 38, of Houston, a teacher at an elementary school. Lewis Rush, a 57-year-old math teacher from Chattanooga, Tenn., said he "probably couldn't swing" a computer this holiday season. In Los Angeles, not a single shopper interviewed said he or she was on the hunt for computer goods.
The new J. Crew store in Manhattan seemed to draw a healthy crowd, though most of the customers seemed to be shopping for the favorite person on their list: themselves. "I am working now, so I can buy more clothes," said Kristine Wrenn, 21, who was loaded down in things khaki and wool.
In contrast to last year, when shoppers concentrated on basic goods, stores that offer more offbeat stocking stuffers were busy. The Bug Store in St. Louis sells "beneficial insects." Pay today for praying mantises and nematodes (microscopic wormlike creatures that aid gardeners), and they are delivered by spring. So that there is something to put under the Christmas tree, the bugs come first in the form of chocolate or tree ornaments, a reminder of what to expect in the mailbox in spring.
"It's great for a gardener who has an organic garden," said Heather Tomlinson, the Bug Store's manager. "Or for someone who has everything."
In Manhattan, Housing Works, a thrift shop, was jammed with people in search of old dishes, shirts and unexpected extras. Trina Moore examined a creamer for a friend who collects them. "I enjoy Christmas shopping in thrift stores," said Ms. Moore, who is 39 and lives in Manhattan. "It is a treasure hunt."
In some shops where a Christmas frenzy is to be expected, madness reigned. Outside the Walt Disney store on Fifth Avenue and 55th Street in Manhattan, a line formed around the block. Nearby, tourists flocked, some looking slightly bewildered as they squinted in the strong afternoon sun at street vendors hawking $10 New York sweatshirts.
While shoppers generally appeared more upbeat than last year, there was a Grinch to be found everywhere. Joe Cvetetic sat in a Barnes & Noble bookstore in lower Manhattan, reading The Village Voice and ignoring the few shoppers around him. "I give people food for Christmas, mostly spanakopita," Mr. Cvetetic, 34, said of his homemade Greek spinach dish. "Why should I buy clothes? I found my favorite sweater in the apartment of someone who got evicted on Avenue A."

HEADLINE: President Out As VW Seeks G.M. Truce

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Thomas Andersson had already been unnerved once by his two roommates, when he walked in to find they had moved in paper-shredders and were busily destroying documents in the house they shared in Wiesbaden, about 20 miles from here.
When he later discovered four cartons of what seemed to be confidential documents from General Motors in his living room, he decided to call the police. That call, on June 21, 1993, may well have been the beginning of the end of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's career as a top executive at Volkswagen A.G. 
 Mr. Lopez, whom General Motors has accused of stealing thousands of secret company documents when he left G.M. to join Volkswagen in 1993, resigned as president of Volkswagen today. His lawyers said Mr. Lopez wanted "to concentrate on expected legal proceedings" -- a civil suit brought by General Motors in the United States as well as criminal charges that are expected to be filed soon by German prosecutors.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Lopez, who is 55, will be found guilty of industrial espionage, as General Motors has contended. But the cartons found in the Wiesbaden house have now led prosecutors and General Motors to evidence of widespread secret shipments of G.M. documents, late-night shredding parties and at least one big effort to transfer material from G.M. floppy disks and paper documents into Volkswagen computers.
Volkswagen executives are now showing signs of panic about the prospects of a court trial in the United States, and are scrambling to reach an out-of-court settlement with G.M.
A person close to VW's board, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the company was horrified by the prospect of VW's chairman, Ferdinand Piech, being forced to defend himself in an American court on accusations of racketeering and industrial spying. The same person expressed the hope that General Motors would be equally concerned about damaging its own image in Europe.
"This is very frightening both to G.M. and to us," the person close to the board said. "We fear that unless there is a settlement, this could really develop into economic warfare. If the discovery process and the trial goes on, there is no question that this could lead to a very, very bad situation."
At a minimum, the Lopez case threatens to severely wound Volkswagen's public image, just when the German car maker is showing strong growth in profits and sales after years of poor performance.
Volkswagen's shares gained 2.3 marks today in trading on the Frankfurt exchange, closing at 615.6 marks.
The chairman of VW's supervisory board, Klaus Liesen, met with the General Motors chairman, John G. Smale, and a board member, Thomas H. Wyman, in September, although the talks evidently made no progress. VW board members are continuing to make informal contacts with G.M. on a frequent basis, hoping that the departure of Mr. Lopez will open the path to some sort of agreement.
For General Motors, the Lopez case has become a campaign for corporate revenge. Before he quit, Mr. Lopez had been one of General Motors' most visible and treasured stars, the man credited with sharply cutting the auto maker's costs and revolutionizing the way it bought its parts. Since losing Mr. Lopez to its German rival, General Motors has spared little effort to investigate, litigate and publicize what it describes as a brazen act of corporate back-stabbing.
Today, General Motors offered little sign of being willing to let bygones be bygones.
"The resignation of Lopez, which has been overdue for more than three years, cannot compensate for the substantial damages," said a statement issued by the company's Adam Opel subsidiary in Germany today. The statement accused VW's top management of a "systematic cover-up" for three years.
If General Motors wins its suit in Detroit, Volkswagen could be forced to pay billions of dollars in compensation. That prospect grew more realistic on Tuesday, when a Federal judge in Detroit ruled that General Motors could sue VW under racketeering laws and claim triple the amount awarded by a jury.
In 1993, when the police responded to Mr. Andersson's call, they found a cache of documents in the Wiesbaden apartment that included internal G.M. studies, cost information and a report entitled "Strategic Business Plan Global Outsourcing." That soon led to a sweeping search of Volkswagen headquarters, Mr. Lopez's home in Germany and VW's guesthouse, where Mr. Lopez had set up copying machines, shredders and a small staff to sort through papers.
Volkswagen, which originally denied that it had obtained any information from General Motors, now admits that it received some of that material. But the company asserts that it had nothing to do with Mr. Lopez's efforts, that the information did not reach VW executives outside Mr. Lopez's group and that VW never used the information.
However the case develops, VW will have a hard time disentangling itself from the activities of Mr. Lopez. G.M.'s lawsuit against Volkswagen contains a long chronology of Mr. Lopez's activities before and after he jumped over to the German car company.
The documents found in the Wiesbaden apartment came directly from General Motors, but they were only the beginning. Once German police found the cartons, they searched Volkswagen headquarters, its computers, its offices and the homes of Mr. Lopez and his associates. According to G.M.'s complaint, Mr. Lopez had set up an elaborate document-processing operation at one of Volkswagen's more remote offices in Germany and installed a mainframe computer, 15 computer work stations and other equipment to transfer data from G.M. disks and documents to Volkswagen computers.
The complaint also recounts the discovery of 20 cartons of General Motors documents, which the company says Mr. Lopez had shipped from Detroit to Spain at the time of his job switch. Those cartons were shipped on an airplane owned by Volkswagen, according to the complaint.
G.M. also retraced Mr. Lopez's movements on an almost daily basis between February 1993, when he started negotiating with Volkswagen, and the time he quit General Motors on March 10. Based largely on interviews with scores of General Motors employees, many of whom helped prepare documents for shipping to Europe, the complaint draws a vivid portrait of Mr. Lopez collecting information voraciously at G.M. at the time he was in deep negotiations with VW over a new job.
Mr. Lopez, the complaint says, demanded vast quantities of information about G.M.'s purchasing structure, its feasibility study for a revolutionary new factory that was code- named Plant X and even pictures of new automobile designs.
At one point, the complaint says, Mr. Lopez ordered G.M. employees to translate large volumes of documents into German and then arranged to have those documents shipped to Europe.
Volkswagen denies that its top management conspired with Mr. Lopez, but the company cannot deny that it adamantly supported the executive at every turn in the three-year conflict with General Motors, and that it refused to back down even after it became clear that Mr. Lopez and his followers had retained control of a big collection of G.M. documents.
Not only did Volkswagen defend Mr. Lopez, but it also used a battery of lawyers to keep G.M. from taking legal action at every available opportunity. VW unsuccessfully tried to prevent G.M. from pursuing its lawsuit in Detroit. It also went to court in Germany, again unsuccessfully, to block G.M. from talking about its allegations here. And most recently, it sought -- again unsuccessfully -- to prevent German prosecutors from sharing their information with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Even today, Volkswagen officials refrained from even hinting at any criticism of Mr. Lopez or acknowledging any improprieties. What G.M. wants, perhaps as badly as financial compensation, is an apology.

HEADLINE: High-Country Common Ground;
In the Sierras, Growth and Preservation Are Not at Odds

BYLINE: By JON CHRISTENSEN 

DATELINE: TRUCKEE, Calif., Nov. 26

 BODY:
In the villages nestled amid the forests and river valleys of the Sierra Nevada, the environment has always been a battleground, with "growth" and "jobs" the implacable rhetorical foes of "no growth" and "the environment."
But now, Sierra business leaders are taking the lead in calling for policies to protect the environment, on the ground that the region's grandeur is the key to the success of their businesses. 
 "We've spent the better part of our business lives ducking the crossfire between entrenched environmentalists and business-at-any-price people," said Janice Forbes, a local publisher and president of the Sierra Business Council, a group of 450 businesses, ranging from small stores and Victorian bed-and-breakfasts to banks, timber companies and Lake Tahoe casinos. "Now we can stand up and say there's a better way."
The business council was formed in 1994 "to secure and enhance the economic and environmental health of the region for future generations." Its first move was to commission an audit of the natural, social and financial capital of the region. The resulting Sierra Nevada Wealth Index, which was released earlier this year, tracks 42 indicators of the region's well-being, from water quality to school test scores to employment.
"Each form of capital -- our human, natural and financial resources -- is critical to having a prosperous, stable and sustainable economy" the report concluded.
There's nothing new in that. The World Bank, for instance, advocates a similar approach to tracking the economies of emerging nations, noted Thomas Michael Power, a professor of economics at the University of Montana who has studied rural economies in the Western United States.
But the Sierra council is the first business group in this country to try to put this potentially far-reaching economic philosophy into practice in the day-to-day decision-making of a region's business people and government planners.
"There are lots of chambers of commerce in cities that focus on livability," said Dr. Power, whose new book, "Lost Landscapes and Failed Economies: The Search for a Value of Place," (Island Press), examines the failure of communities in the Western United States to adapt to changing economies. "But to find business firms in small towns in a rural area realizing that protecting the natural environment is a crucial part of their future economic development is pretty unusual."
The council's efforts are being watched closely. This week, a group of 20 foundations from around the country, including the Ford Foundation, the W. Alton Jones Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation and the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, came to this town of 10,000 just north of Lake Tahoe to see whether the council's approach might work in other places.
"This idea has been in the air," said Richard Morrison, senior vice president for environmental policies and programs for Bank of America, which is a council member. "But this is bringing it down to where decisions actually happen -- in land use planning -- and that's a local thing."
The council's office in downtown Truckee is in a small log cabin built in 1863 to collect tolls from wagons crossing the Donner Pass, the main route across the Sierra Nevada. Today the business council sits at another important crossroads, trying to help a region undergoing a dizzying economic transition figure out where it is headed.
"Truckee has gone from a railroad-and-timber economy to a tourism economy," said Stefanie Olivieri, 53, a council member and owner of two clothing stores in downtown Truckee. "This community was in a deep dive when I was growing up. My father thought it would become a ghost town. But it's always been clear to me where our bread is buttered. It's tourism."
Ms. Olivieri bought her parents out of their dry goods store in the late 1960's and since then has invested several million dollars in her two stores and real estate in downtown Truckee.
Lately, she has seen others do the same. "People who moved here for the quality of life started putting money into businesses," she said. "They replaced derelict buildings with viable tourism-oriented businesses. And we continue to do that."
Indeed, the recognition by small- business owners of the need to preserve the Sierras' attractiveness for tourists and new businesses is at the heart of the council's embrace of environmental concerns. Council members are looking to use the wealth index as a tool for mustering the political will to change land use planning guidelines in each of the region's 11 counties.
"There is almost no understanding of natural resources and conservation in county plans," said Lucy Blake, the council's executive director. "A lot of times the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. We believe it's possible to grow and for communities and natural systems to function as well or better than they do today. But leadership will have to come from local leaders to improve land-use planning."
Truckee may serve as a model. Here, planners are encouraging developers to fill in vacant lots and re-use abandoned buildings downtown rather than sprawl out into the surrounding forest. The local plan calls for redeveloping an old rail yard with a hotel, shops, an ice skating pond, a library and a recreation center. Industrial uses will be moved away from the Truckee River, which runs through town, and a path for bicycling and cross-country skiing will be built along the river.
When Truckee residents look upriver to Lake Tahoe, they can see the future inexorably coming their way.
"The battle between the environment and business was really joined at Lake Tahoe in the 1960's," said Steve Teshara, executive director of the Lake Tahoe Gaming Alliance, a council member that represents casinos at the lake.
By the early 1980's, environmentalists had won an injunction against new construction in the Tahoe basin because the clear waters of the lake were becoming clouded with sediment and pollution. A court-supervised settlement included a series of consensus-building workshops among planners, environmentalists and businesses that set the stage for cooperative planning of limited development around the lake.
"We learned the hard way that fighting doesn't work," Mr. Teshara said. "And we've recently learned to cooperate and work together. If folks can learn from the lessons and avoid mistakes that we made at Lake Tahoe that would be great."
Since 1982, the two-state Tahoe Regional Planning Agency has measured development plans against the "carrying capacity" of the Lake Tahoe basin. Fees to mitigate environmental impacts have been assessed on new single-family homes: $2,000 for air quality and $1.25 a square foot for water quality. Those fees go into trust funds used to build bike paths, subsidize public transportation, control erosion and restore streams.
Now the area is mostly all built, said Pam Drum, a spokeswoman for the agency, and the planners' focus is on ways to improve the environment. Two major redevelopment projects in South Lake Tahoe are replacing "tacky" motels from the 1950's and 1960's with new hotels in an "Alpine rustic elegant" style, she said. The area is also getting shops, restaurants, a high-speed gondola to nearby ski slopes and natural landscaping that will catch runoff and open vistas to the lake.
"There is no question what our bottom line is: it's the environment," Ms. Drum said. "You can ski anywhere. You can gamble almost anywhere now. What makes us truly unique is Lake Tahoe. And businesses here have realized that the quality of the natural environment is their competitive edge."
But the bottom line is more complicated in the rest of the Sierra Nevada, according to the business council's wealth index. In the sparsely populated northern Sierra, the timber economy is struggling to survive. In the north-central region, a quarter of the agricultural lands in the foothills have been turned into subdivisions to accommodate a population boom. In the south-central section, change is coming more slowly, and large ranches still dominate the foothills. The remote east side of the range has changed even less.
One of the council's tasks is to clear up confusion about this varied scene. Too often, people "make economic decisions while looking in the rearview mirror," said Ms. Forbes, the publisher of Sierra Heritage magazine and The Auburn Sentinel, a weekly newspaper.
In a recent poll, the council found that residents in the north thought the timber industry represented a quarter of the local economy. "It did 30 years ago," Ms. Forbes said, but today it constitutes only 2 percent. Small businesses employ more than half of all private-sector workers in the Sierras, according to the council's wealth index, and recreation- tourism is the largest industry.
"The West is no longer a frontier economy where you can identify the base by the smokestacks, the mines, or the tractors rumbling across the land," Dr. Power, the Montana professor, said. "We make our living doing exactly the same thing most other people in the United States do. It's an entrepreneurial economy. The Sierra Business Council has been able to shake loose from the images of economic reality that force most small-business firms to focus on whatever industries used to be important."
The wealth index has already changed the way one member does business. Robert Haydon, president of Placer Savings Bank, started a new Small Business Administration loan program when he realized that small businesses were the growth industry in the region. The first transactions included a $12,500 loan for a beauty shop and a $1.5 million loan for a motel.
Placer, which has offices in 25 Sierra Nevada communities, is also encouraging environmental practices in its owner-builder construction loans, the bank's bread and butter. The bank requires recycling of construction waste, Mr. Haydon said, and asks for amenities like streamside paths in development plans.
"The bottom line is that it costs a little more to do that, but people are willing to pay the price," Mr. Haydon said. "There's a cost, but they'll get a community where people want to build, live, play and stay. And that is what makes it worth living here."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Reshaping a Region's Economy"
With small business and tourism having supplanted lumber and other heavy industries as the engines of the Sierra Nevada region's economy, business owners have begun embracing environmental concerns. The shift is evident in solutions advanced by the Sierra Business council's 450 members for some of the area's most pressing problems.
 
LOSS OF FARMLAND
PROBLEM: Population growth in north central Sierra counties is strong, and with it the pressure to convert farmland to residential uses.
 
SOLUTIONS: Revise county general plans to discourage sprawl. Expand estate tax exemption for agricultural lands.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
PROBLEM: Tourism is the region's leading industry, but the popularity of local attractions contributes to their degradation.
 
SOLUTIONS: A tax on the region's water and power could raise money for restoring rivers and streams.
 
DECLINE OF OLD-GROWTH FORESTS
PROBLEM: Older trees are more valuable to both loggers and the environment, but changing climate and logging practices have led to a decline in the region's old-growth forests.
 
SOLUTIONS: Manage forests to protect old growth. Change the tax code to provide incentives to preserve mature forests.

Holiday Sales Open Briskly; Consumer Spending Climbs
On a day retailers call Black Friday -- for the black ink they hope will show up on balance sheets -- department stores and discount shops, particularly those displaying sale signs, were filled with shoppers, many of whom said they were feeling flush and ready to spend.
At the start of the crucial holiday shopping season, mass-market women's clothing was moving, as were favorite items as diverse as Tickle Me Elmo dolls and toasters. But demand was sluggish for expensive goods like computers, and many sales people in specialty stores had time on their hands. [Page 1.]
 
Consumer spending rebounded by a larger-than-expected five-tenths of a percent in October. Economists took the increase as a sign that Americans were ready to spend during the Christmas season after a summer lull. Personal incomes, however, were unchanged during the month. [41.]
 
For the Dow, a Buoyant Month
Stocks advanced in a shortened session, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.36 points, to 6,521.70, giving it a gain of 8.16 percent in November, the most since a 9.47 percent climb in December 1991. The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.29 points, to 1,292.61, and was up 5.82 percent for the month. [43.]
 
Treasury Securities' Prices Rise
Prices of Treasury securities gained in quiet trading, thanks to overseas buying, portfolio managers' end-of-month buying and favorable economic data. The 30-year bond rose nearly a full percentage point to 10131/32 , pushing its yield down to 6.35 percent. [43.]
 
Hospital Rates to Be Deregulated
With hospital rates in New York scheduled to be deregulated on Jan. 1, thousands of companies face a deadline of midnight Monday to inform the state whether they plan to contribute to state funds to subsidize health care for the poor and to train physicians. Employers that miss the deadline will face big increases in hospital charges. [31.]
 
French Truckers Lift Barricades
Striking French truck drivers began lifting barricades blocking major highways after union and employer negotiators resolved most of the issues in a 12-day dispute that was strangling much of Western Europe's economy. In France, there was widespread sympathy for the truckers, reflecting mounting discontent with the economy. [7.]
 
Amtrak Computer Breaks Down
The computer system that controls Amtrak's ticketing nationwide broke down, leaving thousands of riders on the busiest travel weekend of the year standing in long lines as clerks wrote out tickets by hand -- often guessing at fares. [30.]
 
Dairy Farmers Lose, As Milk Prices Rise
Consumers are paying record prices for milk, cheese and many other dairy products -- 12.1 percent more than a year ago, the Government says. But prices paid to the nation's 150,000 dairy farmers have tumbled 25 percent recently. In the patchwork of free market forces and Government formulas that drive milk prices these days, it is the retailers that are fattening their profit margins. [1.]
 
Peaceworks, Doing Well to Do Good
"There is no better way to create political stability than by having people work together and giving them economic incentives," says Daniel Lubetzky, a 28-year old entrepreneur. His company, Peaceworks, is successfully marketing foods made by Jews and Arabs cooperating for economic advantage. [40.]
 
Protesters Battle Mink Farmers
Tension crackles in Utah, home of the nation's largest number of mink farms. Prices have risen 60 percent this year to $53 a pelt, the highest level in more than 20 years, but animal rights' advocates have raided farms, freeing animals and destroying property and records. Farmers are joining armed patrols, seeking to protect their livelihood. [9.]
 
Fur is again in vogue, with sales in the United States up 10 percent last year to $1.2 billion, and strong 1996 sales are expected. [9.]

HEADLINE: Fashion Trends Encourage Fur Sellers

 BODY:
Whether on the runways of Paris, the covers of fashion magazines or the streets of Manhattan, fur is in vogue again.
Gone, for now, are the days when fur sales were falling faster than temperatures in December. Sales in this country were up 10 percent last year, to $1.2 billion, according to the Fur Information Council of America. The trade organization said 63 percent of American furriers increased sales last year, with fourth quarter sales 20 percent higher nationwide compared with the same quarter in 1994. 
 While the council says the figures represent a rebound, sales have been in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion since 1990, after several years of decline.
The council, which estimates that 1996 sales will equal or exceed those of last year, attributes the jump to the harsh winter in 1995, the strong economy and the resurgence of luxury-goods retailers. It also maintains that the influence of animal rights groups has waned because of what it terms extreme tactics while fur designers have attracted consumers with their use of color, texture and contemporary styles.
Animal rights groups are quick to note that fur sales remaining sharply below 1980's levels, when the industry peaked at $1.8 billion in sales.
"It is still only half of what it was then," said Dan Mathews, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
The group says fur industry sales are artificially inflated by including revenue from fur coat storage and fabric coats lined with fur. But the Fur Information Council says its numbers include only sales of full-fur garments.
In Manhattan, dyed jackets, designer-label coats and lightweight styles are driving sales.
"We came off a very cold winter with a lot of snow, which certainly drives fur sales, and consumers really think fur is in the mainstream of fashion," said Leslie Freund, the marketing director of Maximilian at Bloomingdales, where fur sales to date are up 40 percent this year over last. "Most of our customers already own a fur and are looking for something unique and fashion forward."
A robust economy is also fueling the trend, furriers say.
Richard Goldman, the president of Albert Furs in Cleveland, said clients were snapping up sheared beaver and mink coats, pushing sales 20 percent above last year.
In Minneapolis, William Ribnick, the president of Ribnick Furs, said casual jackets and coats in purple, green and royal blue were popular.
The price of fur coats has also increased 25 percent since last year to $5,700 for a full-length mink, according to the Fur Information Council, which says the increase is being driven by heavy demand worldwide.

HEADLINE: THE WELFARE OVERHAUL -- A special report.;
Shrinking Safety Net Cradles Hearts and Hopes of Children

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
Nothing conspicuous in Christopher and Jennifer Cundiff's appearance says they are poor: not the neat navy blue soccer shirt and blue jeans Christopher wears, or Jennifer's white Mary Janes with a white rose button on each strap. Nor do they act deprived. Blond Jennifer, 6, bounds out of the schoolhouse door, while Christopher, 9, runs to his mother yelling, "I got me an orange juice today!"
But their mother, Norma Cundiff, says she gets every stitch of their clothing from a charity closet where the school keeps other kids' castoffs. Although their father, Robert, works as a dishwasher, the Cundiffs receive welfare, too: two free school meals a day and $60 a month in food stamps. Home is a tiny, cluttered white house, with castoff tattered sneakers piled in a corner and possessions covering every table. 
 Like one in five American children under 18, Christopher and Jennifer Cundiff live beneath the poverty line -- the $15,771 that the Government says a family of four needed last year for a bare-bones level of food, clothing and shelter. Six million of these children are extremely poor, existing on less than half that income. The Cundiffs live on just over half.
The Cundiff children and others like them are at the vortex of the forces shaping the monumental overhaul of the welfare system. The most enduring legacy of the changes may be their effect on these children.
Statistics, interviews with officials from many states and glimpses into the lives of several poor families provide a portrait of the children who depend on welfare. They are a varied group whose plight has worsened in the last few years even as the welfare debate has raged in Congress and in statehouses across the country.
Fear of the welfare law's impact on children was at the center of a furious clash within the Administration as the Presidential race heated up and Mr. Clinton decided to sign the bill, initiated by the Republicans in Congress, which eliminates the 61-year-old Federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children. Publicly rebuking the President, three top officials of the Department of Health and Human Services said the law would hurl at least a million more children into poverty and resigned.
As that debate showed, the experts can better predict the law's effects on welfare mothers, the focus of the new law, than its effects on children.
In 1965, the first year that the War on Poverty programs began to reach many families, the Census Bureau reported that 14.7 million children, 21 percent of everyone under the age of 18, were poor. In less than a decade, that number fell sharply, to 10 million. But the numbers for last year were right back to square one: 14.7 million children were poor -- 20.8 percent of all children.
About 10 million of the poor children account for two-thirds of the beneficiaries of welfare checks, and 5 million more, many with at least one working parent, get other forms of welfare, like Christopher's hearing aid and his morning orange juice.
Two and three decades ago, welfare could lift children to the threshold of poverty. But now, because of inflation and budget cuts, welfare benefits in a typical state are worth half as much as they were in 1970, according to the House Ways and Means Committee.
The lives of poor children today show how the success of any attempt to transform welfare, and to improve the lot of poor children, may depend as much on expensive improvements in health care, education and housing as it does on the way that officials in Washington and in state capitals interpret the new law.
It is hard to find an expert anywhere, on the left or the right, who does not acknowledge that, for a while at least, children could suffer more than they did under the old welfare system that the President and Congress condemned.
"Unfortunately, the children are very often just the victims of poverty," said Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources, which wrote much of the law.
"Unfortunately," Mr. Shaw added, "a few more children will suffer for the conduct of their parents. But they suffer far more now. What we're trying to do is solve the problems of poverty so there will fewer poor children."
 
The Welfare Child
Most Are White With One Sibling
The typical child on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, according to statistics from the Census Bureau and Department of Health and Human Services, is 7 years old. The child has one sibling. The child's mother is 29 and unmarried.
He or she lives in the South, in the rural reaches of the Mississippi Delta and Appalachia, in the rundown cores of big cities -- like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit and Washington -- or, increasingly, in the suburbs.
Most likely, the child is white. In 1995, nearly nine million of the children on welfare were white, almost twice the number of black children on welfare: 4.8 million. But a higher proportion of the country's black children -- 42 percent -- were on welfare, compared with 16 percent of all white children.
Welfare among black children is also more entrenched. The Department of Health and Human Services found that 52 percent of all black Americans who were born from 1973 to 1975 had spent more than five years on welfare as children, compared with 11 percent for the rest of that age group.
The typical welfare child's family owns little more than used furniture, a television, clothes and some food in the refrigerator.
In 1993, the department found that only 6.3 percent of the families on Aid to Families with Dependent Children owned cars. The cars were each worth an average of $597.
As the purchasing power of a welfare check has sunk, so have the wages that once supported a family. Even if the parents of children on welfare get jobs, work is less likely to move them out of poverty today. Typically, parents on welfare qualify for only the lowest-paid jobs, like cleaning motel rooms or working as store clerks. In a full-time job at the minimum wage of $4.75 an hour, they each earn $9,880 a year, or $823 a month.
That is a few thousand dollars more than a family can collect in welfare checks, but those wages also have to pay for more. Within a year of starting work and losing welfare benefits, parents often lose their free child care, subsidized housing and Medicaid.
A child on welfare is less likely than others to have been born to a mother who had good prenatal care and is more likely to have been born sick and underweight, studies by the Annie E. Casey Foundation show. Such children tend to be ill-prepared for kindergarten, to fall behind in school, to be suspended for misbehavior, to become parents in their teens, to drop out before graduating and to set off for the job market with no better prospects than the minimum wage.
"They are labeled as the sad, bad, mad, can't add kids," said Sheila A. Pires, a partner in the Human Services Collaborative, a welfare consulting company in Washington.
To move beyond the labels and statistics, here is a look at several children and their families and how the new welfare legislation may affect their lives.
Karen Goff, a mother of five, is struggling, so far without success, to move her family from dependence to self-sufficiency.
Teen-agers like Narvell Glenn and Cindy Bethel are already dreaming circumscribed dreams.
And even though one parent works, the Cundiffs remain among the large ranks of working poor.
 
The Single Mother
New Challenges In an Old Struggle
The turmoil in welfare has not yet struck the Main Street bungalow of Karen Goff, 24, and her five children: Keira, 7, Kary, 5, Karolyn, 3, Kasey, 2, and Kamron, almost 1. While rearing her children, Ms. Goff finished high school and two years of college, earning an associate's degree. She also worked, most recently in a paint factory.
Then came the reversals that thrust Ms. Goff and her children onto public assistance. Complications during her pregnancy with Kamron forced her to leave her job, and then her marriage collapsed.
She had lived with the children's father since she was 15 and he was 19, and she married him a year and a half ago. Because he was usually unemployed, he watched the children while Ms. Goff worked. But one day last spring, she said, he pistol-whipped her brother in the living room. The gun flew out of his hand and struck Keira, Ms. Goff said, so Ms. Goff called the police. He is now serving six months in jail, and they are divorced.
Ms. Goff's thoughts seemed far removed from those travails on one Indian summer day when she picked up her monthly welfare benefits: a $432 check and food stamps worth $397. She was once rooted to the neighborhood and shopped on foot, but she now drives a weathered 1986 Dodge Omni that she just bought with $50 from her welfare check and $250 from her father.
Ms. Goff, 99 pounds and 4-foot-11, spun like a twister as she unloaded 16 white plastic bags from a discount supermarket. "Now we've got some serious food!" she said, stuffing the refrigerator with 10 pounds of hamburger, 10 pounds of hot dogs, three dozen eggs and some large frozen pizzas and setting aside a stock of multicolored Astro Pops.
While the two youngest children lay sprawled on her bed for afternoon naps, Karolyn ran in from her bus, gave her a mother a high five and ducked into a bedroom to change clothes. Then Keira and Kary's bus pulled up.
Everyone got an Astro Pop. Kary, biting hard on his, lost a cap from a tooth. "Dentist tomorrow morning," Ms. Goff said. Medicaid will cover him.
Kary took a crumpled test from school out of his pocket. On one side was a column of numbers, 1 to 10 in random order; on the other, a column with random piles of 1 to 10 peanuts. He had to draw lines connecting each digit to the right pile of peanuts, and he got them all right.
Ms. Goff said she was embarrassed to have to depend on public assistance to keep her children fed and dressed, housed and healthy. And new law or not, she said, "I do want to work -- I'm not a stupid person."
She says she wants the skills and credentials leading to a job that will support her children. "I'm going to get my bachelor's," she said.
The new welfare law, however, could dash Ms. Goff's aspirations. The State of Kentucky, like most states, will no longer pay for welfare recipients to earn bachelor's degrees. Instead, she is expected to gear herself up to work, for the $4.75 hourly minimum wage, if necessary. If she rejects a job offer the state deems acceptable, she could be penalized with a cut in her welfare check.
If she works, day care for Kamron and Kasey will cost $150 per week, leaving Ms. Goff with just $40 of the $190 she would earn from a full-time job at the minimum wage. On top of that, she will need care for her school-age children for two hours each afternoon before she finishes work.
As Ms. Goff makes the transition to work, the state may not be much help. "We're not in a position where we can find child care for all poor families," said Bonnie Hommrich, district manager for the Department of Social Services in Jefferson County, where Louisville is located.
Ms. Hommrich said she believed that work could confer important benefits to families like Ms. Goff's. "Some people will achieve things they never thought possible," she said. "And kids need to see parents struggle and achieve things."
But Ms. Hommrich worries nonetheless that children's needs will be overlooked. "In our drive to get everybody employed, these kids are not necessarily at the top of our priorities," she said.
 
The Youth
Where Dreams Cannot Grow
Work seems desirable to teen-agers like Narvell Glenn and Cindy Bethel, even without a welfare law that seeks to break the generation-to-generation pattern of dependence and unemployment. But by the time such teen-agers approach adulthood, their hopes often stop short of college and high-paying jobs. Mr. Glenn, 18, and Ms. Bethel, 16, talked about their aspirations as they shot baskets one afternoon in the gym of the Park DuValle neighborhood center, in the middle of housing projects on the west side of town. He is wiry and polite, with long sharp dimples in his cheeks and short hair arranged in rows called prison braids.
Mr. Glenn lives with his mother, grandmother, 19-year-old brother and 17-year-old sister and the sister's infant daughter. He said he had dropped out of school in the 10th grade. Because of their ages, he and his brother are no longer covered by their mother's welfare check.
As a single adult, Mr. Glenn could not have qualified for a welfare check like his mother's under the old system. But he could well have been eligible for food stamps. Under the new welfare law, that option has been reduced to three months of food stamps every three years for able-bodied adults 18 to 50. So, with little of the safety net left, Mr. Glenn has an added incentive to find a job that pays enough for him to eat.
He has had a couple of short-term minimum-wage jobs, one at a Wendy's hamburger outlet, which he held for nine months, and the other at a factory, where he worked for several months before quitting in October because of what he called coercive working conditions.
Mr. Glenn said he had given almost half his earnings to his mother. "With the rest, I buy what I need, like a pair of shoes every two months," he said. "I'm trying to save enough for a bed that isn't on crates."
Mr. Glenn said he needed more education to land a permanent job and was enrolling in a General Educational Development program to get a high school diploma. But he is not thinking of the kind of work that pays the nearly $12 an hour that the average American worker earns. In five years, he said, "hopefully, I'll have a steady job that pays over $5.50 an hour and an apartment." He added, "I hope I have a car, too, but I'll need a second job for that."
Ms. Bethel, a tenth grader, is the second-oldest of six children 7 to 18 years old. Their mother died of a heart attack four years ago, and their father needs welfare to support the family.
As quick as Mr. Glenn on the basketball court, Ms. Bethel, who has tightly wound braids that she has extended with other people's hair, works in a grocery store 24 hours a week for the $4.75-an-hour minimum wage to help her father stretch his $720 a month in cash assistance and food stamps.
She is also an entrepreneur. "I do hair," she said. "I know how to finger-wave, braid, do extensions." She charges $5 for finger-waves and $20 for braids. "When I finish school," she said, "I'll take up cosmetology."
Ms. Bethel and Mr. Glenn say they do not feel demeaned by growing up on public assistance. "You don't if you live in the neighborhood where everybody gets them," Mr. Glenn said. But whether they feel it or not, their aspirations show that they have been stigmatized in ways that the welfare law does not address, said Ron Hutchins, a social worker and family therapist at the community center.
"It's in how they're treated by their teachers," he said. "Teachers have low expectations for them simply because of where they come from. If you're a high achiever, it takes a long time to get recognition."
 
The Working Poor
Few Skills And Little Pay
Home from school, Jennifer Cundiff settles on the floor of the living room. "I want to draw," she says and finds a pad of plain paper. "Just one sheet," Ms. Cundiff commands. But Jennifer discovers that she has begun to peel off more. "Uh-oh, I got two," she says. Her mother lets it go.
"I went through anger control," Ms. Cundiff said. Coping is a strain for this family, and both parents have been reported to child protective services for a general climate of verbal abuse and have been receiving counseling.
Home from school, Christopher said he liked learning to read. Though behind in school, he said he wanted to do better. He likes science. "I want to go to college," he said. "Get a job, go out and get a house, get a car, set furniture. That's about all I want to do."
But it is hard to see where the Cundiffs will get money for paper and books, to say nothing of college. Trapped by their origins, their limitations and their wages, families like the Cundiffs slip into the ranks of the working poor. Mr. Cundiff, 44, who is asleep when the children return from school, earns $6 an hour by working 4 P.M. to midnight as a dishwasher at a Mexican-American restaurant.
Tall and skinny, with all his teeth removed, he was a heavy drinker but has been off alcohol for three years. Ms. Cundiff said he had grown up in a group home and never finished kindergarten.
Ms. Cundiff, 40, grew up in foster homes; her longest stay was for five years. She has never worked. Before having her own children, she said, she reared six of a sister's on welfare after the state gave custody of them to her. She finished ninth grade and can write, while Mr. Cundiff can just sign his name. "I've taught him to count money," she said."
Mr. Cundiff need not often count beyond three digits to the left of the decimal point. His Oct. 15 check stub shows that he took home $379.30. Payments are $120 a month on the family's dark red, 1990 Chevrolet Astro van, bought a few months ago with a trade-in and $1,000 down.
The Cundiffs' rent for their little white one-story, wood-frame house is $350 a month, and they could lose it at any moment. They were a week late with the Oct. 1 rent. On the refrigerator, Ms. Cundiff has stuck a copy of an agreement she signed for the landlord.
"Tenant agrees to pay late fee on the 24th of Oct. in the amount of $35," it says. "Failure to do so will constitute breach of agreement and lessor will not accept Nov. rent without all charges."
Ms. Cundiff has heard Washington's summons to work. She said she was about to start studying for her G.E.D. so she would have the equivalent of a high school diploma. She said she would then look for a job. But with no work experience at all, and after looking for work and being rejected, she said she had little hope. "I'm just smarter than the average bear," she said, laughing at herself.
For supper tonight, the children may choose baloney sandwiches or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, the same choice as last night. "Every night," Jennifer said, "we have one of those."

HEADLINE: Dispute on Tarot Lecture Roils a Small-Town Library

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEABROOK, N.H., Nov. 25

 BODY:
Most cash-strapped, small-town public librarians know better than to look a gift horse in the mouth. But when books on the occult, bearing titles like "Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft" and "To Ride a Silver Broomstick," began showing up in the mail by the dozens last summer at the Seabrook Public Library, the head librarian, Elizabeth Heath, admits that she and her staff were "amazed and confused."
The donated books started arriving after the library's trustees, under pressure from religious leaders in town, postponed two proposed lectures last August on tarot reading, numerology and dream analysis. A group of about 300 local churchgoers objected to their tax dollars financing lectures that they said would promote the occult, comparing the lectures to the teachings of Satan. Some also called for the town selectman to withhold money from the library and shut it down, should the lectures be held as scheduled. 
 Soon after, Tom Canfield, a resident of nearby Durham who dabbles in tarot and astrology, spread word of the postponements on the Internet, calling the board's decision a violation of free speech and urging people to send occult books to the library in protest. As a result of Mr. Canfield's initiative, the library has received close to 500 books related to the occult.
"I felt a sense of outrage that these lectures were banned," said Mr. Canfield, an employee of Aurora Press, a New Age publishing house in York, Me. "It's censorship, pure and simple."
But the Rev. Elizabeth Walton, music director of the Rand Memorial Congregational Church and one of those who opposed the lectures, said, "There is a power at work in these tarot readings and the like, but it's not the power of God."
The issue has sharply divided this working-class New Hampshire border town of 7,000, with an economy driven largely by a nuclear power plant, plus business from neighboring Massachusetts residents who come to vacation, buy fireworks or frequent the numerous tattoo parlors.
There are those, like Mary Sampson, who feel passionately that "lectures on the occult simply don't belong" in the library and who were ready to picket the talks, had they taken place.
Then there are library patrons, like Teresa Amato, who supported the lectures and helped circulate an anti-censorship petition signed by about 250 residents.
"The library is a place for controversy," Ms. Amato said. "Democracy depends on it, and on the free flow of information, not denying people the right to make their own choices."
The petition asks that there be "no further concessions to censorship" by the library board.
Norman H. Brown, a board member, said the trustees would meet "within a month or so" to decide the fate of the lectures.
The controversy erupted last July when the Rev. Andrew Gosnell of the Rand church and others in town learned that the two lectures -- "The History and Use of Tarot Cards" and "Numerology and Dream Analysis" -- were on the library's summer lecture program for young adults.
In a letter submitted to the library trustees, Mr. Gosnell and his colleagues called for the cancellation of the lectures, and warned that sponsoring the talks was tantamount to "inviting all who would participate to unleash a literal 'hornet's nest' of destructive spiritual entities into their lives."
In meetings held throughout August, the board tried to appease the church group by first rescheduling the talks as adult programs, and then withdrawing payment for the lectures, after objections were raised regarding the public financing of what could be considered religious programming.
Eventually, the three-member board voted 2 to 1 to postpone all programs at the library, with the exception of a poetry reading, until a policy on lecture topics was written.
"I know this could appear to be a free-speech issue," said Patricia O'Keefe, a board member who voted to postpone the lectures. But, Ms. O'Keefe said, the board could see that the lectures "could be considered religious and so it really came down to a matter of the separation of church and state."
Ms. Heath said she felt abandoned by the board. As a librarian, she said, her job is to "resist all efforts at censorship of library materials and information" by groups or individuals, and that shutting down the series violated her personal and professional ethics. She has received support from other librarians in the state, as well as from the American Library Association.
But Mr. Gosnell and his supporters say they are not compromising anyone's freedom or rights. They say they simply believe that the public library is an "inappropriate" forum for lectures on the occult.
"If people want to learn about tarot cards," Ms. Walton said, "let them go to one of those stores in Portsmouth or hire a hall someplace for their lecture."
Yet the curious might need go no further than the library stacks once Ms. Heath has sorted through the donated books, which fill a seven-foot-high bookcase, two rows deep on each shelf.
"Some of the titles I saw looked excellent," Ms. Heath said. "We'll definitely keep some of them."

HEADLINE: The Russian Tea Room Question;
Power Diners Wonder When, or if, It Will Reopen

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
The old commercial for the Russian Tea Room was joyously, comically precise. But "just six minutes and 23 seconds from Lincoln Center and slightly to the left of Carnegie Hall," the restaurant now sits empty, a grande dame in mothballs.
Every day used to be Christmas at the Tea Room, where the main dining room was festooned year-round with tinsel and decorative Christmas balls hanging from chandeliers. But this holiday season won't be nearly so jolly for the classical music and show business crowds that made the Tea Room their clubhouse. 
 When the showman and restaurateur Warner LeRoy bought the Tea Room last year from its longtime owner, Faith Stewart-Gordon, and closed its doors for renovation on New Year's Day 1996, he announced it would reopen in 1997 with the acclaimed chef David Bouley in charge of the kitchen.
"I just wanted to redo it," he said.
While the signs hanging in the windows of the five-story town house proclaim 1997 as the year of renewal, even Mr. LeRoy now concedes that that will not be the case. An auction earlier this year of Tea Room bric-a-brac sounded to some like a fatal note, and rumors have swirled like sightings of Anastasia about the Tea Room and whether it will ever reopen.
Some say Mr. LeRoy is deathly ill. Others say his ambitious plan to rebuild the Tea Room was simply too grandiose for his finances. Or they say he is unable to proceed because a contentious divorce has stalled spending. And then there is the unlikely team of the voluble Mr. LeRoy and the painstakingly meticulous Mr. Bouley -- "Barnum and Bouley," some called them -- a feud waiting to happen.
"I heard there was some kind of argument," said Harold Orenstein, an entertainment lawyer who was a regular at the Tea Room for decades. "Maybe it will never reopen."
A prominent restaurateur, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said, "It wouldn't surprise me if it is dead in the water." And Andrew Freeman, who was director for marketing at the old Tea Room, said he was puzzled. "I'm not sure what's really going on there," said Mr. Freeman, who is now vice president of public relations for the Rainbow Room and Windows on the World.
All this has left the Tea Room regulars, who could wander from table to table and never lose a beat in picking up the conversation, feeling out in the cold. "For the second time in my life I'm a refugee," said Robert Lantz, the literary and theatrical agent, who left Berlin in 1935.
But Mr. LeRoy said he ignores all the rumors, and promised the restaurant would reopen, in spring 1998. "I was sick, and that delayed us three or four months," said Mr. LeRoy, who also owns Tavern on the Green. "I had a seminoma -- a curable cancer -- in my chest, but I'm fine now. It was cured."
Both he and his wife, Kay, said the divorce had no bearing on the renovation.
Mr. LeRoy also said he had miscalculated the scope of the project, which called for the addition of four stories to the town house. "We thought we could keep the old building and add to it," he said. "But we couldn't; the foundation is too weak. So we had to plan a new building.
"We're going to put a new frame on the existing foundation, which will be shored up. It's just a complicated construction. It's all bid and it's ready to go."
Nonetheless, some of the old regulars remain skeptical.
"Maybe he's telling us the truth." conceded Mr. Lantz, who said he misses being able to buttonhole his friend and fellow agent Sam Cohn, another regular, at the Tea Room. "It was a wonderful way not to wait for him to return calls, because he was there," Mr. Lantz said.
What the project is lacking in speed seems more than made up for in extravagance. In place of the five-floor house -- a caraway seed sandwiched between the 78-story Metropolitan Tower to the east and the 60-story Carnegie Hall Tower -- will be a nine-floor building with an ornate Art Deco facade in blue, gold and white. A new cellar will house a large shop selling caviar and Russian Tea Room merchandise, and Mr. LeRoy said the ground-floor dining room would look essentially the same as it did, except for the addition of an elevator.
"No, we did not sell off the paintings and the samovars," he said. "What we sold were extra things that Faith had collected. She had 160 samovars. There were 40 in the restaurant. We sold 80."
The second floor will be what Mr. LeRoy called a "grand luxe cafe dining room," a two-story room that will feature in its ceiling the kaleidoscopic stained glass that was last seen in Maxwell's Plum, the trendy restaurant of the 1960's and 70's that Mr. LeRoy owned on the Upper East Side.
"It'll have a 16-foot crystal-and-acrylic bear juggling Faberge circus balls and filled with small sturgeon, and a Faberge egg tree 18 feet high by 18 feet wide, and also a 10-foot-high Faberge egg made by the greatest Faberge forger in the world, that will have a rooster that says cock-a-doodle-doo in Russian," Mr. LeRoy said.
That would be, "Koo-kah-ree-koo, but don't ask me how to spell it," he said.
The third and fourth floors will be banquet rooms, he said, while the remaining floors will be devoted to kitchen and storage facilities.
All told, Mr. LeRoy said, it's a $30 million project.
In his attention to detail, Mr. LeRoy is at least matched by Mr. Bouley, who also insisted that nothing in their relationship had changed.
"I'm still working every day on the food," said Mr. Bouley, who in June closed his own restaurant, Bouley, to devote himself to the Tea Room and to his own grand project, Bouley International, a cafe, restaurant, cooking school and research and development center, all to be housed in one building in TriBeCa. Mr. LeRoy is helping to finance that project.
With a Russian assistant, Mr. Bouley said he had gone back to original sources -- Russian cookbooks that have never been translated into English -- and is developing dishes that he said would surprise everybody. "Everybody knows about red borschts, but I've found 10 or 12 green borschts," he said.
While Mr. Bouley will be based downtown at his complex, he said he would closely supervise the cooking at the Tea Room, rotating Tea Room staffers through the test kitchens of Bouley International, where he will train them to his liking. "The risk of me losing control is completely eliminated," he said.
Mr. Bouley has trouble containing himself when speaking of his plans to expose people to the breadth of Russian gastronomy.
"The challenge is to refine a cuisine that hasn't been refined," he said. "There's almost an adventure of flavors and traditional combinations of food that haven't been developed here. It's user friendly. It's not like Swiss clockwork. It's full of emotion."
"So many people don't realize 'bistro' is a Russian word," Mr. Bouley said. "It means hurry up!"
All this talk of great food is alien to regulars at the old Russian Tea Room, which received a tepid "satisfactory" when last reviewed by The Times in January 1992.
"It was the crowd," said Mr. Orenstein, the lawyer. "It was the atmosphere. Most people didn't eat Russian food."
He said the old crowd had pretty much broken up, with some lunch-time regulars heading to Trattoria dell'Arte on Seventh Avenue, others going to Michael's on West 55th Street, and some nostalgic types going to L'Ermitage on West 56th Street, "where they sell great borscht."
Ms. Stewart-Gordon has heard the complaints, and sympathizes. "They're sort of wandering in the desert," she said. "Lord knows there are enough good restaurants in New York, but that's not really the issue. They just want a place where they can see their friends."
To those who would loathe Mr. LeRoy for trifling with a treasure, Ms. Stewart-Gordon said that she herself changed many things in the Tea Room over the years. She had even planned her own vertical expansion, a small hotel on top of the restaurant that fell victim to the recession of the 1980's.
"The design certainly looks different, but I think he'll retain the spirit," she said.
More perplexing for Ms. Stewart-Gordon was the prospect of competing on ever-changing West 57th Street, where landmark buildings like Carnegie Hall and the Osborne struggle to maintain their stately visages as the tide of theme restaurants and souvenir shops washes around them.
"I think that Warner will fit more into that than I did," she said. "He's capable of taking something and making it more razzle-dazzle than I was, and that's a good idea."
Mr. LeRoy, who said he likes what he sees happening to West 57th Street, said the Tea Room would fit right in. "In a sense, it is a theme restaurant because it's Russian," he said, "but this is as high scale as you can get."
Mr. Orenstein is not sure he agrees. He questions whether a restaurant catering to the image of elegant Russian aristocrats, wiling away the post-Revolution years in stateless decadence over blini and caviar, will still hold appeal.
"Oh yes, someone will reopen it," he said. "The name is too good to lose. The question is whether they'll be able to recapture it."
