HEADLINE: Health Spending Rises to 15% of Economy, a Record Level 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Health spending accounts for nearly 15 percent of the nation's economy, the largest share on record, the Bush administration said on Thursday.
 The Department of Health and Human Services said that health care spending shot up 9.3 percent in 2002, the largest increase in 11 years, to a total of $1.55 trillion. That represents an average of $5,440 for each person in the United States. 
 Hospital care and prescription drugs accounted for much of the overall increase, which outstripped the growth in the economy for the fourth year in a row, the report said. 
Complete data on health care spending in 2003 are not yet available, and some experts say the rapid growth of the last few years may be slowing. 
Prof. Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton, said: "The increase in health spending is no surprise whatsoever. This is what the American people asked for when they abolished managed care." 
Many consumers rebelled at limits on their choice of doctors and hospitals.
The increase comes before baby boomers become heavy users of care. It does not reflect the increased demand for prescription drugs likely to result from the Medicare law signed last month by President Bush.
"We've had two successive years of rather dramatic increases in the share of gross domestic product going to health care," said Katharine R. Levit, director of national health statistics at the department. "Everyone, from businesses to government to consumers, is affected."
Projections put health spending at 17.7 percent of gross domestic product, or G.D.P., by 2012, the government said last February.
Health spending surged in recent years while the economy sputtered. As a result, health spending rose from 13.3 percent of the G.D.P. in 2000 to 14.1 percent in 2001 and 14.9 percent in 2002, the report said. From 1992 to 1999, the share was stable. 
Ms. Levit said that factors driving the growth in health spending showed "signs of dissipating in 2003." Typically, she said, it takes two or three years for changes in the economy, like the 2001 recession, to affect the health care sector.
Likewise, Kenneth L. Sperling, a health care consultant at Hewitt Associates, said there had been a tapering off of the sharp rise in the use and prices of hospital services and prescription drugs. He expected the trend to be reflected in a lower rate of growth in health spending in 2004.
Spending for hospital care reached $486.5 billion in 2002, a 9.5 increase over the prior year. It was the first time since 1991 that hospital spending had grown faster than health spending generally. 
Ms. Levit said the increase reflected a growing demand for hospital services and rises in the number of admissions, the length of hospital stays, the cost of malpractice insurance and the wages and benefits of hospital employees. In addition, she said, hospitals have shown an increased ability to negotiate higher prices as the constraints of managed care have waned.
The new federal figures were published in the journal Health Affairs.
Even though more than 43 million Americans are uninsured, the United States devotes more of its economy to health care than other industrial countries. In 2001 -- the last year for which comparative figures are available -- health accounted for 10.9 percent of the gross domestic product in Switzerland, 10.7 percent in Germany, 9.7 percent in Canada and 9.5 percent in France, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Public spending on health care accounts for 45 percent of all health spending in the United States, compared with a 72 percent average in O.E.C.D. countries. But health spending has outpaced economic growth in most of those countries, putting pressure on government budgets.
Prescription drugs accounted for 10.5 cents of every dollar spent on health care in the United States in 2002, and for about one-sixth of the increase in health spending.
Drug companies cite those figures in arguing that they have been unfairly vilified as a major source of rising health costs.
But another statistic helps explain why drug costs have become a potent political issue. They account for 23 percent of what Americans spent on health care out of their own pockets, and 51 percent of the increase in such spending, in 2002.
Total out-of-pocket spending on health care rose $12 billion, to $212.5 billion in 2002. Out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs rose $6.1 billion, to $48.6 billion.
Insurance coverage of drugs has grown in the last 20 years, Ms. Levit said. But consumers' out-of-pocket spending on medicines exceeded the amount of their own money that they spent on hospitals, doctors, dentists or nursing homes in 2002. Drug spending rose 15.9 percent in 2001, 16.4 percent in 2000 and 19.7 percent in 1999.
Cynthia Smith, an economist at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the increase "has arisen largely from increased use of new drugs, rather than from increasing prices of existing drugs."
Mark V. Pauly, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said he saw no evidence that the increase in health spending had been "cosmically harmful to society." Indeed, he said, "for middle-class people with health insurance," the value of the health care they receive is often worth the additional cost.
But Mr. Pauly said the increase in health costs and spending tended to hurt the uninsured. 
Since 1985, the report said, per capita health spending has grown more slowly under Medicare than under private insurance. Liberals say that shows Medicare is more efficient. But conservatives trace much of the difference to the fact that private insurers have provided more generous benefits.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 President Bush's attempt at immigration reform is nothing more than a cynical attempt to garner the Hispanic vote and to cater to the needs of his friend President Vicente Fox and the Mexican government (news analysis, front page, Jan. 8). 
 Unable to get its own economic act together, Mexico exports its poorest people to America. They sneak across the border; they work for low wages; they send money back to Mexico; and they use our social services, our hospitals and our schools.
It's a great deal for Mexico, and contrary to all those who say it helps our economy, it's a very bad deal for America.
But if I were a poor Mexican, I'd probably be coming here, too.

HEADLINE: Free-Market Iraq? Not So Fast 

BYLINE:  By DAPHNE EVIATAR

 BODY:
There is no doubt about American intentions for the Iraqi economy. As Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has said, "Market systems will be favored, not Stalinist command systems."
 And so the American-led coalition has fired off a series of new laws meant to transform the economy. Tariffs were suspended, a new banking code was adopted, a 15 percent cap was placed on all future taxes, and the once heavily guarded doors to foreign investment in Iraq were thrown open. 
 In a stroke, L. Paul Bremer III, who heads the Coalition Provisional Authority, wiped out longstanding Iraqi laws that restricted foreigners' ability to own property and invest in Iraqi businesses. The rule, known as Order 39, allows foreign investors to own Iraqi companies fully with no requirements for reinvesting profits back into the country, something that had previously been restricted by the Iraqi constitution to citizens of Arab countries. 
In addition, the authority announced plans last fall to sell about 150 of the nearly 200 state-owned enterprises in Iraq, ranging from sulfur mining and pharmaceutical companies to the Iraqi national airline.
But the wholesale changes are unexpectedly opening up a murky area of international law, prompting thorny new questions about what occupiers should and should not be permitted to do. While potential investors have applauded the new rules for helping rebuild the Iraqi economy, legal scholars are concerned that the United States may be violating longstanding international laws governing military occupation.
History provides limited guidance. The United States signed both the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and has incorporated their mandates regarding occupation into the Army field manual "The Law of Land Warfare." But foreign armies, whether the Vietnamese in Cambodia, the Turks in Northern Cyprus or the United States in Panama and Haiti, have rarely declared themselves to be occupying forces. After World War II, for example, the Allies claimed the Hague regulations did not apply because they had sovereign power in Germany and Japan, which had surrendered. And although most of the world calls Israel's control of the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 an occupation, the Israeli government has not accepted that status, although it has said it will abide by occupation law.
Reconstruction and privatization in Kosovo, for example, have been bitterly debated. The United Nations authority over Kosovo, set up by the peace treaty after a war that was unsanctioned by the United Nations, hesitated to privatize what was in essence seized state property, but it decided the economic future of Kosovo was too important to wait for a final peace settlement that would fix Kosovo's legal status.
The government in Belgrade and the much-reduced Serbian community in Kosovo have argued that such sales are specifically forbidden in the United Nations resolution setting up the authority itself. This dispute, though similar, sidesteps questions of occupation law because Kosovo, unlike Iraq, involves United Nations and NATO forces.
In Iraq the latest pronouncements by the Security Council only add to the muddle. Resolution 1483, issued in May, explicitly instructs the occupying powers to follow the Hague Regulations and the Geneva Convention, but in a strange twist it also suggests that the coalition should play an active role in administration and reconstruction, which many scholars say violates those treaties. 
The conflict centers on Article 43 of the Hague Regulations, which says an occupying power must "re-establish and insure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country."
In other words, the occupying power is like a temporary guardian. It is supposed to restore order and protect the population but still apply the laws in place when it arrived, unless those laws threaten security or conflict with other international laws. 
"Under the traditional law the local law should be kept unchanged as much as possible," said Eyal Benvenisti, professor of international law at Tel Aviv University and author of "The International Law of Occupation" (Princeton, 1993). Repairing roads, factories and telephone systems, then, is a legitimate way to get the economy running again. But transforming a tightly restricted, centrally planned economy into a free-market one may not be. 
In a memo written last March and leaked in May to The New Statesman, the British magazine, Lord Goldsmith, Prime Minister Tony Blair's top legal adviser, warned that "the imposition of major structural economic reforms" might violate international law, unless the Security Council specifically authorized it.
Officials of the coalition authority insist the Security Council did that with Resolution 1483. They maintain that wiping out Saddam Hussein's entire economic system falls within Resolution 1483's instructions "to promote the welfare of the Iraqi people through the effective administration of the territory" and assist the "economic reconstruction and the conditions for sustainable development."
So the authority is pressing ahead with most of the plans for economic reform in Iraq and promises to have new laws in Iraq governing, among other things, business ownership, foreign investment, banking, the stock exchange, trade and taxes by June, when power is to be transferred to the Iraqis. 
"We believe the C.P.A. can undertake significant economic measures in Iraq particularly where those measures support coalition objectives and the security of coalition forces," said Scott Castle, general counsel to the coalition. "There's a close nexus between the economic health of Iraq and the security of Iraq." 
Some experts in international law call that a stretch. "The Security Council cannot require you to comply with occupation law on one hand and on the other give you authority to run the country in defiance of that law," said David Scheffer, a professor of international law at Georgetown University and a former United States ambassador at large for war crimes issues. He added that "1483 is internally inconsistent."
Order 39 "raises the biggest single question about coalition policy as it relates to the laws of war," said Adam Roberts, a professor of international relations at Oxford University and an editor of "Documents on the Laws of War" (Oxford, 2000). "That order embodies a major change not just in human rights or the political situation, but in the economic one. It would appear to go further in a free market direction and in allowing external economic activity in Iraq than what one would expect under the provisions of the 1907 Hague law about occupations." 
International business lawyers at a conference of investors in London in October similarly warned that the coalition authority's orders might not be legal. 
Part of the problem is that the old occupation law does not seem to fit the realities of modern warfare. As Mr. Benvenisti explains in his book and in a forthcoming article in the Israel Defense Forces law review, when the Hague regulations were initially drafted, war was understood to be a legitimate contest between professional armies, not a messy attempt to remove a tyrannical leader. 
"The Hague law reflects the interests of sovereigns to maintain their basis of power, their property and their institutions," Mr. Benvenisti said. Instead of wholesale transformation of a nation, then, occupation was supposed to be a short, transient state of affairs, with minimal intervention of the occupying authority in the lives of civilians. 
But in Iraq the United States' explicit goal is to completely remake Iraqi institutions and society. "Their objectives far exceed the constraints of the law," Mr. Scheffer said, noting that occupation laws were restrictive precisely in order to prevent overzealousness on the part of an occupying power. "We're squeezing transformation into a very tight square box called occupation law, and the two really are not a good match." 
In a forthcoming article in the American Journal of International Law, he sets forth a dozen possible violations by the occupying powers of international law, including failure to plan for and prevent the looting of hospitals, museums, schools, power plants, nuclear facilities, government buildings and other infrastructure; failure to maintain public order and safety during the early months of the occupation; and excessive civilian casualties. 
In the article Mr. Scheffer explains how individuals could use United States laws to sue individual coalition officials in American courts. "This is a rather uncharted field in U.S. jurisprudence," he said in an interview. "But I would not underestimate how far litigation might go."
Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the Defense Policy Board, which advises the Pentagon, is not so concerned. In her view the Iraqi laws do not deserve much deference because they were issued by an authoritarian government. "If it's not a democratically crafted law, it lacks the same legitimacy," she said.
Coalition officials have recently backtracked on privatization, in part because of the legal concerns. "We recognize that any process for privatizing state-owned enterprises in Iraq ultimately must be developed, adopted, supported and implemented by the Iraqi people," Mr. Castle said. 
Still, some specialists worry that the radical economic changes that are moving forward will lack legitimacy in the eyes of Iraqi citizens. Iraqis may see such wholesale economic transformation as "threatening and potentially exploitative," said Samer Shehata, professor of Arab politics at Georgetown University. "I think the sensible answer is to leave extremely important decisions like the possibility of complete foreign ownership of firms to a later date, when a legitimate Iraqi government is elected by the Iraqi people in free and fair elections."

STRIKES MAY LOWER PACIFICARE'S EARNINGS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a leading operator of Medicare health plans, said strikes at California supermarkets might lower its earnings this year. 
Work stoppages over health benefits at Albertson's Inc., the Ralphs Grocery chain of the Kroger Company and the Vons stores of Safeway Inc. may cause PacifiCare to miss goals for increasing membership and trim as much as 19 cents a share from 2004 earnings on a presplit basis, the company said. PacifiCare, which is based in Cypress, Calif., insured about 48,000 United Food and Commercial Workers members who have been striking against the supermarkets since October and provided prescription-drug services to another 200,000. Some employees lost eligibility for coverage because of the strikes, the company said.

Few Jobs Were Added To Labor Force in December
Job growth came to an unexpected halt in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, and rather than hunt for work, thousands of people disappeared from the labor force.
 Most forecasters thought December would be a breakthrough month for job creation, given the strengthening economy. But instead of the 150,000 new jobs they had expected, there were only 1,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.7 percent from 5.9 percent in November, but that was mainly because so many people chose not to look for work, a requirement to be counted as unemployed. Page A1. 

Investors sold shares after the employment report. The Dow Jones industrials declined 133.55 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,458.89, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 10.06 points, to 1,121.86. The Nasdaq composite index was down 13.33 points, to 2,086.92. C4.

Damages Ordered in Smoking Case
A jury in Brooklyn said that Brown & Williamson should pay punitive damages of $8 million in the lung cancer death of an individual smoker. The jury also assessed an additional $12 million against two tobacco industry trade organizations that have been dissolved. B1.

LG Card Avoids Bankruptcy
LG Card avoided bankruptcy after its creditors agreed to a five trillion won ($4.23 billion) rescue package that puts it under management by the Korea Development Bank, which has a 25 percent stake. C4.

Auction Set for F.A.O. Schwarz
FAO received bankruptcy court approval to auction its F.A.O Schwarz assets, including leases for stores on Fifth Avenue in New York and in Las Vegas. C2.

Parmalat Executive Surrenders
Giovanni Bonici, left, the former head of Parmalat's operations in Venezuela, turned himself in to prosecutors and was jailed after briefly appearing at the courthouse in Parma, Italy. Mr. Bonici was also president of Bonlat, a Parmalat unit that investigators say was at the center of a web of offshore front companies. His lawyer said Mr. Bonici was not guilty of a criminal act, but he said that Mr. Bonici might have violated some administrative laws and should face some administrative penalties. C3.

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 Smurfit-Stone Container, the nation's largest packaging company, said yesterday that it was closing four plants -- in Indiana, California, Texas and Kentucky -- in a cost-cutting move that eliminates 315 jobs, or about 1 percent of its work force. 
The largest of the plants is in Anderson, Ind., where the closing and 143 job cuts were announced this week. That plant makes corrugated containers. A corrugated container plant in San Jose, Calif., and sheet plants in Temple, Tex., and Louisville, Ky., are also closing. About 240 hourly and 75 salaried employees will be affected.

Saddam Is Prisoner of War Under Geneva Convention
The Defense Department has granted Saddam Hussein prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention, giving independent observers access to him for the first time since his capture. Information about him has been tightly guarded, although members of the Iraqi Governing council were allowed to confirm his identity. A1

A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a Shiite mosque in Baquba, Iraq, as Friday Prayers drew to a close, killing 4 other people and wounding 37. Concerns arose among Iraqis that the attack was meant to ignite sectarian fighting, something that so far has been avoided amid other violence in Iraq. A6

The major political parties of the Iraqi Governing Council and Kurdish leaders agreed that the northern Kurdish region should keep much of its autonomy. The issue has emerged as the most volatile one confronting officials as they try to create a transitional government by July. A6

The United States moved to secure Secretary General Kofi Annan's public backing for the American plan to transfer authority to Iraqis, and to persuade him to send United Nations staff members back to Baghdad. A6

Guantanamo Prisoner Release

HEADLINE: As Far as Jobs Go, B ush Can Only Wait 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The stage had been set to celebrate the revival of jobs.
 With a phalanx of women entrepreneurs at his side and a billboard covered with the word "Jobs!" behind him, President Bush proclaimed his confidence about the economy here on Friday. But he made only passing reference to the latest news about employment. 
 The reason was clear: Friday's report on unemployment in December was much weaker than either the administration or most independent economists had predicted. Job creation was virtually nil, and the unemployment rate declined only because the labor force shrank by 309,000 workers. Many of those were people who had simply become too discouraged to keep looking for work. 
The problem confronting Mr. Bush is that there is little he can do between now and the elections except wait and hope that the employment picture improves. And the administration is not likely to get much more help from the Federal Reserve, which has already reduced short-term interest rates to just 1 percent.
"In terms of big levers to pull, they don't have anything," said Pierre Ellis, a senior economist at Decision Economics, a forecasting company.
It is entirely possible that the job trend will abruptly improve over the next several months. Businesses are more optimistic and more willing to invest in expansion than they have been in years, and that should translate into more jobs at some point.
President Bush may also have an ace in the hole. Last year's tax cuts are expected to produce another big bulge of tax refunds and lower tax bills between now and June -- about $40 billion in extra cash flow to households, according to economists at Goldman Sachs and Macroeconomic Advisers. 
"It's not a good idea to give excessive weight to any particular statistic," said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. "If you look at the pattern, most of the economic news has been good rather than bad."
Both the White House and the Fed are confronted by a recovery unlike any other in modern history. Economic growth has been soaring for months, corporate profits have shot up and the stock market has regained much of its old ebullience. 
Yet job creation has been slower than in almost any previous recovery, and wage growth has slowed to a crawl. That appears to reflect another big new element that lies entirely outside the president's control: the enormous increases in productivity, which have made it possible for companies to squeeze more output from each worker.
"The evidence is powerful that we can have 4 or 5 percent growth without hiring much," said John Makin, a senior economist at the American Enterprise Institute. Mr. Makin has long been among the more pessimistic economic forecasters, but the employment and wage data on Friday came in far worse than even he had expected. "I was stunned, quite frankly," he said.
It is not unusual for presidents to undertake actions to straighten out the economy and then do little but hope and pray they work -- and in time. Jimmy Carter appointed Paul A. Volcker as chairman of the Fed, and he increased interest rates to stem inflation. The first President Bush reluctantly raised taxes to deal with a ballooning budget deficit. In each case, those actions helped the economy recover, but not in time to earn Mr. Carter or Mr. Bush a second term. 
Administration officials know that the crucial issue in an election season is jobs. And President Bush's track record, a net loss of more than two million jobs since he took office, remains one of his biggest political weaknesses.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Bush's Democratic opponents jumped on the jobs number as another opportunity to attack his record.
"President Bush has all but declared 'Mission Accomplished' on an economy that is still not generating jobs," said Gen. Wesley K. Clark. Howard Dean, who has distanced himself from former President Bill Clinton through much of his campaign, said Mr. Bush had generated only 1,000 jobs in December while the economy added about 1,000 jobs every three hours during Mr. Clinton's administration. 
"What further proof do we need that George Bush's economic policies are a failure for working Americans?" Mr. Dean said in a statement issued after the new employment data was released.
Unable to do much more to stimulate the economy, administration officials have stepped up their arguments that the three tax cuts over the last three years have made the economic slowdown and job losses shorter and smaller than they might otherwise have been.
"Without the passage of the president's plans, by the second quarter in 2003, the unemployment rate would have been nearly one percentage point higher," Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said earlier this week. "As many as 1.5 million fewer Americans would be working, and real G.D.P. would have been as much as 2 percent lower."
It is impossible to prove or disprove such contentions, but they are unlikely to comfort voters in big industrial states where hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs have been lost over the last three years. 
Administration officials also appear to have stepped up efforts to show their concern, sometimes by criticizing "unfair trade practices" by China and other countries and occasionally by offering help in prominent cases.
On Thursday, for example, the Export-Import Bank announced a new agreement to lend $35 million to Malden Mills, a textile company in Massachusetts whose owners have been trying to pull it out of bankruptcy court. 
However well intentioned, such moves amount to little more than window dressing. "If they want to do something for public relations, they might have some kind of job hiring incentive," Mr. Ellis of Decision Economics said. "But it could not possibly be something of a magnitude that would affect this economy."

HEADLINE: Ethnic Friction Over Signs That Lack Translations 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Should stores in ethnic neighborhoods be allowed to have signs with no English on them?
 That delicate issue was revisited yesterday in Flushing, Queens, which has received an influx of Koreans in recent years; a bustling stretch of Northern Boulevard could briefly be mistaken for a commercial strip in Seoul. Most of the businesses have signs emblazoned with large Korean letters. Some have no English words, and some have messages in fragmented English that give no clue to a business's nature. 
 A task force led by City Councilman John Liu of Flushing announced yesterday that the problem was not serious enough to warrant a new city law requiring some English on signs. The task force, which includes other local elected officials and civic leaders, surveyed 293 businesses along a stretch of Northern Boulevard from Main to 162nd Street. It found that only 5 percent of the stores had signs bearing no English. Twelve percent had English words that were not descriptive of the businesses.
 But some people disagree.
"Look at that sign," said Ken Westerfield, 38, of Whitestone, who stood on the boulevard yesterday pointing to a large Korean-language sign next to a supermarket. Its only English words were "Now" and "24 Hours." "You tell me what that sign is for," Mr. Westerfield said. "I can't figure it out." He added that the sign controversy has highlighted ethnic discord between Korean immigrants and longtime white residents of Queens.
 "A lot of white people who've grown up here resent Koreans setting up businesses that sell only to other Koreans, buy from other Koreans and do business only with other Koreans," he said. "They ruin the economy for regular Americans."
 City law does not require storefront signs to be written in English, a spokeswoman for the City Buildings Department said yesterday. But Councilman Tony Avella, who represents part of the Korean area of Flushing, said he was preparing a bill requiring all signs in the city to be "at least half in English."
 In September, Mr. Avella set off a controversy by opposing a Korean-language billboard in Flushing advertising a car service. At the time, he cited a 1909 state law requiring some English on signs. Yesterday, task force members called the law unenforceable. Mr. Avella agreed. He was not at the news conference yesterday, but in a phone interview, he said, "I have no intention of backing off" and called signs with no English "a form of discrimination."
 "There's an awful lot of people who feel very strongly about this," he said. "I don't think there's racism here, but people really feel discriminated against when they suddenly see a store sign in the neighborhood they grew up in, and can't understand it. The obvious response is to say, 'They don't want me in their store; they don't want me here.' "
 Mr. Liu said his office had received hundreds of calls complaining about signs with no English, as well as complaints about all-English signs with no Korean. Instead of legislation, he advocated educating and assisting business owners regarding their signs. He compared the issue to Yiddish signs on the Lower East Side a century ago and Russian signs in the Brighton Beach neighborhood in Brooklyn today.
 Most larger businesses on Northern Boulevard, like the Seoul Plaza shopping center, have signs with English translations.
 In the Tipperary Arms, an Irish pub nestled among many Korean businesses on Northern Boulevard, a group of customers grumbled about how their families had to Americanize when they immigrated. But Koreans avoid mingling outside their community, they said.
 "You don't see a Gaelic sign on this bar, do you?" said Al Antretter, 63, a veteran and longtime Flushing resident. "It's not about the signs themselves. It's about the Koreans coming to this country and starting their businesses, but they don't want to deal with us or our language. They don't even want our business. I say, 'You're in America, speak English.' "
Asked about such attitudes yesterday, one task force member, State Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin, said, "Change is often hard for many people to accept."
Nyung Park, an owner of Jangsoo Stone Bed and Furniture, whichsells beds made of heated onyx and jade and has descriptive English on its sign, said she welcomed customers of all ethnicities.
 "I think all store signs, it's good to have English," she said. "You get more customers."

HEADLINE: $8 Million Award to Widow Punishes Tobacco Company 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
For the first time in New York State, a jury in Brooklyn yesterday said that a tobacco company should pay punitive damages for the lung cancer death of an individual smoker.
 The $8 million damage award was imposed on Brown & Williamson for conspiracy and fraudulently concealing the health risks of smoking. The jury also assessed an additional $12 million against two tobacco industry trade organizations that have been dissolved, the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research. 
 While far smaller than some awards against tobacco companies in Oregon, California and elsewhere in the country, plaintiffs' lawyers and some financial analysts said the verdict could be a turning point, encouraging many more suits against tobacco companies. It is also helping to demonstrate, they said, that there are cracks in what was for decades a legal armor that seemed to make tobacco companies invulnerable to such lawsuits nationwide. 
 "It will force the industry to stop saying these large punitive damage awards from juries are just some aberration from the West Coast," said Mary Aronson, an analyst who studies the suits for institutional investors. "Now, it's moving east."
 The award was the first in the Northeast against a tobacco company in a case involving an individual smoker's death since an eventually abandoned case in New Jersey in 1988.
 In a verdict on Dec. 18, the same Brooklyn jury said the widow of Harry W. Frankson, a Brooklyn man who died in 1999 after smoking Lucky Strikes for more than 40 years, should get $175,000 in compensation.
 After a monthlong trial, the jury said then that punitive damages, intended under the law to punish outrageous behavior, were warranted. Yesterday's decision followed a brief second phase of the case to set the amount. Some lawyers said the relatively modest amount might enhance the possibility that an appeals court could sustain it. Since 1996, smokers or their families have won 13 cases nationwide. But many very large awards, including one for $28 billion in Los Angeles, have already been reduced.
 Several jurors in the Brooklyn case said that the panel was divided and that the $20 million total punitive award was a compromise, with two of the six members working to limit the damages and others pressing for as much as $1 billion.
 "I wanted to hurt them in their pocket because I wanted to send a message," said Lenore Toscano, 61, an unemployed office worker who said she had wanted a $100 million award. "They just wanted to sell cigarettes, they didn't care about the public."
 Another juror, a 51-year-old school safety officer who declined to provide his name, said he had been outraged by evidence in the case that tobacco companies covered up the dangers of smoking. He said "they're going to keep doing it" unless they were punished.
 Mr. Frankson's widow, Gladys, who said her husband began smoking when he was a 14-year-old in Queens, said she was satisfied by the verdict. But, she told reporters in a bustling hallway of Brooklyn Supreme Court, "there is no price that replaces my husband. No amount of money."
 Brown & Williamson, the third-largest cigarette company in the country, with estimated annual revenue of $3.6 billion, put out a statement from its headquarters in Louisville, Ky. "The verdict is outrageous," it said, predicting it would be reversed. 
 A lawyer for the company, Gareth Cooper, said Brown & Williamson was particularly disappointed that the trial judge, Herbert Kramer, did not follow what Mr. Cooper said were the dictates of a United States Supreme Court decision in April. It said punitive damages should be proportional to damages awarded for compensation. In arguments, company lawyers had told the Brooklyn jurors the proper amount of punitive damages was about $50,000.
 The lawyers for Mrs. Frankson, Gary J. Douglas and Michael A. London, had suggested punitive damages of as much as $137 million.
 But the two lawyers said yesterday that the $20 million verdict would encourage other lawsuits in New York and elsewhere. 
 Until Mrs. Frankson's case, the industry had been successful in defeating other New York suits by arguing that smokers should be held personally responsible for their decisions to smoke despite information that has been widely known for decades about the health risks.
 Steve Kottak, a spokesman for Brown & Williamson, said that after every court defeat for a tobacco company, critics say that the verdict will encourage additional suits. 
He said inquiries about whether Brown & Williamson might be responsible for the $12 million in damages that were assessed against the dissolved trade organizations were "hypothetical."
 Mr. Douglas said it was unclear whether money was still available at the two dissolved trade organizations to pay the award. 
But because the jury found that Brown & Williamson conspired with those organizations and others in the industry, he said, he planned to research whether the company could be forced to pay the $12 million in damages assessed against those organizations.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Share Prices Slide After Report of Anemic Job Growth

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Investors sold off shares yesterday after the Labor Department reported anemic job growth in December, suggesting that the economic recovery is still not producing significant employment opportunities.
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 133.55 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 10,458.89, and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 10.06 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,121.86. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, which had spent much of the day in positive territory, was down 13.33 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,086.92. 
Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities in San Francisco, said the Nasdaq was bolstered in midday trading by "a liquidity phenomenon," with investors putting money in technology stocks in hopes of a 2004 repetition of the strong 2003 gains.
Still, Mr. Clark said, "I worry we may be getting a bit ahead of ourselves."
Charles H. Blood Jr., senior financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company in New York, said, "The market took the employment report badly at the start."
He noted, however, that the jobs figures were at odds with other reports of economic expansion.
"Two months in a row like this would raise a real question," Mr. Blood said. "One month, you have to decide if it's telling the truth and the other ones are wrong, or vice versa."
The markets got some comfort, at least for a while, when the Bush administration announced it was lowering the national terror alert level to yellow from orange. The homeland security secretary, Tom Ridge, said that an urgent threat had passed.
Before the market opened, the Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate dropped to 5.7 percent in December, but that companies added only 1,000 new jobs in an anemic holiday-hiring performance.
Analysts had been expecting a gain of 100,000 to 150,000 new jobs.
Although December's unemployment rate was the lowest in 14 months, it reached that level because fewer people were looking for work, the department said. More than 300,000 people gave up their search for jobs and dropped out of the pool of available workers, the department said.
Job creation is watched closely as a measure of the depth of the economic recovery from the 2001 recession and as an indicator of consumer finances. Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the economy.
The jobs report also suggests that the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates lower longer to stimulate the economy.
The bond market responded strongly to the likelihood that interest rates will remain low, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.08 percent from 4.25 percent on Thursday. The price of the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, soared 114/32, to a price of 10112/32. 
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 130/32, to 1066/32. The bond's yield, fell to 4.96 percent from 5.08 percent on Thursday.
Downgradings hurt telecommunications stocks.
Shares of AT&T fell 92 cents, to $21.06, after a Deutsche Bank analyst, Viktor Shvets, cut his rating to sell from hold. SBC Communications dropped $1.39, to $26.20, after Merrill Lynch cut the stock to sell from neutral.
The telecommunications equipment maker Lucent Technologies was down 18 cents, to $3.70, after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal-weight after what it called "significant outperformance."
Although Ford Motor projected increased profits in 2004, its shares fell 54 cents, to $16.56.
Alcoa, which swung to a fourth-quarter profit on improved productivity, was down $1.41, to $37.25.

HEADLINE: Westchester and State Seek Fiscal Stability for Hospital 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
With a financial crisis looming at Westchester Medical Center, hospital administrators and state and county officials were all struggling to come up with possible solutions for the center's fiscal troubles.
 On Thursday, after the medical center's debt rating was downgraded, both a county legislator and a financial analyst suggested that an infusion of cash from the state was needed to help fill a projected $100 million deficit for this year. But a simple bailout seemed unlikely, and the state and the county were each assessing what steps the other could take. 
 The medical center, which is in Valhalla, offers the most advanced level of care between New York City and Albany, with a burn unit, trauma center and organ transplant program. But since spinning off from the county government in 1998, the 1,000-bed hospital has suffered financial setbacks, resorting to hundreds of layoffs last year. 
On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's, two credit-rating agencies, both lowered the rating on a large portion of the center's $278 million in long-term debt to one step above junk.
Westchester has backed about $260 million of the medical center's debt, including an $85 million credit line that the medical center has exhausted. And Westchester officials are now worried that the county's own AAA bond rating, the highest of any county in the state, could be threatened if the medical center defaults on its payments.
A county legislative subcommittee had no fewer than three meetings yesterday to explore ways to keep the hospital afloat. The Legislature and county executive's office authorized the hiring of a financial consultant to help them better understand the scope of the center's problems.
The strategy that appeared to be gaining the most traction, according to hospital administrators and state and county officials, was the potential reclassification of the hospital by the state, from an academic medical center to a public hospital. The hospital continues to serve a large number of poor and uninsured patients.
"We think we've been misclassified, and we're going to talk to the state about it," said Gene A. Capello, chairman of the Westchester County Health Care Corporation, which operates the medical center.
Such a reclassification could increase the medical center's reimbursement rates considerably, resulting in additional revenue of some $15 million a year, county officials said. Larry Schwartz, the Westchester County deputy county executive, estimated that the medical center could reap as much as $80 million if a change in classification were retroactive to the year the medical center became independent.
An official in Gov. George E. Pataki's office hinted at the possibility of some sort of financial help, above and beyond any reclassification. But the official, Robert R. Hinckley, the senior deputy secretary to the governor for health and human services, said "any kind of assistance that the state would provide" would be predicated on a plan by the hospital to "restructure its operations and improve its management."
The state would expect Westchester County to do its part in rescuing the medical center, Mr. Hinckley said. "We would expect the county to have a role in any solution that is put together," he said. "The medical center provides services for the county, and it's an asset."
But county officials said that Westchester was burdened with its own set of financial problems brought on by state-mandated expenses. Moreover, the county itself is owed millions of dollars by the medical center for police and public works services that the county has provided under contract, Mr. Schwartz said.
Indeed, Westchester was looking to spread the responsibility, arguing that the counties in the Hudson Valley also shared responsibility. About 40 percent of the center's patients come from outside Westchester.
Richard L. Brodsky, a state assemblyman from Westchester, said the county should help the medical center extend its line of credit, as well as put more funds into a pool of money for malpractice judgments that predated the medical center's becoming an independent entity.
Mr. Brodsky said that the county, state and federal governments had all short-changed the medical center to a certain extent through inadequate funding. "The first task isn't how do you fill a short-term hole," he said. "It's how you restructure revenue streams so that the hospital is getting actual reimbursement for the care it is giving."

HEADLINE: Big Three Hope Rising Economy Will LiftAll Vehicles 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The Big Three are putting a bullish face on 2004, predicting that a wave of new products, aided by an improving economy, will increase earnings and might even cool off their price war.
 The first week of the year is always a big one in Detroit, opening with the press preview of the North American International Auto Show, where the industry shows off its new cars and trucks with plenty of pomp, rock and smoke machines. 
 Then the automakers get down to the business of the business as General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler meet with analysts and lay out their financial forecasts. 
The view from the auto show floor showed that the brutal battle for market share will continue in the United States, the most lucrative auto market. 
The traditional domestic industry has not been faring well, with its share down to 60.2 percent last year from 61.7 percent in 2002, according to the AutodataCorporation.
In the past, the Big Three invented their way out of trouble by creating new categories, like sport utility vehicles and minivans, while the Japanese focused on producing high-quality entries into existing markets.
Now, with no breakthrough segments on the horizon, automakers are attacking each other's traditional areas of strength, with the Japanese redoubling their efforts on pickup trucks and the Big Three trying to win back buyers of passenger cars. 
That could make this year's economic climate crucial in meeting profit goals, but automakers may have to continue to rely heavily on incentives to bring customers into showrooms. 
"The Big Three expect an improving economy to support better pricing in 2004; we don't," Gary Lapidus, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report. He says that weaker household spending will pressure sales and prices and that it will be difficult to maintain sales levels in the robust range of 17 million cars and trucks nationwide, as the industry expects.
"If the industry wants to sell 17 million vehicles, it can, if it lowers the price enough," he said. 
Incentives have already been at record highs and show few signs of abating. Through November 2003, incentives by the domestic automakers averaged $3,310 for each vehicle, compared with $2,440 in the period a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com. That compared with $941 a vehicle from the Japanese brands in 2003, which have lower incentives for a variety of reasons, including better quality reputations and favorable exchange rates.
General Motors, which includes brands like Chevrolet, Pontiac, Cadillac and Hummer, dug itself into a hole in 2003 when sales lagged in the first quarter after a big sales push in December 2002. With no interest in repeating an early slump, G.M. has rolled out aggressive incentives already, extending to five-year interest-free loans on most of its sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. 
That is on top of GM HotButton, a new promotional campaign that will give away 1,000 G.M. vehicles to customers who visit showrooms. At $50 million, the campaign is double what G.M. typically spends on a summer drive or year-end push and considerably more than at the beginning of the year. Technically speaking, it is not a sales incentive because the $50 million comes out of the advertising budget. 
Then again, the company will count these 1,000 vehicle giveaways as sales.
Chrysler has its own new sweeping incentives, adding a $2,000 rebate on top of four-year zero percent financing deals. Ford is expected to announce a new marketing program next week. 
The hope is that some of Detroit's new products, including new passenger car entries from each of the Big Three, will mitigate the price war when they are introduced later in the year. 
"A lot of our production in '04 is going to be new products, over 20 percent," said Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. "We put that against what seems to be, by all measures, an improving economic environment, and I think it suggests that at least the environment for some mitigation in the growth of incentives looks pretty good."
Nicholas V. Scheele, Ford's chief operating officer, said on Friday that the rising tide of incentives had also been offset in part by customers' trading up to more expensive models as everything becomes cheaper. 
On Friday, Ford forecast 2004 earnings of $1.20 to $1.30 a share, better than last year's but at the low end of analysts' expectations. Executives say the company's two-year-old turnaround plan will return the company to decent, if not standout, levels of profitability within a couple of years. 
Ford expects its automotive business to start generating profits again this year. Over all, the company is expecting a slight profit for 2003 after losing $6.4 billion over the previous two years.
"We're not where we need to be yet, but we're further along than many people realize," said William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and chief executive. "This is the year we're going to keep building on that momentum and delivering on our commitments."

HEADLINE: Governor Seeks Big Cuts In California's Spending 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger presented his first budget on Friday, a $76 billion spending plan for the state of California that includes significant cuts in health care, public education and payments to local governments. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger acknowledged that the reductions would be painful to many of the poorest Californians but said that he was forced by "irresponsible" spending under Gov. Gray Davis and the Democratic-dominated Legislature to make those cuts. 
 "Over the past five years, the politicians have made a mess of the California budget, and now it's time to clean it up," the governor said.
Governor Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said the state faced even more severe cuts if Californians rejected a $15 billion deficit reduction bond that will be on the ballot on March 2. His budget contains no new broad-based taxes but includes increases in tuition at state universities and in a variety of fees, including user fees for state parks.
"We will not raise taxes," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "Higher taxes will punish working families. It will kill jobs and drive businesses away. It will stall the recovery we need to pay for essential programs."
Mr. Schwarzenegger presented his budget plan in a direct and somber tone, with little of the levity that has marked many of his other public appearances since taking office in November. He spoke in the same auditorium where California's secretary of state, Kevin Shelley, made the new governor's improbable candidacy possible last July, when he announced that recall organizers had gathered more than enough signatures to put the recall question on a fall special election ballot.
The new governor promised in his campaign and in his State of the State address earlier this week to "blow up" government agencies that were not performing and make state government more efficient. But there was little evidence of a major restructuring in the budget blueprint presented on Friday. Some analysts called it a moderate document that could have been prepared by Mr. Davis, whom Mr. Schwarzenegger replaced in November.
The general fund portion of the budget came to $76 billion, a drop from the $78 billion the state anticipates spending in the current year, which ends June 30. Including special earmarked funds and bond revenues, the proposal projects total state spending next year of $99.1 billion.
The budget includes a modest increase in state tax revenue over the current year, based on projections of an improving economy. It also includes $500 million in potential revenue from Indian casinos. Under agreement with the state, gaming tribes currently do not pay taxes to the state but pay modest amounts to offset the local impact of the casinos. Mr. Schwarzenegger is hoping to negotiate a deal that would allow expansion of gambling operations in exchange for payments to the state.
The governor anticipated criticism from advocates for the poor, university officials and representatives of local government, who are all seeing their programs cut.
"Everyone will be worried about what this means," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "What it means is we have to cut back for the next two years until we get out of this crisis. It's that simple."
Mr. Schwarzenegger promised during the campaign not to cut financing for education, and this budget does include a $2 billion increase in spending for kindergarten through high school classes next year. But schools would have been entitled to $2 billion more than that under the state's complex education financing formula. Mr. Schwarzenegger negotiated a deal with the state's teachers' union to make that reduction with the promise that schools would not face further cuts in later years.
The budget proposed reducing the number of incoming freshmen and raising fees for all students at the University of California and California State University systems.
The governor's proposal does not contain any increase in sales or income taxes, but relies on fund shifts, borrowing and one-time accounting moves to cover more than half of the $14 billion shortfall between spending and projected revenue for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The plan anticipates $3 billion in proceeds from the $15 billion bond on the March ballot. The remainder of the bond proceeds will be used to cover deficits in the current fiscal year.
The governor's plan cuts spending by more than $4.6 billion, with the largest reduction, roughly $2.7 billion, coming from health and human services programs. The proposal limits the number of new children enrolled in health programs. It also raises deductibles and co-payments for recipients of Medi-Cal, the state's name for the Medicaid program, and cuts payments to medical providers. 
Democrats and advocacy groups said that Mr. Schwarzenegger was singling out the most vulnerable populations for the deepest cuts.
Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a consumer group, said: "Under this proposal, hundreds of thousands of children and others would be denied basic care, and millions of Californians would have to pay more to get basic health services. The governor is putting the burden of this crisis on low- and moderate-income families, rather than restoring the tax brackets for himself and other wealthy Californians, so they can share in the solution."
Representatives of county governments, which would lose $1.3 billion, also voiced opposition.
Steve Szalay, executive director of the California State Association of Counties, said that counties delivered vital services, including public safety, sanitation and health programs. He said the proposed cuts, on top of more than $1 billion in reductions last year, would be devastating.
Democrats in the Legislature were somewhat measured in their reactions. They realize that Mr. Schwarzenegger's resounding victory last fall and his ability to communicate directly with the public have changed the political calculus in Sacramento. California's constitution requires a two-thirds majority to pass a budget, and while Democrats dominate both chambers of the Legislature, they do not hold two-thirds of the seats.
Under Mr. Davis, most Democrats expressed belief that the budget could not be balanced without raising new revenue. Now, however, they appear willing to try.
"If he can find a budget solution that more equitably distributes the pain without raising taxes," said Speaker-elect Fabian Nunez, a Democrat from Los Angeles, "then we're willing to talk."
The governor said he hoped he could get Democrats to go along with his proposals, as they have for much of his early agenda. In a lighter moment in his news conference he said, "I don't have a specific plan on how I'm going to deal with each one of the Legislators and how many cigars I need to smoke with them when I get together with them and all of those kinds of things."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MINISTER; 
Sharpton's Bid Renews Queries Over Finances

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
While the Rev. Al Sharpton has struggled to raise contributions for his longshot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign has paid thousands of dollars for him to stay in luxury hotels and to travel around the country with his own personal filmmaker.
 Even as the campaign awaits word from the Federal Election Commission on whether it will be certified for matching money -- which would mean an infusion of more than $100,000 from taxpayers -- a review of the candidate's most recent campaign report, filed in September, shows it is marked by oversights, errors and potential violations. 
 The campaign, for example, did not report the free use of cars. A spokesman for the commission said it should have been reported, and the contribution could also be illegal. 
In many ways, the campaign parallels Mr. Sharpton's personal and professional lives when it comes to finances, according to court, New York State and New York City records. Besides disclosing a history of staying in expensive hotels, flying first class and relying on limousine services, though, such records also reveal a series of judgments, lawsuits and tax debts.
Mr. Sharpton tried to deflect blame for his financial record by suggesting that he and many of the people around him were not financial experts, but activists who should be given some leeway in such matters. 
"We are an advocacy group," Mr. Sharpton said in an interview on Christmas morning, referring to his group, the National Action Network. "Your staff sometimes lets things slip through the cracks, probably."
"This morning we are feeding the homeless," he said. "I have no idea if they paid the guy that brings the truck, or tipped the guy that brings in the bread." 
But Mr. Sharpton's financial lapses extend to his life as a businessman and a civil rights leader. He is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, a review Mr. Sharpton said was spurred by questions about the accuracy of his personal and business tax filings. In 1993, as part of a deal to settle two New York State felony charges, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense of not filing his personal state income taxes seven years earlier.
Mr. Sharpton said that the financial issues should not reflect badly on his fitness to be a candidate for president. Further, he said that in September he brought in Charles Halloran, a new campaign manager, and that he has hired a lawyer with an expertise in campaign finance.
But while the campaign has struggled to raise money, collecting $284,000 by September, Mr. Sharpton chose to stay in luxury hotels like the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, a European-style hotel with antiques and private balconies, and the Mandarin Oriental in Miami, on Biscayne Bay. Most candidates stay in more modest hotels to hold expenses down.
Mr. Sharpton said he chose the Mansion on Turtle Creek because he was attending a Black Expo and other attendees were staying there. According to his filing to the commission, the bill came to $3,264.11 for one night for Mr. Sharpton; Eddie Harris, his personal filmmaker; and Mr. Harris's sister, Marjorie Harris Smikle, the executive director of the National Action Network. 
In July, Mr. Sharpton spent $7,343.20 at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles for a three-day stay that included campaign-related events at the hotel. 
"If I was going to go and live the high life, I certainly wouldn't be doing it one night or two nights at a time," Mr. Sharpton said about his choice of accommodations.
He said he had agreed that the campaign would now pay only $200 a night for his or any other person's hotel room and, if the election commission permitted it, he would pay the difference to stay at a more expensive hotel.
The campaign has also spent thousands of dollars on airfare and lodging for Mr. Harris, who, according to Mr. Halloran, does not work for the campaign. Instead, he is under contract with the National Action Network and has a deal with Mr. Sharpton to film his activities. In June and July, the campaign paid about $4,000 in airfare for Mr. Harris. 
Election-law experts said using campaign contributions to cover noncampaign-related expenses is improper, and a commission spokesman said Mr. Harris's travel and lodging was probably not a "qualified campaign expense." 
The Sharpton campaign also did not report that it had received the free use of cars from a car dealer in South Carolina. That should have been reported as an in-kind campaign contribution, Mr. Halloran said. Bob Biersack, a spokesman for the election commission, said that in some circumstances the free car use could be considered an illegal corporate contribution.
Campaign records also show that when Frank Watkins, Mr. Sharpton's national campaign manager, left the campaign in September, he was owed thousands of dollars in unpaid salary and expenses. The new campaign manager said some of that had been paid, and Mr. Sharpton said they parted on good terms. 
But when questions were raised about the campaign's filing in September, Mr. Sharpton primarily blamed Mr. Watkins for the problems. Mr. Watkins, while cautious about not entering into a feud with Mr. Sharpton, said, "I know what the F.E.C. rules are, and I made those rules known to the candidate."
In any case, Mr. Halloran said, "Since I have been here I have made it very clear to people what the rules are and that we would follow them, and the reverend has backed me 100 percent on that."
A financial record like Mr. Sharpton's would probably put an end to most bids for office. But Mr. Sharpton has benefited from not being taken quite so seriously as a candidate -- and from the financial reputation he brought into the race. He is, after all, the man who said in a deposition about his finances that the only things he owned were his watch and wedding ring. "That's about it," he replied to a lawyer's question.
Until recently, the clearest picture of Mr. Sharpton's finances was given in that deposition, which was taken on Dec. 6, 2000, for a lawsuit stemming from the 1987 case of Tawana Brawley, the teenager from Wappingers Falls, N.Y., who claimed to have been abducted and raped by a group of white men.
The Brawley case was determined to have been a hoax by a grand jury and Mr. Sharpton was subsequently assessed a $65,000 judgment in a defamation suit for accusing a local prosecutor, Steven A. Pagones, of taking part in the attack.
When he failed to pay, Mr. Pagones's lawyer, Garry M. Bolnick, took the deposition looking for Mr. Sharpton's assets. 
In the deposition, Mr. Sharpton said he made about $73,000 a year from the National Action Network, and was vague about any other income, including cash "love offerings" collected at churches where he preaches.
He said in the Christmas Day interview that he regrets parrying with the lawyer during the deposition. He also said his answers did not include references to property that he owned with his wife. 
A recent filing with the election commission that is required of presidential candidates provided new details about Mr. Sharpton's income. He disclosed that in 2002 he earned $381,900 -- $78,000 from the National Action Network; $75,000 from Kensington Publishing, the publisher of his book "Al on America"; $25,000 from Pepsico for sitting on an advisory board; $3,900 from Inner City Broadcasting for a radio show; and $80,000 from various companies for consulting work. 
Another $120,000 came from speeches and sermons through a company he identifies in his filing and in court papers as Rev. Als Productions. When no company by that name could be found, Mr. Sharpton said it was actually RevAls Communications, a corporate identity he created in 1999, of which Rev. Als Productions is a subsidiary. 
A tax return for 2002 shows Mr. Sharpton's group, the National Action Network, reported $1.93 million in revenue, mostly from unidentified contributors.
Mr. Sharpton said the group has relatively few financial problems given the number of vendors it deals with.
But, he said: "If they are wrong, then the buck stops. I am the president, I am responsible, I am not saying we are infallible. But clearly when you are dealing with corporations, dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, you can have mistakes. You can have problems. When they have come to my attention, or to the attention of the board, or those in authority, we try to rectify, but this clearly doesn't show the width and breadth of the organization." 
In many cases of claims against the National Action Network, though, creditors said they tried to talk with Mr. Sharpton or his aides to work out payment schedules of the debts. They said their overtures were either ignored or the arrangements were ultimately not met. 
For instance, the National Action Network ran up a debt of $76,704.34 with 1-800-Limo-Center, a business based in Rochelle Park, N.J., which provided Mr. Sharpton with car service at cities around the country, said Howard Levi, a lawyer representing the car service. When the network failed to meet a court schedule to pay off the debt, a judgment was imposed. The remaining unpaid debt is about $30,000, Mr. Levi said. 
Asked about the case, Mr. Sharpton objected only to calling the company a limousine service because, he said, he never rides in limousines. 
The National Action Network also owes about $16,000 on a $25,222.83 bill from a conference it held at the Millennium Hotel in New York on Jan. 19, 2000, court records show.
The network also has a tax warrant against it for failure to pay New York State $15,446.31 in unemployment insurance. Christine Burling, a state labor department spokeswoman, said in a statement: "The Department of Labor reached out to the organization via telephone and we provided them with written notices numerous times, but have been unsuccessful in getting the National Action Network Inc. to take corrective action. As a result, the department had no choice but to issue warrants." 
Mr. Sharpton said this week that he was unaware of the unpaid taxes and had instructed his lawyer to straighten the matter out. 
This year, a small travel agency in Manhattan filed a lawsuit against the National Action Network and Mr. Sharpton, saying that the network refused to pay nearly $200,000 for travel, including a trip Mr. Sharpton took to Sudan, plus interest. That dispute is also pending. 
Mr. Sharpton's entertainment promotion company, Raw Talent Inc., was dissolved in 2002 for failing to file tax returns for 1991, 1995 and 2002, and not paying taxes in 1991, 1992, and 1995 through 2002, state officials said.
Mr. Sharpton said that the issue of overdue taxes for Raw Talent is one item being reviewed in the federal audit, which he said was looking into what the I.R.S. feels may be undeclared income in four separate years. He said that the focus of the I.R.S. audit was reimbursed expenses and thus not subject to taxes.
At least one of Mr. Sharpton's recent debts has been fully paid. After he failed to pay the $65,000 he owed to Mr. Pagones for defamation damages, his friend Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan borough president, came to his aid. 
With interest, supporters organized by Mr. Sutton paid Mr. Pagones nearly $80,000.

HEADLINE: What's in a $400 Rebate? One iPod, or Two Manolos 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Inside the Family Corner Restaurant on 31st Street in Astoria, Queens, the question yesterday was what to do with the $400 that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg wants to give homeowners as a rebate on the 18.5 percent property tax increase from 2002. 
 Between bites of a veal sandwich at a table in the back, Barry Edison had a quick, four-word answer: "Buy an iPod Mini." 
 This led to another question: What would Mr. Edison, an official with the city's Bureau of Correctional Health, do with the iPod he was carrying in his pocket? 
"Probably give it to my wife," he said.
Is that what experts mean by trickle-down economics? That question went unanswered at the Family Corner, but the consensus was that $400 would not go very far. Some said it would not be enough to go on vacation.
It is, it turns out, enough for a pair of Manolo Blahnik pony-hair shoes with three-inch-high heels (starting bid: $349.99 on eBay) or a forge for making horseshoes (starting bid: $325, also on eBay). But $400 -- the amount City Hall estimates most homeowners would receive -- would not cover one second on the national debt clock at www.toptips.com. 
And George Kavadias, who owns the Family Corner and was taking orders for Greek salads and souvlakis at lunchtime yesterday, doubted that $400 would cover tickets to the Rangers. ("Maybe the Islanders, though," he said.)
Still, he was enthusiastic.
"Four hundred dollars is a fantastic gift from Bloomberg," Mr. Kavadias said, in part because the city had doubled parking fines at about the same time that it raised property taxes. "The extra on the tickets hurt the neighborhood," he said. "One hundred and ten dollars is too expensive for the average Joe to pay."
A waitress, Joanne Tsarsitalidis, zipped by. "Bloomberg's out of touch with the middle class," said Ms. Tsarsitalidis, who, as a renter, would not be eligible for the rebate. "I wonder if the rebate's for re-election."
Mr. Kavadias sighed. "It probably is," he said. "Four hundred dollars isn't much. But it's something." Then, sounding like a voter speaking his mind directly to Mr. Bloomberg, he added, "Four hundred dollars? I can pay off my credit card bills, but you take so much from me in one year."
How to spend a $400 rebate was being talked about in corners beyond the Family Corner yesterday. Christian Moulin, a hair stylist in Manhattan, wanted to spend his $400 on dinner at Daniel, Daniel Boulud's restaurant on East 65th Street -- "just by myself, not even with my wife," Mr. Moulin said. "On $400, you can only be extravagant for one." Or, he figured, he could go to the Metropolitan Opera 25 times if he bought standing-room tickets in the orchestra ($16, except on Saturdays) or fly -- coach, of course -- to Paris on the lowest fare he could find.
"But then you have to spend the money on a hotel," he said, "and that will cost you three times that rebate."
And Mr. Edison at the Family Corner? He may have rebate money to burn. The iPod Mini will cost only $250 when it goes on sale next month. That would leave Mr. Edison with $150.
No, it won't, he said. There is always new software to be bought. "You put me in the Apple store," he said, "and whatever's in my pocket goes."

HEADLINE: GROWTH IN JOBS GROUND TO HALT DURING DECEMB ER 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Job growth came to an unexpected halt in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday, and rather than hunt for scarce work, tens of thousands of people disappeared from the labor force.
 Most forecasters had said they thought December would be a breakthrough month for job creation, given the strengthening economy. But instead of the 150,000 new jobs they had expected, there were a minuscule 1,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.7 percent from 5.9 percent in November, but that was mainly because so many people chose not to look for work, a requirement to be counted as unemployed. 
 "We thought we were finally moving out of the jobless recovery, that the work force was really growing at last," said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist for Global Insight, a research and forecasting firm. "And now this report is telling us we are still stuck in a jobless recovery." 
President Bush, speaking in Washington before a group of small-business owners, focused on the drop in the unemployment rate, which he called "a positive sign that the economy is getting better." 
Other administration officials called attention to the few positives in the report -- for example, job growth in construction, education and health care. "We think we have the policies in place to produce job growth going forward," N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview, referring to what he described as the stimulus from the Bush tax cuts.
But there is little more the president can do to stimulate the economy, and the administration is not likely to get much more help from the Federal Reserve, which has already lowered short-term interest rates to just 1 percent. That leaves the White House waiting and hoping that the employment picture improves between now and the elections. News analysis, Page C1. 
For Democrats on the campaign trail, the employment numbers were an opportunity to heap criticism on the administration. 
"With the recovery that we're supposed to be in, adding a thousand jobs is pathetic, nothing short of pitiful and pathetic," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri told reporters in Concord, N.H. "This president is presiding over an economy that is still not producing jobs."
The government lowered by more than a third its original estimates of the number of jobs created in October and November. Instead of an increase of 143,000 jobs in those months, the revised total was 94,000. 
That shaved the total job creation to 278,000 in the five months that the economy has been adding jobs. Most economists maintain that job growth must proceed at a pace of at least 150,000 a month, on average, to absorb everyone who wants to work -- a rate that the economy is lagging well behind.
Citing the weak labor market, Ben S. Bernanke, an influential governor of the Federal Reserve, declared in a speech last Sunday that the central bank would keep interest rates down to encourage borrowing and spending to keep the recovery from dying out. Yesterday's jobs report only reinforced the prospect that rates will stay low, and in response, bond prices rose and stock prices and the dollar fell, as they often do on such news. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.26 percent, closing at 10,458.89.
The jobs data left economists struggling to reconcile the nation's strong economic growth with faltering employment. How can the output of goods and services be going up so briskly, as most statistics show, without bringing up employment, too?
One answer is productivity. The output from an hour of work has been rising faster than the demand for what is produced, and employers have brought the two into balance by holding back on hiring while pushing existing workers to keep up their output.
"I think we got slower productivity growth in the fourth quarter than the third," Mr. Gault said, "but when it will run out enough so that we have to create more jobs is anybody's guess." Data on productivity in the last three months of 2003 will be released next month; in the third quarter, productivity rose 9.4 percent.
The second explanation that some economists cite is statistics that they describe as faulty, or at least conflicting. 
The bureau calculates employment two ways. It surveys net job changes at 400,000 companies representative of the nation's nearly nine million incorporated businesses. Most economists regard that method, called the payroll survey, as more reliable and comprehensive than the bureau's household survey, in which members of 60,000 households are interviewed each month. 
But the household survey is better at catching self-employment and off-the-books work than the payroll survey. According to the household survey, job creation averaged 278,000 a month from October through December, even allowing for 54,000 jobs lost in December. That was nearly six times the job creation in the payroll survey, and some economists say that at this juncture in the recovery, the household numbers merit more attention.
"The payroll survey is underestimating job creation," said Maury N. Harris, chief United States economist at UBS, the global banking firm. "I don't know by how much, but when all is said and done, you probably will be closer to what household is telling you."
Another hard-to-interpret number in yesterday's report was the drop of two-tenths of a percentage point in the unemployment rate. Unemployment has declined from a peak of 6.3 percent in June, when the many months of weak economic growth in the aftermath of the 2001 recession finally began to give way to a much more visible upturn.
Normally, a falling jobless rate means that the unemployed are seeking and finding jobs. But in December, 309,000 working-age men and women who would normally be job hunting either left the labor force or did not bother to enter it in search of work, the bureau reported.
If they had not either dropped out or found jobs, the unemployment rate would have remained at 5.9 percent.
"Of all the parts of the December employment report that I think are specious, it is the decline in the unemployment rate, which is likely to be reversed next month," said William Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman Sachs.
Dropping out has been a characteristic of the recovery since June, reflecting the struggles of the unemployed amid companies' reluctance to add workers. As a result, the percentage of the working-age population participating in the labor force -- that is, employed or seeking employment -- fell to 66 percent in December from 66.5 percent in June, a withdrawal of roughly 1.1 million people.
Reflecting this exodus, the employment-to-population ratio -- a measure of the percentage of the working-age population actually holding jobs -- has been dropping, as well. It has fallen nearly eight-tenths of a percentage point, to 62.2 percent, since the recession ended in November 2001, and 2.1 percentage points since the start of the recession in March of that year. 
Federal Reserve policy makers consider this ratio an important indicator of how many jobs can be added without upward pressure on wages or inflation. Mr. Bernanke has cited the weakness in the ratio as an important reason for keeping interest rates low.
The decline in the ratio has been particular sharp among young people, African-Americans and Hispanics, and economists say it may help to explain a deterioration in wages among workers in jobs below the level of manager or supervisor. These workers account for 80 percent of the 130.1 million people in the work force. Their average hourly earnings, which rose 3 cents, to $15.50, in December, are growing at an ever slower annual rate: 2 percent in December, down from 3.2 percent a year earlier.
"What we worry about is consumer spending in 2004," said Mr. Gault, the Global Insight economist. "We got a lot of help in 2003 from tax cuts and from mortgage refinancings. This year, however, we are counting on better employment gains to support consumer income growth and, in turn, consumer spending. If we don't get the jobs, we will have to worry about the consumer."
The biggest jump in employment last month, a rise of 30,000, came in jobs for temporary workers. Economists said those gains reflected the reluctance of employers to take on permanent workers until the recovery becomes much stronger.
Manufacturing, which has shed workers all through the recession and recovery, lost 26,000 more jobs in December, on a seasonally adjusted basis. On that basis, jobs also disappeared in retailing, hotel work and restaurants -- 42,000 in all.
Despite the mild job growth since August, total employment fell last year by 331,000 on top of a 1.5 million drop in 2002. The last time employment, as measured by the survey of 400,000 establishments, declined for two consecutive years was in 1944 and 1945 as war production wound down.

HEADLINE: AMERICA IN SPACE: THE MISSIONS; 
For Space Glory, Reach for the Stars, Experts Say

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Disasters big and small have struck the federal space establishment with alarming regularity of late: satellites have failed, space shuttles have blown up, astronauts have died.
 NASA has captivated the public this week with dazzling pictures from the rover it just landed on Mars. But closer to Earth, at the International Space Station, air is slowly leaking and no one knows why. The Pentagon, after spending billions, is having trouble making a booster rocket for the antimissile system it is trying to build. A new generation of spy satellites is behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. Landsat 7, a federal satellite that observes the Earth, is sending back fuzzy pictures and acting like a malfunctioning video camera. 
 All of these troubles raise the question of whether the nation has the technical muscle to achieve President Bush's vision of setting up a human base on the moon and sending Americans to Mars, a plan he is expected to announce next week.
"NASA has gotten obese and encumbered," said Rick N. Tumlinson, a founder of the Space Frontier Foundation, a private group in Nyack, N.Y., that advocates bold exploration. "It's like a former Olympic athlete eating potato chips and drinking beer while watching reruns of past glories."
The consensus of experts is that NASA and the nation's wider space community are damaged in vital areas and now clearly unable to do anything ambitious.
But the space program could soar again, they said, even with modest funding increases -- if it is revitalized by bold leadership and tough political calls, like finding a graceful way to end the shuttle program, which has already outlasted its intended life span and is a huge drain on NASA's resources.
If done right, they said, the initiative could end the string of failures and replace them with new achievements.
"This is a way of fixing a lot of that by providing a focus that will draw good people back into the space program," Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said. "The current problems are a result of a lack of focus."
Any return to the moon, let alone a much more ambitious and dangerous foray to Mars, would require new generations of advanced rockets, engines, air and food supplies, communications gear and shields to protect humans from blasts of solar radiation.
But Jerry Grey, policy director of the American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics, a professional group of aerospace engineers based in Washington, said the technical woes were not insurmountable or uniform. He noted that the Spirit robot that recently landed on Mars was apparently working flawlessly as it readied to explore the planet.
"The technical establishment is not fine," he said. "There are a lot of things wrong with it. But it's not about to fall apart. And an initiative like what President Bush appears to be ready to announce would open up a lot of opportunities."
Mr. Tumlinson of the Space Frontier Foundation said no big budget increases would be needed for President Bush's plan but that NASA would have to be completely restructured, with unneeded centers shut down and new divisions set up to mobilize new talent.
"We're at our best when we're given our biggest challenges," he said. "When the challenges are mediocre, when they don't call on us to reach beyond ourselves, we have a tendency to perform in a mediocre fashion."
Such work, Mr. Tumlinson added, now characterized the space shuttles, which are grounded, and the space station, which is down to two crew members from three and leaking air. "We have to call on NASA to do something beyond itself," he said.
Experts who have consulted in the decision-making process said Mr. Bush's plan may call for retiring the shuttles and ending station work sometime early next decade as the nation begins a new round of moon landings.
But the political handiwork needed just to end the shuttle program would be significant, requiring major assaults on entrenched interests: When up and running, the spaceport in Florida employs some 14,000 people and each year pumps $1.4 billion into the state's economy.
Analysts said the current slump began after the cold war when the federal government cut back on its enormous investments in space technology. At the same time, scientific research in the nation's private sector took off, drawing into computers and medicine many of the best students who otherwise might have gone to NASA or the space programs of other federal agencies, including the Defense Department.
This loss of talent was one of the factors behind the Columbia space shuttle disaster last year, which killed seven astronauts, according to the panel that investigated the accident. It singled out a "broken safety culture" at NASA that played down potential problems and was too influenced by the need to meet flight schedules. It found that decision making was flawed, safety procedures incomplete and communications poor.
Similar problems have been identified in the military's space programs. Last May in a thick report, a high-level advisory panel to the Pentagon, the Defense Science Board, said those efforts were suffering from major cost increases and schedule delays, with "a devastating effect on program success."
It said the problems grew out of bureaucratic failings in which estimates had grown unrealistic and undisciplined, and that good managers were so scarce that the government's abilities to lead and manage acquisition programs "have seriously eroded."
Despite wide atrophy and decay, many experts said that bold leadership could revitalize the nation's space establishment.
Dr. Bruce C. Murray, the former director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who is now at the California Institute of Technology, said the plan that Mr. Bush is expected to announce could work if clear and properly structured.
An important part of the initiative, he said, should be for the human spaceflight program to shed its historic aversion to computers and robotic technology and to integrate them into the heart of the new work, cutting costs and empowering bold technologies for opening new frontiers.
"On earth, humans and computers are developing an enormous symbiosis," Dr. Murray noted. "But none of that is happening on the human side of spaceflight. The future belongs to that symbiosis. And we of all nations have the maximum capability to take advantage of this evolving symbiosis, and we of all nations have not."

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy Paperbacks 

BYLINE:  By Scott Veale

 BODY:
 THE TIME OF OUR SINGING, by Richard Powers. (Picador, $16.) This sprawling, difficult novel, which traces the lives of a family of musical prodigies over the course of the 20th century, spins off from the marriage of a young black voice student and a Jewish emigre physicist, whose trials and humiliations echo those of American society. "Powers combines the artistic and the scientific, classical music and physics, song and Einsteinian relativity" and creates "a fascinating, stimulating and moving . . . imagining of a harmony that continues to elude us in life," Daniel Mendelsohn said here last year.

HIGH AND MIGHTY: The Dangerous Rise of the SUV, by Keith Bradsher. (PublicAffairs, $14.) Bradsher, a correspondent for The Times who was its Detroit bureau chief from 1996 to 2001, marshals statistics, history and a cold-eyed survey of the auto industry's political maneuverings to make the case against sport utility vehicles. "It isn't so much that the average S.U.V. is underengineered, inept, unsafe, polluting, fuel-guzzling and sociopathically aggressive, he laments, as that it's so knowingly, cynically, avoidably so," Bruce McCall wrote here in 2002. The result is a "sobering, infuriating, necessary" polemic.

WHEN THE MESSENGER IS HOT: Stories, by Elizabeth Crane. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.) The women in these stories may be basket cases -- nervous, indecisive wrecks who fall for unsuitable lovers -- but they are also smarter than they think they are, and a lot funnier. "Crane has a distinctive and eccentric voice that is consistent and riveting from the first story to the last," Jennifer Reese said here in 2003, and her work "expresses a remarkably strong and coherent artistic vision."

FAT LAND: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World, by Greg Critser. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) From a business perspective, the author argues in his historical study of the nutritional contradictions of capitalism, the nation's supersizing may have been a necessity, as food companies have had to devise new ways to transform overproduction into overconsumption. As a result, 6 of 10 Americans today are overweight. This "highly readable" book "does an excellent job connecting the dots between government and corporate policies and the fattening of America," Michael Pollan wrote in these pages last year. A Consumers' Republic: The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America, by Lizabeth Cohen (Vintage, $16.95), chronicles the rise of mass consumption after World War II, a movement backed by government, business and labor that urged Americans to serve the national interest by buying everything in sight. While a triumph for capitalist production, it has been a failure for civil society and economic equality, the author maintains. In 2003 our reviewer, David M. Oshinsky, found her account "rich in detail and perception."

DEAR FIRST LOVE, by Zoe Valdes. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) In this Cuban novel, a middle-aged woman tries to rediscover her first true love by returning to the revolutionary summer camp where she was sent as a teenager to till the fields alongside the peasantry. "Valdes's voice embodies a ferocious vitality and sheer existential appetite that can't be reduced to any ideology," Jennifer Schuessler said here in 2002. "She's as much a connoisseur of the absurdities of revolutionary life as she is a critic."

THE GATE, by Francois Bizot. (Vintage, $14.) In 1971, the author, a French ethnologist, was abducted by a Khmer Rouge band and sent to a prison camp for three months, where he met a rebel commander who treated him with sympathy as they chatted of philosophy and politics, yet who eventually took charge of a notorious Cambodian killing field. Bizot's memoir, which our reviewer, Richard Eder, found "evocative, wise and crisscrossed with fury," raises questions about "the moralities of power's ends and means, the character of revolutionary fanaticism and the indecipherable humanity that flickers within it."

BLUE SHOE, by Anne Lamott. (Riverhead, $14.) Mattie Ryder, this novel's barely employed, barely-keeping-it-together heroine, spends her days in Marin County, where she endures her husband's remarriage, the birth of his new children and her own children's unrest and confusion, somehow gaining a little self-knowledge along the way and finding time for an affair of her own. The result is a "messy, brave and weirdly lovable" tale, Claire Dederer wrote here in 2002. Scott Veale

HEADLINE: Bringing Pampering To the Pampas 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR HAHN; TAMAR HAHN is as freelance journalist who reports on Latin America.

 BODY:
IN 1940 Magdalena Pena, a young woman from a prominent Buenos Aires family with a reputation for stubbornness, purchased an estancia, as a country estate or a working ranch is known in Argentina, with her husband.
 Her search for a suitable property took her to a piece of land in Argentina's pampas grasslands region, 77 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. The estate had 600 acres, much of it prone to flooding, and a decrepit house that had served as a relay stop on the post road from Buenos Aires to Peru in colonial times. 
 Unsurprisingly, Ms. Pena's family and friends thought that the property was a losing proposition. But she ignored them. Smitten by the majestic lane of sycamore trees that interlock in a thick green arch above the entranceway and the charm of the former inn, she decided to buy the property. Ms. Pena and her husband, Ricardo Aldao, refurbished the old inn, sowed corn and sunflowers in the fields and built a dairy farm. Estancia La Bamba was born. 
 These days, the estancia (now 370 acres) is still owned by the Aldao family but has largely discontinued farming and opened its doors to tourists. For a flat fee, visitors (who usually come for a day or a long weekend) get the full estancia experience: horseback riding with local gauchos, Argentina's mythological cowboys; fishing and picnicking at the nearby River Areco; bird-watching, or simply lounging around and gazing at the stubbornly horizontal landscape. 
 Argentines are also among the estancia's guests. They come seeking to escape city life, the disheartening state of the country's economy and the increasing violence that plagues the streets of Buenos Aires. 
 For me, visiting an estancia was a way to reconnect with a country in which I grew up, but one that is no longer my home. I came with rudimentary notions of Argentine history and faded memories of obligatory school trips to the countryside designed to acquaint us with our cultural heritage. At the time, my classmates and I were much more interested in the latest pop music from the United States (even though we didn't understand the lyrics) than in the riding skills of the gauchos. This time around, I was eager to rediscover the part of Argentina's tradition I had snubbed as a child. 
 When I visited my family in Argentina last May, I spent a weekend visiting two estancias, La Bamba and El Ombu de Areco, with my sister and her boyfriend. The drive northwest from Buenos Aires takes about an hour on a well-maintained highway. The bustling city quickly fades away, and the endless flat fields of the pampas unfold. The last stretch of the drive to La Bamba is on a short dirt road; on the day of our visit, rain had transformed it into a muddy mess. The three of us were picked up by Patricia Foster, the energetic caretaker of La Bamba, in a Soviet-era four-wheel-drive Lada. After skidding and sliding through the mud we arrived at the main house, or casco, a magnificent bright-pink colonial structure. 
 Stepping inside felt like going back in time. Electricity, running water and a heating system are the only nods to modernity. Everything else, from the wrought-iron beds to the turn-of-the-century bathroom fixtures and the antique furniture, reflects a bygone era. Past generations of the Aldao family in heavy Victorian attire and mounted on thoroughbreds peer down from the stucco walls. Family heirlooms are everywhere: a dresser with a set of silver combs in the master bedroom, a 200-year-old marble fireplace in the living room, and leather-bound French-language editions of Shakespeare from the turn of the century on the bookshelves. 
 The U-shaped casco surrounds a small patio with a beautifully tiled well. Guests can sleep in one of the seven bedrooms in the main house, or in the nearby grapevine-covered annex or a small cottage. A manicured lawn surrounds the property and there is a swimming pool. 
 I slept in a large, simply furnished, cozy room with two single wrought-iron beds and large windows overlooking the grounds. The bathroom had black and white tiles and turn-of-the-century white fixtures, which were charming but getting a bit rusty; there was plenty of hot water. The doors to the bedrooms have no keys and, according to the owners, nothing has ever been reported missing. But when my sister and her boyfriend had to go back to the city and I spent the night at La Bamba by myself (there were no other guests), I wished I could lock the door, just in case.
 There are no amenities like TV, phones or room service. But I was content to just walk around the property, visiting the horses in the fields and reading by the fireplace. Once I became used to the complete silence, I discovered that I needed nothing more.
 EXCEPT for food, that is. Spending some time in the Argentine countryside is as much about good, old-fashioned local food as it is about the setting. A traditional barbecue, or asado, is at the center of the estancia experience, usually served for lunch in the main dining room or, weather permitting, alfresco. My family and I had drinks and empanadas in the porch, but dark clouds kept accumulating on the horizon and we ended up having the main meal at the antique family dining table. A variety of salads were set, buffet style, and the young gaucho who had prepared the asado in the outdoor grill came by at regular intervals with sweetbreads, chorizos, kidneys and three different cuts of beef grilled to perfection. Wine was included with the meals. 
 After lunch the three of us took a walk around the grounds. But four hours later Iwas eating again. The merienda, the Argentine version of 5 o'clock tea, is typically an assortment of cakes and homemade jams with the traditional pastelito: small, crispy cakes stuffed with quince jam, fried and sprinkled with sugar. At dinner at 9:30 (served late, Argentine style), I had no problem devouring a salad of fresh spinach, a plate of homemade pasta and even some chocolate mousse. 
 Estancias can be found throughout Argentina, from the arid lands of Salta in the north to the frigid tundra of Tierra del Fuego. They are the birthplace of the country's myths, largely tailored around the prodigious riches of the land and the history of the pioneers who seized it from the Indians. 
 Established in the 17th century, the estancias produced the fabulous agricultural wealth that paved the way for Argentina to become one of the most prosperous countries in the world as the 20th century began. Newly well-to-do landowners, or estancieros, transformed themselves from rugged entrepreneurs into refined aristocrats by replacing their rudimentary homes with grandiose Spanish colonial or English Tudor mansions, French chateaus and Italian palazzos. Eager to display their refined European tastes, landowning families wore the latest Paris fashions and had 5 o'clock tea parties on their lawns.
 But Argentina's wealth would eventually run out. By the time of the country's economic collapse in 2001 the golden days of the estancias were mostly a thing of the past. In 1986, Ricardo Aldao, Magdalena Pena's son, realized that agriculture alone would not be enough to keep La Bamba going. Determined to keep the property in the family, he took what was then a radical step and opened the house to visitors. 
 "At that time tourism was anathema to the refined image and genteel ways associated with the estanciero life, and many of our neighbors looked down on my father," says Isabel Aldao, Ricardo's daughter and the estancia's manager and co-owner. "But he knew that it was the only way we could keep the estancia."
 Throughout the years, many other financially strapped estanciero families followed the Aldaos. Today, an estimated 500 estancias offer accommodations for groups and individuals and are host to weddings and business meetings. 
 "European and North American tourists are our bread and butter," Ms. Aldao says. "They come to Argentina looking for two things: tango and gauchos. In the city they have the former. We provide the latter."
 After my stay at La Bamba, I visited another estancia, El Ombu de Areco, about a mile away. The intricate wrought-iron gate at the entrance of the 740-acre property hints at the lavishness of its main building, a vine-covered Italian palazzo, with high ceilings, a marble staircase and a wide porch lined with antique tile floors. 
 The estancia's namesake, the ombu, presides over the gardens. A large evergreen shrub often mistaken for a tree because of its immense umbrella-like canopy and massive trunk, the ombu is native to the pampas. At the estancia, it provides ample shade for outdoor asados and for the gaucho shows, which consist of folk dance troupes, local musicians and the stunning displays of equestrian skills such as horseback sprints, lassoing and hog-tying.
 El Ombu de Areco was built in 1880 by Gen. Pablo Riccheri, who later became the Argentine minister of defense. In 1934 a first-generation German immigrant named Enrique Boelcke bought the property, which is now owned and managed by his granddaughter, Eva Boelcke. Like La Bamba, El Ombu was a working ranch until it fell on hard times in the 1980's and Ms. Boelcke also decided to go the tourist route. 
 "My brothers and sisters have all left Argentina for Europe and Kenya, but I could never live anywhere else," says Ms. Boelcke, a trim blond woman with a passion for horses and country life. 
 I found El Ombu's bedrooms a little dark and impersonal. The bathroom was large and equipped with antique fixtures, including a clawfoot tub. The spacious common room, with wood paneling, an oversize fireplace and French windows overlooking the gardens, is filled with equestrian artifacts and feels cozy. The estancia seems less like someone's home and more like an inn. The decor is less personal but the facilities -- the two swimming pools, the larger grounds, and the dining room were appropriate for larger groups. 
 And El Ombu offered a more hands-on estancia experience. Cattle are still raised and guests can try their hand at milking, driving cattle to harness, ear-tagging, dehorning and branding. I was eager to go riding on one of the 40 well-groomed horses, but it rained. The weather did not prevent me from enjoying an asado, though, one that was as delicious as at La Bamba. "Some of the European and American tourists that come here are not used to eating so much meat," Ms. Boelcke says. "So we make sure that there are also chicken dishes and vegetarian alternatives." 
 After a couple of days at the estancias, even the most tightly wound city slicker will be lulled into the quiet pace and endless beauty of the pampas. Ms. Aldao and Ms. Boelcke are happy to change meal times and arrange riding outings or trips to the nearby village of San Antonio de Areco. They each greet visitors personally and make sure everything is satisfactory, although I didn't have any meals with either of them. The weather limited me to walks, lounging around and enjoying some great meals. But there is plenty to do for both children and adults. 
 At the end of my weekend as I was driving through the short stretch of country road that connects La Bamba and El Ombu to the highway, out of nowhere, a gaucho on horseback appeared. With a wide hat resting just above his eyes, his black bombacha pants, and a sash over his shoulder he looked every bit the part. He smiled and touched the rim of his hat in salute. I waved and headed for the city.

Way out West, in South America

Getting There
 From Buenos Aires, drive along the Panamericana Route following the Acceso Norte, which becomes National Route No. 8. Continue on Route 8, past the tollbooth until the distance indicator for Kilometer 110. Turn right at the police station onto State Route 41 (paved) for another three miles up to the intersection with State Route 31. Turn right at the airport and continue for four miles; the estancia El Ombu de Areco will be on the right. For La Bamba, continue along the same road for a mile and you will see the bright-pink house on the right. 
 Both El Ombu and La Bamba offer car services from Buenos Aires for about $40 each way. 

The Estancias
 For reservations at La Bamba, contact Isabel Aldao, (54) 2326-456293 or (54-11) 4732 1269, www.la-bamba.com.ar. Rooms range from $180 for a large bedroom with queen bed and private bath to $120 for a single room with bath. A night at the cottage, which accommodates four, costs $240.
 For reservations at El Ombu de Areco, contact Eva Boelcke, (54-11) 4710 2795 or (54) 2326-492080, www.estanciaelombu.com. A room for two is $75 a person and a single room is $100. 
 At both estancias, the price of an overnight stay includes all meals (breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner, wine and soft drinks) and such activities as horseback riding, fishing and bird-watching. Folkloric shows featuring singing and dancing troupes and gaucho skills can be arranged; a gaucho show costs $150 and a folkloric show is $140. 
 Guests can visit for the day; it costs $35 at La Bamba and $30 at El Ombu, and includes lunch and tea and all the free activities described above. Children under 12 pay half.
 The town of San Antonio de Areco, about 20 minutes away to the south, is worth a visit for its colonial buildings, gaucho museum and many artisan shops. The estancias can provide car transportation and a guide.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER; 
Changing Coasts, on a Solo Drive

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA ROWE; CLAUDIA ROWE is a reporter at The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

 BODY:
I WAS changing my life, leaving the East Coast behind and flinging myself across the country to Seattle because I wanted to try something new. A road trip, solo, seemed a suitably adventurous way to get there -- more mind-expanding than flying and cheaper than shipping my belongings, I told skeptical friends.
 But really, I was hooked on the romance of the cross-county drive. The idea of zooming along empty highways into a scarlet sunset or sailing across acres of prairie was tantalizing. I saw myself sitting at Western bars, talking to cowboys. 
 Before any of that, though, I had to plan my route. The south suggested gothic oddity and ghostly deserts. Very Thelma and Louise. But I had never spent more than four hours at a time behind the wheel, and going that way I would have to cover three states at a single clip. A northern route -- from New York to Chicago, into the Midwestern Plains and across the Rockies -- began to seem a saner choice. 
 Only in cyberspace, on the forum at www.roadtripamerica.com, did I betray my fears. Were there things a woman driving alone should beware of, I asked; indispensable items I must bring?
 "All you need is excitement," the webmaster replied. 
 "Pepper spray," said a friend. "At those truck stops, you've got to have pepper spray."
 I was determined that my trip cost less than $600, so my itinerary was largely based on locations of people who might put me up along the way. This made Pittsburgh my first stop, and I planned to set out from Saugerties, N.Y., on a sunny September morning. But road trips never begin on time -- not for rock bands or nuclear families, and certainly not for freelance writers -- so it was 3 p.m. by the time my tires touched the New York State Thruway. 
 Most travel manuals insist that you have to leave the Interstate to find what's left of American quirk, but on that first afternoon, even superhighways seemed grand. I gazed at the green valleys lining I-80 and scanned my life, piled neatly in the back seat, through the rearview mirror. By the time I got to Pennsylvania, I was laughing out loud. 
 For weeks my greatest concern had been road hypnosis, the fear that I would be lulled into a lonely sleep at the wheel. That never happened. People kept calling my cell phone and rousing me from dreamy reveries.
 "Where are you now?" a former boyfriend asked from his desk in Manhattan on my second day out. "What are you seeing?" 
 I was in Indiana, rumbling past a tractor-trailer filled with mangy cattle who stared at me on their way, I imagined, to slaughter. I told him about the scarlet sunset instead.
 During those first days, four or five hours behind the wheel wore me out; I tried to chat with gas station clerks wherever I could, hoping folksy inspiration might propel me a few more miles. At the Ernie Pyle rest stop outside South Bend, Ind., a freckled-faced cashier was so flummoxed by my attempts at conversation he rang up my purchases twice.
It took three days to push through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin, and I spent much of the time pondering the tidy farmhouses dotting my route. Any of them could have starred on an America-the-Beautiful calendar, and I wondered what it felt like to live inside a picture postcard by the side of a highway.
 All that uniformity shattered at the House on the Rock in Spring Green, Wis., about 45 miles west of Madison. At $19.50, it was the one roadside attraction I'd resigned myself to pay for. 
 Built between 1945 and 1960 by Alex Jordan, a medical school dropout turned professional dreamer, the 14-room "house" is actually a monument to hoarding. Stone hallways lined with arms and armor lead to rooms holding ivory tusks, vintage cash registers, jeweled crowns, model ships, miniature circuses and automated orchestras, all of it funneling visitors toward a great, clanging carousel, where 239 serpents, mermaids and satyrs spin without cease. 
 The staff claims that it takes five hours to fully absorb Mr. Jordan's private fantasy world, but I'd arrived just before closing and sped through the place like someone chased by demons.
 "All by yourself?" a voice behind me whispered as I hurried through the noisy darkness.
 "You're doing very well," another guard said as I raced past an enormous calliope.
 Naked, winged mannequins floated from the ceiling. Mechanical orchestras echoed in my mind. It felt like wandering through a child's nightmare, or what we may find when Michael Jackson dies.
 After my House on the Rock experience, I was starved and feeling inexplicably dirty. Greenspirit Farm, a mile down the road, beckoned. I thought I'd buy a bag of apples for dinner and eat them all the way into Minnesota. An old man with a thick beard sat on a bench outside, whittling.
 "When'd you leave New York?" he said, barely looking up.
 "Four days ago."
 "Where you headed?"
 "Seattle," I said. "Do you have any apples?"
 "I used to live in New York -- Crown Heights," a younger man called out, emerging from the vegetable shed with a blond baby on his hip. "What street did you live on?"
 Greenspirit Farm had no apples, just two farmers who wanted to talk about Woody Allen and Coney Island. They said they'd never heard of a born-and-bred New Yorker leaving the city. I told them I was happy to be their first. 
 Dark hills framed the restof my drive along bucolic Route 18, and in the twilight I felt like singing out at their beauty. Then I passed a sex shop in Rochester, Minn., where a 50-foot neon sign beamed messages toward the highway -- "welcome sinners, we accept checks!" -- and wondered how it all fit together.
 In my determination to make this trip both scenic and economical, I learned that using my laptop to book hotel reservations on the Internet each morning shaved prices considerably, and of all the roadside chains, Motel 6 quickly won my heart.
 The franchise is aimed at no-frills travelers who want plain, functional cleanliness -- fresh linens, hot showers and, presumably, secure door locks. True, the South Bend, Ind., version sat on a grim strip and suggested, with its cement-block walls and cigarette-scented front office, the kind of place where bad things might happen to naive girls. But the room itself was sound, quiet and $36.16, including tax. 
 The Motel 6 in Rochester, Minn., where I watched "Apocalypse Now" on the free HBO , cost me $33.01. The one night I failed to book ahead electronically, in Mitchell, S.D., I spent $43.19.
 As for eating, my plan had been to subsist on trail mix, water and fruit, arriving on the West Coast cleansed and thin. But I considered the $49.95 ice cream sundae at Margie's Candies in Chicago (yes, it's meant to be shared), and I did enjoy a butter-drenched egg-and-cheese sandwich at the Gateway diner in Wykoff, Minn. (population 460), south of Rochester.
 The best meal by far came from a home kitchen in Glasgow, Mont., north of Fort Peck Lake, where a friend of a friend, who works for the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, let me spend the night. In the morning, he pushed a shiny breast of pheasant toward me -- bagged and smoked by a hunting buddy -- and suggested I make a sandwich for lunch.
 "Watch out for buckshot," he said, as I hacked at the meat and smushed it between two slices of brown bread spread with horseradish.
 Six hours later, I pulled the sandwich from my cooler, bit in and reeled at the sensations that came out. I could taste alder chips and wood smoke, a sense of rich and deliberate preparation -- and something else, something hard and small like a peppercorn. It ricocheted against my teeth and I spat it into my coffee cup. Buckshot. 
 Two Indians in cowboy hats stared at me as I sped past their pickup truck toward the mountains. 
 Several people had spoken reverently about Going-to-the-Sun Road, a 50-mile path cutting across the high peaks in Glacier National Park. My Glasgow host had insisted I drive it. An aging trucker I met at a gas station in Shelby, Mont., sealed the deal.
 "On your way to college?" he said, eyeing my license plates and the roof-high pile of clothes crammed into my Volkswagen.
 I shook my head and laughed. College had been almost 20 years ago.
 "Well, I graduated college in 1996!" he crowed. "Graduated high school in 1959!"
 In between, he'd supported a wife and four children by driving every road in the country, and he reeled off three possible routes I might take from the gas pumps to Seattle.
 "I was thinking, actually, of Going to the Sun Road," I said. "Is it worth it?"
 I'D been worried about this for hours -- already there had been one flat-tire repair and evening was coming fast. How breathtaking could a landscape be, anyway?
 "Go for it!" said the trucker, with a goofy thumbs up.
 I set out along a road lined with golden aspens and studied the face of every driver coming the other way. I was looking for strain but saw only beatific smiles. I crept up 40-degree inclines and around hairpin turns, passed a glittering lake and touched rainbow droplets from a streaming waterfall. 
 At the summit, I pulled off the road and sat with two leather-clad bikers, staring across a misty canyon at the tips of evergreens poking from impossible precipices. Above us, the dark peaks seemed to be breathing.
 The last leg of my trip took me along the craterous Columbia River Gorge to the Oregon Coast. I wanted one long look at the Pacific before turning north toward my new life.
 It was pouring when I got to Oswald West State Park in Manzanita, Ore., but I sloshed down a muddy path zigzagging to the sea and tromped across the sand anyway. Sky and ocean blended into a silvery sheet and the sound of water was everywhere, trickling down the ravine, crashing onto the sea stacks, drumming from the sky. 
 In a grove of tall pines, a lone guitarist sat under a rickety shelter, strumming and eating raw oysters. He sang folk songs for me and offered to open a few Kumomotos. 
 I tasted the brine, breathed in the salt air and tallied my totals: I'd covered 11 states and 3,800 miles on 13 tanks of gas and 21 large cups of coffee. And I'd done it all for $592.85.
 I'd aged nine days but I felt younger than I had in years. My face was soaking wet, and I was changed.

Trekking west, cheaply
 On my leisurely, 10-day drive from New York to Seattle last September, I spent several nights at the homes of friends, who also fed me. That helped keep my average daily cost to $59.78. 

Finding a Bed
 My total lodging costs amounted to $275.01, after spending from $33 to $89 a night for five nights in motels. 
 The Best Western Grant Creek Inn, 5280 Grant Creek Road, Missoula, Mont., (406) 543-0700, fax (406) 543-0777, www.bestwestern.com, has 126 rooms, an indoor pool, fitness center and laundry. I paid $89.88, but in summer doubles are $109 .
 The Comfort Inn Columbia Gorge, 351 Lone Pine Drive, The Dalles, Ore., (541) 298-2800, fax (541) 298-8282, www.comfortinn.com, has 56 rooms, all with microwave and minirefrigerators, an indoor pool and fitness equipment. While I paid $72.86, rates can range from $49 to $129. 
 Both hotels served free breakfasts, of which I took full advantage, taking fruit and rolls for later.
 Otherwise, I chose Motel 6, (800) 466-8356 or www.motel6.com. My average Motel 6 cost was $37.45 a night.

Feeding the Car
 In all, my driving costs came to $263.13, of which $202.58 was for gasoline. I paid $16.55 in tolls in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. I also spent $12 to fix a flat tire in Montana, and $32 for a car charger for my cellphone. 

Feeding the Driver
 I spent only $62.24 on food, thanks to meals with friends and the free breakfasts at the two hotels. I spent most of my food money in grocery stores, rather than at restaurants. 

Feeding the Spirit
 House on the Rock, 5754 Highway 23, Spring Green, Wis., (608) 935-3639, www.thehouseontherock.com, closed last week until March 15, then will be open daily most of the year. General admission is $19.50. 
 Racing to cross all of South Dakota in a single day, I had little time to explore its famed scenery. But Highway 240 wends 14 miles through otherwordly landscape in Badlands National Park, (605) 433-5361, www.nps.gov/badl, and was worth the $10 fee. CLAUDIA ROWE

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE PRESIDENT; 
Aides Say Bush Is Already Absorbed in 2004 Race

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The official White House line, repeated once again by President Bush at a fund-raiser at a lush Palm Beach golf resort only on Thursday, is that "there's plenty of time for politics." The message is that he is so focused on the business of running the nation that he has paid little attention to the details of his re-election campaign.
 In reality, presidential advisers say, Mr. Bush is wholly absorbed by the race. 
 The president personally made the decision to hold the Republican National Convention in New York City, one adviser said. He talks daily to Karl Rove, his chief political aide, about the ups and downs of his Democratic competitors. He keeps a close eye on his fund-raising totals, which now amount to more than $130 million. 
Other advisers say that Mr. Bush, who was deeply involved in his father's presidential campaigns, is far more immersed at this point than his re-election staff likes to admit, and often sets strategy hand in hand with Mr. Rove. 
"It's not a matter of turning everything over to Karl," said one top adviser, who asked not to be named for fear of angering the White House. "Karl is brilliant, but in terms of political strategy, there's no question that the president is intimately engaged. When he comes into a state, he will know exactly what his numbers are, whether people think the country is moving in the right direction, what his approval rating is."
Advisers were also struck by how many campaign-related people Mr. Bush knew among the 5,000 who were invited by his political operation to White House Christmas parties in December. "It was not just the state chairmen but the chairmen of counties," the top adviser said. 
More recently, Mr. Bush has been intensely kibitzing about the strengths and weaknesses of Howard Dean with advisers who are still anticipating a campaign against the former governor of Vermont, but who have covered their bets by continuing negative research on the entire field of Democratic contenders.
"There are more similarities between them than there are differences," said Ken Mehlman, Mr. Bush's campaign manager, who is planning a campaign focused more on the direction of the country and less on a personal matchup between the Democratic nominee and Mr. Bush, who continues to polarize large portions of the electorate. Although he faces no opposition in the primaries, his campaign is nonetheless dispatching workers to Iowa and New Hampshire in the next weeks to counter an extended political attack on Mr. Bush and his agenda.
Meanwhile, the Bush-Cheney campaign headquarters, in a characterless office park just across the Potomac River in Arlington, Va., is humming like a model of corporate America. In contrast to the Dean headquarters in Burlington, Vt., there are no boxes of stale pizza, crumbled Diet Pepsi cans or volunteers in blue jeans on grungy sofas.
Instead, it feels a lot like the West Wing: fresh flowers, security checks, a big photograph of Mr. Bush with day-old stubble at his Texas ranch, an army of well-dressed staff members. "Generally speaking, people conform to a certain sense of decorum," said Terry Holt, the campaign press secretary, who never wears jeans to the office. "In this campaign, you have a responsibility to represent the president of the United States, and even if it is a campaign, it's important to look that way."
Over all, the mood among the 160 staff members at Bush-Cheney headquarters is sunny, while the strategy is to cast the Democrats as angry and out of touch with what Mr. Bush calls the essential optimism of America.
"We're going to face a vicious assault," Mr. Mehlman said. But he did not sound dismayed, and Republicans close to the campaign say that Mr. Mehlman's real challenge is to keep his troops from overconfidence. The polls may be good now, they say, but Iraq and the economy could derail the campaign's meticulous plans.
"It's the Yogi Berra line: it's not over until it's over," said David Winston, a Republican pollster who talks to Bush campaign officials. "One of the most dangerous moments for any campaign is when everything seems to be going well. There's clearly a sense of confidence at the moment because they see these huge margins. But the fact that it's the second quarter and you've got a huge lead doesn't mean you can't still lose the game."
A recent CBS News poll shows Mr. Bush running 20 percentage points ahead of Dr. Dean among registered voters, but only 9 points ahead of a generic Democrat. Dr. Dean remains ahead among Democrats in recent surveys, but a Gallup poll last week showed Gen. Wesley K. Clark moving up to within 4 percentage points of Dr. Dean. Whatever the latest tally, Mr. Bush's advisers say that such numbers are almost meaningless without a Democratic nominee, and this far from the election. 
Matthew Dowd, the campaign's chief strategist, told Mr. Rove and Mr. Mehlman in an internal memorandum in November: "As I have repeated time and again, this race will be decided within a four- or five-point margin, not the 18- to 20-point margins like 1984 or 1972." Mr. Dowd added in the memorandum that he expected the race to be neck and neck when the Democrats are likely to settle on a nominee this spring.
The person in charge of the campaign is Mr. Rove, who remains on the White House payroll as the president's senior adviser.
Mr. Bush has delegated the organization of the campaign to Mr. Rove, but he has the final say on campaign decisions and a senior adviser says he was closely involved in creating his immigration policy in large part because of its potential for attracting Hispanic voters in 2004. 
"This was not just Karl," the adviser said. 
The president also turns for political advice to Karen P. Hughes, his longtime communications aide, who left the White House in 2002 to return to Texas. 
A critical strategist is Vice President Dick Cheney, a former member of Congress from Wyoming, who knows the political map of the United States almost district by district. Mr. Cheney's campaign activities will pick up nextweek with fund-raisers, speeches and state Republican Party events in six states.
Mr. Rove oversees a campaign staff that is by and large young, that for the most part owes jobs to him and that has no rival to challenge his authority. He is in constant contact by telephone with Mr. Mehlman, his top deputy, who worked at Mr. Rove's side as the White House political director before opening the Arlington headquarters last spring. Mr. Mehlman makes regular trips across the Potomac to meet with Mr. Rove in the White House.
At campaign headquarters, just as at the White House, days begin early. Aides are in at 6 a.m. or earlier to begin assembling packets of the day's relevant stories from the newspapers and television into White House-like news summaries for the campaign's senior staff. 
By 7:30 a.m., there is what the staff calls a "rapid response" conference call between the campaign staff and Ed Gillespie, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to review the important political events coming that day, like major speeches by the Democrats, polls and presidential events. The goal is to be ready with consistent talking points.
Between 8 and 8:30 a.m., the campaign has a senior staff meeting to go over the battle plan for the day. Those attending include Mr. Mehlman, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Holt, as well as Jack Oliver, the deputy finance chairman; Mark McKinnon, who is in charge of political advertising; and Nicolle Devenish, the communications director.
Much of the rest of the day is spent in conference calls to Bush campaign officials across the country. Terry Nelson, the campaign's national political director, makes a lot of those, as does Mr. Mehlman. Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, is in charge of the Southeast; Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota, is in charge of the Plains states. 
There are also 33 staff members in 14 newly opened offices in major states, plus 5,500 county and precinct leaders who have been trained in 52 sessions around the country. They have learned, Mr. Mehlman said, basic grass-roots political skills: how to register voters, hold Bush-Cheney barbecues, call in to talk radio shows and send letters to the editor extolling the virtues of their candidate.
The Bush-Cheney 2004 Web site provides a link for sending the letters by e-mail, including the addresses of regional newspapers, plus writing tips ("Be clear and concise") along with pre-written blocks of Mr. Bush's policy positions ("The president understands the necessity to manage forest and rangelands") that a supporter can simply cut and paste into the Web site's e-mail form. 
Mr. Mehlman said that 37,000 e-mail messages had been sent to newspaper editors, but that he did not know how many had made their way into print.
Midweek, the campaign holds a Washington conference call to brief two dozen core allies on political developments and buzz, and to make sure they have talking points when reporters call.
Charles Black, a Washington lobbyist and a longtime Republican strategist, is in on those calls, as is Mary Matalin, a former top adviser to Mr. Cheney. Others who participate include Kenneth M. Duberstein, who was Ronald Reagan's last chief of staff, and Ed Goeas, a leading Republican pollster.
At this point, the campaign has settled on the timing and themes of an advertising push, which may be built around the sense of national hope that Ronald Reagan tapped in his 1984 "Morning Again in America" spots casting the country in a golden glow. 
Mr. Bush will lay out what will become the major themes of his campaign in his State of the Union address. Two months from now, when the Democrats may well have a nominee, he will probably have reached his fund-raising goal of $170 million. His campaign will then enter a more active phase.
Until then, advisers say, Mr. Bush is on the phone, busy handicapping the race and debating the merits of the Democratic field. They will not say, however, what he thinks of Dr. Dean.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 14, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about President Bush's involvement in his re-election efforts referred incorrectly to the current assignment of the political operative Ralph Reed. (The error also appeared in an article on Dec. 20 about grass-roots voting efforts by the Republican Party and in one on Sept. 29 about preparations by the Bush campaign to focus on the eventual Democratic nominee.) Mr. Reed is the Southeast regional chairman for the Bush-Cheney '04 campaign. He resigned as head of the Georgia Republican Party in May 2003 to join the Bush campaign, and was succeeded by Alec Poitevint.

Dracula Theme Park: Idea That Just Won't Die

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE

 BODY:
NO one knows Vlad the Impaler's drinking tastes beyond, well, his favorite refreshment. Yet a beer brewer and a soft-drink bottler are two early sponsors of a proposed theme park in Romania to be built around the character of Dracula. 
 The park would include a golf course, a water park, some Dracula-inspired rides and a variety of other family attractions, on a site just north of Bucharest rather than in Vlad's native Transylvania. 
Dracula was a nickname for Prince Vlad the Impaler, a real 15th-century figure in Romanian history, as the ruler of Walachia. But in the West, the name Dracula refers to the vampire character in Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic novel of the same name. 
 Over the years, the fictional Dracula grew in popularity and turned up in all sorts of shapes, played in the movies by Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee. One of his last major appearances was in the 1992 film by Francis Ford Coppola, "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula,"' in which he is called Vlad. 
 About the time the Coppola movie appeared, Romanians themselves were discovering that they could market the fictional Dracula. Nicolae Paduraru recalls how in 1993, four years after the collapse of Communism in Romania, he founded the Transylvanian Society of Dracula in Sighisoara, his and Vlad's hometown. The idea, he said in a recent phone conversation, was to attract scholars and historians to explore both the historical figure and the Victorian tale.
 Without sponsors, the society foundered until Mr. Paduraru, a former tourism ministry official, hatched the idea to raise funds by organizing tours of Vlad's old territories. A company that Mr. Paduraru also founded in 1993, Mysterious Journeys, markets through travel agents and its own Web site (www.mysteriousjourneys.com) trips to Vlad's major haunts in Transylvania, costing $60 to $70 a day. 
 Mr. Paduraru says there have been dozens of proposals for Dracula parks across Romania, in towns like Brasov and Poienari, and at the Borgo Pass. Most notable was a plan, proposed by the minister of tourism in 2001, for a park at Sighisoara. A company was set up, with the town council of Sighisoara as its main shareholder.
 But Sighisoara is a Unesco World Heritage Site as "a fine example of a small, fortified medieval town," and outraged opposition from cultural organizations, environmental groups like Greenpeace and celebrities like Prince Charles caused the Romanians to step back. In the end, the government commissioned a feasibility study and last year proposed building the park not in Transylvania, but near Bucharest.
 Some, like Mr. Paduraru, objected. 
"If you visit Sherlock Holmes, you don't go to Manchester, you go to London," he said. "Romeo and Juliet are not in Milan, they're in Verona."
 Nevertheless, in October the Romanian government approved the plan. A new company, Dracula Park S.A., was established to find investors and begin design and construction. Sorin Marica, a tourism ministry official who is president of Dracula Park, said cost estimates range from $47 million to $82 million. 
 In an e-mail message, Mr. Marica said the park would feature "all the classical attractions of amusement parks," like roller coasters and other rides; a golf course; a water park; tracks for horse and automobile races; and models of Romanian cities and famous buildings. He said work was expected to begin in the spring.
 Officials like Mr. Marica estimate that the park will attract as many as a million visitors a year, perhaps 20 percent of them foreign tourists, drawing investment and jobs. Two early investors, the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company and Brau Union, Austria's largest brewery, have signed on, pledging $150,000 and $500,000. 
 Yet some argue that the last thing that Romania -- with a floundering economy, widespread corruption and one of the lowest per-capita incomes in Europe -- needs is a Dracula theme park. Last year, Arpad Bako, a member of a citizens group that helped stop the project in Sighisoara, asserted that Romanian families, with an average monthly income of about $60, could hardly afford the projected $5 entrance fee and the further $5 visitors would have to spend to make the park profitable. 
 "A family of four would have to spend $40, nearly one month's income," Mr. Bako wrote in a newspaper article.
 David Camp, a theme park consultant with Economics Research Associates in London, is equally pessimistic. While there "seems to be several suppliers that are driving it forward," he said of the plan, there is still uncertainty how the rest of the money would be raised. 
 Another problem, Mr. Camp said, is that "the plan is to boost tourism." Yet with the exception of Orlando and the Disneyland Paris park in France, he said, theme parks are visited by local and regional residents. 
 The sponsors are not fazed. Michael Bickstein, a spokesman for Brau Union, said the brewery had exclusive rightsto promote and sell beer in the park for 10 years; Coca-Cola Hellenic has a similar arrangement. 
 "When the park is finished," he said, "Dracula won't be drinking blood, but beer."
 But barring some preternatural event for which Transylvania has a certain tradition, Dracula may have to make do with blood for a good while to come.

HEADLINE: A Short-Order Revolutionary 

BYLINE:  By Russell Shorto; Russell Shorto is the author of a book about Manhattan's founding, "The Island at the Center of the World," which will be published in March.

 BODY:
It starts -- just as your mother told you it should -- with a good breakfast. Two fried eggs, yolks bouncing brightly. Burly strips of bacon with alternating strata of red meat and glowing fat. The potatoes are nubby and brown, the toast thickly wedged, a light crunch followed by a satisfyingly dense chew. Strong coffee. And milk: don't muddy it in the coffee; take it straight and unhomogenized, a big cold mouthful, aswirl in lowing bovine immediacy. 
 Tod Murphy, the man behind the breakfast, literally and figuratively, sits in a green vinyl booth in his 60-seat eatery, the Farmers Diner, on North Main Street in Barre, Vt., and deconstructs my meal. "The potatoes come from Will Allen's farm over on the Connecticut River. We get our bread from a bakery in Northfield, and believe it or not the eggs come from a little egg farm right in downtown Stowe. Earl and Amy out in Strafford supplied the milk and butter, or rather their Guernseys did. And the bacon came from Andrew." Andrew is 15 years old, and in his first foray into hog farming he produced what your correspondent is ready to nominate the finest bacon on the planet. But we'll get back to Andrew shortly. 
 Murphy -- who is himself a farmer -- started the Farmers Diner 18 months ago with a modest-seeming goal: to rely on local ingredients. Since then it has become something of a cause celebre, to the extent that a Formica-counter establishment that showcases patty melts and macaroni and cheese can. It is probably safe to say that it is the only business that both Gourmet and WorldWatch Institute devoted attention to last year. Such business innovators as Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry's and Paul Hawken of Smith & Hawken have offered advice. Investors are lined up behind Murphy, and, incongruously, some are using the F-word -- franchise -- and talking about taking it regionally, even nationally. 
Why the fuss? Because "local food" has become almost an oxymoron. In an era in which 10 companies supply more than half the food and drink sold in the United States, in which processed and prepackaged are the norm and hydrogenated oil is practically a national beverage, in which the average apple, chicken breast or lettuce head travels more than 1,500 miles from grower to consumer, the Farmers Diner is so old it's radically new. There has been a rumbling of concerns among some people -- activists, moms -- over health and environmental issues related to the centralization of food. Long-distance travel means a push for longer shelf life, through chemical additives or genetic modification. Massive monocultural enterprises -- vast expanses of corn, numberless cattle crammed into gargantuan feedlots -- require a heavy reliance on antibiotics and pesticides. The current mad-cow scare exists only because the food system is so far-flung. But lying beneath the concerns, surely, is the simple, ineffable yearning for lettuce, tomatoes and burgers that taste the way they're supposed to. 
Upscale restaurants have long showcased select ingredients from area farms. But in those places, local tomatoes or snap peas appear on the plate alongside Madagascar trout, oysters from the Sea of Japan or whatever other delicacies the chef needs to express his creativity. Tod Murphy's diner is different from the ground up, in prices (cup of chili: $2.75; grilled cheese sandwich: $3.50) and in philosophy. The diner has a purpose: to support nearby family farms, or rather to demonstrate the conviction that -- economically, historically, naturally, logically -- food is supposed to be local, and that it can be again. Its business model is to swim directly against the globalization current. To that end, being a diner -- an icon of the American culinary and cultural landscape -- underscores the point: Remember what we used to be? Remember when taste and tradition mattered? Real food for regular people. 
The Farmers Diner, which Murphy started with $240,000 of capital, stunned its investors by hitting its break-even point in its first year: about $1,500 a day in gross sales. "We're ahead of what we projected," Murphy said, "and I'm surprised at the number of customers who get it. I thought most would just think of it as a diner, but they see what we're doing." While the place has a philosophy, it lacks dogma. It will never get all of its food locally. "It's got to be recognizably a diner," Murphy said, and that means serving things like orange juice and coffee, items that, unless global warming kicks into high gear, aren't going to come from Vermont's farms. When he opened the place, he was getting 60 percent of his products from area farms; it's now at 70 percent, and he says he thinks he will reach 80. 
Murphy is 38, wears his hair in a ponytail, has a sleepy expression and talks in an earnest, hushed, NPR kind of delivery. It's impossible not to be duped, on first sitting down with him, into thinking you are in for a laid-back, yoga-and-granola kind of encounter. Twelve hours later, however, he is still talking, and by then you've realized his personality is in fact a seamless mix of organic farmer and high-octane businessman. He can go on forever about the minutiae of franchising. At the same time he'll tell you, "If you want to know whether a piglet will grow into a nice fat hog, you measure its father's scrotum." The Farmers Diner is a blend of these two trains of thought, and of Murphy's two experience paths. Farming is in his blood: he grew up on his family's southeastern Connecticut dairy farm. It had long since gone out of business, but when he was a kid, his great-grandmother told him how they used to drive into town on Saturdays and sell eggs and butter to stores. Later, he and his wife went into franchising, creating a coffee company. It fizzled, but he learned a lot, which he's now putting to use. 
Chuck Lacy, former president of Ben & Jerry's and now the head of the Barred Rock Fund, an investment group that supports sustainable agriculture initiatives, was one of the first people Murphy went to for backing for his venture. "I turned him down flat," Lacy said. "I'm a farmer myself, and I know the reality. The local infrastructure is gone." But Murphy's doggedness paid off. Lacy agreed to make a modest $35,000 investment in the first restaurant as a trial balloon, and he is now a big booster. "Tod has done it," he said. "He's competing with diners that are getting their chicken cutlets from Sysco or Tyson, that are cheaper, that are shipped from who-knows-where, processed and pumped with antibiotics. He's forged this farm network, and he's showing that there's a market out there of people who think there's nothing like eating a fresh egg, who like knowing where their food came from." As president of Ben & Jerry's, Lacy took it from $50 million in sales to $150 million, and he says he thinks the Farmers Diner is another food business rooted in Vermont that could catch on nationwide. 
But the challenge of recreating his great-grandmother's distribution system in the global age is difficult almost to the point of absurdity, as Murphy cheerfully admits. "When I first went looking for investors, lots of people liked the idea, but nobody believed it would work," he said as the waitress brought the check. "And they had good reason to believe we'd never get to this point. Finish your coffee, and I'll show you why."
The landscape of this part of northern Vermont is wild: rough hills, pine trees shrouded in fog on a cold fall day, seething rivers running by white steepled churches. Tod Murphy has roamed these hills relentlessly the past couple of years, seeking out suppliers. Americans used to bandy about a variable but significantly low statistic: 5 percent of the population are farmers. Or 3 percent, or 6. In stating it, you were bragging that we didn't have to work the land, that in this brave new era, ingenuity had replaced grunt effort. In fact, that figure is now below 1 percent, and it represents the primary challenge to Murphy. It means that to get his business off the ground, he had to find either holdouts, who had stubbornly refused to take their grips off the plow, or else others who, like him, have gone back to the land. 
He found both. Will Allen -- a dead ringer for Willie Nelson -- has been an organic farmer since 1968. He and his wife, Kate Duesterberg, farm a swath of bottomland alongside the Connecticut River. Both are longtime activists in the sustainable-agriculture world, and their vegetables are nearly as legendary as they are. Murphy wanted to get his produce from them, but there was a catch: they don't deliver because they sell nearly all of their produce from road stands. 
Meanwhile, 25 miles from downtown Barre, Earl Ransom and Amy Huyffer farm a primeval hilltop of 600 acres, a landscape of cows, hogs, hay and mud. Earl was born on the farm, but it has been through several incarnations, and the family started their dairy business only two and a half years ago. No sooner do we take a seat in their dining room than they begin clunking down old-fashioned milk bottles, emblazoned with the name Strafford Organic Creamery. Whole milk. Two percent. Heavy cream. Maple milk: a Vermont specialty, made by mixing in some maple sugar. "I'm really proud of my skim," Earl says, pouring a glass, and it actually tastes like milk, not like the watery skim you buy in cartons. Everything Earl and Amy do is organic, starting with the grain that their cows eat. And so far it's working: they're making a bit of money. They sell their product to co-ops and restaurants and make their own deliveries in a refrigerated truck. 
The Farmers Diner gets its milk, butter and ice cream from the couple. The result is a 16-ounce glass of milk that costs $1.95, as compared with $1.49 at the Friendly's down the road. So far, enough customers have been willing to pay those modest premiums in exchange for the taste and satisfaction of the genuine article, to help keep Tod Murphy's dream alive. But if you're rebuilding local networks, you don't rest at simply carrying out a transaction between producer and seller; you work the angles. In this case, Murphy figured out a three-way deal that would get him his vegetables. One of Will Allen's field hands who lives near the dairy farm drops off the Farmers Diner vegetable order on his way home, and Earl and Amy's milk truck in turn brings the produce to the diner along with the milk delivery. "We want to support Tod," Huyffer said. "This is a network, and it only works if we work together." Still, the network isn't without its problems. If the dairy truck breaks down, or if winter weather makes the winding dirt road from the farm impassable, the diner does without its dairy and vegetables. 
Another old-timey vignette played out at the farm of John and Janine Putnam, who make an award-winning cheese from the milk of their grass-fed Jersey cows that winds up in the macaroni and cheese at the Farmers Diner. "Tod came here looking for a cheese for the diner," Janine said, "and we were talking about our whey problem." Whey is a byproduct of cheese making, for which there aren't many uses, yet the Putnams hated to waste it. "We mentioned that we'd heard some people feed whey to their pigs," John said, "but we didn't have pigs. Tod's eyes lit up." Murphy knew that the Putnams' 15-year-old son, Andrew, was looking for a part-time job. He suggested that Andrew raise eight hogs on the family farm and guaranteed that he would buy them. So Andrew did: he fed the piglets and watched them grow while dreaming of the pair of skis he would buy. "It wasn't too hard," Andrew said, though he admitted to a slight twinge when Murphy showed up to take the grown pigs away to make bacon. 
So that's Tod Murphy in action: making endless small, back-country deals. But the difficulties don't stop there. In fact, they've just begun. Stay with this particular deal a bit longer. Murphy has bought eight hogs from Andrew Putnam. How does he get from hogs on the farm to bacon on the breakfast plate? 
Just down the road from the Farmers Diner is a small corrugated metal building. It's tiny inside -- a few modest-size rooms, one hot and smoky, the others refrigerated and smelling clean, cold and bloody. It's one of the smallest U.S.D.A.-inspected meat-processing facilities in the country, and one of the few left that are not controlled by the large food companies. Pork bellies hang on racks; three employees hack at pink slabs of raw pork and shove handfuls of it into ham netting. "The first thing I learned about trying to source local food is, meat is the issue," Murphy said. "Vegetables are easy. A restaurant that uses locally grown vegetables, that's nice, but so what? If you're a diner, you need a steady supply of bacon, sausage and ham. Maybe you can find a small farmer to supply you, but he doesn't have the facilities for slaughtering. And who's going to smoke the meat? I couldn't find a processor in the state who wanted to do it. I didn't see how we'd be able to demonstrate the model without meat processing. So I bit the bullet and realized I was going to have to do that myself." 
Murphy rewrote his business plan and rustled up $160,000 more from his investors, and now he's in the meat-processing business as well. He's not yet licensed to slaughter -- for that he goes to "slaughter spots" at larger slaughterhouses -- but the five employees cut steaks and chops and smoke and cure bacon, ham, sausage, turkey, fish and cheese. It's hard work, made harder still by the need to comply with government regulations geared 
toward huge companies. "You see the challenge, right?" Murphy asks as we leave. "All these food facilities that are so basic to society -- the creamery, the local butcher -- they're gone. You have to build them yourself." 
But once you do -- once you have the production, processing and distribution figured out -- you have the makings of your own little food empire. 
In contrast to the hundreds of miles a month Murphy logs staying in touch with his 35 suppliers and tracking down new farmers to join his network, and to the mountain of paperwork and endless string of phone calls he juggles to keep his rural Rube Goldberg device functioning, consider the manager of the Friendly's just down the road from the Farmers Diner. The menu options aren't so different between the two places. Yet the entire food order for Friendly's is handled with a single digital form, which the manager (who asked not to be named) fills out and sends to the franchise's single supplier: the company's regional distribution center in central Massachusetts. "It takes me about five minutes," he says. "And then the big Friendly's truck shows up with everything." The Friendly's experience is more or less the norm for restaurant managers today. Tod Murphy's is . . . unique. 
Needless to say, it takes great reservoirs of energy and passion to create what is in effect the ultimate anti-franchise restaurant. But Murphy's dream is more complicated still. He wants it both ways: a local diner that's also a franchise. As it turns out, the retro space in northern Vermont is only Step 1 in a vaster plan: a mere test kitchen, as it were. That's why it has gotten the attention of some fairly big money. "We were interested in the Farmers Diner because it's socially responsible," said Deborah Ciolfi, president and C.E.O. of Gravestar, a private asset-management company that has invested in the diner, "but if it's a one-off, it doesn't have an impact. We envision hundreds of Farmers Diners in regions around the country." 
The next phase that Murphy and his backers envision is a "pod," consisting of four diners and a central food-processing plant where animals from area farms would be slaughtered and local organic tomatoes would be turned into vats of salsa or pasta sauce. The greater Boston area seems the most likely location, since it has some continuing tradition of small-scale farming and a population that might appreciate what the diners would offer. Then the pod would be duplicated in other areas. Branding is part of the strategy. The processing plants would turn out sausage, smoked cheese and tomato sauce with the Farmers Diner label. You'd have a Farmers Diner on the local strip alongside Wendy's and Taco Bell. This is Murphy's fully realized dream: "I want to blend my great-grandmother's business model with a multiunit one that relies on economies of scale."
It's a quirky-sounding combo, but only to the uninitiated. "You can't assume small and local means lacking in major league entrepreneurial energy," says Woody Tasch, C.E.O. of Investors' Circle, a venture-capital group with more than $90 million invested in socially responsible businesses. "Some of our members feel that after the last decade, the emphasis no longer needs to be on growing a business into a billion-dollar public company in a few years. We need to support projects that will create long-term value for society." Murphy made a pitch to the group, and some of its members are lining up behind the expansion of the Farmers Diner concept, the next phase of which will require about $6 million; so far about 50 investors have expressed interest. "When you find an entrepreneur like Tod Murphy, you have to try to help him, and see where it goes," Tasch said. "Some investors will want to blow it up into a McDonald's. The trick is to keep it rooted in the local."
The real trick may be to find a way to clone Tod Murphy. "The Farmers Diner works because Tod is willing to do the incredible amount of legwork and network-building," said Brian Halweil, a WorldWatch Institute researcher who made a study of the diner last year. "He's really committed. Plus, it's a tight-knit community. It remains to be seen if what he's done can be duplicated elsewhere." 
There's one other challenge: getting people to put up with the limitations that come with localness. In Vermont in winter, you spell "vegetable" with four letters: r-o-o-t. Sitting down to lunch at the diner, I ordered the pork tenderloin special. "The vegetable of the day is beets," the waitress declared, as if throwing down a challenge. "Any substitute?" "Nope!" she said cheerily. "All right," I said. "Beets it is." They were O.K. Sort of.

HEADLINE: Professor Nagl's War 

BYLINE:  By Peter Maass; Peter Maass, a contributing writer, is the author of "Love Thy Neighbor: A Story of War." He has reported extensively for the magazine from Iraq.

 BODY:
Maj. John Nagl approaches war pragmatically and philosophically, as a soldier and a scholar. He graduated close to the top of his West Point class in 1988 and was selected as a Rhodes scholar. He studied international relations at Oxford for two years, then returned to military duty just in time to take command of a tank platoon during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, earning a Bronze Star for his efforts. After the war, he went back to England and earned his Ph.D. from St. Antony's College, the leading school of foreign affairs at Oxford. While many military scholars were focusing on peacekeeping or the impact of high-tech weaponry, Nagl was drawn to a topic much less discussed in the 1990's: counterinsurgency. 
 At Oxford, he immersed himself in the classic texts of guerrilla warfare. There are different schools of thought, but almost every work in the canon imparts the message that counterinsurgency is one of the hardest types of warfare to wage. Nagl read "Small Wars: Their Principles and Practice," by Col. C.E. Callwell, a British officer who in 1896 warned of "protracted, thankless, invertebrate war" in guerrilla terrain. Nagl also read "Small Wars Manual," published in 1940 by the United States Marine Corps, which cautions: "Every detachment representing a tempting target will be harassed or attacked. The population will be honeycombed with hostile sympathizers." 
 The more Nagl read, the more he understood the historical challenge of insurgency. Julius Caesar complained that his legions had trouble subduing the roving Britons because his men "were little suited to this kind of enemy." In the early 1800's, Carl von Clausewitz wrote of "people's wars" in which "the element of resistance will exist everywhere and nowhere." The book that most forcefully captured Nagl's imagination was written by T.E. Lawrence, popularly known as Lawrence of Arabia, the British officer who, during World War I, led Arab fighters against the Turkish rulers in the Middle East and described the campaign (taking liberties with the facts) in his counterinsurgency classic, "Seven Pillars of Wisdom." 
Lawrence's is one of the few books in the canon written from the point of view of the insurgent. (Another is Mao Zedong's "On Guerrilla Warfare.") In a near-hallucinatory state, suffering from dysentery and lying in a tent, Lawrence realized the key to defeating the Turkish Army. "Armies were like plants, immobile, firm-rooted, nourished through long stems to the head," he wrote. Lawrence's guerrillas, by contrast, "might be a vapour." For the Turks, he concluded, "war upon rebellion was messy and slow, like eating soup with a knife."
In his own research, Nagl focused on two modern insurgencies in Asia. In Malaya in the 1950's, the British successfully suppressed a Communist revolt (comprised mostly of ethnic Chinese) by generally steering clear of excessive force and instituting a "hearts and minds" campaign to strip the insurgents of public sympathy. In Vietnam in the 1960's and 1970's, the United States military took a different approach and failed. The Americans resorted to indiscriminate firepower and showed little concern for its effect on the civilian population. Comparing the two efforts, Nagl demonstrated that a key issue for a counterinsurgent army is to calibrate correctly the amount of lethal force necessary to do the job with the minimum amount of nasty, counterproductive side effects. Even if using force with restraint meant the mission would take more time or reduce the level of force protection, it was still an indispensable step: a successful counterinsurgency took care and patience. When Nagl's doctoral thesis, "Counterinsurgency Lessons From Malaya and Vietnam," was published in 2002, it carried the subtitle "Learning to Eat Soup With a Knife." 
Nagl's scholarship helped earn him a post as a professor at West Point. But when I met him last month, he was testing his theories far from the classroom. Nagl is now the third in command of a tank battalion in the heart of the so-called Sunni Triangle, which extends north and west of Baghdad. The counterinsurgency expert is, for the first time in his life, practicing counterinsurgency.
Over the course of two weeks I accompanied Nagl as he did everything from overseeing raids to detaining Iraqis, meeting local sheiks, doling out grants to schools, attending a memorial service for a fallen soldier, picking up bits of human flesh after a car-bomb attack, playing ultimate Frisbee with fellow soldiers and dodging rocks and bullets that Iraqis were firing at him and his soldiers. In the first of many discussions we had, I described him as an expert in counterinsurgency, and this made him laugh.
"The 'expert' thing just kills me," he said. "I thought I understood something about counterinsurgency, until I started doing it."
Nagl is the operations officer of Task Force 1/34 Armor, an 800-soldier battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. Jeff Swisher, that is part of the First Infantry Division. The battalion is stationed a 90-minute drive west of Baghdad, at an Iraqi air base, not far from the city of Falluja, that is now known as Camp Manhattan. The main town in the battalion's area of operations is Khaldiya, a few miles from the base. Like Falluja and Ramadi and other former Baath Party citadels, Khaldiya is a staging ground for anti-American attacks, and five of the battalion's soldiers have been killed and more than 40 wounded. Local allies of the Americans, or people seen as collaborators, live dangerously, too; in September, assailants killed Khaldiya's police chief, firing 25 bullets into his body.
Despite that attack, Nagl knows that effective counterinsurgency can't work without the formation of local security forces. Foreign troops don't know the terrain and its people as well as locals, and besides, foreign forces cannot remain forever. And so, soon after arriving in Iraq in September, Nagl and his battalion set out to retrain Khaldiya's corrupt and hesitant police. 
When the first detachment of American soldiers went to the Khaldiya police station in an effort to form a joint patrol, the policemen on duty at the station, seeing the Humvees rolling up, scrambled out the back windows, Nagl told me. They were frightened at the prospect of walking the streets with the occupiers. The next day, when Nagl went to the station, the same thing happened. He and a few of his men walked across the street to the police force's administrative office and collared two of the officers there, informing them that they would have the honor of patrolling with the Americans. He put AK-47's into their hands and said it was time to move out. The conversation, as Nagl remembers it, went like this:
"You're going to walk with us," Nagl said.
"No, we're not," one of the officers responded.
"Yes, you are."
"No."
"Yes."
"No."
"Yes."
"No."
"You're going, buddy."
Nagl laughed as he told me the story. He and I were sitting on cots in the room where I was staying with the battalion's translators. One of them had Scotch-taped a few centerfolds from a soft-porn magazine above his cot. A few feet away, another translator was on his knees, praying. Nagl, like every other soldier in his battalion, was far from home.
Nagl is 37, the eldest of six children. He grew up in a Roman Catholic household in Omaha, Neb., and said he decided to attend West Point out of a desire to serve his nation and spare his family the expense of putting him through college. (His father was an electrical engineer who served in the Navy.) Nagl found, in the gulf war, that combat was his metier, or one of them. During the invasion of Iraq last spring, he watched impatiently from the sidelines at Fort Riley, Kan., with his wife and infant son; he wanted to be in the action and thought he had missed his chance. Now, in and around Khaldiya, he is getting his chance. I asked whether it was different from what he expected. He laughed again.
"I understood intellectually that counterinsurgency is an intel-driven event," he began. "You have to have the local nationals tell you who the bad guys are, and then you act on that information. But the steps between there were not clear to me."
What did he mean?
He offered an example: "The local comes in and says, 'There's a bad guy in my neighborhood who is planting I.E.D.'s"' -- improvised explosive devices -- "'and is an arms dealer and fires mortars at you.' Wow, that's great intel. 'So tell me where he lives."'
He paused for effect.
"There aren't any addresses in this country. The streets don't have names, there are no street signs, there aren't numbers on houses; all the houses look the same."
Nagl said he would next offer a map or satellite image to the local and ask him to point out the house. The Iraqi, in most cases, would scratch his head.
"These clowns don't know how to read maps," he continued. "So how exactly do I find out which house the bad guy lives in? I've got to get the Iraqi in a Humvee and drive past the house and get him to point out the house -- but he doesn't want his friends to see him in a Humvee. I can put him in a Mercedes and put myself in local garb, but if I do that the Geneva Conventions say I lose my rights and protections. Conventional soldiers don't usually do that sort of stuff." (It is the sort of thing the Special Forces are doing. I was told -- though not by Nagl -- that S.F. operators occasionally visit his base, wearing local clothes or outdoor gear that regular soldiers are not permitted to wear.)
Much of Nagl's time in Iraq is taken up with conundrums like this. His days start before dawn, and by the time he goes to sleep, he can hardly remember everything that happened since he opened his eyes. For a student of guerrilla warfare, he knows, this is the opportunity of a lifetime. He is like a paleontologist given the chance to go back in time and walk with the dinosaurs. But Nagl can't simply stand around and take notes. He is responsible, with the rest of his battalion, for taming an insurgency, which is as difficult as teaching dinosaurs to dance.
The American counterinsurgency war in the Philippines, which began in 1899, cost more than 4,000 American lives and left hundreds of thousands of civilians dead. The British forced the relocation of nearly half a million peasants in Malaya in the 1950's. The French in Algeria. The British in Northern Ireland. The Turks and the Kurds. The Israelis in Palestinian lands. The Americans in Vietnam. The dour lessons of the past are very much on the minds of Nagl and other American officers trying to implement a workable strategy in Iraq, but they are playing catch-up. In the 1990's, and in fact until 9/11, counterinsurgency was a musty corner of the American military. The Pentagon referred to it as "military operations other than war" or "low-intensity conflict." As the Iraq situation shows all too grimly, however, counterinsurgency is war, and there is nothing low-intensity about it.
Nagl understands this intellectually and intuitively. The portions of his book that focus on Vietnam stress the erroneous and muddled thinking of American military and political elites, especially Gen. William Westmoreland, who (as the historian Max Boot recounts), when asked his solution to the Vietcong, replied with one word: "firepower." As a counterpoint in his study, Nagl quotes Marine Gen. Victor (Brute) Krulak, who concluded: "You cannot win militarily. You have to win totally, or you are not winning at all."
For Nagl, Vietnam stands as an encyclopedia of what shouldn't be done. Foremost in the do-not-repeat category are the indiscriminate use of firepower, the resort to conventional tactics to fight an unconventional threat and the failure to implement an effective "hearts and minds" campaign. The preferred strategy has been referred to as "total war," though the phrase is often misunderstood as referring to a scorched-earth strategy. John Waghelstein, a retired Special Forces colonel who led the team of American advisers in El Salvador in the 1980's, is regarded as an astute though controversial practitioner of counterinsurgency; he promotes the "total war" strategy but does not define it as the vicious practices used by some of his pupils in the Salvadoran Army. Instead, Waghelstein, now a professor at the Naval War College, offers a subtler definition.
"Total war means you use all the elements of national power," he told me recently. "It's at the grass-roots level that you're trying to win. You can kill enemy soldiers -- that's not the only issue. You also need to dry up their support. You can't just use the military. It's got to be a constant din of propaganda; it's got to be economic support; it's got to be elections. As long as you only go after the guy with the weapon, you're missing the most important part."
Ignoring the civic side of counterinsurgency has been likened to playing chess while your enemy is playing poker. Though this truism is now well known in the military, Nagl acknowledges that it is not being applied in Iraq as well as it could be.
The civic chores are supposed to be shouldered by the American-dominated Coalition Provisional Authority, led by L. Paul Bremer III, but the C.P.A. remains isolated and rather inept at implementation. Its presence is minimal outside Baghdad, and even in the capital the C.P.A.'s thousands-strong staff spends much of its time in the so-called Green Zone, in and around Saddam Hussein's Republican Palace, behind elaborate rings of security and far removed from Iraqi civilian life. Some of the staff are on 90-day tours: they arrive; they learn a little; they leave. On the few occasions when C.P.A. officials venture outside the compound, they are usually escorted by G.I.'s or private guards.
One morning, during breakfast at the battalion canteen, I asked Nagl about the Coalition Provisional Authority. He has yet to see a C.P.A. official at the base, he said. He pointed to an empty plastic chair at the table and asked: "Where's the guy from C.P.A.? He should be sitting right there."
Given the weakness of the C.P.A., Nagl and other soldiers are effectively in charge not only of the military aspects of the counterinsurgency but also of reconstruction work and political development. Trained to kill tanks, the officers at Camp Manhattan spend much of their time meeting local sheiks and apportioning the thin funds at their disposal for rebuilding; the battalion maintains a list of school-improvement projects known as "the Romper Room list." It is not unusual for Nagl and Colonel Swisher to go out in the morning on a "cordon and search" raid and return in the afternoon to their tactical operations center for a meeting with the second in command, Maj. David Indermuehle, about dispersing small grants to local health clinics.
The entrance to Camp Manhattan discourages direct attacks. Approaching cars must park in a dirt lot about 100 yards from the front gate. The car and anyone in it must undergo a search before proceeding further. Any vehicle trying to reach the gate without stopping for a search must first run a slalom of concrete barriers that slow it down, and along the way it will be fired upon and destroyed. This makes the base a hard target.
On a bright Sunday morning in December, insurgents in Khaldiya struck a soft target -- the police station. Not long before, the officers there had been jumping out windows to avoid working with the Americans, but in the intervening months, Nagl had begun to build trust, and relations had improved. That changed on Dec. 14. At 8:32 a.m., a car packed with plastic explosives and ball bearings detonated outside the station, killing 24 policemen as well as two women and a child. Colonel Swisher and his troops arrived at the blast site within minutes, and Nagl followed soon after. When Nagl arrived, the smell of cordite was still in the air, with blood and charred flesh on the ground. An eight-foot crater had gouged the spot where the car exploded.
That evening, as we sat in the cramped room in the battalion's tactical operations center where Nagl worked and slept, he told me about the attack and its aftermath. A portrait of Saddam Hussein was hung, with coy humor, over his bed. Above his desk, he had taped up a Dilbert spoof that a few of his soldiers had created about him. The Dilbert character, intended as Nagl, says: "At Oxford I learned to use my huge brain. But I try not to frighten ordinary people with any gratuitous displays of mental superiority."
The crowd that gathered after the blast, Nagl told me, didn't seem angry at the insurgents responsible for the carnage. Instead many of them blamed the G.I.'s. The mother of a dead policeman, who was allowed inside the hastily formed perimeter, shouted insults at the Americans until an Iraqi police officer escorted her out. A rumor swept through the crowd that it wasn't a car bomb that had caused the blast but a missile fired by the Americans, who were angry, so the rumor went, because the police were not supporting the occupation.
Though a car bombing like this one might seem indiscriminate, there are in fact at least two strategic reasons for such attacks. First, they discourage cooperation with American forces, creating precisely the kind of fear that made the police reluctant to aid the Americans in the first place. They also create chaos. If an occupying power is unable to guarantee security -- and car bombs have a way of showing it can't -- the insurgents might, over time, win over the populace. It is a real-world employment of the Russian revolutionary slogan, "The worse, the better." 
In the early afternoon, a funeral procession passed by Nagl and the police station, on its way from a mosque to the cemetery. A bit later, as Nagl and other soldiers recounted it to me, another procession neared the station, larger than the previous one, with about 1,000 people, many of them shouting anti-American slogans. Nagl, who was on the street, couldn't see much of the crowd, but one of his tank commanders, Capt. Ben Miller, had a better vantage point.
"Crowd coming," Miller warned over the radio. "Recommend we mount up now and pull back."
"Roger," Nagl replied. "Execute."
The crowd threw rocks at the retreating soldiers, who sprinted to an American outpost 400 yards away. The rocks hit some of Nagl's men, and as the mob surged forward, on the verge of overwhelming the G.I.'s, the Americans fired warning shots to disperse the protesters. Nagl's soldiers then retreated behind coils of concertina wire at the outpost. Most of the crowd continued to the cemetery, but several hundred stayed behind, staring at the Americans from the other side of the wire. Anything could happen, Nagl recalled thinking: perhaps they'll rush the wire; perhaps they'll throw grenades or fire AK-47's.
Sitting in Nagl's room, I mentioned that a few days earlier a commander in a nearby area had told me how he'd instructed his snipers, before a planned anti-occupation march on their base began, to identify the leaders of the march and, if the crowd became violent, to shoot the leaders dead.
Nagl said he wasn't surprised by the idea that Americans would fire on protest leaders. "I'm only surprised he told you that," he said.
In his own standoff, Nagl went on to say, "I was running through what to do if they rushed us, and there were not any particularly good answers to that question."
What if the crowd attacked?
"You look for the leaders," he replied, quietly.
After a half-hour, the crowd filtered away, leaving Nagl with a metaphor for his hearts-and-minds effort: "Across this divide they're looking at us, we're looking at them from behind barbed wire, and they're trying to understand why we're here, what we want from them. Almost inconceivable to a lot of them, I think, that what we want for them is the right to make their own decisions, to live free lives. It's probably hard to understand that if you have lived your entire life under Saddam Hussein's rule. And it's hard for us to convey that message, particularly given the fact that few of us speak Arabic."
In many ways, the standoff was also a metaphor for something larger: the American counterinsurgency campaign in Iraq. The standoff could have gone either way, just as the war could go either way.
Nagl seemed to want to find a positive lesson in the day's events, and eventually he did. "We had soldiers surrounded by an angry crowd, and if the soldiers had not acted under pressure with discipline, as they had been trained to do, it could have been a very ugly situation," he said. "It is very easy to imagine one of the soldiers panicking and firing into the crowd, and that would have really set us back a very long way."
A few hours after the car bomb detonated, the American military announced that Saddam Hussein had been captured. The news did not elicit shouts of joy at Nagl's base. The reaction among Nagl's men was summed up by a soldier who didn't hesitate when I asked whether he thought Hussein's capture would make his job easier. "Nah, there are too many bad people here," he replied. "They don't need Saddam Hussein to tell them to do bad things."
Writing more than a hundred years ago, C.E. Callwell, the British military historian, predicted in his classic text "Small Wars" a dilemma that would face every counterinsurgent force of the 20th century. "In a guerrilla situation," he warned, "the guerrilla is the professional, the newcomer the amateur." Callwell offered this remedy: "It cannot be insisted upon too strongly that in a small war the only possible attitude to assume is, speaking strategically, the offensive. The regular army must force its way into the enemy's country and seek him out. . . . It must play to win and not for safety. . . . It is not a question of merely maintaining the initiative, but of compelling the enemy to see at every turn that he has lost it and to recognize that the forces of civilization are dominant and not to be denied."
Callwell's solution tends to create a new problem, however. What is the right amount of offensive force to use? At the outset of the Vietnam War, Col. John Paul Vann, who would emerge as one of the most thoughtful and ultimately tragic officers in the war, recognized the paradox and realized his firepower-loving commanders had not. In 1962, he warned David Halberstam, then a young reporter for The New York Times, that the wrong strategy had been adopted. "This is a political war, and it calls for the utmost discrimination in killing," he told Halberstam, as recounted in William Prochnau's "Once Upon a Distant War." "The best weapon for killing is a knife, but I'm afraid we can't do it that way. The next best is a rifle. The worst is an airplane, and after that the worst is artillery. You have to know who you are killing."
Nagl, in his book, portrays Colonel Vann -- the protagonist of Neil Sheehan's Pulitzer-Prize-winning book "A Bright Shining Lie" -- as a clear-eyed officer who saw what was wrong and had the courage to say it out loud. Nagl understands the message Vann imparted to Halberstam and tried to impart to the generals he served under: counterinsurgency requires an excruciatingly fine calibration of lethal force. Not enough of it means you will cede the offensive to your enemy, yet too much means you will alienate the noncombatants whose support you need.
Nagl struggles to achieve the right calibration in Iraq. I went on several cordon-and-search raids with him and his men, and as we drove in his Humvee he would always make a point of waving at civilians. A small gesture, for sure, but it showed what was on Nagl's mind. The gesture was appreciated by some; from others it elicited hard stares. 
The paradox might be impossible to resolve. The United States military has done a good job, in general, of limiting what it refers to as "collateral damage" in its occupation of Iraq. Yet for every raid that finds its target, there seem to be nine that don't, and in those nine, soldiers often point weapons at civilians, drive through fields and backyards, break down doors and detain people who are later released. This is the inherent messiness and slowness of counterinsurgency that T.E. Lawrence wrote of, and it is a key reason that the failure rate in counterinsurgency is so high.
"I didn't realize how right Lawrence of Arabia was," Nagl said to me once. "My first experience of war was the gulf war, which was very clean. We shot the tanks that didn't look like ours, we shot the enemy wearing a uniform that didn't look like ours, we destroyed the enemy in 100 hours. That's kind of what I thought war was. Even when I was writing that insurgency was messy and slow, the full enormity of that did not sink in on me. I am seeing appreciable progress, but I am starting to understand in the pit of my stomach how hard, how long, how slow counterinsurgency really is. There is no prospect it's going to end anytime soon."
The United States Army that marched into Iraq was a big-war army, with lots of armor and lots of plans for crushing a massed enemy, after which the people would offer flowers and sweets to their liberators. The Army has not completely adjusted itself to counterinsurgency, but it has undergone alterations. Nagl's soldiers, trained to guide tanks over open ground, are now negotiating Humvees through mud alleys. Artillery and bombs, which Vann identified as the least effective weapons in Vietnam, are being used in the Iraqi counterinsurgency campaign with the precision of the knives that Vann recommended -- or so the Americans believe.
Soon after arriving at Camp Manhattan, Nagl's battalion was the target of mortar attacks by an insurgent who was nicknamed "the mad mortarman." The soldiers were unable to catch him in the act, but counterbattery radars pinpointed the field he was operating from, and Nagl's troops fired artillery and mortars at it one night. When American soldiers went to the scene the next morning, local civilians, who hadn't enjoyed the experience of having American shells landing by their homes, told the Americans who had been firing the mortars; four men were detained later that day.
According to the American troops, there were no complaints from local men and women about the American shelling; nobody was injured, and the locals apparently understood it was not an indiscriminate assault but a targeted response to targeted attacks. Nagl says he believes that makes a difference, and he points to declining attacks to support his case. 
"Direct-fire attacks on us have dropped dramatically," he told me. "We have a pretty clear message. If you shoot at us we will do our damnedest to kill you, and most of the time we will. And if you live in a neighborhood and you know there are bad people and you don't want Americans to return heavy fire into your neighborhood, endangering your families, you need to turn in the bad guys. That message is being received."
The picture was the same across Iraq as the year ended: the number of attacks against American forces, which averaged about 40 a day in November, fell to an average of about 20 a day in December, according to American officials. The capture of Saddam Hussein is a reflection of better intelligence; he was found not by chance but after hard intelligence work buttressed by raids in which associates of his were found and persuaded to offer tips on his whereabouts. It is, in the annals of counterinsurgency, a notable achievement.
Military officers and scholars are conducting an unusually open debate about counterinsurgency tactics in Iraq, focusing on the question of calibration of firepower and the use of other pressure tactics, like surrounding hostile villages with barbed wire -- this has been done on at least two occasions by American units in the Sunni Triangle -- and demolishing houses used by insurgents and detaining their relatives. In March, the Marines will return to Iraq, and the man who will command the 20,000-strong force, Lt. Gen. James T. Conway, said in an interview last month with The New York Times that the Marines will use a softer touch than the Army. "I don't want to condemn what people are doing," General Conway said. "I'll simply say that I think until we can win the population over and they can give us those indigenous intelligence reports, that we're prolonging the process." Referring to the Army's use of airstrikes against insurgent targets, Conway added: "I do not envision using that tactic. It would have to be a rare incident that transcends anything that we have seen in the country to make that happen."
It's not clear why the Marines believe a softer touch will be more effective. During the war and its aftermath, no Marine battalions were based in the Sunni Triangle outside Baghdad, which is where the majority of attacks against American forces have occurred and where American tactics have been the most hard-nosed. Yet it is true that the Marines are, historically, more experienced at counterinsurgency warfare than the Army.
When I asked Nagl what he thought of Conway's critique, he shrugged in a dismissive manner -- his way of saying the Marines don't understand the reality on the ground in the Sunni Triangle. But at least one Sunni leader said he thinks Conway's critique is spot on. Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar is deputy chief of one of the largest Sunni tribes and a member of the American-appointed Governing Council. Al-Yawar is a moderate who wants the occupation to succeed and Iraq to become a democracy. However, he doesn't see the Army's counterinsurgency doing much to bring real security and peace.
"The United States is using excessive power," he said when I visited his residence in Baghdad. "They round up people in a very humiliating way, by putting bags over their faces in front of their families. In our society, this is like rape. The Americans are using collective punishment by jailing relatives. What is the difference from Saddam? They are demolishing houses now. They say they want to teach a lesson to the people. But when Timothy McVeigh was convicted in the bombing in Oklahoma City, was his family's home destroyed?"
Al-Yawar continued: "You cannot win the hearts and minds of the people by using force. What's the difference between dictatorship and what's happening now?"
The formation of "indigenous" forces, as they are called, is considered a paramount element of successful counterinsurgency. In his book, Nagl emphasizes that one of the many shortcomings of American policy in Vietnam was America's inability to build a capable South Vietnamese fighting force. "Vietnamization," when it finally came along in 1969, was too little, too late. During one of our discussions, Nagl explained the use of Iraqi forces as a matter of efficacy and necessity.
"There are lots of reasons why Iraqis are going to be better at it than we are," he said. "They know who is supposed to be where and what they are supposed to be doing. They can see patterns of behavior that are irregular in a way that our untrained eye cannot. They can talk to everybody in a way that we cannot."
A patchwork of Iraqi security forces is being created. In addition to the beleaguered police, there are, most notably, the new Iraqi Army and the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, or I.C.D.C. The first battalion of the new Iraqi Army went through a nine-week training course late last year, but within two months of its graduation, nearly half of the battalion's 700 soldiers had quit because their pay, about $60 a month, was too low. Although pay scales are now being reviewed, the army remains embryonic and is unlikely to assume significant counterinsurgency missions for some time. The I.C.D.C., on the other hand, already numbers more than 10,000 and is regularly engaged in joint patrols with American troops. Still, members of the I.C.D.C. appear far from ready to take over the hard-core missions being carried out by the occupation force. 
Last month, I went to a base in Balad, about 50 miles from Camp Manhattan, where the Fourth Infantry Division's First Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment, was training a class of about 50 I.C.D.C. recruits. Each course takes two weeks, the first week in the classroom and the second week in the field. The battalion had already trained three classes, but not without hitches. The first commander and deputy commander of the I.C.D.C. in the area were fired after it emerged that they were extorting kickbacks from the recruits. One recruit was found to be trying to organize other recruits into an anti-American cell that would use its training to mount attacks against the occupation force; he was thrown into prison. "In every class there are people we're concerned about," an American officer told me. "There are people in the I.C.D.C. now who we're concerned about."
The classroom was situated in a concrete airplane hangar in which Iraqi and American flags hung from the ceiling. The recruits, wearing red baseball caps with "I.C.D.C." printed in English and Arabic, ranged in age from their late teens to their mid-40's. Because the American trainers were having a hard time recalling the recruits' Arabic names, the Iraqis were given English nicknames. (One of the recruits, a pudgy Iraqi in his 20's, was called Flounder, after the character in the movie "Animal House.") When I visited, they were being trained to say, in English, "Raise your hands!" and "Drop your weapon!" -- a strange choice in a country where few people speak English.
The recruits came from local villages, and most of them had joined the I.C.D.C. for two reasons: because they wanted better security and because they needed the money. When the classes started in October, the first group of recruits faced harassment from other locals -- sometimes even from family members -- who threatened to kill them if they worked with the Americans. According to Lt. Col. Aubrey Garner, the battalion commander, the quality of recruits has increased and threats against them have diminished as the local population realizes the money is useful and the Americans are not going to leave tomorrow. Yet Garner harbors no illusions about his I.C.D.C. recruits.
"We had this idea that we could train them and they could start independent operations quickly," he said. "But what we learned is that a two-week training regimen isn't going to turn them into soldiers like we have."
Because the I.C.D.C. has been so slow to mature, American officials decided in December to form a special I.C.D.C. battalion composed of veteran fighters from the militias of the five major Iraqi political groups. This special battalion is intended as a strike force of determined soldiers who will focus on capturing or eliminating insurgents. The plan drew instant criticism from some Iraqis who say they believe the new battalion will focus not on fighting the insurgency but on eliminating the enemies of their political patrons. Al-Yawar, the Sunni tribal leader, is one of the plan's harshest critics.
"It means civil war in the future," he said. "If they do this, there will definitely be warlords."
The creation of a strong security force can backfire in unexpected ways. In the Middle East, as in most of the third world, security forces do not behave terribly well. In Egypt, to take just one example, the army and other security forces have an abysmal human rights record. True, the American military has more of a guiding hand in Iraq, but that doesn't guarantee much. The American-trained and -equipped Salvadoran Army, which was an effective fighting force in the 1980's in the sense that its soldiers were excellent killers, eliminated not only the leftist rebels who were its official enemies but large numbers of ordinary civilians and political activists who were not bearing arms. Moreover, in countries that lack strong political leaders -- and Iraq today is such a country -- strong military leaders have a habit of exercising political control in a fashion that does not favor democratic development or political reconciliation.
For these reasons, it seems unlikely that Nagl and soldiers like him will soon be able to cede their role as the principal counterinsurgency force in Iraq. And while they wait, their work will probably not get any easier. 
Two days before the attack on Khaldiya's police station, a soldier in Nagl's battalion, Sgt. Jarrod Black, was in a convoy that was attacked by an improvised explosive device, or I.E.D., in Ramadi, a Sunni city 10 miles from Khaldiya. Black, the father of two boys, whose wife was pregnant at the time, was killed by the blast; he was the 455th American soldier to die in Iraq. 
Three days later, just 24 hours after the Khaldiya car bomb, a memorial service for Black was held at an American base in Ramadi, and Nagl attended. Nagl had warned me that the final stretch of our trip to the base, about a mile's drive through the busy center of Ramadi, might be dangerous because American convoys often got stuck in traffic, where they turned into easy targets. But the drive there was uneventful. 
After the service, Nagl returned to his Humvee -- there were five vehicles in the convoy, including two, in the front and back, that had .50-caliber machine-gun turrets. The convoy left the base and headed back into Ramadi. The main street has four lanes divided by a large median; two lanes go east, two lanes west. The eastern lanes were blocked by a crane placing cement blast barriers in front of the municipal building. All eastbound vehicles were being diverted into one of the westbound lanes. After a few hundred yards, traffic snarled.
From the eastern end of the street, near a mosque that was about 500 yards away, a crowd was marching toward the convoy. At the same time, pops of gunfire were heard; they quickly became a fusillade, like Chinese New Year with bullets, though the firing was vertical -- the gunmen were shooting into the air. In a sign that violence beckoned, shopkeepers began pulling down the shutters of their stores and women and children along the street began to run.
Because the convoy was stuck, bumper to bumper, Colonel Swisher, in the Humvee ahead of Nagl's, ordered his men to drive their vehicles over the median to the unfilled lanes on the other side and get out of town immediately. The median was high, about two feet. Nagl's driver, Specialist James Regester, who goes by the nickname Reggie, backed up a few inches -- that was all the space he had -- and revved the engine, throwing it into first and jumping the median in a lurching heave that rocked Nagl back and forth in the cabin. The other Humvees did the same, but Colonel Swisher's got stuck on the median, its front wheels in the air.
The soldiers left their vehicles and set up a perimeter, keeping their eyes on the crowd and rooftops, their weapons pointed at the protesters, who by now had encircled the Americans. The Iraqis were gripped with anger, jeering and shouting slogans in favor of the recently captured Saddam Hussein. They thrust their fists toward the Americans, they waved the soles of their shoes -- a particularly low insult in the Arab world -- and some of them spat toward the G.I.'s. Gunfire was everywhere.
Nagl tried to get brigade headquarters on the radio but couldn't get through. He was talking with Colonel Swisher about alerting the base's Quick Reaction Force to rescue the trapped convoy. Although the convoy had two .50-caliber machine guns, whose carrot-size bullets can cut through several rows of massed people, there were fewer than 20 American soldiers on hand, and one of them was a chaplain. A gun battle would leave many dead on both sides; and the crowd, about a thousand strong, controlled the rooftops. 
Nagl recognized that although the protesters were furious, most of them were not insurgents. In typical insurgencies, fighters make up just a small part of the population, which is why winning the loyalty of the population is just as important as killing insurgents. The crowd's mood might have revealed that their hearts and minds, on that day at least, were beyond the grasp of the Americans. But no one was shooting at Nagl's men -- at least not yet. 
The moment was perilous. If the G.I.'s were fired on and returned fire, or if they fired first, the inevitable results -- dead civilians with American bullets in their bodies -- would be broadcast by Al Jazeera throughout Iraq and the Arab world, delivering a useful propaganda victory to the insurgents. The insurgency has so far favored the tactics of detonate-and-run, but any quick-thinking fighter in the crowd might realize that he could instigate a bloodbath by firing a round at the sitting ducks by their Humvees. 
Nagl tried to ease the tension with a wisecrack. "Ever see 'Black Hawk Down'?" he asked me.
After five minutes that seemed much longer, the colonel's Humvee was freed from its marooned perch. The soldiers jumped into their vehicles and began moving out. All along the street, men jeered and threw rocks. Then heavy gunfire -- boom-boom-boom -- erupted. It was only later that Nagl learned the fire came from one of his Humvees; its gunner saw someone with an AK-47 shooting -- or preparing to shoot -- at the convoy and responded with a burst of .50-caliber fire.
As the convoy raced toward home, young men along the highway jeered the passing Americans. As our Humvee reached the outskirts of Khaldiya, Nagl could see, not far from the bombed police station, a crowd on the road, waving flags and chanting slogans that included "Saddam is in our blood and soul." A smoke bomb, detonated by the protesters, covered the road with an orange haze.
Children in the crowd threw rocks and stepped into the road to stop or slow down the Humvees; the kids jumped out of the way when Reggie gunned the engine. In such situations, with projectiles striking Humvees and the soldiers inside them, the rules of engagement allow soldiers to fire, because it is hard to determine whether an object that is thrown at them is a rock or a grenade. Nagl was worried that Reggie, who was steering the Humvee with his left hand and aiming his M-16 out the window with his right, might put a bullet between the eyes of one of the rock-throwing youths.
"Don't shoot them!" he shouted. "Don't shoot kids!"
"No, sir, I'm on safe, I'm on safe," Reggie
replied. 
That evening, back in his office, Nagl told me that military intelligence had informed him that the demonstration we encountered was in fact against Saddam Hussein and in favor of his capture. It seemed hard to believe that the crowd, in the Sunni heartland, was happy about Hussein's capture, especially given the chants I heard supporting Hussein. But when I said so to Nagl, he insisted the people were happy about Hussein; their anger, he said, revolved only around the fact of occupation. 
I later learned that similar anticapture protests had occurred in Tikrit and Samarra, also Sunni strongholds. And Nagl told me that there had been more bloodshed in Ramadi after our convoy escaped the city. In our wake, American reinforcements showed up at the municipal center, which was besieged by the crowd. According to a press release from the United States military, members of the crowd fired on the G.I.'s, wounding one of them. The soldiers shot back, killing two Iraqis and wounding one. Another American convoy was attacked by several dozen Iraqis; the Americans returned fire and killed one Iraqi, according to the press release.
The best explanation for the fact that insurgents in the crowd didn't open fire on Nagl's convoy was simple self-defense: they knew that although they could kill some of the trapped G.I.'s, they would be killed, too. But they acted that way because the Americans had threatened and used lethal force on many occasions, and this had not won their hearts or minds. It's a chicken-and-egg dilemma. Would the crowd, or any crowd in the Sunni Triangle, be less hostile if they hadn't previously been threatened with lethal force and, on occasion, shot at? 
John Paul Vann assumed there was a calibration of lethal power that would work in Vietnam or in any counterinsurgency effort -- the right amount of force, the right number of friendly waves. I began to wonder whether such perfection is attainable. Nagl, sounding a bit more hard-line than before the events in Ramadi and the car bomb in Khaldiya, said he thought a balance was being struck.
"I'm not really all that concerned about their hearts right now," he said that evening. "We're into the behavior-modification phase. I want their minds right now. Maybe we'll get their hearts later, as we spend $100,000 on their schools and health clinics this week and another $100,000 on their schools and health clinics next week and $100,000 on their schools and health clinics the week after that. Over time I'll start winning some hearts. Right now I just want them to stop shooting at us, stop planting I.E.D.'s. If they're not involved in these activities, they should start turning in the people who are. Whatever techniques that are legal and moral that I have to use to accomplish that, I will. Counterinsurgency is not always a pretty thing."
On what I had planned as my last day with Nagl's unit, I walked to the tactical operations center at 9:30 in the morning to say goodbye and get a ride to the front gate, where my driver was waiting for me. From a few hundred yards away I noticed that a line of Humvees was idling in front of the center, about to move out. I ran the rest of the way, and as I neared Nagl's Humvee he opened the back door and said: "Get in. We took a hit."
As the convoy raced out the front gate Nagl explained that an attack on a checkpoint from a rocket-propelled grenade had just wounded and perhaps killed two of his soldiers. We soon arrived at the scene: an armored personnel carrier that had been parked next to an unfinished cinder-block hut was surrounded by blast debris and bloody bandages; the wounded soldiers had already been taken away for treatment. Soldiers immediately set up checkpoints on the road -- a tank, with the words "Assault & Battery" on the barrel of its gun, stood on the median -- and began questioning the residents of nearby houses.
Nagl strode to the nearest house. In its courtyard, a man held a glass of tea in his hand. His family members -- several adult women and about a half dozen children -- had gathered a few feet away, next to a wall, with terror in their eyes.
"Did someone say they saw the guys?" Nagl asked a soldier who had sequestered the family.
"No one says they saw the guys," the soldier replied.
Nagl stared at the man with the glass of tea.
"This guy is coming with us now," he said, sharply.
Nagl walked to a yard in front of the house and found footprints that he suspected belonged to the insurgent who had fired the grenade. The Army had never trained Nagl to be a crime-scene investigator, but that's one of the things he has become. He walked briskly across the street, back to the cinder-block hut. There was a small crater next to the damaged armored personnel carrier, the inside of which was stained with blood. Nagl began digging in the rubble and soon found fist-size chunks of shrapnel, too large for a rocket-propelled grenade.
"It was an I.E.D.," he shouted -- an improvised explosive device.
Nagl continued digging, unearthing the burned remains of a motorcycle battery. There are two types of detonation devices for I.E.D.'s in Iraq: either a wire is attached to a detonator held by the insurgent, who might be 50 to 100 yards away, or an electrical detonator, attached to a small battery, is triggered by a remote control, like a repurposed garage-door opener. Nagl had found the remnants of the electrical detonator.
A few feet from Nagl, in a corner of the cinder-block hut, his soldiers had flexicuffed a middle-aged, overweight man and pulled his kaffiyeh over his eyes. The Iraqi said he didn't know who set off the I.E.D. He was trembling and said he was sick and wanted to sit down. He was told to remain standing. On the street, soldiers were stopping cars and searching them; there was no friendliness in any soldier's demeanor this day.
Nagl had figured out what happened. The insurgents had buried the I.E.D. -- two artillery shells wired together -- and waited for a patrol to pull up to the hut. When that happened, an insurgent who was across the street, in the front yard of the house, pushed the remote control. Nagl knew that the Americans could have avoided the attack. They had provided an easy target because they had used the hut before as a resting spot for patrols and checkpoints. The insurgents, conducting "pattern analysis," had noticed this.
An order went out immediately to the battalion: do not stop at the same place for patrols or checkpoints. The only good news of the day was that this lesson had not been learned at a fatal cost. The wounded soldiers would survive.
The insurgency has weaknesses. Its ranks are composed of ex-Baathists, Islamists, small numbers of foreign fighters, criminals and dirt-poor men who agree to fire a rocket-propelled grenade at a passing convoy for $500. It is not cohesive. Nor does it have a positive vision, or any vision, of how Iraq should be governed if the occupiers are driven out. Particularly with the capture of Saddam Hussein and close associates of his, whatever central leadership may have existed has been badly crippled. The American military is hoping that a headless insurgency with dwindling finances will melt away under the pressure of continued raids and precise airstrikes.
Yet theinsurgency's weaknesses are, in a looking-glass fashion, also its strengths. A senior adviser to Gen. John Abizaid, the head of Central Command, advised me to read an article in the winter issue of The Washington Quarterly by Steven Metz, the director of research at the Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute. Metz is highly regarded in military circles. In the 1990's he presciently warned that insurgencies would soon return to challenge the United States. 
In his article, Metz wrote that disunity among the Iraqi insurgents is not as much of a disadvantage as it might seem: "Unifying the various strands of the Iraqi insurgency behind any one strategy or objective, at least in the short term, will certainly be difficult if not impossible. Yet, this same complexity means that quashing the insurgency will be just as difficult or impossible." Metz also noted that insurgencies, like those in Colombia and Sierra Leone, often use money to attract fighters, rather than ideology.
In the end, it is not the guile or ingenuity of the insurgents that will determine whether they succeed -- their hit-and-run tactics are similar to those seen by Julius Caesar, after all, and they employ an attritional strategy that guerrillas have used for centuries. Instead, the deciding factor will be the guile and ingenuity of the counterinsurgents. If the history of counterinsurgency demonstrates anything, it is that Nagl and officers like him will have to be wily, tenacious and perhaps a little lucky to win. In Iraq today, it would not be unreasonable to consider the American counterinsurgents -- though they are equipped with enough firepower to destroy every building in Iraq and enough technology to listen to any whispered conversation -- the underdogs.
Even if the insurgency is kept at a low boil, what will happen when an interim government takes control of Iraq in July? Will the government have enough legitimacy? If American forces take a back seat to Iraqi security forces, as they hope to do, will fighting break out among Shiites and Sunnis and Kurds? Will the security forces be strong enough to keep order? Or will they be so strong that they turn Iraq into a dictatorship that exterminates insurgents and civilians alike?
These are risks that Nagl, at least, is willing to run. When I asked, one morning, whether the war was worth its human and financial costs, he described the goal of the occupation as freedom for blighted Iraq. He concluded by enthusiastically using a four-letter word that soldiers utter more frequently than "the" or "and," followed by, "yeah, it's worth it."
Nagl is a gifted officer with the common sense not to confuse hopes with facts. He says he believes he is winning his war, and his grasp of the present, as well as of the past and the future, is as sharp as anyone's. He knows, though, that the war will be messy and slow, as T.E. Lawrence warned, and he knows enough about wars to realize that the outcome is not assured. That is the nature of guerrilla wars, especially -- they are chaotic and confused and only fools predict their results. 
Yet if predicting the future is a hopeless endeavor, learning from the past is not. The counterinsurgency books that Nagl studied do impart an important lesson. The goal the United States hopes to reach in Iraq -- a successful counterinsurgency that does not drag on for years and does not involve a large amount of killing -- has never been achieved by any army.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 01-11-04; 
Cattle Futures?

BYLINE:  By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
It's hard to say whether an American hamburger was appreciably less safe to eat the day after a Holstein cow tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Washington State last month than it was the day before, but it had sure gotten less appetizing. The news cracked open a door on the industrial kitchen where America's meat is prepared, and what we glimpsed on the other side was enough to send even the heartiest diner to the vegetarian entree or the fish special.
 We learned, for example, that the beef we have been eating (until the U.S.D.A.'s sudden change of heart about the practice) might consist in whole or part of meat from a "downer cow," an animal so sick and hobbled that it must be dragged to the slaughterhouse with chains or pushed by a front-end loader. Then, before finding its way into a frankfurter, the carcass of that animal is often subjected to an "Advanced Meat Recovery System" that is so efficient at stripping flesh from spinal cord that the chances are good (35 percent, in one study) that the resultant frankfurter contains "central nervous system tissue" -- precisely the tissue most likely to contain the infectious prions thought to communicate B.S.E. 
 So: We have been eating downers and really picking their bones clean. And what did these animals eat in turn? Many of us were surprised to learn that despite the F.D.A.'s 1997 ban on feeding cattle cattle meat and bone meal, feedlots continue to rear these herbivores as cannibals. When young, they routinely receive "milk replacer" made from bovine blood; later, their daily ration is apt to contain rendered cattle fat as well as feed made from ground-up pigs and chickens -- pigs and chickens that may themselves have grown up on a diet of ground-up cows. But the grossest feedlot dish we read about in our newspapers over breakfast has to be "chicken litter," the nasty stuff shoveled out of chicken houses -- bedding, feathers and overlooked chicken feed. Since this chicken feed may contain the same bovine meat and bone meal that F.D.A. rules prohibit in cattle feed, those rules are, in effect, all but guaranteed to break themselves. Oh, yes, I forgot to mention one of the ingredients in chicken litter: chicken feces, which the U.S. cattle industry regards as a source of protein.
Whatever else it is -- nutritious, economical, the polar opposite of wasteful -- you can't help feeling that the convoluted new food chain that industrial agriculture has devised for the animals we eat (and thus for us) is, to be unscientific for a moment, disgusting.
I know, I'm offering an aesthetic judgment of a system designed not for beauty but for efficiency. Protein is protein, goes the logic of this system, whether you find it in an animal muscle, a soybean or a chicken dropping: this reductionism is the world-beating formula that drives industrial agriculture, and it works, up to a point. By feeding the absolute cheapest forms of energy and protein to animals it treats as machines, the industrial food chain has succeeded in making the protein we eat unimaginably cheap. Just look at what you can get for a buck or two at Wal-Mart or McDonald's.
But there is a problem. By the reductive logic that rules our food system, cannibalism should be as legitimate a way of eating as any other: it's all just protein, right? Yet the great unlearned lesson of B.S.E. and other similar brain-wasting diseases is that, at the level of species or ecosystems, it isn't quite true that protein is protein. Eating the protein of your own species, for example, carries special risks. The Fore of New Guinea were nearly wiped out by kuru, which bears a striking resemblance to B.S.E.; they spread it among themselves by ritually eating the brains of their dead kin.
Biologists think that evolution probably selected against cannibalism as a way to avoid such infections (among other things). Many animals' instinctive aversion to their own feces and to the carcasses of their species may represent similar strategies to avoid infectious microbes and parasites. Through natural selection, animals have developed what amount to a set of hygiene rules that function much like taboos. One of the most off-putting things about factory farms is how cavalierly they flout these evolutionary rules, forcing animals to overcome deeply ingrained aversions. For their instincts we substitute antibiotics.
Life as a human omnivore is more complicated and risky. When you can eat almost anything, how do you avoid the dangers nature presents, the plant toxins and parasites and lethal microbes? We have culture to guide us (traditions, science, Jane Brody), but surely even we can still hear older voices, aversions (to rot) and attractions (to sweetness) that still speak when we encounter a plate of food. In matters as fundamental to our animal lives as choosing what to eat, perhaps our aesthetic sense of things is not just aesthetic but is informed by something deeper, something we would do well to heed.
For tens of thousands of years, we have been eating the flesh of ruminants that live on grass. The rightness of that picture -- a bovine grazing on grassland -- goes way back, maybe all the way to the savanna. And while that picture has recently been eclipsed by nauseating images of modern meat production, the grass-fed ruminant and the vegetarian herbivore are not extinct yet.
For several years now, an alternative, postindustrial food chain has been taking shape, its growth fueled by one "food scare" after another: Alar, G.M.O.'s, rBGH, E. coli 0157:H7; now B.S.E. Whatever science told us about the risks of these novel industrial entrees and sides, something else told us we might want to order something more appetizing: organic, hormone-free, grass-finished. It might cost more, but it's possible again to eat meat from a short, legible food chain consisting of little more than sunlight, grass and ruminants. Back to the future: a 21st-century savanna. If, as seems probable, this landscape should now expand at the expense of the feedlot, then something good -- even beautiful -- will have come of this poor mad cow.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
Creating New Uses in Former Military Factories

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
ONE of Long Island's major commercial developers has purchased two large former military plants with plans to create new office and retail space. Because of their highly visible locations and oversized plots, the buildings are typical of many large industrial buildings once belonging to the military industry that have been upgraded in the past 25 years, realtors say. 
 In September, the Syosset-based Blumenfeld Development Group purchased a 750,000-square-foot complex on 80 acres in Deer Park for $22 million from the EDO Corporation, a Manhattan-based military contractor. It is about three miles from the Long Island Expressway on Commack Road, a major north-south thoroughfare. 
 Blumenfeld is planning to renovate the building for mixed use, including offices, retailing and some industrial space, said David Blumenfeld, a partner with his brother, Brad, and father, Edward, who founded the company in 1974. 
This weekend, at another site 10 miles west in Syosset, adjacent to the Long Island Expressway, Blumenfeld moved into its new corporate headquarters in 23,250 square feet of a 205,000-square-foot building on 18.5 acres. The firm purchased the building in 2002 for $14 million from BAE Advanced Systems, a division of BAE Systems North America, which produces military communications and identification products. BAE has since moved to a 400,000-square-foot building in Greenlawn. 
Blumenfeld is spending $30 million on renovations of the Syosset building, including its headquarters. The remaining portion of the building, is being marketed as "flex space," suitable for offices and research laboratories, David Blumenfeld said.
Alan Yaffe, a partner at the Melville-based United Realty and the broker for Blumenfeld in the Syosset transaction, said: "Many of Long Island's large former defense plants seem to be strategically located by major thoroughfares and on oversized parcels of land. Therefore, when these defense contractors determined their plants were surplus and they looked to sell these facilities, they found they can lend themselves to be developed for higher and better uses such as office and-or retail development."
In the past 25 years, many of Long Island's large industrial buildings have been upgraded to office buildings, said William E. Greiner, president of Greiner-Maltz, a commercial brokerage with offices in Woodbury and New York City. The firm tracks industrial statistics for buildings 15,000 square feet and over. 
"The motivation is economic," Mr. Greiner said. "If the property has extra land for parking, it lends itself to upgrading. They have the land, the building and the location, and the lot has value." 
Blumenfeld, which also has an office in Jackson Heights, Queens, has been leasing 9,000 square feet of office space in the North Shore Atrium -- a 310,064-square-foot office park that had once been a military plant -- as its headquarters. Blumenfeld had redeveloped the office park in partnership with the Rechler family, according to Mr. Blumenfeld. It is now owned by the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation.
IN the past two years, Blumenfeld's Long Island projects included the development of Nicolls Plaza, which is two shopping centers on 55-acres in South Setauket in Suffolk County, and the rehabilitation of two five-story office buildings totaling 102,000 square feet in Jericho in Nassau County.
Blumenfeld's new headquarters, which is at the front of the former BAE building, was designed by Susan Blumenfeld Interiors, owned by David and Brad's mother. It includes a 25-by-25 foot dining area, a 40-by-45-foot basketball court, 26 office cubicles, 12 administration offices, seven executive offices and a conference room. There are also a gymnasium and locker rooms on a mezzanine level. 
The building's dark gray stone exterior has been refurbished with an aluminum and glass curtain wall with tan limestone accents and white frame windows.
Inside, wood-timbered ceilings and brick walls accent the office areas to give it a "New York City loft-y look," said Michael Dejoseph, Blumenfeld's architect.
A wooden truss system crisscrosses the ceiling of the 700-square-foot conference room, which has a restored doorway at its entrance from the lobby. This classic portal, which came from an old local estate house, is framed with columns and topped with an arched pediment.
A 600-foot-long central corridor with skylights runs the length of the building. Open community areas, like lounges and a putting green, will be placed at intervals along the corridor for all employees, Mr. Blumenfeld said. 
Ceilings throughout the building have been restored to their original height of 18 feet, and partitions have been removed in the part of the building that will be leased, where supporting columns are 24 feet apart in one direction and 48 feet in another. This section will be custom built for two to six tenants, preferably ones who want blocks of 20,000 square feet or more, Mr. Blumenfeld said. Annual rents will be $19 per square foot plus taxes, which will be $3 a square foot, and utilities. 
There will be a total of 1,100 parking spaces on the four sides of the building.
Farther east in Suffolk, the Deer Park complex, which was built during World War II, has always been owned by military contractors, Mr. Yaffe said.
EDO, which has 30 locations in the United States, including two on Long Island, has occupied the property since it merged with Airborne Instruments Laboratory, another longtime contractor, in 2000. 
Since 1996, EDO's marine and aircraft division has been in 80,000 square feet of a 120,000-square-foot building in North Amityville, where it has a 15-year lease. 
The defense and antenna products divisions are in approximately 350,000 square feet of the Deer Park complex, which includes a 700,000-square-foot building and several small buildings, said Philip Heilpern, first vice president at CB Richard Ellis, which is the broker for EDO. 
BLUMENFELD has leased the building back to EDO for two years and will pay it an additional $8 million once it vacates, David Blumenfeld said. 
According to Frank W. Otto, EDO's executive vice president, the company is hoping to keep the Deer Park divisions on Long Island. "We are looking at several options," he said. "One is to move the defense division to Amityville and antennas somewhere else. Or we may move somewhere else altogether, but we want to stay on Long Island. We could also combine the three divisions and build a new building in Amityville." 
"We still have about two months before we have to panic over a decision," he added.
Currently, there are about 2,500 industrial buildings on Long Island, a number that has not changed much over the years, since new buildings have been built and some renovated for office use, Mr. Greiner said. 
"But the use has changed today," he said. "It is primarily for offices and distribution rather than manufacturing." 
Such is the case with Polar Electro, a company based in Finland that makes heart rate monitors. In November, it leased 52,000 square feet for its new North American headquarters at I.park in Lake Success near the Queens border.
A 1.4-million-square-foot complex on 94 acres, I.park had been owned by a series of military contractors and is now primarily an office park. Annual asking rents are $24 a square foot for office space and $12 for warehouse space. 
Polar Electro had been in 30,000 square feet of office and warehouse space in Woodbury, which is 15 miles east of Lake Success. It will use half of the I.park space for offices and half as a distribution center, said David Pennetta, a principal at Oxford & Simpson Realty in Jericho, which represents Polar. 
According to Jukka Jumisko, Polar's business controller, the company, which has 100 employees at the new location, has doubled its size in the past five years. "We needed more space, and parking was an issue," he said. "We also wanted to be closer to the city, so we could get some talented people from Manhattan and the boroughs."

HEADLINE: The Office Forecast: Lukewarm 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
A GRADUALLY improving economy in the New York metropolitan region -- albeit with little job growth -- is likely to add some strength to the office leasing market this year, although rents are not expected to increase significantly, many real estate executives say. 
 A disconnect between soft leasing fundamentals and high prices paid for office buildings and other properties is likely to continue, thanks to an abundance of low-cost capital available to finance transactions and the attractiveness of the New York market to both local and outside investors, they add. 
 These lukewarm predictions come after a year in which vacancy rates increased and rents softened in most parts of Manhattan, the boroughs and suburbs. According to figures compiled by CB Richard Ellis, the brokerage and services company, the overall vacancy rate for Manhattan at the end of 2003 was 13.68 percent, compared with 12.25 percent a year earlier. The average asking rent for a mix of Class A and B buildings was $41.98 per square foot, compared with $43.56 a year previously. 
Nevertheless, many market participants said they think 2003 represented a bottoming out of the business cycle and that this year should be one of recovery, although opinions vary over how robust it will be. "We have definitely reached the bottom of the market cycle," said Michael T. Cohen, the president of GVA Williams, a brokerage and management company. 
The pace of leasing is expected to pick up as companies seek to lock in favorable rental rates, he said, although the arrival of two major new properties -- the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle and the full block Vornado Realty Trust development between 58th and 59th Streets and Lexington and Third Avenues that will house Bloomberg L.P. -- will exert downward pressure on rents. "They will cause several large blocks of Class A space to come to the market," Mr. Cohen said, "which will keep rental rates from growing in 2004."
Although 2003 was a generally a lackluster year, it was not without its high points. One occurred when the Macklowe Organization bought what had been the General Motors Building, 767 Fifth Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets, for a record $1.4 billion, or $729 a square foot. (Another large sale, involving the 11 Madison Building at Madison Avenue and 24th Street for $675 million, was less than half as expensive at $310 a square foot.)
And, as the year was winding down, the Durst Organization reached an agreement with the Bank of America to jointly develop a new 2.1-million-square-foot building at the northwest corner of the Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street. The 51-story building, to be known as One Bryant Park, is to be the New York headquarters for the financial services company, which will occupy at least 1 million square feet on a 20-year lease.
Demolition on the site, which is adjacent to the Durst-owned Four Times Square, the Conde Nast building, on the western end of the block, is expected to begin this spring, with occupancy in 2008.
Sales of buildings, and refinancings as owners sought to take advantage of low interest rates, continued briskly during the year, despite the softness in the leasing market that, in ordinary times, is the structure on which prices are determined.

Shaping 2003
Low Interest Rates Had Big Impact
But 2003 was not an ordinary year. Interest rates continued near historic lows and capital continued to rush into markets, like New York and Washington, that resisted the national downturn better than most other cities. The result was that the normal rules did not apply.
"The capital markets' impact was so much more pronounced than the leasing market," said Warren M. Heller, an executive managing director at Julien J. Studley, a brokerage company. "People who would not ordinarily be buyers were able to do so because of the availability of finance." An example of the availabilty of funding to underwrite real estate investment was the $1.4 purchase of the former General Motors Building by Harry Macklow, a transaction in which the Macklowe interests put up only $50 million, meaning that it was 96 percent financed, Mr. Heller said.
He added that low interest rates produced profits for buyers who because of the slow pace of leasing could not immediately increase the income of a building. If a building had an annual income of 7 percent of the purchase price -- which is called the capitalization rate -- and financing was available at about 4 percent, an investor could profit from the difference, said Mr. Heller, who is generally known as Woody. "When the interest rate is lower than the cap rate, there is positive leverage," he said.
Mr. Heller, who was previously with Insignia/ESG before it was taken over by CB Richard Ellis, is establishing a capital transactions group at Studley, which was previously best known as a tenants' representative in leasing transactions.
The low interest rate climate should continue through this year, at least until the presidential election, said John Lyons, the president of Granite Partners, a financial consulting company. "As a result of low interest rates, prices will remain high for stable properties with assured incomes," he said. "Capital will compete for high quality real estate through 2004."
He said that demand is strongest for buildings in the central business districts of major cities where there are barriers to new construction, which helps to ensure that existing properties will not face as much income-sapping competition. By contrast, "the suburban office sector has been out of favor for the last 36 months," he said.
With plenty of money available on favorable terms and the prospects for office leasing improving, sales boomed last year. "By last September most people were comfortable that the leasing market was picking up, and that helped drive sales," said Darcy Stacom, an executive vice president of CB Richard Ellis. "As a result sales for the year will total over $10 billion, compared to a normal year of $6 billion to $7 billion."
Part of the reason the total is higher is that prices have jumped. A few years ago the most prestigious buildings in New York sold for about $400 a square foot, Mr. Heller said. Recently, they have been closer to $600 a square foot.
Since there are two sides to each transaction, what is good news for sellers can be bad news for prospective buyers. "We are increasingly perplexed on the buy side," said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of W&M Properties, which manages a privately owned real estate portfolio. "It is very hard to find anything that makes sense." 
Because the sale of real estate that has appreciated in value usually triggers a tax bite, many landlords opted to recapitalize their properties, rather then sell them outright, Ms. Stacom said. She said investors with short-term financial objectives were able to cash out because of the availability of capital. "The opportunity funds got out, but the operators stayed," she said.
"The money that wanted to get out," said Steven A. Kohn, the president of Sonnenblick-Goldman, a financing company, "was short-term money that was invested a few years ago. In some cases the returns have not been what investors wanted, and in others the operating partner and the capital partner have different objectives."
A higher stock market, and the recovery in the financial services business that many are counting on to revive the office leasing business, may also provide more capital to finance real estate transactions, Mr. Kohn said. As their stocks increase in value, pension funds may increase their allocation of funds to real estate, to keep it a fixed portion of their portfolios, he said.

Leasing
Tenants Lock In Longer Terms
On the leasing side, the Durst deal with Bank of America may mark a turning point, said Peter G. Riguardi, president of the New York region for Jones Lang LaSalle, a brokerage company. "This is the transaction that people will point to as the turnaround," he said. "It is just as the Morgan Stanley building at 1585 Broadway got things started again after the last downturn."
He said the commitment by the financial services company in the early 1990's took an empty building off the market and encouraged other companies in the industry to establish themselves in Midtown. He said the Bank of America deal would similarly encourage other participants in New York's most important industry to make commitments in the city.
As the economy improves, the amount of shadow space -- space that is unoccupied but not officially on the market -- will decrease as companies reserve it for their own needs, Mr. Riguardi said. "By the end of this year the shadow space will have disappeared," he said, "and it will be a tighter market by the fourth quarter."
Interest in leasing space increased toward the end of 2003 and appears likely to continue into at least the early part of 2004, said Mark S. Weiss, an executive vice president of Newmark & Company Real Estate, a brokerage and management company. "There is a lot of activity, but it is hard to know if it is a pickup in the economy or the result of pent-up demand," he said. "So many companies put their plans on hold, and then they came rushing back."
He said the Bank of America deal was important because of the signal it sent to other companies wondering whether to make commitments for space. "When the big companies act, the smaller companies will follow," he said.
The sense that rents are as low as they are likely to become and that deals in the future will be more expensive is pushing some tenants to lock in for longer terms than usual, said Mary Ann Tighe, the chief executive for the tristate region of CB Richard Ellis.
"There is a different attitude on the part of tenants," Ms. Tighe said. "They have the feeling that we are at the bottom, and they don't want to miss it. And they are locking in for 15 or 20 years now, rather than three or five years."
Many of the transactions are by companies renewing leases for space they already occupy, Ms. Tighe said. "Six of the top 10 deals are renewals," she said. They include New York Presbyterian Hospital, which renewed 210,702 square feet at 333 East 38th Street; the law firm of Dewey Ballantine, which renewed its lease and expanded to 493,000 square feet at 1301 Avenue of the Americas; and Estee Lauder, which renewed its 309,139 square feet in the former General Motors Building at 767 Fifth Avenue.
As companies renew leases or sign new ones, the vacancy rate will decline and rents will rise, slowly at first, but then perhaps sharply, she said. In terms of vacancy rates, "this has already happened in Midtown South and will happen in Midtown as well," she said. Although asking rents in Midtown South have not risen, Ms. Tighe said that asking rents tend to trail market changes. Taking rents in Midtown South, she said, are a much larger percentage of the asking rent than in areas of softer demand like Downtown.
The outlook, Ms. Tighe said, is for a slow rise in Midtown rents through this year and then a sharp rent spike in 2005.
Midtown may be the focus of much of the real estate industry's attention, but the bargains for tenants are to be found downtown, said Bruce Mosler, the president for United States operations at Cushman & Wakefield, a major brokerage and services company. Not only are rentals lower in the area, but there are government incentives available to help businesses recover from the attack of Sept. 11. "Incentives of $10 to $12 a square foot can make a big difference," he said.
With the incentives and lower asking prices, brokers estimate that space downtown is $20 to $30 a square foot cheaper than in Midtown.
Like other real estate executives, Mr. Mosler said an increase in employment is needed to induce companies to lease the space to house their staffs. Although there was little job growth last year, he said he expected to see a significant increase this year in part because of improvements in the stock market.
"The N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq are up, and in New York it is Wall Street and financial services that will lead the way in space absorption," he said. He noted that the amount of sublease space had declined from 35 percent of the total available to 26 percent by the end of 2003.
Proposed developments on the far West Side of Manhattan and in Long Island City will almost certainly be delayed until vacant space is absorbed closer to the city's core, real estate executives said.
Following are developments in other sectors of the commercial property industry:

Other Office Markets
A Leasing Slowdown In the Suburbs
The pace of office leasing in northern New Jersey, one of the largest markets in the country, was slow last year, and with retrenchments continuing in the state's largest industries, no quick pickup is anticipated.
"There has not been a lot happening," said Robert J. Donnelly, an executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey. "We are 40 percent off the average of the last five years."
He noted that the leading industries in the state are telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and finance. Telecommunications has been downsizing, pharmaceuticals have been consolidating and finance has been waiting for markets to improve. He said the Interstate 78 corridor through the midsection of the state has a 40 percent vacancy rate.
Sales of office buildings have been stronger than leasing. Mitchell E. Hersh, the chief executive of Mack-Cali Realty, took advantage of the hot investment sales market to sell one of its waterfront buildings in Jersey City, Harborside Plaza 10, to Istar Financial, a New York company, for $194 million. "That is the highest price ever paid for an office building in New Jersey," he said. 
Mack-Cali, a real estate investment trust, had a more difficult time on the leasing side, Mr. Hersh said, with sublease and shadow space reducing demand for directly leased space. But he said that "there is more optimism in corporate America" and that some sublease space had been withdrawn from the market by companies for their own use.
Mr. Donnelly said the amount of space leased in New Jersey fell to about 8.5 million square feet in 2003 after averaging 13 million to 14 million square feet annually in the previous five years. He said this year should be better, but is uncertain by how much. "We will probably be above 8 but not back to 13 to 14," he said.
Leasing was similarly slow in Westchester County and Fairfield County, according to James Fagan, a senior vice president of Cushman & Wakefield. He said that the market was in a malaise at the beginning of last year but that it began to improve after companies shifted their focus from cutting costs to meeting growth targets.
"By the end of the year, activity began to pick up, and we saw leases in the 5,000 square foot to 15,000 square foot range," he said.
The vacancy rate in Westchester stayed flat at a little over 14 percent through the third quarter on a year-to-year basis. Average asking rents declined about $1 a square foot, to $24.34, according to figures published by Newmark.
The vacancy rate in Fairfield County, Conn., was also flat year-to-year, at about 18 percent. The asking rent declined to $29.27 a square foot from $32.06 a square foot in the third quarter of 2002.

Retail
Steady Rents For Store Space
New Yorkers kept on shopping last year, so rents for retail space held steady, in contrast to the softness in the office sector.
Some retail brokers said the strength in the sector was a response to the threat of terrorism and the difficulties in traveling. "Many people are afraid to travel, so they stayed home and shopped," said Faith H. Consolo, vice chairman of Garrick Aug Associates, a brokerage company specializing in retail space.
Ms. Consolo said fashion accessories like handbags had been hot sellers in the past year, as were electronics, notably plasma televisions.
The decision by Westfield America to accept a $140 million buyout of its lease for the retail space at the World Trade Center has clarified the situation downtown, according to Richard B. Hodos, president of Madison HGCD, a retail brokerage company.
"Many retailers were waiting to see what Westfield would do," he said. "Now Borders Books is on Broadway, and others are looking there as well."
Big box stores have been entering the market despite the difficulty of finding suitable spaces in Manhattan, said Robert K. Futterman, chief executive of RKF Associates, a retail brokerage firm. "We are looking for spaces of 40,000 square feet and up," he said. He noted that Home Depot had leased space on 23rd Street and in the Vornado development in the old Alexander's site on Lexington Avenue and 58th Street.
He added that Whole Foods had secured sites near Union Square and in the Time Warner development at Columbus Circle and said it was possible that the discount retailers Target and Wal-Mart might enter the Manhattan market.

Hotels
Upturn Is Expected To Continue
In the hotel industry, which rents its space by the night rather than the year, the situation was similar to that of the office industry: its asset values held up much better than its operating earnings, according to Sean Hennessey, the leader of the New York hospitality practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm.
"The first half of the year was tough in terms of both occupancy and room rates," he said. Occupancy in the first quarter averaged 65.7 percent compared with 70.1 percent a year earlier, according to figures compiled by the firm. The average nightly rate was $168.93 compared with $177.21.
By the third quarter things had improved, with the occupancy rate up to 78.5 percent, compared with 74.1 percent. The average daily rate, however, had declined slightly to $168, from $172.60 a year earlier.
By the last four months of the year, Mr. Hennessey said, occupancy had improved and room rates had pulled equal to those of the previous year. "The real engine of the hotel business in New York is corporate travel and that is making a slow comeback," he said.
The 251-room Mandarin Oriental Hotel, which opened in November as part of the Time Warner complex in Columbus Circle, was the largest of six hotels that opened last year. The 187-room Hotel Gansevoort at Ninth Avenue and 13th Street is the biggest that is expected to open this year, according to the firm.
With traffic expected to improve somewhat this year, Mr. Hennessey said, hotel operators are hoping to increase their room rates by 4 to 7 percent over the course of the year.

HEADLINE: A Babe in Dow Land 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
IN David Denby's office at The New Yorker magazine, two headlines from The Wall Street Journal share a frame. A March 2000 headline, accompanied by a cartoon sketch of a bull flexing his bicep, blares, "Nasdaq Pumps Up to 5000." 
 The other, from December of the same year, reads: "Poof! 'Smart' Investment Ideas Go Up in Smoke, as Market Tumbles." 
 "Medieval scholars used to keep a skull on their desks to remind them of their own mortality," Mr. Denby, one of the magazine's two film critics, said in an interview last week. 
Mr. Denby, a slight 60-year-old in a tweed jacket and tortoise-shell glasses, pointed to the frame. "And that is my version." 
The framed, yellowing pages are a poignant memento mori. Mr. Denby's new book, "American Sucker" (Little, Brown), is a self-flagellating, revealing memoir of how, in the throttle-grip of a divorce and a midlife crisis, Mr. Denby vowed to make a million dollars in the stock market.
Instead, it all went just as the headline -- the second one -- described: Poof! 
He lost $900,000.
"I got caught up in the whole madness and excitement," Mr. Denby said. "And I made the classic errors." 
In January 2000, Mr. Denby, a relatively inexperienced investor whose previous book was about rereading the literature of the Western canon (Goethe, Boccaccio, Homer), decided to plunge into the choppy waters of high finance. He became obsessed with CNBC and believed money would rain down from the munificent technology and Internet markets that had been doing so well. 
Specifically, he thought that a million dollars would allow him to salvage his marital pride and buy his now former wife's half of their Upper West Side apartment. (She is the novelist Cathleen Schine, who occasionally writes for The New Yorker.) 
And maybe, just maybe, he would be able to buy an Audi A6 (the current base price is $36,640).
"I fell in love with a car," he said, scratching his gray head. "How insane and middle-aged is that?" 
Just as Mr. Denby is not a financial writer, his memoir is not entirely focused on finance. For a time, he became a compulsive viewer of Internet pornography. "Asian Frenzy? Latino Studs? Oh, why not?" Mr. Denby writes.
"It is part of what happens to a man after his wife leaves him," Mr. Denby said. "It is about demoralization. It is about obsession. Now it just seems like a mirage."
A disastrous affair with a married woman ended after her husband found Mr. Denby's suit hanging in the closet. He could sleep only after megadosing with NyQuil. He dated another woman, and when the moment for intimacy arrived, he could not, as they might say on Wall Street, close the deal. 
Perhaps most corrosive was a sense of greed and envy he developed -- along with other members of the well-educated but perhaps not lavishly remunerated intellectual middle-class -- standing in dumb, malevolent silence before the vast fortunes of the young Internet multimillionaires at the end of the 90's.
Mr. Denby writes with almost loving appreciation of the lofts, apartments, country estates, cars, even the toned bodies of the wealthy men and women he encounters. 
Talk about splaying your life open. What next, Mr. Denby, necrophilia? "I'm not concerned with looking good here," he said. 
At least his timing is good. "American Sucker" arrives at a moment when the markets are humming again, the economy is in an uptick and some of the former executives Mr. Denby writes about -- many of whom milked the companies they steered for personal gain -- are headed to trial. One has been banished by legal decree from the securities industry for life. Another is in prison. 
He counted two of those men as his personal gurus. One was Samuel D. Waksal, the imprisoned chief of the biotechnology company ImClone Systems, whose relationship with Martha Stewart has led to her own trial, which is to begin Jan. 20. 
Another was Henry Blodget, the Merrill Lynch Internet-stock analyst fined and exiled from Wall Street for issuing misleadingly positive reports in order to generate investment banking business. Mr. Blodget is now reporting on the legal proceedings of Martha Stewart for Slate. 
Mr. Denby also became a devotee of George Gilder, the publisher of a newsletter whose wildly optimistic predictions about the telecommunications boom left his followers with shrunken portfolios.
Which all raises the question (so stark in 20-20 hindsight): Why did he choose those losers? 
"Because they seemed like enormous winners," Mr. Denby said. "At the time. And of course my journalistic instinct, as far as Henry and Sam went, was, 'There's a story there with these guys.' And here they are, my two characters. Blodget is covering her trial. And Waksal's in prison."
By this time, Mr. Denby had moved to the Conde Nast cafeteria, where he was swallowed up for several minutes in a swirling sea of long-legged blond women in black boots and miniskirts.
Eventually huddled over a plain green salad and black coffee at a quiet table, he explained that his mission in writing the memoir was to expose the mistreatment of the small investor at the hands of corporate America. "What outraged me was the amount of lying, and the way rich people stick together and protect each other," he said. 
"They," he said, and then used a verb that could be replaced with "undermine" or "mistreat," "the litte guy." 
Toward the end of the book, as he lost more and more money, he became more and more angry.
Of course, Mr. Denby had more money to invest than your average American. He had inherited $325,000 from his mother in 1991, he and his wife had saved money in 401(k) plans and, as they collected money from book royalties and writing salaries, invested in small and mid-cap value funds and overseas funds in the mid-90's. In the final analysis, Mr. Denby said, he and Ms. Schine, his former wife, "were way up on paper, then way down on paper." He added, "In the end, we lost about six years' worth of investing."
Still, not many Americans who lost money in the stock market got to write books about their experiences. 
"I say right up front that I am in a privileged position, to be able to make a book out of your troubles," Mr. Denby said. "Most people can't. But writers are ruthlessly pragmatic, and they will take anything and turn it into a story or a book."
John Cassidy, a New Yorker financial writer, said that he had cautioned Mr. Denby from the beginning. "From a financial perspective, it seemed to me to be insanity. He didn't seem to be operating according to financial logic," he said. 
But financial behavior is not always logical, Mr. Denby said. "A lot of it is about emotion, impulse, anger, desire, envy," he said.
And envy is a driving force in the book. He writes in longing detail about Mr. Waksal's SoHo loft, the expensive art and sumptuous decorations, where "one felt as actors feel on a stage, warmed by attention." Later, he writes that he looked at Dr. Waksal and envisioned "a dream of an alternative life."
When Mr. Denby visited wealthy friends on their 400-acre weekend estate in Connecticut, he slept in their guest room and lay awake wondering why he would never inhabit a room like it and its adjoining bathroom, with its yards of marble and its pastoral views.
"They were gracious people," he writes, "and my envy would wriggle through their good humor like a snake in the garden and, finding nothing vain to attack, would turn back and bite itself in bitterness." The couple, he adds, "lived in the place from which the rest of us had been expelled."
As he stared into the bowl of untouched salad, Mr. Denby relented a bit. The real and most pervasive envy, he said, "is that among peers." He went on: "In this case, the upper bourgeois intellectuals in New York. Mixed in with the genuine good will and friendship, there is always envy."
Envy, as described in the book, is "the curse of the middle classes -- particularly, I would add, the professional and intellectual sectors of the middle class, the Upper West Siders living in every city and suburb in the country." Envy swallows up the middle class with questions like: "Who has brighter children? Who has taken the more interesting vacation? Eaten at the better restaurant?"
Not that there's anything wrong with a little consumer desire. Mr. Denby said he still wanted if not a million dollars at least the Audi A6. 
"I will buy it, or maybe the A4," he said, referring to a less expensive version of the car (its price starts at $26,240). "Someday. One hopes."
Mr. Denby said he and his former wife have recovered about 40 percent of their losses, which isn't as positive as it sounds. 
"That means we're down about $500,000," he said.
As for the apartment, the two of them sold it. He now lives in a four-room apartment four blocks away. 
"Once you know where the red pepper bin is at Fairway, you don't want to leave the neighborhood," he said. He said he was no longer a habitue of Internet pornography and rarely watched CNBC. And he is in love. He is dating Susan Rieger, associate provost for the office of equal opportunity and affirmative action at Columbia University. "She is tall and blonde," he said. "I mean, wow." 
As for Ms. Schine, Mr. Denby's former wife, she said that she did not like reading about herself. 
"It's alarming to see any characterization of yourself in print, because it's like looking at a picture," she said. "You just see all the wrinkles and puffs." She added, however, that she liked the book. "One of David's great strengths is that he is courageous enough to be earnest, which in this day and age is not something that everyone will do." 
Mr. Denby still invests in the markets, although he has diversified his portfolio rather than relying heavily on any one sector.
"The market is coming back," Mr. Denby said. "I am interested in the Japanese recovery, and in China, which is a very dangerous, speculative thing." He paused. "Although it is pretty safe to say that no one should take my advice on investments."

HEADLINE: Call It the Family Risk Factor 

BYLINE:  By Jacob S. Hacker; Jacob S. Hacker, assistant professor of political science at Yale and a fellow at the New America Foundation, is working on a book about economic insecurity.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Conn. 

 BODY:
On the heels of Friday's glum Labor Department report, Americans have a right to be confused. Soaring growth, stocks and consumer confidence have heartened investors. And yet, the country remains mired in a jobless recovery. The reality is that the economy has become more uncertain and anxiety-producing for most of us -- not just over the past three years, but over the past 30. But by fixating on the day-to-day ups and downs, analysts have largely missed the more telling trend: an increasing shift of economic risk from government and corporations onto workers and their families.
 Signs of this transformation are everywhere: in the laid-off programmer whose stock options are suddenly worthless, in the former welfare mom who can get a job but not health care or day care, in the family forced into bankruptcy by the sickness of a child. But these episodes, while viewed with sympathy, are usually seen in isolation, rather than as parts of a larger problem. This blinkered view stands in the way of both diagnoses of the causes of the new economic insecurity and prescriptions for its cure. 
 Consider the accompanying chart. The line traces the year-to-year instability of family income from 1972 to 1998, based on the University of Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics. It measures the extent to which a family's income from both government and the private sector fluctuates from year to year, controlling for the size of the family and the general rise of income among all Americans (so as not to confuse upward mobility with instability). 
The formula captures both changes in the income of families and changes in families themselves, like divorce and separation, that alter their standard of living. What it shows is that family finances have grown much more insecure. Although insecurity dropped in the booms of the late 1980's and late 1990's, the long-term trend is sharply upward. In fact, the instability of family incomes was roughly five times greater at its peak in the 1990's than in 1972. 
Optimists point out that Americans are much richer than they were in the 1970's. But while they are as a whole, incomes have grown little for the middle class and working poor -- even as wages have become more unstable, the financial effects of losing a job have worsened, and the cost of things families need, from housing to education, has ballooned. Yet government and the private sector aren't just ignoring these problems, they are making them worse. Many programs for the poor, for example, have been substantially cut. And middle-class programs like Social Security have steadily eroded.
The truly staggering changes, however, are taking place in the private sector. The number of Americans without employment-based health benefits has been rising for decades. Employers are also restructuring workplace benefits to impose more risk on workers. Once, for instance, workers lucky enough to have a pension enjoyed a guaranteed benefit. Now, with so-called defined-contribution plans like 401(k)'s, workers have to put away their own wages and the returns of the plan depend entirely on their own investments.
What might be done to help families cope with the new economic insecurity? The essential first step is to shore up existing policies to ensure broad-based and secure unemployment, pension and health benefits.
Yet simply upgrading present efforts is not enough. I believe we need a new, flexible universal insurance program to protect families against catastrophic expenses and drops in income, before families fall into poverty. Universal insurance would, in turn, be coupled with tax-subsidized savings accounts that would help middle and lower-income families manage these expenses before they reached catastrophic levels.
Our economy is in the throes of a great transformation -- from an all-in-the-same-boat world of shared risk toward a go-it-alone world of personal responsibility. Protecting families from the greatest "hazards and vicissitudes of life" -- in Franklin Delano Roosevelt's still relevant words -- is necessary and possible, and it offers perhaps the best hope for reviving a constructive role for government, on bold new terms, in this new century.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Markets Shine Even More Abroad

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
THE United States stock market had a bang-up year in 2003, but performance overseas was even better. 
 International stock funds, which can invest everywhere but here, posted an average return of 39.8 percent last year, in dollar terms, according to Morningstar Inc. Including dividends, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index recorded a return of 28.7 percent. Some of the international outperformance was attributable to the slide in the value of the dollar. 
 W. George Greig, manager of the William Blair International Growth fund, which has about $2 billion under management, talked last week about his outlook for foreign markets this year. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. What do you expect for the global economy in 2004?

A. I am struggling to figure out what might be changing in the world.
 At this point, it doesn't look like very much is. 
 It still looks like things are going strong from one end of Asia to the other, from India to China. Economic recovery is looking stronger in Europe, but it is kind of peaking out in the United States and in the United Kingdom. 
South America is very commodity-sensitive, and if you have a reasonable political and macrofinancial environment, it should do well. And the global agricultural economy is booming.

Q. Why did foreign markets begin swinging higher last year?

A. There were two catalysts.
 The first was the end of the war in Iraq, which brought European markets back from the brink. The other was the end of the SARS crisis, which for a time masked a very strong rebound in Asia. 
 After the SARS scare, we got the sense that China was driving the global economy as much as the United States was.

Q. Emerging markets did much better than stocks in the developed countries. Where is your portfolio invested?

A. We are limited to 20 percent of the total portfolio in emerging markets, and for the last nine months or so we have been at the top of the range.
 Our heaviest commitments in emerging markets are in China, Taiwan, India and Brazil. I am bullish on Brazil, even though its market doubled last year. About half our emerging-market exposure is in these four countries. 
 Emerging markets beat the rest of the world in 1999, lagged in 2000 and have outperformed ever since, both in the bear and the bull market. On a five-year basis, emerging markets have significantly outperformed developed-country markets, including the United States.

Q. How is the remaining 80 percent of the portfolio allocated?

A. About 24 percent of our money is in Japan, and another 6.4 percent is in Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore. Nearly 6 percent is in Canada. A little over 20 percent is in the United Kingdom, and about 23 percent in Continental Europe.

Q. The dollar has weakened substantially against the euro over the last year. But Europe has a wide range of economic and fiscal problems. Do they concern you?

A. I am worried about the European Union, where fiscal tensions are becoming very difficult. It looks like Europe is suffering from a lack of cohesiveness and political leadership.
 As far as the currency is concerned, if you asked a trader, he would say the euro isn't strong; the dollar is weak. If the dollar were not weak, I think the euro would be the focus of currency traders.

Q. Which other countries or regions of the world worry you?

A. Pakistan, Taiwan and North Korea are the three countries I worry about.
 The fact of all the attention and effort the Middle East has gotten in the last couple of years means that it is probably not as much of a threat, in a surprise sense, as it was. But if there were some sort of unforeseen extremist revolution in Saudi Arabia, or unforeseen developments in Palestine, that would not be good, either.

Q. What are the biggest holdings in the fund?

A. As of the end of September, our five biggest holdings were Vodafone, UBS, Nomura Securities, Samsung Electronics and Standard Chartered P.L.C.

Q. Do you sense a shift in sentiment about the wisdom of investing overseas?

A. There has been a shift in the last couple of years. At the end of the 1990's, people were asking what the point was of investing overseas, because we do everything better here.
 A few years on, there is not quite so much cynicism about foreign economies. People hear about how competitive China is, and how many jobs are going to India. 
 As far as the allocation is concerned, the consensus view among most advisers and pension funds is that 10 percent to 20 percent of a portfolio should be invested internationally. 
 I wouldn't quarrel with that.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
The No-Bang,All-Whimper Recovery

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE jobs report on Friday was a stark reminder to investors of why trusting the consensus view of anything economic -- the stock market, interest rates, commodity prices -- can be such a peril. 
 Economists had forecast an increase of 150,000 jobs in December. They were off by a mere 149,000. 
 Other aspects of the employment figures disappointed, too. More than 300,000 people dropped out of the job pool and the index of hours worked fell below the level of 1998. The manufacturing sector shed jobs, as it had for the previous 40 months, but so did the retail and financial service industries. Finally, November's upbeat job report was revised downward. 
 One economist who was unsurprised by the figures is Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. Arguing for months that a lasting recovery cannot be built on an increasingly indebted consumer, a declining savings rate and widening current-account and trade deficits, Mr. Roach's has been a voice in the wilderness. 
 Bulls on the economy have snickered at his warnings that, contrary to some of the data, the domestic labor market was not rebounding. Now he looks prescient. 
 "We had a spectacular second half of '03 in G.D.P. because of tax cuts, the last-gasp spending of the refinance cycle and price cuts on motor vehicles," Mr. Roach said. "But we haven't had job growth and income generation. Consumers can't continue to carry the ball with their incomes lagging."
 The consumer, of course, has been a stalwart spender for years in spite of significant job losses, a nonexistent savings rate and increasing personal debt. Counting out the consumer has been folly. 
 "I think the 90's taught people to spend not just out of their paychecks but also out of their assets," Mr. Roach said. First, the stock market, then their homes.
 But the unpleasant reality remains that private-sector payrolls are now 7.5 million workers below the level that would be typical 25 months into an economic recovery, he said. This trend may well continue, he said, and for several troubling reasons.
 They all have to do with the outsourcing phenomenon that has swept through the manufacturing world and is now threatening service jobs. Thanks to the Internet and the continued push for productivity, more American companies are turning to offshore workers.
 And Mr. Roach sees no reason for that to change. 
 "In the last five months, 280,000 jobs have been created, a number that we get easily in a month during a normal recovery," he said. Most of the new jobs are in temporary staffing, health and government, he added. 
 "The days of an old-fashioned hiring-led recovery are over," Mr. Roach said. "And we have to face that, in terms of understanding the potential for our economy to keep growing as many in our financial markets are now blindly assuming will be the case."
 Mr. Roach said the second half of 2004 might bring an economic relapse. Hmm. That would heat up the presidential race.
 Also casting doubt on the recovery is Robert H. Parks, economist and professor of finance at Pace University. He said he thought that interest rates would rise significantly by the end of the year, pushed up not by Alan Greenspan, who never saw an asset bubble he didn't like, but by the bond market vigilantes. "Deficits financed by way of freshly printed money to fund tax cuts, pork-barrel spending and huge outlays for military spending are going to generate headline news on sharply rising interest rates, long before 2004 is over," Mr. Parks said. 
 Just something to think about for those with portfolios chock-full of high-priced stocks and bonds.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
A Higher Return, a Higher Risk

BYLINE:  By BRUCE McWILLIAMS

 BODY:
BANK loan mutual funds gave investors much higher returns than money market funds last year, but the loan funds also carried a higher risk. 
 The bank loan funds, so called because they hold bank loans and other debt of less than investment grade, currently yield 3 to 4 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., versus less than 1 percent for money market funds. Over all, bank loan funds gave investors an average total return of 10.2 percent in 2003. Most of the gain resulted from improved credit quality of the fund's holdings, which led to an increase in their price. Money market funds returned an average of 0.56 percent in 2003. 
 Unlike money market funds, which can be cashed in throughout the day, some bank loan funds permit withdrawals only once a month or once a quarter. And there is a much greater possibility of a loss in these funds. 
 Bank loan funds offer some protection against interest rate declines because the rate of the corporate loans in their portfolios is generally reset every three to six months. As a result, these funds are sometimes called floating rate funds. Typically, a loan in a fund's portfolio has an interest rate 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points higher than a base interest rate, like the London interbank offer rate, or Libor. When the base interest rate rises, the loans' rate goes up.
 When credit quality declines, impairing the value of the funds' holdings, they can lose money, although losses to date generally have been modest. In 2002, the Columbia Floating Rate fund declined 0.6 percent, according to Morningstar. But last year, it gained more than 15 percent.
 Geoff Blyth, vice president and investment officer with the Genesee Valley Trust Company in Pittsford, N.Y., said he includes this category of mutual fund in some portfolios he manages. "In 2001 and 2002, there was actual principal erosion" in some funds, he said. "But, they pay a hefty yield." 
 Because the floating rate loans are to a large extent protected against interest rate increases, some portfolio managers and financial planners say the funds can help add balance. "We use them in large portfolios as a hedge against rising interest rates," said Kevin Grimes, a certified financial analyst and certified financial planner in Westborough, Mass. 
 Scott Page, who manages floating rate funds for Eaton Vance, said that the funds were different from bond funds, which tend to have falling returns when interest rates rise. "We're antibond," he said. "When rates go up, we go up."
 Because the loans that make up the funds' underlying portfolios are not of investment grade, careful selection of securities is important, managers say. The loans are generally secured by collateral. If the company gets into trouble, fails to make loan payments and goes out of business, those with bank loans secured by collateral usually get the first chance at the assets of a company. 
 Christine McConnell, who manages the $890 million Fidelity Floating Rate High Income fund, says that "senior ranking of the debt reduces the credit risk and maximizes recovery" of the loan if the issuing company goes bankrupt.
 Steven C. Miller, managing director of Standard & Poor's LCD, a unit of the rating agency that monitors creditworthiness of floating rate loans, said default rates, a measure of how many companies have stopped paying interest, have been declining. He said that the rate stood at 2.3 percent in November, compared with 4.5 percent at the end of 2002. It reached a high of 7.3 percent at the end of 2000.
 The Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserves fund, which began in 1989, when bank loans were traded infrequently, is among the oldest in the field, according to Morningstar. It allows only quarterly redemptions of investments. 
 FUND managers at many of these funds have sometimes had difficulty pricing assets daily, which would lead to problems in selling securities if investors withdrew money abruptly.
 But the market for the funds' underlying securities has expanded, and some relatively new funds, like Fidelity Floating Rate High Income, allow daily redemptions. So do some other Eaton Vance funds. Ms. McConnell, of the Fidelity fund, which started in 2000, said the fund tried to offer investors "transparency and liquidity." Fidelity charges a fee of 1 percent on redemptions made within 60 days of purchase. 
 Over all, total expense ratios for the funds vary from 0.9 percent for Fidelity Floating Rate to 2.9 percent for Columbia Floating Rate Advantage C, according to Morningstar.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
How the Boomers Lost Their Way in the Bubble

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
"IT ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble," Mark Twain once said. "It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."
 Millions of investors, ignorant of financial history, were taught expensive lessons when they eagerly absorbed the new conventional wisdom of the 1990's. Most prominent of those new certainties was the notion that stocks were the only sensible securities. Bonds, after all, provided neither double-digit annual returns nor cocktail-party cachet. 
 The responsible baby boomer, frightened by Wall Street promoters and unduly cynical about receiving Social Security, came to regard a heavy commitment to stocks as crucial to any chance of prospering and then maintaining a decent standard of living in retirement. 
 The main corollaries of stock pre-eminence were that you should buy more shares whenever prices dropped, and that you should hold on to them practically forever.
 Weren't these the methods of Warren E. Buffett, the iconic sage of Omaha, whose net worth from investing runs to 11 digits? 
 The stock implosion that shattered these illusions in early 2000 resulted from a combination of forces. Not least of these was the belief in an Internet-based new era, a premise that anybody familiar with financial history should have found highly suspect.
 In her highly readable and insightful "Bull! A History of the Boom, 1982-1999" (HarperBusiness, $27.95), Maggie Mahar exposes the ignorance, myths and avarice that surrounded the fin de siecle market bubble and subsequent bust. The book is an account not only of a swarm of naive stock buyers but also of Wall Street hyperpromoters, greedy corporate executives, careerist mutual fund managers, complaisant accountants and company directors, beholden politicians and too many uncritical journalists swept up in the stock-buying frenzy. It also tells of misjudgment by the Securities and Exchange Commission and an error or two by the Federal Reserve.
 In the process, Ms. Mahar, a financial journalist who was a senior writer for Barron's, makes a devastating case against the contention that the market is almost perfectly efficient -- that prices are the product of immediate, judicious weighing of all available information by rational investors. She quotes Robert J. Shiller, the prescient Yale economist, who declared this hypothesis "the most remarkable error in the history of economic theory."
 Many of the novice stock buyers were stampeded by Wall Street warnings that this constant devotion to stocks was the only way they could build a satisfactory nest egg. This coincided with corporate America's desire to rid itself of the burden of traditional pensions and thus force employees to largely finance their own retirements; 401(k)'s were suddenly on everybody's lips. 
 It didn't help that independent research had become almost unavailable to individual investors because deregulation had shriveled the commissions that once supported it. As a result, information-age investors were lost in a torrent of incoherent data. Moreover, Wall Street was seeking to make up for lost commissions with investment banking business, leading to the rise of cheerleader analysts.
 Company executives, meanwhile, were busy convincing investors that they should prefer stock buybacks to cash dividends -- a policy that happened to mask the earnings dilution that was produced by lavish executive stock options. 
 Pointing to what she calls "fully deluded earnings," Ms. Mahar is particularly cogent in her discussion of efforts to require options to be considered expenses and deducted from profits. Under pressure, many companies have since adopted that reform.
 Mutual fund portfolio managers, for their part, were generally forced by the system to be more interested in outperforming peers than in husbanding shareholders' accounts. The fixation lured many to speculate in ludicrously expensive market leaders. 
 "As the market climbed, most managers chose investment risk (for their clients) over career risk (for themselves)," Ms. Mahar contends. Fund sponsors, she adds, made the piling up of fee-generating assets their top priority and had the gall to stick investors with marketing costs, even for funds closed to new investors.
 Nor does Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, escape blame for fomenting an unsustainable boom, despite his famous December 1996 warning of "irrational exuberance."
 Though investors may have put undue confidence in any human's ability to fine-tune economies, Mr. Greenspan seems to have succumbed too readily to new-era visions of productivity and may have overprepared for the possibility of disruption from the Year 2000 computer problem.
 He also chose not to make it harder to buy stock on credit by raising margin requirements, calling this weapon a blunt instrument that would affect only small investors who could not maneuver around it, but nevertheless something that would "guarantee" elimination of the market bubble. 
 For thematic purposes, the book necessarily jumps back and forth in time, making for repeated, sometimes numbing statistical reminders of market levels at various points. And, in a well-edited work generous with credit to other observers -- footnoted, thankfully, in the back -- it is surprising that the name of Morgan Stanley's chief domestic strategist, Byron R. Wien, is misspelled some two dozen times.
 Ms. Mahar's engrossing tale is grounded in the verity that sooner or later markets always revert to historical norms. She concludes it by endorsing the revived appreciation of cash dividends and underscoring, so long as inflation is contained, the "miracle" of compounding.
 BUY-AND-HOLD investing is apt to disappoint, Ms. Mahar contends, noting that Mr. Buffett himself steps aside on occasion.
 "Any value investor is a market timer," she declares. "At the end of a cycle, when prices are higher, he stops buying." 
 Commodities, gold, real estate and emerging markets may be profitable current avenues, she suggests, but her strongest single recommendation is the Treasury's inflation-protected securities, a riskless long-term investment. Inflation's eventual return is a given, she says, and stocks are an uncertain hedge. 
 "Knowledge of history is an investor's best defense," Ms. Mahar concludes. "Despite all the financial engineering that attempts to eliminate risk, cycles appear to be as inevitable as the seasons."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM -- BUZZ; 
Harlem, She Wrote (and Murder, Too)

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY

 BODY:
 THE SETTING -- The lemon-yellow rooms of a brownstone on West 121st Street in Harlem, where dozens of literary sophisticates come and go while eating deviled eggs, the perfect setting . . . for murder.

THE BUZZ -- Not real murder, crime-novel murder. Or was it justifiable homicide? For the answer to that and other questions -- such as, what was playing on the jukebox at the Fat Man Bar on 155th Street in the summer of 1972? -- you will have to read "The Viaduct" by Grace F. Edwards. She and her recently published book were the reasons for the party, held last weekend by the Harlem Writers Guild.
 "I'm a mystery reader," said Lenore Blackburn, a fan of Ms. Edwards who traveled from Clifton, Va., to find a seat at the party and balance a big plate of tuna salad on her knee. "Her credibility is excellent. Until I found her books, I didn't know there was an African-American female mystery writer." 
 Ms. Edwards is known for her textured descriptions of Harlem, the setting for each of her six books. McGraw-Hill published her first mystery in 1988, and Doubleday has published the last five. She does well. The average print run for her books is 39,000 copies, according to Doubleday.
 The main character in "The Viaduct" is Marin Taylor, a Vietnam veteran who harbors tortured memories of the war. The action begins when Marin is attacked while walking home at night on the 155th Street viaduct. A man dies, and soon after, a child is stolen. The reader follows Marin through a violent world of ill intent that is piquantly strewn with cultural references to things like the Flip Wilson television show, "chicken and waffles at Wells' Restaurant at three in the morning" and Mayor John V. Lindsay's struggles with uptown urban renewal. 
 The gracious Ms. Edwards, who now lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and who perhaps looked better than a 71-year-old woman has a right to look in a pair of burgundy leather pants, noted another slice of Harlemesque verisimilitude in her novels: suspicion of civic authority. 
 "Growing up in this area, I sort of have a problem with confidence regarding the police," she said. In her books, characters like Marin and Mali Anderson, a female private detective, do most of the sleuthing. 
 One partygoer, Jimmy Peterson, nodded in time to the cool jazz of a four-piece combo that featured the rumbling thrum of the jymba, a goatskin drum from Africa. He was happy to compliment Ms. Edwards, the little girl who lived down the block when he was growing up on 148th Street in central Harlem. 
 "She's the same person with the nice smile who is always glad to see you," he said. He also praised the familiarity of her fictional world: "I really like her, because she writes about me." 
 For those still wondering, the answer is "You're So Fine" by the Cats and the Fiddle, a rhythm and blues group. That's what was playing on the jukebox at the Fat Man before Marin Taylor walked out into the humid night and met fate on the viaduct. JIM O'GRADY

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Surprise: Year Has A Happy Ending

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
THE last quarter of 2003 turned out to be much better for mutual funds than many investors might have thought.
 As September wound down, some market strategists worried about the damage being done to investor confidence by the spreading mutual fund scandal. Others focused on equity valuations, which, they said, were so high that the market was ready for a correction. 
 Instead of falling, though, stocks rallied in October. And November. And again in December. The gains were not limited to a narrow group of stocks. The entire market rose, ending 2003 with its first yearly gain since 1999. 
 The Value Line Index of 1,667 equally weighted stocks rose 7.7 percent in October. It was up an additional 3.1 percent in November. And it gained 3.9 percent in December. 
 Fund investors shared in those gains nearly across the board.
 The average domestic stock fund posted a return of about 12 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Morningstar Inc., and ended the year up 32 percent. International stock funds did even better, with an average return of a bit more than 15 percent for the quarter and more than 39 percent for the year. 
 Indeed, of the 33 equity fund categories tracked by Morningstar, only one -- bear market funds -- posted a negative return for the quarter. 
 "The market continued to surprise people right through the end of the year," said Thomas McManus, chief investment strategist at Banc of America Securities.
 The list of those implicated in the mutual fund scandal, meanwhile, continued to grow. Investors reacted by pulling money out of some fund families that have been tarred by the scandal. But by no means did they turn their backs on funds as an investment vehicle.
 In fact, inflows into equity funds in the fourth quarter exceeded $61 billion, the largest of the year, according to AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif. "The inflows have been going to those fund groups that have either not been charged at all or not charged in an egregious way," said Robert Adler, president of AMG. 
 Mr. Adler said that more than half of the equity fund inflows had been received by three fund families that have not been connected with the scandal: American Funds, Vanguard and Fidelity Investments. 
 A poll in December by UBS and the Gallup Organization found that of the more than 800 investors nationwide who participated, 65 percent said that the scandals had not affected their mutual fund investment decisions. Seventy-three percent said they did not plan to shift assets out of mutual funds in the near future. But 75 percent said they would shift assets out of a mutual fund that admits wrongdoing. 
 "I am a little surprised that flows were as good as they were," said Russel Kinnel, director of fund research at Morningstar Inc. "My guess as to why people are not that affected is that the scandal relating to market timing and other arrangements did a fairly small amount of damage to the funds themselves." 
 For many investors, the stock market's performance may have helped to ease the scandal's sting.
 Underlying economic fundamentals certainly provided a positive framework for stocks during the quarter. News about the strength of the economy was particularly encouraging, especially a report from the Commerce Department in late October that the gross domestic product had grown at an eye-popping 8.2 percent rate in the third quarter. "That was a real jolt," Mr. McManus said. 
 There was other good news as well.
 Corporate earnings reports released in the quarter were strong. Rising commodity prices helped natural resources companies. And the decline in the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets helped investors in international funds, which turned in a stellar performance.
 On average, international stock funds posted a return of just over 15 percent for the quarter, according to Morningstar data.
 Some regional funds did much better than that. 
 Emerging-market funds were up by more than 18 percent. And Latin American stock funds generated areturn of more than 20 percent in the quarter.
 THE bang-up performance by Latin markets had more to do with commodity prices' strength than the dollar's weakness.
 "Brazil was the driver for the quarter and the year as well," said Will Landers, co-manager of the Merrill Lynch Latin America fund, which rose 22 percent in the quarter and more than 68 percent for the year. 
 Thanks to surging commodity prices and strong demand from China, Brazil recorded a trade surplus of around $25 billion in 2003, Mr. Landers said. "China was definitely the source of most of the growth we saw in Latin America in 2003," he said. 
 Over the course of last year, "during meetings with Latin companies I watched my watch to see how long it would take for the subject of China to come up," Mr. Landers added. 
 A trip to Asia in the fourth quarter prompted Harry W. Lange, manager of the $4.5 billion Fidelity Capital Appreciation fund, to begin a major portfolio readjustment. 
 At the beginning of 2003, Mr. Lange said, 45 percent to 47 percent of the fund's assets were invested in technology stocks. In Asia, though, he said, "seeing the massive demand for commodities started to make me think about commodity prices and inflation as being things we ought to start to think about."
 Over the last three months, he said, the fund has lopped its exposure to technology back to 12 to 15 percent of the overall portfolio, and increased its exposure to commodity-based companies, industrials and "some Big Pharma companies that didn't perform well last year." 
 The fund returned more than 51 percent for all of 2003. 
 Even though stocks performed well and the economy grew vigorously -- two factors that are normally not associated with positive developments in the fixed-income markets -- bond funds managed to have positive returns in the quarter. 
 Taxable bond funds returned 1.93 percent, according to Morningstar, while municipal bond funds returned 1.4 percent. 
 Given the current level of interest rates, bond funds will be challenged to post positive returns in 2004, analysts said. And it will probably be more difficult to make good money in stocks. 
 "This year could be tougher," said Bill Miller, manager of the $14 billion Legg Mason Value Trust, which in 2003 outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the 13th consecutive year. "Last year, it was clear to us that you wanted to take on risk, which people had been fleeing for three years. Now, things are more evenly balanced." 
 Mr. Kinnel of Morningstar recommended caution. "There doesn't appear to be any area that is particularly attractive," he said. 
 "Diversify," he advised. "And don't get carried away based on a fund's performance last year. People who were chasing performance in the late 1990's have hopefully learned a painful enough lesson that they won't repeat it again soon."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
When Santa Delivers, Is Growth On the Way?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL GROSS; Daniel Gross writes the "Moneybox" column for Slate.

 BODY:
THE holiday shopping season was covered much like the college Bowl Championship Series. 
 There was extensive pregame analysis, as economists and retail analysts tossed out their forecasts on national television. (The National Retail Foundation boldly predicted that sales would rise 5.7 percent.) There was a frenzy of activity surrounding the kickoff, as camera crews flocked to Wal-Marts on the Friday after Thanksgiving. As the action heated up, reporters filed blow-by-blow reports from malls nationwide. And at every twist and turn viewers were bombarded with statistics. 
 Now that both seasons are over, we may pose the question to the holiday shopping season that is asked about some of the football games, especially the also-rans like the Continental Tire Bowl and the Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl. Do the results matter to anyone but the participants? 
 Other than shareholders of the retailers, which ring up nearly a quarter of their annual sales during the five-week season, who should care that sales rose 4.2 percent, as the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS reported last week. Do the sales tell us something about the state of, or, more important, the direction of the economy?
 "Holiday season sales matter because they have implications for the subsequent year," said Michael Niemira, chief economist and director of research at the International Council of Shopping Centers in New York. "The fact is that a good Christmas is often followed by strong consumer spending."
 Two years ago, Mr. Niemira, who compiles the International Council of Shopping Centers-UBS chain store sales report (formerly the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi chain store sales report), analyzed figures on holiday sales and economic growth from 1989 to 2000. He concluded that a model that used holiday sales to predict the next year's growth in gross domestic product and consumer spending was usually accurate. 
 So that 4.2 percent gain in 2003 sales bodes well for 2004, right?
 Not necessarily. In the last few years, holiday retail sales have misfired as a leading indicator. In 2001, sales rose a solid 5.6 percent, but economic growth in 2002 was disappointingly weak. In 2002, retailers tallied their worst holiday season in more than a decade, as sales rose a measly 2.2 percent. Yet in the 12 months that followed, economic growth surged. 
 There were extenuating circumstances in each of these instances. In 2001, the post-Sept. 11 surge of patriotic shopping that saved that year's holiday shopping season might have masked underlying weakness in the economy that persisted through 2002. And if the economy shifts gears in the middle of the year -- as it probably did in 2003 -- holiday season sales can be more of a reflection on previous months than an indicator of future economic performance.
 "This year, the holidays came at a good time because the economy was picking up momentum in the third quarter," said Rosalind Wells, chief economist at the National Retail Federation in Washington. 
 The stimulus created by higher government spending and tax cuts, the stock market's climb and the stabilized job market "put a lot more discretionary income into consumers' pockets," Ms. Wells added.
 So what do the latest sales results tell us? On the one hand, holiday season sales grew at almost double the rate they did in 2002. But given the wind at the economy's back going into the fourth quarter, the figure may be viewed as less than impressive. 
 IN addition, rather than signaling broader future economic growth, an increase in holiday sales could indicate that consumers are cramming more of their annual purchases into the holiday season. But, the added hype over holiday shopping hasn't led consumers to do so in recent years. According to the National Retail Foundation, the percentage of annual sales rung up by retailers during the 2002 holiday season was the same as the 1993 level: 22.7 percent.
 Besides, some economic forecasters warn that at this stage, the spending decisions of businesses may have more impact on the economy than the spending decisions of retail shoppers.
 "Don't forget that consumer demand has been strong all year long," said Saul Hymans, professor of economics and director of economic forecasting at the University of Michigan. "It's not going to be the consumer that pushes the economy into a higher plane in 2004." 
 After carrying the ball for so many years, consumers are still trying to hand it off to the business sector, which has watched from the sidelines for far too long.

HEADLINE: Paying the Price Of Retirees' Health Care 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 When it comes to poorly funded pension and retiree health care plans, the main culprit is Congress, not the companies that are providing these benefits. 
 Congress needs to develop a long-term policy on retirement benefits. Is it good social policy for workers to have employment-based retirement benefits? If so, Congress should create a framework that encourages companies to supplement Social Security and Medicare with employer-provided coverage and at the same time give companies the flexibility to fund the benefits during both good times and bad.
 Currently, pension law encourages companies to fund their pension plans during "bad times," when the economy is weak, stock markets are low and interest rates have been lowered to stimulate economic growth. These are the economic periods when companies can least afford to fund their pension plans.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Close to Reaching a Lofty Goal 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan 

 BODY:
When the Nationalists retreated here from the mainland at the end of China's civil war in 1949, they did not intend to stay long. The architecture shows it.
 Rows of short, dreary concrete buildings line the older streets. Boxlike, 10-story glass office buildings with no pizazz flank avenues in the newer business districts. Typhoons are a frequent threat and earthquakes a constant menace -- 2,455 people died in a quake here just over four years ago that destroyed 51,000 homes and damaged an additional 53,000. 
 Not surprisingly, only a handful of buildings have more than 30 stories -- the tallest has 52. But that has not stopped a coalition of local tycoons, politicians, builders and architects from building what is about to become the world's tallest building, a 101-story tower with the shape of an abstract pagoda that soars past previous holders of the title, the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the Sears Tower in Chicago. (Plans for the site of the former World Trade Center in Manhattan call for an even taller building, although some argue it may not qualify as tallest because part of it will be more structural framework than habitable building.)
Hydraulic jacks on the roof moved the Taipei building's spire into place in October, and the final windows to finish enclosing the 1,667-foot-high building were installed in early November. The building, Taipei 101, is to open in December. Although it trails the Sears Tower in the height of antennas on top of its roof, it exceeds the Sears building in the height of its uppermost occupied floor and has a higher spire than the Petronas Towers.
As with other very tall buildings in Asia, the construction of this one is as much about politics and pride as commerce. "As the world's highest building, Taipei 101 will attract attention to Taiwan's excellence, and carve 'Taiwan first' in the minds of people around the globe," President Chen Shui-bian said in a written response to a question about the project.
Mr. Chen was the mayor of Taipei in the spring of 1997 when he began pressing to have a skyscraper built in the new neighborhood he was creating close to City Hall, on the city's eastern outskirts. He called Lin Hong-ming, one of Taiwan's wealthiest construction tycoons, who said he had rounded up the financing for the project in only a couple of days by contacting the leaders of a half dozen of the country's wealthiest families. The cost of the building is $1.7 billion. 
Mr. Chen was a rising star then in the Democratic Progressive Party, which was starting to challenge the Nationalist Party's half-century monopoly on power. Tycoons who had grown rich under the Nationalists had an incentive to seek warm ties with the new party.
The initial plan was for a 66-story skyscraper with two 20-story buildings in front of it. Mr. Lin said the planned tenants for the 20-story buildings, China Trust and the Taiwan Stock Exchange, each wanted to be in the main building, though, so their office space was stacked on top of the original building.
"It was never really our intention to build the tallest building in the world," he said.
Mr. Chen's election as president in 2000 gave the project extra momentum. The Asian financial crisis in late 1997 and through 1998 did not derail the project, nor did the end of the dot-com boom, although both caused serious economic problems in Taiwan.
Just as the Rockefellers built Rockefeller Center inexpensively during the Great Depression, hiring workers cheaply, the tycoons here have found construction workers and companies eager to work even at reduced pay on one of the few big projects left.
Mr. Lin describes the building as the most important of his life and has pursued it with single-minded focus. Creditors have seized some of his family's other properties, which have suffered from the general downturn in the local real estate market over the last two years, but the Lin family has not reduced its stake in Taipei 101.
"I am 100 percent devoted to this project," he said in an interview in a barren, unpainted, makeshift office a third of the way up the tower.
Safety has been a big concern, and the Sept. 11 attacks raised fresh worries. C. P. Wang, the architect, said that while computer modeling of such an attack was difficult, the builders had designed Taipei 101 so that it should be able to stand for at least a couple of hours longer than the World Trade Center towers did and might not collapse at all under similar circumstances.
The World Trade Center's structure relied on many slender columns in each floor. Taipei 101 has an immense frame with eight pillars of steel and reinforced concrete, each measuring 11 feet by 8 feet at the base, rising inside the corners of the building.
Even a passenger jet moving at full speed should not be able to break one of the pillars, Mr. Wang said, but if it did, the other pillars should be able to support the building.
To anchor the building against earthquakes, builders drilled down through 200 feet of dirt and then 65 feet into the bedrock. Taipei lies in a bowl between mountains, and the soil is prone to shimmying like gelatin in an earthquake, but the bedrock moves less.
For all the precautions, the construction has been dogged by problems. An earthquake in 2002 caused two cranes on Taipei 101 to fall, killing five workers. A small steel panel fell from the top on Nov. 21, bouncing down the side of the building and lightly grazing a passer-by on the street.
On the roof now, the winds are surprisingly strong even on a clear day, as the building is higher than the surrounding hills. For stability during typhoons and other high winds, the building has a 727-ton solid steel ball hanging from eight cables inside the 89th floor. 
Not much larger than a minivan, the ball is designed to act as a pendulum, offsetting up to 40 percent of the swaying in the tower's top floors.
Such balls, known as tuned mass dampers, are common in buildings over 70 floors, but are usually in mechanical rooms where visitors do not see them. 
Already installed, the ball in Taipei 101 will be painted gold and will be the centerpiece of a bar and restaurant, so that patrons can watch it move. The ball is designed to swing back and forth up to five feet during a severe typhoon. Bumpers will prevent it from swinging any farther and striking barflies.
Mr. Wang said that even though the building was designed to withstand storms seen only once in a century, few people would be around to see the ball swing violently, given corporate and government policies of dismissing workers when a typhoon approaches.
"In the case of a real strong typhoon," he said, "I would recommend people go home."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE MILITARY; 
In a Logistical Ballet, the U.S. Is Bringing In Fresh Forces to Continue the Mission in Iraq

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: KUWAIT, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
In long neat rows, as far as one can see, hundreds of American armored personnel carriers, artillery pieces, trucks and other machines of war are parked at this sprawling port, ready to load onto transport ships for the trip home from the conflict in Iraq. 
 To make room for their new cargo, each of the 900-foot vessels pulling into berths here must first disgorge more than 1,400 Bradley fighting vehicles, Humvees and other replacement equipment that will soon roll north. 
 More than 240,000 soldiers and marines are to move into and out of Iraq from now to May, testing the military's ability to handle a major logistical feat while battling the Iraqi insurgency. From remote camps in northern Iraq to the port here, this swapping of forces amounts to the United States military's largest troop rotation since World War II. 
It is a movement of hundreds of convoys synchronized by computerized programs that monitor a two-way flow of tanks, trucks and other equipment. Remote sensors track the day-by-day progress of materiel from the moment it leaves bases in Iraq to the time it rolls into predetermined parking spaces aboard one of the giant seven-story cargo ships now arriving here -- as well as the other way around. 
"It's kind of like a ballet with the Green Bay Packers," said Brig. Gen. Jack Stultz, a senior Army logistician here. He is responsible for orchestrating the movements of what will be as many as 3,000 vehicles a day along an 800-mile stretch into and out of Iraq.
During this rotation, about 110,000 fresh troops will flow into Iraq to replace 125,000 who have been there for about a year. The first 200 returning soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division arrived home this week in Fort Campbell, Ky. Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were also heading home, to Fort Bragg, N.C. 
At the peak period of overlapping forces, commanders will be able to capitalize on having as many as 200,000 troops in Iraq. But the rotation also poses new risks as American officials say they fully expect guerrillas to try to exploit the transition to new, less experienced troops.
"The shifting focus of their attacks is relentless," said Maj. Gen. Stephen M. Speakes, the senior Army officer here overseeing the troop rotation. "But this will not be a period of vulnerability." 
As the logisticians wrestle with how to feed, house and transport all the troops on the move, combat commanders say they are preparing to ensure that the frontline-unit transition is seamless. That means transferring to incoming units information about the insurgents and their structure, as well as operational matters and the personal relationships with tribal and religious leaders that have been cultivated during the past months. 
"These are three priorities that have to be transferred without a hiccup," said Brig. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, commander of the First Armored Division in Baghdad, which will hand off much of its area to the First Cavalry Division, from Fort Hood, Tex.
"We're going to have to work very hard getting them spooled up on the personalities, the sheiks, the tribes, the bad guys, the cells, the infrastructure, the economic projects and the Iraqi security forces," said Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of the 101st Airborne Division.
General Petraeus said there would also be an aggressive campaign in the Iraqi news media, including television call-in programs, to counter any efforts by the guerrillas to portray the troop rotation as the United States abandoning the Iraqi people. 
For incoming units, the process will start at the Ash Shuaiba port, where as many as three or four 900-foot-long Navy transport ships may be unloading at any time. Troops will be flown in to drive their equipment to large staging camps in the desert. They will then spend several days training in the desert before pushing up into Iraq.
The process works in reverse for returning troops. The Army plans to leave about 15 percent of its equipment behind, notably high-priority vehicles like armored Humvees and some communications equipment. The rest will be driven south in armed convoys, washed off, inspected and loaded onto the ships, now empty. 
The 101st Airborne is flying about 30 of its Apache gunships back to Fort Campbell on C-17 cargo planes, but most of the division's 250 helicopters will be flown from its headquarters in Mosul, Iraq, to Kuwait, taken apart, wrapped in plastic to avoid shipping damage and put on the vessels. The division has more than 6,000 vehicles and trailers heading home.
"The key to this whole operation is that no cargo stays in any situation longer than 12 hours, otherwise it's backing everything up," said Maj. Faris Williams, the Army's top operations officer at Ash Shuaiba, where nearly 100 cargo ships are to unload or pick up trucks, combat vehicles and other equipment over the next five months. 
Incoming units have been brushing up on lessons that soldiers now in Iraq have passed along, from cultural sensitivity training to maintenance tips. 
"It's about as complex an operation the Army has had in many, many years," Lt. Gen. Thomas Metz, the head of the III Corps, said in a telephone interview from his headquarters at Fort Hood. 
General Metz is expected to arrive in Iraq later this month and will assume daily operational control of the mission, allowing Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the senior American officer in Iraq now, to focus on strategic military and political issues. 
The units going home include the First Armored Division, based in Germany; the 101st Airborne Division; and the Fourth Infantry Division, from Fort Hood. 
Incoming units include the First Cavalry Division; the First Infantry Division, from Germany; and 25,000 marines from several bases. In addition, several thousand National Guard and Reserve forces will be flowing in.

HEADLINE: In Aftermath of Wildfires, Many Fault Firefighters or Bureaucracy 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN

DATELINE: CEDAR GLEN, Calif., Jan. 7 

 BODY:
They used to call Dick Pretzinger the land baron of Hook Creek. For 43 years, he made his home in the canyon the creek flows through, raising his children and horses under towering pines to the sound of a rippling stream.
 His 3,400-square-foot house was filled with so many mementos -- an $8,000 saddle with silver spurs, a music room full of instruments -- that his granddaughter named it the museum. 
 But when a wildfire roared through the San Bernardino Mountains in late October, Mr. Pretzinger's home and those of about 350 of his neighbors in and around Cedar Glen were obliterated, leaving this small community east of Los Angeles one of the most heavily damaged of all those hit by the blazes that raged across Southern California for 10 days. 
Mr. Pretzinger's property, now fenced to ward off looters, resembles a blackened trash dump, full of twisted metal and broken objects lost to the flames. The rest of the canyon is no different, forever scarred.
"It looks like a nuclear bomb went off," said Charis Scanlon, a founder of Rebuilding Mountain Hearts and Lives, a new organization in neighboring Lake Arrowhead that is coordinating assistance for homeowners like Mr. Pretzinger.
More than two months after the fires, which destroyed 3,600 homes and burned nearly 740,000 acres across the state, residents of San Bernardino County and the eight other affected counties are growing increasingly anxious and frustrated. Many victims here are demanding to know why firefighters failed to reach the canyons to save their houses. Some are realizing, too late, that their properties were underinsured, while others are gearing up for a fight with building officials who are trying to enforce codes established long after their homes were built. In many cases, the new codes would sharply limit rebuilding in narrow canyons and on steep mountainsides.
"The whole thing is a bureaucratic boondoggle," said Mr. Pretzinger, 76, a retired civil engineer and surveyor who is leading the effort to get the county building codes relaxed. He is also trying to stave off proposed rules for mountain areas that would require new homes to have double-paned windows, nonflammable roofing and fire-resistant materials for walls and decks. Mr. Pretzinger and other residents fear the rules would make rebuilding too expensive.
"It's going to take us five or six years to get even close to where we were," said Camie Pretzinger, Mr. Pretzinger's daughter-in-law, who raised her three boys, now 15, 13 and 11, in a nearby house that was also burned to the ground. 
She and other former residentsof Hook Creek are furious that utility companies sent crews with heavy cranes into the canyon to remove damaged trees -- in the process, they say, further damaging the foundations of some houses. Without surviving foundations, residents fear, the county will declare the properties a complete loss, making it unlikely that they will be allowed to build new homes there. Adding to their anxiety, recent rains have swept acres of topsoil off the denuded hills, with the prospect of more rain as the wet season approaches.
"If those foundations are washed out we could be in big trouble," Mrs. Pretzinger said.
A few miles down the mountain, 14 people, some of them children, were killed when a storm sent mud cascading through Waterman Canyon on Christmas Day. In the next few days, San Bernardino County officials plan to send letters warning 75,000 property owners in a 31-mile fire-damaged area of the potential for more floods and mudslides.
The prospect of more disasters is hard to take in a county that lost almost 151,000 acres and 659 homes in the wildfires. Across Southern California, 22 people died, including one firefighter, and 260 people were injured. So far, insurance claims exceed $4 billion in the nine counties affected by the fires.
In the midst of the uncertainty over rebuilding, survivors of the fire face continuing deadlines for their paperwork. About 33,000 people have requested disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, many of them at an emergency assistance center at San Bernardino International Airport.
In San Diego County, the pace of reconstruction is not much faster than it is here, with only a dozen or so permits for rebuilding single-family houses issued so far. County officials say they are trying to speed up the permit review process while making it easier for those with mobile homes to find places to park. Victims have been scattered far and wide, many staying with friends and relatives or in hotels and rented apartments. 
In Scripps Ranch, one of the most devastated communities in San Diego County, with 341 homes lost or damaged, neighbors are helping one another. About 300 volunteers have formed committees to help fire victims with everything from school car pools to house rebuilding. 
"The biggest thing weighing on my mind is having to list all the things we lost," said Bob Younger, who had lived in Wildcat Canyon, northeast of San Diego, for just seven months before fleeing his home with his family as flames approached.
Unlike many other people, Mr. Younger said he was satisfied with his insurance company's response to his claim. "Some people are finding out that they're only getting $81 a square foot in reconstruction costs, when the real cost is $200," he said. "And, of course, some people have no insurance at all." 
In Lake Arrowhead, Terry Adams said she was feeling the weight of negotiating with adjustors. "We are having nothing but problems with our insurance," said Mrs. Adams, a social worker at Mountains Community Hospital who has been living in a "little rental" since her home in Cedar Glen burned to the ground.
Her husband, Kurt Adams, had another target for his wrath. "Our house could have been saved, so we have a lot of anger about that," said Mr. Adams, 51, who said he was semi-retired from the computer industry. "The firefighters never went back there."
Lake Arrowhead, a mountain resort town that gets most of its business from weekend travelers from Los Angeles and San Bernardino, was untouched by the fires, although its boundaries were singed. 
"None of us have ever gone through anything like this," said Suzanne Kushner, the owner of Razzbearies' Cookies and Muffins, a coffee shop in the town's central square. Though her home was saved, she said, her business lost more than $25,000 in the days after the fire because the entire area had been evacuated. She was recently turned down for a Small Business Administration loan to see her through what she expects will be a rough winter because, she said, "our financial condition looked so bleak that they didn't think we could pay it back." 
Business was already off long before the fires, she said, because potential visitors had been alarmed by reports that the mountains posed a fire danger, primarily as a result of infestations by pests that killed thousands of trees.
"The economy up here has just been devastated," Ms. Kushner said. "Bark beetles, fires, the bad economy -- we've had it all. Even though the fire is out, we're not through this. If we have rain, we'll have mudslides and rock slides, and no business. It's going to be a challenging year."

HEADLINE: Incentives Lure Many to Quit, Even With a Lean Job Market 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
At 51, with college still ahead for his two teenage children, Lee Hutchison had no intention of retiring from FedEx, where he had worked for 21 years. But a few months ago, that is just what he did.
 "It was so far from my mind, early retirement," he said. "I was in a department that wrote manuals for our aircraft engineers. We were very well respected. But when they made that retirement offer, they in effect defined a group of employees that they were saying, 'We need you to leave.' It took a little while for it to dawn on me that I was part of that group." 
 So like thousands of others in recent months, Mr. Hutchison jumped at the opportunity to leave a good job and take his chances searching for work at a time when few jobs are being created. What little hiring there had been in recent months came to a halt in December, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Only 1,000 jobs were added last month, far short of the 150,000 forecasters had expected. 
Fortified with big pension payouts and promises of health benefits, these early retirees are gambling on the devil they don't know rather than sticking with the devil they do.
Until a year or two ago, exit packages drew fewer takers. Now they are more carefully aimed at employees in operations that are shrinking. Although no national statistics are kept, companies that offer these packages say that the response is greater than they had anticipated. 
"What people are doing more than in the past is laying themselves off if they get what amounts to a big enough package," said Deborah Hart, a principal at Towers Perrin, a consulting firm that designs exit packages for corporate clients.
At FedEx, 3,600 workers took an incentive package to leave in October, out of 14,000 who were eligible. Even more striking were the numbers at Verizon Communications a month later: 21,600 workers left their jobs, or 10 percent of the company's work force. Both companies said the responses achieved their goals.
Similar packages have been heavily subscribed recently at, among others, the State Street Corporation, a financial services company in Boston, and the Entergy Corporation, a network of utility operations with headquarters in New Orleans.
"We cannot underestimate the changing mind-set," Ms. Hart said. "People are not viewing retirement incentives as an end to work."
Employers are mindful that shrinking head counts with early retirement packages is more palatable, inside and outside the company, than layoffs. And they know that years of job insecurity have conditioned workers to fear the worst, thus raising the odds that workers will leave if the incentive is rich enough -- typically 40 to 50 percent of annual preretirement wages.
The workers taking early retirement often are in their early 50's and say they neither can afford to stop working nor want to. They embrace packages that give them full pensions years ahead of schedule, or severance equal to a year or more of full pay, or both. Although the current economic recovery is notable for an absence of robust hiring, these people are gambling they can get just enough work to make up the lost income. Above all, they are lured by the promise of continued health insurance, paid by the company. 
"The incremental cost of these packages is not significantly greater than the cost of a layoff," said Ezra D. Singer, executive vice president for human resources at Verizon. "It allows the company to get to the size it needs to get to, while minimizing or eliminating the demoralizing aspects of layoffs. If we had not done this, then over the next two or three years, we would have had a work force that was constantly worried about layoffs."
Among most companies engaged in cutting labor costs, outright layoffs are still common. The elaborate retirement and buyout packages that Verizon and FedEx offered are just beginning to spread, according to management consultants who design them, and such packages put the companies at risk of losing employees they might prefer to retain.
When the package was offered to Mr. Hutchison, he felt vulnerable and "apprehensive," as he put it, feelings that FedEx's retirement offer played on. Mr. Hutchison's division, no longer growing, would be pared down, the company said. 
But FedEx was offering both health coverage and a full pension, which in Mr. Hutchison's case would replace nearly half his annual salary of more than $60,000. He otherwise would have had to work another 10 years to secure that sum.
"I'm not home free and I'm not asking to be, but I have a good enough safety net now," said Mr. Hutchison, who lives in Memphis, where FedEx is based. Including his wife's salary as a teacher, he figures, "I can fall down a few times in another job and pick myself up, and my family won't starve."
Like 5,600 other unionized employees at Verizon, Steven Carney, a field technician, took the plunge although he was protected from layoffs under the Communications Workers of America's contract with the company. But at 53, after 35 years at the company, he had begun to find the pressures intolerable, he said, with workloads rising for employees in Verizon's land-line operations as the company shifted its focus toward wireless. 
Mr. Carney said that he had no expectation of landing a job that would replicate his $64,000-a-year salary, not counting overtime. But in preparation for his departure, he refinanced his mortgage to lower his payments by $400 a month and calculated that he could pocket $200,000 or more if he sold his home in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., moving with his wife to smaller quarters.
Her income from a teacher's pension is $11,000, and the severance part of his Verizon package will bring him $18,000 annually in monthly payments spread over four years. That is not enough, Mr. Carney said, not with a son in the first year of law school. (His other child, also a son, just graduated as a dentist.) Still, Mr. Carney developed a skill while at Verizon as a safety coordinator, and he hopes now to make money in that field as a consultant.
"With even a part-time job to offset some of the bills, I'll be all right," he said.
If work is scarce, however, he has his retirement settlement to fall back on. Like nearly everyone else who took the Verizon package, Mr. Carney elected a lump-sum payout. Verizon encouraged that choice, pointing out to employees that once interest rates rise from their present low levels, the pension plan will decline in value and lump sums will be lower in a future payout. 
The payoff for the company is that it ended its pension obligations for more than 20,000 employees. For Mr. Carney, the lump sum came to more than $400,000. In a pinch, he said, the interest from investing that amountat, say, 5 percent would bring his total income to $42,000 a year, apart from his wife's pension. 
"The thing that concerns me is that I am not a financial person," he said. "I've worked with my hands all my life, and to a large degree, I am at the mercy of financial planners in my calculations."
The writing on the wall at FedEx was too blunt to ignore for Bobbie Temple, 46, a senior representative in human resources at the company's overnight delivery operation, FedEx Express, where Mr. Hutchison also worked. The dot-com bust and the e-mail phenomenon have cut into demand for 24-hour delivery of documents and small packages, so FedEx is openly cutting costs. 
"It was an offer I could not refuse," said Ms. Temple, who rose through hourly jobs to a final salary of more than $50,000 a year.
She was too young to qualify for early retirement or health coverage, but took a severance offer of roughly 18 months' pay. Without children and sharing a three-bedroom home with a significant other who brings in an income as an office furniture installer, she described her needs as more modest than those of most people leaving FedEx.
"Eventually I planned to do something different, and this made it sweeter to act now, and I did," Ms. Temple said. "You don't want to become fearful of losing your job. I've never had that fear."
Martha L. Reading of North Plainfield, N.J., said she harbored that fear, and it figured in her decision to retire early from Verizon.
She was a manager of employee research, asking employees about their needs and their views of the company. At 56, she had an annual salary of $90,000. And with 24 years of service, she qualified for a normal pension, which she took as a lump sum of nearly $400,000. The severance portion of the incentive package -- $94,000 in her case -- prompted her to retire years ahead of her internal schedule.
Ms. Reading and her husband, a teacher, have adopted five children, ages 10 to 14, and she says she must work at least another decade to help support them.
"I just did not feel that with all the risks at Verizon, all the downsizings, I would be able to stay there that many years," she said. "I am not saying it would not be a possibility. I was not sure, and I thought if ever I was going to change careers, this would be the time. If I got into my 60's, it would be a lot harder."
The world of adoption fascinates Ms. Reading, and she said the severance package had given her the opportunity to work with an adoption agency, conducting seminars for couples considering adoption.
She earns $200 to $300 for each family that signs up with the agency, which means she must successfully refer about 300 families a year to earn the $70,000 that she says she needs.
That much annual income is a long shot, and if she cannot earn it, then she will hunt for work, probably in market research -- behaving, in other words, no differently from someone who has been laid off involuntarily.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Decline in Summer Tourism 

BYLINE:  By HARLAN J. LEVY

 BODY:
THE worst weather in decades, a stagnant economy and the uncertainty of the lingering Iraq war all combined to bring Connecticut's tourism industry fewer visitors and less money last summer.
 A study released last month by the State Office of Tourism found that 10.3 million tourists visited the state last summer, down 9 percent from the year before, and the money spent by tourists fell to $890 million, down 13 percent. 
 But not all the news was negative.
 "When people did come, they stayed a little longer, and they came back for multiple visits," said Edward Dombroskas, executive director of the tourism office. "No part of the state did particularly well or badly. They all had ups and downs." 
 Tourism is important, said Stanley McMillen, an economist at the University of Connecticut, because it has had a higher job growth rate than manufacturing and the finance, insurance and real estate sector and is second in output and sales growth. Tourism has been the source of more than $10 billion in annual revenues, including spin-off effects, he said. And more than 146,000 residents, almost 9 percent of the state's work force, owe their jobs to tourism. 
 Non-traditional attractions and "those properties that offered a new experience did better than the traditional attractions," Mr. Dombroskas said. "Consumers were definitely looking for something new and improved." Tourists were avoiding the major attractions," he added, "and theywere doing more wandering around, going to restaurants, spending at retail establishments, visiting historical sites, cultural sites, not necessarily the typical sites like Mystic Seaport or the aquariums."
 The attractions that could buck the overall trend and increase attendance and revenues "paid closer attention to their customers and strategically went after the kinds of people most likely to come to Connecticut and to enjoy the attraction," said John Bourget, president of Witan Intelligence Strategies of Avon, the company that did the study both this year and last year. Several successful attractions targeted the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area, Connecticut's primary target, offering packages of activities and events in a distinct geographic area of the state geared to several specific demographic groups, Mr. Bourget explained. He said most single-focus attractions that offered little that was new saw their attendance decline.
 The report shows that visitors to the state's main attractions from June through part of September averaged about three to a party and spent $653, about 9 percent less than the $721 each party spent in the summer of 2002. However, each party stayed longer -- 2.7 days per party on average -- with 46 percent staying overnight, 6 percent more than in 2002, and 14 percent staying about a week, a 34 percent increase. 
 Nationally, tourism suffered a "huge" decline, "but we didn't get hit as hard as some of the other states," Mr. Bourget said. 
 Connecticut got off easier in part because it studies market details carefully, Mr. Bourget said. "We can market more efficiently, because we understand better." 
 Traffic at Mystic Aquarium, Mystic Seaport, and the Essex steam train did not live up to state expectations, Mr. Dombroskas said, unlike the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks, Lake Compounce in Bristol, and Boats Books and Brushes with Taste, the annual three-day literary, art, maritime, and food festival at New London's waterfront in September. 
 The air museum, featuring hangars filled with historic military and nonmilitary aircraft, had a 4 percent gain in attendance after increases in each of the summer's three months, the only monitored attraction to do so.
 Michael Speciale, the museum director, said one reason was the opening of a new building on June 1, a third hangar to show a B-29 Super Fortress, the biggest bomber of World War II.
 "It's an impressive sight, and we tell a good story of how the airplane was used in the war in the Pacific," Mr. Speciale said. "We got quite a bit of publicity from that."
At Lake Compounce, business was up 14 percent for the summer season, with increases in every category, said Richard Bisi, the former marketing director, now a park consultant. 
 Group catering jumped 13 percent, Mr. Bisi said, with more than 350 companies visiting the park. Small-group business from summer camps, town recreation groups, and churches was up 10 percent. Math and science education-group business grew 16 percent. 
 "A former teacher put together six different educational programs for grades K-12, and we marketed this to teachers in Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts," Mr. Bisi said.
 The third annual Boats Books and Brushes with Taste festival, held Sept. 5, 6, and 7, brought in 110,000 to 120,000 visitors, Nancy Tyler, the event manager, said, up from 80,000 in September 2002 and 8,000 in 2001 just after Sept. 11.
 It's a brand-new festival every year, she said. "The only thing that stays the same is the harbor and the setting." 
 What stays the same for the lodging and restaurant sectors of the summer tourism market is the uncertainty born on Sept. 11, 2001, and nurtured by the shaky, if improving, economy.
 "Historically, Connecticut was sold out, but in the past couple of years, that's not the case," said Simon Flynn, executive director of the Connecticut Lodging Association as well as president of the Connecticut Restaurant Association. "There is an awful lot of competition."
 The Madison Beach Hotel -- a 35-room shoreline landmark from the early 1800's, 20 miles north of New Haven on Long Island Sound -- has felt the competition, but not during the summer.
 "In the summer we're all sold out, and that happens year after year," said Roben Bagdasarian, the co-owner. "Our weekends used to be sold out from the first of May until the end of October, but this year it didn't sell out." Also, he said, the corporate conference business was off 50 percent since the Sept. 11 attacks.
 "Hotel budgets are strained, and they have to look carefully as to whether they can hire or sustain some positions," Mr. Flynn said. "And it affects the restaurants dramatically."
 What needs to be done, he said, "is aggressive marketing, but unfortunately, the state has cut back on tourism marketing. So, making people aware of the value in Connecticut is an increasingly difficult battle." 
 Because of Connecticut's state budget deficit, lawmakers have cut the Office of Tourism's budget from $4.22 million for fiscal year 2003 to $3.96 million for fiscal year 2004, which ends June 30. Also, the 11 regional tourism districts were consolidated into five, and their total promotions budget was cut in half.
 "The return on investment is staggering," Mr. Bourget said. "So if you're going to cut, you don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg." "
 Tourism spins off $51 for every $1 the state spends on marketing Connecticut, Mr. Dombroskas said.
 The state will no longer advertise in the Boston and Philadelphia markets, Mr. Dombroskas said, although they recently began sending more tourists to Connecticut. Instead, he said, the state will concentrate on metropolitan New York. 
 One bright spot is evidence from British tour operators and airlines that British tourists will resume travel to Connecticut and the rest of New England next summer after largely abandoning the region in 2002.
 The United States is "on sale," said Paul Wade of London, a travel writer. "The dollar is at an all-time low, and you get 25 percent more in dollars for a British pound than a year or so ago. At the same time, Europe has gone up in price."
 By the end of 2004, said Robert Haynes of the London-based tour operator America Direct, "we are fairly confident that British visitor levels will be above what they were before 9/11."

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Luring Movie Stars To Suffolk County

BYLINE:  By DAVID EVERITT

DATELINE: Port Jefferson 

 BODY:
IF Michelle Isabelle-Stark, Suffolk County's new director of the Office of Cultural Affairs, has her way, the beaches and towns of the Hamptons and the North Fork, and other county landmarks, will become familiar to moviegoers worldwide. That is because she is aggressively trying to attract filmmakers here for location shooting.
 Although the county saw a burst of film activity in the 1980's -- for example, scenes in "Wall Street," starring Michael Douglas, were filmed in the county -- there has never been a steady influx of movie projects. Ms. Isabelle-Stark's plan is to apply a more business-oriented strategy than has been used. 
 "I approach the arts and film as infrastructures and as important economic contributors," she said in an interview at a restaurant here, where she lives. "It's been demonstrated that having a vibrant art and cultural scene in a community is a competitive advantage to attracting and retaining a knowledge economy." 
Ms. Isabelle-Stark, 46, was appointed to her post in May. Her responsibilities include running the Suffolk County Film Office and the county's cultural arts program, which administers grants and promotes programs at local organizations like the Heckscher Museum of Art and the Cinema Arts Center.
A Michigan native who moved to Hicksville in her teens, Ms. Isabelle-Stark trained as a dancer at the State University of New York at Brockport. She also has an M.B.A. from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. She worked at the Small Business Development Center at Stony Brook, helping develop businesses from technological endeavors at the university. She was also an assistant to Mayor Jeanne Garant of Port Jefferson, where she helped inaugurate the annual Dickens Festival, an event held at Christmastime.
Ms. Isabelle-Stark's first priority, she said, is to market Suffolk County film locations over the Web. Previously, the film office relied on conventional mail.
"If I get calls from California, they're not going to wait to get pictures of locations in the mail," she said. "They want to be able to go to a Web site and pull up images in real time."
At this point, the film office is e-mailing location shots to production companies upon request, she said, but she hopes to have a complete location database up and running "within the year."
She also wants to address some economic disincentives faced by filmmakers in Suffolk County. For one, the county lies outside a film-union designation known as "the zone," which means that crews must be paid a higher overtime rate to work here than in areas closer to New York City.
In addition, government incentives and dollar exchange make Canada, in particular, attractive for moviemakers.
To compete more aggressively, Ms. Isabelle-Stark said, she would like to see county and local authorities "eliminate some film fees, offer rebates, eliminate local taxes."
Another obstacle is the sometimes confusing process of obtaining permits from the county's various jurisdictions. Complicating the process is the desire of local officials to keep beaches clear for visitors in summer.
"Some towns have fairly restrictive regulations, so it's helpful to know who you can talk to," said Lyn Pinezich, location manager for "The Forgotten," a science-fiction thriller starring Julianne Moore, which recently filmed in Caumsett State Park in Lloyd Neck and along the Hampton Bays coastline. "There are all these different kinds of towns, villages, hamlets." 
Ms. Isabelle-Stark said she wanted to bring order to this situation. "I want to have one person in each jurisdiction to be a point person, so when a request comes in, I can e-mail them because they know their area better than I do," she said. 
In some cases, this coordination between county and locality is something new. "Before I heard from Michelle, I didn't know that a county film department existed," said Sundy Schermeyer, Southampton's assistant superintendent of parks and recreation.
Ms. Isabelle-Stark also wants to spread word of the charms of the county, which she said had enormous potential as a location, and not just for movies set in the area, like the recent "Something's Gotta Give," starring Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.
The county could "replicate so many kinds of locations," she explained, including New England-type villages and European-style vineyards. Among its attractions, she said, are Centerport's Vanderbilt Mansion, Oheka Castle in Huntington, and Theodore Roosevelt Park in Montauk. "Riverhead is to me the great untold story," she added. "It's got architecture from every period. It looks like Lowell, Massachusetts. It's got rivers, it's got farms, it's got wineries."
The film office has advertised in "Variety" and "Hollywood Reporter," and she said she planned more advertising. 
Ms. Isabelle-Stark replaced Chris Cooke, who led the office for 12 years, until last January; repeated efforts to locate him were unsuccessful. But local film-industry professionals say there was more filmmaking in the county in 2003 than in previous years.
"This past year has been busier for filmmaking in Suffolk than it has been for a long time," said Beth Kushnick of East Hampton, vice president of the Set Decorators Society of America and a nominee for the Suffolk County Film Commission, which advises the county executive on local filmmaking. Under the new executive, Steve Levy, the commission is to get new members and is scheduled to hold a strategy meeting next month.
But statistics are hard to pin down, partly because local records do not include movies that did not require permits because they were shot on private property, and partly because neither the county nor the New York State Governor's Office for Motion Picture and Television Development has a full record of 2002 productions. 
Nine movies registered on the administrative radar of the county's film office last year. They were already committed to the county when Ms. Isabelle-Stark took over, but she was involved in finalizing arrangements for three movies shot late in the year: "The Forgotten"; the remake of "The Manchurian Candidate," starring Denzel Washington, which filmed in a Centerport home overlooking Northport harbor; and "Loverboy," directed by Kevin Bacon, which shot at Babylon's Oak Beach.
David Martin, location manager for "Loverboy," found the film office to be "very helpful," especially in steering him to the correct jurisdiction to gain permits. But Roger Majkowski, writer and director of "The Sound," a low-budget independent feature about a sound that makes men not want to have sex, criticized the film office's performance, saying he had difficulty getting permission to film from local officials. He, and Ms. Isabelle-Stark, said local officials were put off by the subject. She said the film office was not asked to get involved early enough; he said, "I think she had plenty of time."
The hope is that the year's string of projects, which overall seem to have gone smoothly, will give momentum to the efforts to lure filmmakers here, Ms. Kushnick said.
Ms. Isabelle-Stark compares the film business to other industries. "There's no reason why we can't come up with a plan for a county production cluster in the same way one's been developed for biotech and software," she said.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Foreigners in Strange Lands, But at Home in the World

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

DATELINE: New Brunswick 

 BODY:
AS a nation of immigrants, the United States is full of ethnic organizations devoted to the memory of distant homelands. Often staffed by volunteers, and reliant on donations, these groups keep cultural ties alive, fostering a sense of community in what must sometimes seem a baffling new home.
 So it is with the American Hungarian Foundation, whose headquarters is a fairly brutal-looking yellow concrete building on New Brunswick's downtown fringe. Here the group supports student and scholar exchanges, publications and academic programs, and holds exhibitions in a musty if well-appointed gallery at the far end of the building. 
 This month, the gallery is host to a show of about 70 19th- and early 20th-century Hungarian paintings, and a few works on paper, from the collection of Nicholas Salgo, a former United States ambassador to Hungary. The collection is part of the Salgo Trust for Education, located in an old mansion near Port Washington, Long Island.
 The exhibition's title, "Everywhere a Foreigner and Yet Nowhere a Stranger," is drawn from the diary of the 19th-century Hungarian painter Baron Laszlo Mednyanszky. It reflects the show's central theme: that Hungarian art of the late 19th century was different from, and yet a part of, wider currents of European art.
 The dual character of Hungarian art is most apparent in the landscape paintings, which account for almost half the show. Looking at the works, you find the artists seeking formal inspiration in the artistic styles of Western Europe, while maintaining some identification with their local landscape, cultural customs and the ambience of Eastern Europe.
 Karoly Ferenczy, Jozsef Rippl-Ronai and Geza Farago, for instance, adapted the high-keyed palette and stylistic traits of French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism to the Hungarian landscape. Farago's "Sunny Day," circa 1910, a charmingly poetic, light-filled rural scene, owes much to Claude Monet, and, going a little further back, Camille Corot.
 "Sunny Day" more or less sets the pattern for early modern painting in Hungary; the artists did it well, but late. Rippl-Ronai's bright and lyrical "The House at Kortvelyes," circa 1910, reveals the artist dabbling in Post-Impressionism, while the colors of Bela Kadar's undated "Untitled Landscape" are reminiscent of the Fauvists.
 Among the more academic painters of the period, Mihaly Munkacsy, whose original name was Michael Lieb, stands out. Born in 1844, a member of Hungary's German-speaking minority, he traveled to Dusseldorf and then Munich in the 1860's where he learned to paint in the prevailing realist-naturalist style. In 1872, he moved to Paris, where he married a titled widow and painted religious and historical subjects.
 "Hay Harvest," circa 1886-87, ranks among Munkacsy's more folkloric works. It depicts a typical rural scene -- indentured peasants harvesting hay; the women, their white kerchief's untied for ventilation, raking the hay into bundles; the men loading it onto a horse-drawn cart. A well-dressed, aristocratic lady supervises the peasants, while keeping an eye on her two children cavorting in a nearby mound of hay.
 No doubt a private commission, "Hay Harvest" reflects the aristocratic patronage at the heart of the cultural revival in Hungary in the 19th century. This was also a period of great economic prosperity and political power, with Hungary an equal partner in the Habsburg Empire. It was a revival that was to be abruptly halted with the outbreak of World War I, after which Hungary was forced to cede much of its territory. 
 Aside from landscape painting, portraiture was Hungary's other main art tradition. This is not reflected in the show, which contains a few figure studies and half a dozen pleasant but mostly derivative portraits. 
 The exception is Pal Szinyei-Merse's "Mother with Two Children" (1868). A gifted piece of plein-air painting, it shows a young mother in a taffeta dress sitting on a picnic blanket with a baby, her elder daughter readying to present a hatful of flowers. Although reminiscent of 18th-century pastoral painting, it has an idle charm that pleases. It is an image of a world long gone.
 "Everywhere a Foreigner and Yet Nowhere a Stranger" is at the American Hungarian Foundation, 300 Somerset Street, New Brunswick, through April 25. Information (732)846-5777.

HEADLINE: BY THE WAY; 
Paying Attention to Eating

BYLINE:  By Christine Contillo

 BODY:
When the air is cold and the landscape bare, gardeners get out their catalogues and start planning their springtime activities. If they can't be in their fields, they want to gather and talk about them. 
The Northeast Organic Farming Association of New Jersey will hold a winter conference, "Greener Fields: Opportunity and Challenge of Organic Agriculture," on Jan. 31 at Cook College Center at Rutgers University. One of the topics, "Exploring the Small Farm Dream," is a short version of the sold-out, four-part class held last fall at Mercer County Community College, and it will be repeated in April and May.
 The organic farming association, based in Pennington, is the premier agricultural organization in New Jersey. Karen Anderson, executive director, says that the conference is not just for professionals; the association hopes to attract a cross-section of attendees. "We're all stakeholders in the food system," she said. "We all eat. Some of us just pay more attention." 
 It's tough to run a successful small farm in New Jersey. Land and help are expensive, weather is unpredictable, and the economy is still shaky. But it is an attraction to many people, ranging from financially challenged property owners in a search of a tax break to those who have made money on Wall Street and long for a field that will let them feel more grounded (Ms. Anderson's pun).
The conference, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., is meant to give would-be farmers some tough questions and allow them see what it might take to make their dream a success. Seventeen sessions will be presented, including selling at farmers markets, organic viticulture, financial planning for farmers, e-marketing and cultivation equipment.

HEADLINE: RESEARCH; 
Near the Hudson, Studying Earth

BYLINE:  By JAMIE MALANOWSKI

DATELINE: PALISADES, N.Y. 

 BODY:
FEW people are aware of it, but nestled atop behind a woodsy screen along Route 9W, right at the cusp of that imaginary line where New York becomes New Jersey, lies the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a division of Columbia University.
 Lamont, as all the insiders shorthand it, is chartered with the portfolio of studying everything between the core of the earth and the upper levels of its atmosphere. Its areas of interest are broad: they vary from the composition of the skeletons of microscopic sea creatures that perished tens of millions of years ago, to the question of how human life can avoid being extinguished if the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should continue to rise. 
 Speaking from an office perched at the edge of the Palisades, with the rain-washed Hudson over his shoulder, Dr. Michael Purdy, Lamont's director, laid out the themes that connect the labors of more than 130 Ph.D.-level researchers and the approximately 350 projects they are conducting. "First is the climate system," he said. "There's a whole group of phenomena that we're studying, El Nino and other systems that change our climate in subtle ways, to the steady and substantial increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. 
"Second is the dynamics of the solid earth. The earth is moving always, at different rates and speeds, generating earthquakes. The best work on understanding how earthquakes actually function is done here.
"The third theme is earth surface processes -- the interaction between the climate and the rest of the earth. The Hudson River, for example, is one such surface. It's remarkable how little is known."
Dr. Purdy, who now lives in Nanuet, is a native of Britain, and he still speaks with an accent that any character actor who aspires to be cast in a Harry Potter movie would happily copy. He utters that last phrase not with exhaustion, but with excitement. 
Dr. Purdy clearly loves his science; in the first part of his career, as a postdoctoral scholar at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution studying the earth's crust beneath the ocean, he was part of so many research expeditions that he spent, all told, more than three years at sea. "The reason why this business is so wonderful," he said, investing the word with inspirational conviction, "the reason why everybody here is in a state of constant joy about everything we do, is because it is a very young science. So there are just beautiful plums waiting to be discovered. This isn't high energy physics, a very mature science that's been picked at by lots of brilliant people for many decades. There's a lot of basic physics that we're just discovering. We're constantly learning how things really work."
The Earth Observatory sits on Torrey Cliff, just south of Harriman State Park, and offers the same steep slopes and splendid views and a sense of seclusion. The campus is dotted with a number of fairly anonymous one- and two-story buildings of the 1960's and 1970's that house Lamont's divisions, with their offices and labs; there is little doubt that the money here is supporting science, not architecture. Torrey Cliff was once the weekend estate of Florence Lamont, the widow of Thomas W. Lamont, the chairman of J.P. Morgan. In 1948, she donated the land to Columbia, and the property might have had a rather ordinary fate had not the Geology Department been so eager to get its sensitive seismological equipment away from the I.R.T. local. Two decades later, a grant endowing the faculty from the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation brought their name into the title.
One of the earliest and continuing projects that researchers undertook was crossing the globe in a research vessels, boring holes in the floors of the seas, and collecting core samples of the earth below. Lamont has a warehouse containing about 18,000 of these samples. 
On one tour recently, a visitor asked about a dark smudge, thinner than a pencil-width, three inches from the tip of a core taken from the Mediterranean.
"That's Vesuvius," the guide replied.
The science can often seem dauntingly esoteric. "We work very hard at making what we do here sound boring," Dr. Purdy said dryly. "It's another of our great skills." But Lamont's work is deeply practical.
The observatory is part of Columbia's Earth Institute, a relatively new interdisciplinary group that connects political scientists, public health specialists, other social scientists and economics at the university to the researchers at Lamont. This effort stems from the recognition that increasingly, the problems of the earth are too complex to be addressed with one approach.
"For example, it is possible to say that there is a very high chance of a magnitude 7 earthquake occurring within 10 miles of the center of Istanbul within the next 30 years," Dr. Purdy said. "We're really pretty good at being able to say that. But the real question is what's the mayor of Istanbul supposed to do? One of the really important things we're trying to do is make that step between defining a hazard, the economically feasible ways of mitigating them and the steps one needs to take politically to achieve them."
Take global warming, for instance. "We have to start thinking about it," Dr. Purdy said. "We don't believe we can change industry on a global scale in a few decades so that everybody stops burning fossil fuel. We feel we've almost got to accept the fact there's going to be this vast increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. So what are we going to do about it?
"The biggest fear is that it's going to cause a perturbation in the climate system that would flip us into some different climate state, which would be disastrous. So what we're beginning to think about here is doing something proactive, and that involves removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Can we do that? Maybe; the world authority on thinking about how to get CO2 out of the atmosphere is here. But if we could, where would you put it? Perhaps you could drill deep holes into the earth, and pump the CO2 into the earth, and fill the pore spaces between the rocks, and over time, have it chemically change with the rock into something inert. We have the leading experts in drilling and measuring very deep holes in the bottom of the ocean, kilometers into the earth, so we're seeing if this can be done."
Lamont feels it has a serious obligation to take its work before the community. Every October it is host to an open house, with exhibitions for children and lay people; more than 4,000 people attended last fall's event. Lamont is also host to a public lecture series in the spring, where some of its scientists discuss their work and its ramifications. Information about this year's series, which will begin in late March, will soon be posted on the observatory's Web site (www.ldeo.columbia.edu).
"Educating the public, improving the quality of basic science education -- we take our role in that very seriously," Dr. Purdy said. "It's going to be really important for folks to understand much more about the environment than currently, so they can make good decisions about their future."

HEADLINE: Facing New Challenges 

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER 

 BODY:
EACH day at 4 a.m., as the lights come on in the back of Nino International Bakery, Robinson Plasencia begins another day. After fleeing from Peru 15 years ago when vandals destroyed his family's business there, Mr. Plasencia struggled to make his way in a new country, first in Queens and later in this bustling village of 28,000 people on Long Island Sound. 
 In the early days, when he was new to the United States, he barely eked out a living. But now, his business is thriving. One recent morning, as customers streamed in to buy coffee and pastries like alfores (Peruvian cookies) and turron de donas (Portuguese rolls), Mr. Plasencia greeted them with the confidence of a successful businessman. "Everything is fresh," he told visitors. "Try some!" 
 Mr. Plasencia's story is a new one, and yet an old one here. For more than a century, Port Chester has served as a magnet to immigrants, first Irish and Italian. Now, over the past two decades, Port Chester has turned into something of an Ellis Island for Hispanic immigrants, a place of first refuge for people who are lured not just by the harbor it has given to their friends and relatives, but also by the village's proximity to affluent communities like Greenwich, Rye and Harrison, where jobs are plentiful working on gardens and properties and caring for children. 
In this way, the new Port Chester has drawn immigrant families into the service economy, much as the village offered manufacturing jobs from the 1920's until the 1960's in factories like the one here that made BeechNut LifeSavers, which offered work to several generations of immigrants. 
Looking out of the plate-glass window in the front of his new quarters on Poningo Street, Mr. Plasencia, who became a United States citizen in 1995, pointed across the way to several recent immigrants from Central and South America. "When I first came here, I was lonely too, like they are," he said. 
Close to half of the village's population is now Hispanic, according to the 2000 United States Census. And advocacy groups suggest that the percentage is higher because the census likely missed illegal immigrants. 
In some regards, Mr. Plasencia and others who were drawn to Port Chester in the late 1980's have been more fortunate than the newer arrivals from Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala and Mexico. Many of the earlier Latino immigrants were able to obtain legal papers and steady employment, and they have set down roots, raised families and found good jobs. 
It is a far different, and less hopeful, story for the newcomers, many of them here illegally. Mayor Gerald Logan recently estimated that 3,500 undocumented Latinos live here, a 2.5-square-mile village next to the Byram River. Crossing the Mexican border illegally, they make their way to Port Chester, meeting up with relatives and friends who settled here earlier. 
Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks two years ago, United States immigration laws have become more strict, and most of the recent group of undocumented immigrants from Central and South America are unlikely to ever obtain legal papers, said Ann Blanchfield, a lawyer at the Westchester Hispanic Coalition, a nonprofit social services organization in White Plains. 
"If they stay, they'll have to live under the radar forever," she said. "They'll cobble a life together working in restaurants, hotels, country clubs, wherever they can. But if they get injured or sick, they're not eligible for any benefits, so they're sort of stuck in a no-man's land."
That could change, however, if President Bush's proposal on Monday to overhaul the nation's immigration laws is adopted by Congress. Under the proposal, an undocumented worker could apply for temporary worker status in the United States, with employee benefits, like minimum wage and due process, accorded to those legally employed. 
Ms. Blanchfield said the Hispanic Coalition helps immigrants get United States taxpayer identification numbers and pay taxes, even if they are undocumented. "It's a goodwill gesture on their part," she said. "It shows they want to comply with the system."
Although there have been complaints in other Westchester communities where Latinos have settled, like Mount Kisco and Tarrytown, Ms. Blanchfield said she had heard few objections to the presence of illegal immigrants in Port Chester. "Mostly, employers and others call up to see what they can do to help," she said. 
Ms. Blanchfield said that although employers undoubtedly take a risk in hiring undocumented immigrants, they constitute the only available labor force willing to take the lowest-paying jobs.
ESPECIALLY vulnerable are day workers like Miguel, 26, a recent immigrant from Guatemala City who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he feared that giving his name would make it easy for immigration authorities to find him. Ms. Blanchfield said Miguel and other day workers are sometimes prey to employers who hire them but fail to pay them. 
"It's happened to many of my friends," said Miguel, who was waiting for work recently outside of Our Lady of the Rosary Church. While he decides whether to stay or return to his country, Miguel spends his days at the Don Bosco Center, a soup kitchen and job placement center for immigrants sponsored by the church, a religious and social services institution in the village. 
When the weather is good, Miguel and the other men wait outside for work. When it rains, they go inside, playing dominos at one of the long cafeteria-style tables in the center, socializing with the other men and participating in the English as a Second Language classes offered by the church. 
Inside the church offices one recent afternoon, the Rev. Timothy Ploch, a priest from the Salesian order, a Roman Catholic group dedicated chiefly to education and missionary work, mused on Port Chester as a small Ellis Island. 
"The main difference is that at Ellis Island, the immigrants are legal," Father Ploch said. "In our village these days, most of the new arrivals cross without papers." 
The immigrants rely on the church not only for work placement but also for social services, some food and supplies like diapers. "They trust the church," Father Ploch said, "because they're sure we would never turn them in." 
Our Lady of the Rosary Church also runs clothing drives for the needier immigrants and holds group showers several times a year for expectant mothers, most of them Latinos, who cannot afford to buy supplies for their infants. 
Before the church's Don Bosco Center offered sanctuary to the day workers, many of them waited for employment on street corners throughout the village. But Port Chester officials, church workers and representatives of the Westchester Hispanic Coalition decided several years ago that it would be more effective to acknowledge the illegal immigrants' presence and their need for work by establishing a central hiring location, said Gerald Logan, the village's mayor. 
"If you go by the letter of the law, they really shouldn't be hired at all, but if they don't get work, they'll become homeless," said Mr. Logan, 66, a former financial executive who is in his second two-year term. 
Mayor Logan is also concerned about many of the immigrants' living conditions. "They stay in overcrowded apartments and pay high rents just to plant their feet on the ground here," he said. "What money they have left, they send home." Immigrants who were interviewed for this article said they had no alternative but to pay the rents the landlords demanded, and not to complain about the often run-down conditions. 
Joseph P. Cannavo, president of Great American Development, an owner and developer of real estate here, said, "It's not the landlords, it's the tenants who bring in the extra people."
Mr. Cannavo said landlords often don't know that additional people are living in the units, and when they suspect that might be the case and inquire, the tenants claim that relatives are temporarily visiting. Mr. Cannavo also said he charged market rates for apartments and it was not true that overcrowding was caused by exorbitant rents.
When Port Chester's police chief, Joseph Krzeminski, was growing up here in the 1950's and 60's, the vast majority of the newcomers were Polish, Italian and Irish, he said. 
"The village has always been a place for immigrants," said Mr. Krzeminski, who as a boy lived in a five-family house owned by his Italian grandfather. 
Like other immigrants of that time, Mr. Krzeminski's grandfather purchased a house and rented out apartments to relatives and friends from Europe. Because the rents were low, the newer residents were able to save money and buy their own houses, in turn. 
Now, though, most of Port Chester's multifamily houses are owned by absentee landlords who charge high rents, the police chief said. Troubled by fire and health hazards created by overcrowding in the apartments, Mr. Krzeminski reports the worst cases to the Port Chester Building Department. 
The police chief said he is also concerned with the drunkenness that occurs at night and on weekends among some of the newer immigrants, most of whom are here alone, away from their families. Mr. Krzeminski said some immigrants have been attacked at night when they are out alone. According to the police department, Port Chester recorded 57 robbery-assault cases in 2002. Of those, 54 involved Latinos and took place on the street. In 2003, there were 49 robbery-assaults with 44 involving Latinos and 34 taking place on the street. 
Lt. Jeff Hartrey of the Port Chester police said the perpetrators of such crimes against Latinos know that their victims often don't put their money in the bank and carry their cash with them. 
Chief Krzeminski said assailants also know that illegal immigrants are unlikely to file a formal complaint.
Mr. Krzeminski said some changes in the village since he was a boy have not been for the better, a sentiment shared by Frances C. Nugent, who is the city clerk for Rye. 
Born 83 years ago in Port Chester, which is part of Rye, Mrs. Nugent said she misses walking at night with her children to the downtown area for ice cream cones. Fretting about the impersonality of the large chain discount stores about to be built in that section of the village, she said: "Whether the new plans will be good for Port Chester remains to be seen. I liked it better when all the shopkeepers knew our names." 
Other things have changed, too. 
The bakery is on one of this village's many side streets, where small businesses like coin laundries and bodegas share working-class neighborhoods with modest multifamily homes. Nino International Bakery moved last year from Port Chester's more densely populated downtown section, where a $140 million urban redevelopment project is under way. A 15-screen movie theater, a Super Stop & Shop, and several big-box retailers, among other businesses, are scheduled to open in the downtown area in the next 18 months. 
Gregg Wasser, a principal with the Bethpage, Long Island-based G&S Investors, said his company's plans for The Waterfront, as the project is known, will benefit the village, which he described as a "region that is under-retailed."
But plans for The Waterfront are proceeding slowly and not without controversy. Since the warehouse club retailer Costco built a 140,000-square-foot store more than a year ago alongside the river, no new retail construction has taken place. 
Some residents, like the mayor, whowelcome new development, said they were worried the developer wouldn't finish the project. 
Mr. Wasser said that he first had to complete relocation efforts for displaced businesses and deal with legal opposition to eminent domain efforts associated with The Waterfront. The state Court of Appeals refused to hear appeals last summer by four merchants whose buildings were acquired for the project by Port Chester two years ago, and the demolition phase is almost finished. Mr. Wasser said construction is to begin shortly, with some retailers expected to open for business as early as this summer. 
IN response to critics like Mrs. Nugent, the city clerk, who fear the loss of the village's character, Mr. Wasser said some old storefronts from the first half of the 20th century will be retained. "We're not razing all of the old," he said. "When something is there for 60 or 70 years, you don't throw it all away, because you can't duplicate it." 
At the local public schools, administrators said they must tailor their instruction to address the needs of the children from legal and illegal immigrants. In the latter group, fewer children speak or read English well, and there are more health problems. 
Of the 3,527 students enrolled in the district's six schools (four elementary schools for grades kindergarten through 5, a middle school for grades 6 though 8, and a high school), 65.3 percent are Hispanic, said Dr. Charles Coletti, superintendent of schools. Ten percent are African American, 23.9 percent are white, and 0.8 percent are Asian. 
Dr. Ellen Santiago, principal of Edison Elementary School, said that one-third of the students at the grade schools need assistance with English. In two of the elementary schools, as much as 80 percent of the students receive free or reduced-price lunches, which "indicates the high level of economic need in the community," she said.Because many parents work long hours and hold several jobs, the schools open at 7:35 a.m. and offer special-help classes until 6 p.m., Dr. Santiago said. 
Dr. Coletti said that despite the challenges, 95 percent of 4th graders were at or above the competency level for math on state mandated performance tests last year, as were 91 percent of 8th graders. 
English language scores, though not as high, showed that 85 percent of 4th graders and 70 percent of 8th graders were at competency level or above, he said. Of the 214 students in last year's high school graduating class, 83 percent went on to college, half of those to four-year institutions and the other half to two-year community colleges. 
"Many of our students can't afford a four-year college, so they go to Westchester Community College and then transfer on," Dr. Coletti said. "They're often the first generation in their family to attend college.
"But then that has been the American way for succeeding waves of immigrants. Higher education always has been the fastest route up the economic and social ladder. In the early 20th century, it was Eastern Europeans. These days, it's the Latinos."

Wampum Came First
Port Chester Timeline, Since European Settlers Arrived
1660: John Coe, Peter Disbrow and Thomas Studwell purchase land on Manursing Island from the Siwanoy American Indians, for 8 coats, 7 shirts and 15 fathom of wampum. 
1663: First group of settlers moves onto the mainland, some going to Poningo Neck (now in the city of Rye), and others to Saw Pit (which was named for its saw pits, where logs for the shipping industry were cut. Saw Pit later became Port Chester.) Over time, the American Indians are forced off the land by the settlers.
1798: The merchant Jared Peck operates a brisk shipping trade along the Byram River, transporting local grain and crops to New York City, establishing several mills in Saw Pit. 
1837: Saw Pit becomes the village of Port Chester, officially being incorporated 31 years later.
1879: First regular steamboat is placed in service, making three trips a week to New York City.
1884: Port Chester Water Company establishes supply system for village. 
Early 1900's: Waves of European immigrants, drawn by manufacturing industry, begin to arrive.
1950's: Among Port Chester's major manufacturers: the Ernest Simons Manufacturing Company, which made sheets and pillow cases; the Russell Burdsall and Ward Bolt and Nut Company; Fruit of the Loom, Abendroth Brothers, which manufactured stoves and furnaces; Beech-Nut LifeSavers; Arnold Bakers; and the Empire Brush Company. 
1970's: Many of Port Chester's factories begin to move south or west; the downtown retail sector struggles.
1984: LifeSavers shuts down its North Main Street factory after 64 years, the last major manufacturer to leave the village.
Late 1990's: The developer Gregg Wasser develops plans for the Waterfront at Port Chester, a shopping area of big-box discount retailers along the Byram River. Meanwhile, Latino-owned stores and restaurants open along the struggling Main Street.

HEADLINE: The World: Banished Bicycles; 
China's Car Culture Hits Some Potholes

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
IT as a milestone of sorts when Shanghai, China's biggest city, banned bicycles on its largest avenues last month, but also a belated acknowledgment of a change that has already transformed many large cities in China. Bicycles have gone from carrying more than 70 percent of travelers in Shanghai as recently as 1990 to from 15 to 17 percent now, according to the Shanghai Urban Planning Bureau. 
 China's four-wheeled future is on gleaming display at Shanghai's auto dealerships. At a Buick showroom fitted with soaring, plate-glass windows and a modern interior that looks a little like a coffee shop with cars, Yang Yi, 31, recently went shopping for his first car after a lifetime of public transportation, bicycles and walking. He was a little nervous as he carefully studied a deep blue compact model, and watched attentively when the salesman demonstrated how to check the dipstick. 
 "My friends showed me how to do it," he said. "But I wanted the salesperson to give me a professional knowledge of how to examine it."
 Mr. Yang, a wine salesman in an increasingly cosmopolitan city, with a population that now exceeds 20 million, said he needed the car for work and to go driving with his wife on weekends. Also, he said, most of his friends were buying cars. 
Automobile sales in China, which reached two million last year, are growing at an annual rate of more than 50 percent. The growth of private car ownership has brought with it a car culture that increasingly resembles the American one, but with even worse traffic jams, especially in Beijing. Downtown parking spaces have become precious. 
Brand consciousness is so strong that people buy fake hood ornaments of luxury cars like Mercedes to put on domestically manufactured models. Chinese car owners even show a very American resistance to carpooling.
 "People here are exactly like in the United States -- they want to be independent," said Bernd Leissner, president of Volkswagen Asia-Pacific, the largest foreign automaker in China. "If you look on the highways, they are all driving alone. It's stupid, but they do it."
 Shanghai's decision to restrict bicycle access on major thoroughfares is especially noteworthy because city leaders have been more cautious than elsewhere about relying on cars. Wu Jiang, the city's deputy director of urban planning, said that while the city has only three subway lines now, five more are under construction and nine more are planned, a network intended to give the city 20 percent more miles of track than New York City. 
But developers in Shanghai, as in virtually every big Chinese city, are erecting rows of apartment buildings on the outskirts, creating a new commuter class of people who prefer cars to mass transit.
Shanghai's main avenues must be able to accommodate these people, Mr. Wu said. Bicyclists here, and in other big cities, have had to move to the smaller streets and alleys, which honeycomb the older sections of China's cities, to get where they're going. 
The switch from bicycles to cars is having serious health consequences. China has seven of the world's 10 most polluted cities, according to the World Health Organization, and pollution from cars has been rising quickly even as regulators have had some success in discouraging people from burning coal in their homes for heat and cooking. Mixing cars and bicycles in traffic is also deadly: bicycles account for three-quarters of all traffic accidents, Mr. Wu said.
In a country with an average income per person of $1,000, relatively few bicyclists can dream of affording a car, even though tiny models with minimal safety equipment and low-powered engines are available for less than $5,000. Bus service is excellent, but becoming slower as cars clog the main roads, according to a recent Chinese traffic study.
Still, after two decades of rapid economic growth, more and more Chinese are becoming sufficiently prosperous to buy their own cars, and see no need to forgo the comfort and status that comes with owning one.
"I wouldn't spend the money," Mr. Yang said. "I'd save it if I weren't expecting better times."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Terror Policy: Between Fear and Freedom

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
IN the days of relative calm before the nation went to "code orange" last month, Asa Hutchinson, the Bush administration's point man for border protection, was being briefed once a day on whatever terrorism threats were lurking.
 But the anxiety level ratcheted up substantially in mid-December when intelligence officials began picking up ominous tidbits indicating that a big attack might be in the works. Once the country went to orange, or high alert, on Dec. 21, Mr. Hutchinson's daily updates became almost hourly. Everything from the status of grounded Air France flights to suspicious passenger names and fragments of classified terror data flew past his desk. 
 "It's all been a little bit surreal, just because of the level of intensity we've seen in these last few weeks and the urgency of it and the drama as it unfolds," said Mr. Hutchinson, an under secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. "There's a constant pressure mentally because you realize people's lives are at issue -- not just their safety, but their convenience when you have hundreds of people sitting on a runway for hours."
The events of the last three weeks -- the code orange alert, grounded planes, fighter plane escorts, warnings of hijackings and, on Friday, a stand-down to a nationwide code yellow -- have been a jolting reminder for many Americans about their own fragile sense of security. 
Indeed, in a war perhaps unlike any other the United States has ever fought, waged largely on its own turf against an enemy that is invisible and without a state, the quandary Mr. Hutchinson faces is one the entire country has wrestled with in the last few weeks: How far can America go to make itself feel safe again? And how much are Americans willing to give up in the way of freedoms and convenience to get there?
For every new border protection program -- like the fingerprinting of many foreign visitors, initiated last week -- civil libertarians and Arab-American groups express concern about ethnic profiling. For every dire government warning about the threat of terrorism, skeptical allies raise questions about the strength of the intelligence the United States has used to justify its concerns. And for every plane grounded by the threat of terrorism, travelers or airline officials want to know who is going to foot the bill. 
A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in fact, placed the cost of the stepped-up security for the code orange alert at a billion dollars a week. Tom Ridge, the secretary for homeland security, said he believes the final cost will end up being much lower than that, but he acknowledged that the potential toll on people day to day is a real concern. 
"We always want to put safety first, but we also want to minimize the inconvenience," he said last week in moving the country back down to a yellow alert.
The last three weeks have seen a spasm of aggressive initiatives by the Bush administration to secure the borders and help quell rising public concerns. Officials issued an emergency order demanding that foreign carriers put armed marshals on planes, if necessary. They sent military fighter planes to escort overseas flights thought to be at risk. 
They began fingerprinting and photographing tens of thousands of foreign visitors. They picked three companies to develop military antimissile technology to protect airliners. And they gave local police forces more than 1,000 radiation detection devices to help spot possible threats at events over the holidays, like the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans and the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
The result, administration officials said, is that the public should rest easier knowing the country is safer from terrorists today than it was before Sept. 11, 2001. 
But not everyone is convinced. In a report released Thursday by the World Economic Forum and Gallup International, a majority of Americans surveyed -- 53 percent -- said they feel the country is less safe today than it was 10 years ago.
 "What I see doesn't give me any sense of comfort," said Charles G. Slepian, an aviation security specialist who is chief executive officer of the Foreseeable Risk Analysis Center, a private group in New York.
 "What I see is an admission that the government doesn't trust the security measures we have, and we've had to start doing things like grounding planes and denying landing rights because we're unprepared for the threats we've seen the last few weeks," he said. 
If there is a sense of skittishness on the part of counterterrorism officials, it is because they say the threats are both real and growing. In the nightmares they see, the next big attack on American soil could come from almost anywhere: a hijacked international airliner crashed into a power plant or a landmark; a radiological "dirty bomb" detonated on a downtown street; a crude nuclear device smuggled into a port; or perhaps a crop duster loaded with dangerous chemicals.
American officials regard Al Qaeda as a foe that is as crafty as it is dangerous. Expeditions in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, for instance, revealed translations of American newspaper articles that discussed security vulnerabilities in federal government buildings. And Al Qaeda has proven resilient as well, with its agents suspected in a series of recent attacks despite the capture of numerous leaders. 
 To combat the threat, American intelligence has become increasingly aggressive in collecting bits of terrorism information from around the world -- eavesdropping on suspected extremists, checking e-mail, assessing trends. The aim, officials say, is to avoid the types of missed warning signs that preceded Sept. 11.
The more information that is developed, the more skittish officials are likely to become. With the United States pumping an additional $41 billion into counterterrorism and homeland security this year, its efforts have no doubt produced a surge in threat reports for officials to assess -- the same type of reports that led the Bush administration to raise alert levels last month. 
But some critics wonder whether the whole process has become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, with an apparatus that has an incentive to report terrorist threats, based on solid information or not.
"Fear is a tough thing to combat," said Timothy Edgar, an American Civil Liberties Union official who believes some of the Bush administration's principal counterterrorism measures have gone too far. "The idea that we're facing very specific threats against the United States has gotten a lot of people upset. But the reality is that it's very hard for any of us to judge why we went to code orange in the first place."

HEADLINE: The Nation: A New Order; 
Imagining Life Without Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: San Francisco 

 BODY:
IMAGINE America without illegal immigrants, the people who flip the burgers, clean the toilets, watch the kids and send their children to public schools. 
 Would the grass be greener? 
 The question got an answer of sorts last month in California, where about a third of the country's estimated 8 million to 10 million illegal immigrants live. Thousands of Latinos stayed home from school and work one Friday, protesting the repeal of a contentious new law that would have allowed illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. 
The boycott was not nearly the success its organizers had hoped for. Nonetheless, there were reports of fast-food counters closing and lawns going uncut. A few shops in cities with big immigrant populations, like Fresno, did not bother opening, and in Los Angeles, the second-largest school district in the country, the absentee rate nearly tripled from the Friday before. 
President Bush reopened the national debate about immigration last week with his proposal to grant temporary visas to undocumented workers. As with those who supported the repeal of the driver's license law in California, the Bush initiative left many Americans wondering why elected officials would change the rules for people who live in this country only by breaking them.
"I think it is hard to imagine a worse immigration reform proposal right now," said George J. Borjas, a professor of economics and social policy at Harvard who has written extensively about the drawbacks of illegal immigration. "The one good thing you could say about it is, it takes seriously the fact that the United States is not going to deport 10 million people. We have to do something about these people." 
Most everyone would agree that mass deportation is unlikely. But imagining such a chain of events is one way of understanding the economic backdrop to Mr. Bush's initiative. 
The Pew Hispanic Center estimated in 2001 that the unauthorized labor force in the United States totaled 5.3 million workers, including 700,000 restaurant workers, 250,000 household employees and 620,000 construction workers. In addition, about 1.2 million of the 2.5 million wage-earning farm workers live here illegally, according to a study by Philip L. Martin, a professor at the University of California at Davis who studies immigration and farm labor.
That is a whole lot of cheap labor.
Without it, fruit and vegetables would rot in fields. Toddlers in Manhattan would be without nannies. Towels at hotels in states like Florida, Texas and California would go unlaundered. Commuters at airports from Miami to Newark would be stranded as taxi cabs sat driverless. Home improvement projects across the Sun Belt would grind to a halt. And bedpans and lunch trays at nursing homes in Chicago, New York, Houston and Los Angeles would go uncollected. 
"There would be a ripple effect across the economy," said Harry P. Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at the University of Southern California, a Latino research group. 
But while the disruption would be real, Professor Borjas argues, it would not be long lasting. As proof, he says, look no further than places like Iowa, where foreign-born residents are relatively rare, but there are people working in hotels, fast-food restaurants and all the rest.
Most illegal immigrants, in fact, are concentrated in a handful of states -- California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida -- leaving many parts of the United States relatively untouched by the influx. 
Estimates by the Immigration and Naturalization Service based on the 2000 census show that 15 states accounted for all but 13 percent of illegal immigrants.
If there were no undocumented workers to tend to the gardening, Californians who wanted a nice lawn would pay more for it, eventually drawing low-skilled workers from other parts of the country, Professor Borjas said, adding that American workers would be the better for it.
"The workers would be slightly wealthier and the employers would be slightly poorer, but everything would get done," said Professor Borjas, who used to live in California. "I moved to Boston and the lawn is still green."
Laura Hill, a research fellow at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, said there would be a spike in prices for lettuce, spinach and strawberries, which are typically picked by undocumented workers. But farmers and agricultural companies would eventually find cheaper ways to harvest the crops. "Who knows, but maybe it would turn into new technology being developed," Ms. Hill said.
If not, Americans would look elsewhere, including other countries, for cheaper substitutes.
"The nice thing about importing a good is that once you don't like it, you can dispose of it," Professor Borjas said. "Immigration isn't like that."
Some immigration experts also suggest that American taxpayers would be better off financially if the country's unauthorized residents returned home. 
Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington group that favors greater restrictions on immigration, argues that if Americans "eased our addiction to this illegal labor," there would be less stress on the country's social welfare system, ranging from fewer children in crowded urban schools to fewer welfare checks for the American-born families of illegal immigrants.
"Immigrants over all use at least one major welfare program at a rate 50 percent higher than natives," Mr. Krikorian said, referring to an analysis of 2001 data by his center that found Medicaid use particularly high among immigrants. "That is not because they are morally defective. It is because they are poor and don't have any education and they end up inevitably stumbling and having needs for the system."
But immigrant advocacy groups dispute the notion that illegal immigration is a drag on America. Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights organization, said the economic impact of immigration plays out differently at the local and national levels.
While hospitals and clinics in Los Angeles County, for example, bear huge health care costs associated with uninsured illegal immigrants -- one study put the total at $340 million in 2002 -- thefederal government enjoys a "bonanza" from many of the same immigrants who pay federal taxes but receive no benefits in return, Mr. Yzaguirre said.
Mr. Yzaguirre suggested that Social Security would go broke without the payments of undocumented workers, many of whom, contrary to popular perception, do have regular payroll taxes deducted from their paychecks by employers. (In some instances, undocumented workers use false Social Security numbers, while others have valid numbers from when they had worked legally.)
Mr. Yzaguirre also rejected suggestions that Americans would maintain their standard of living without the low-wage contributions of those workers. He agreed with Professor Borjas that some Americans would enjoy fatter paychecks, but he said all Americans would be punished by having to pay more for everything from a McDonald's hamburger to a new house.
In a 2002 study conducted with the cooperation of immigrant rights organizations, researchers at the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago concluded that the 300,000 or so illegal immigrants in Chicago did not use government benefits at a substantial rate. The study also estimated that 70 percent of the undocumented workers paid payroll taxes, like Social Security and unemployment insurance. The researchers calculated other economic benefits, finding that consumer spending by illegal migrants generated more than 31,000 jobs and contributed $5.34 billion annually to the gross regional product in Chicago.
Which side to believe? The problem with gathering data about illegal immigrants, and the idea of an America without them, is that they tend to blend into the vast tapestry of legal immigrants.
Someone living and working in the United States with a valid visa one year can become illegal the next by overstaying the visa. A single household can have legal and illegal residents, sometimes brothers and sisters. In that sense, the Bush proposal to blur the distinction further between illegal and legal workers includes "some degree of honesty," said Patricia Nelson Limerick, chairwoman of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado.
"The hope is that it would lead to some recognition that you don't solve problems of illegal immigration by shutting down the border," she said, "but reckoning with the problems in the home country."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Of Fuzzy Math And 'Food Security'

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER

 BODY:
"WE are not concerned with the very poor," wrote E. M. Forster in "Howard's End," his 1910 novel of culture and class. "They are unthinkable, and only to be approached by the statistician or the poet." 
 Where the statistician ends, however, and the poet -- or the politician or the advocate or the salesman -- begins has long dogged the science of probability and averages. And to the extent that Americans are concerned with the very poor, it is not surprising that cold numbers and impressionistic reasoning should mingle uneasily. 
 Take the annual survey of homelessness and hunger published by the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization encompassing 1,183 cities with populations of 30,000 or more. The 2003 installment arrived in mid-December, and as it has for each of the last 16 years, the survey reported an increase in "demand for emergency food" -- this time by 17 percent. 
The figure was quickly noted in the press. 
"Homelessness, Hunger Worsen," was the Boston Globe headline. The Washington Post had it as "Survey Indicates More Go Hungry, Homeless." And an editorial in The New York Times cited the survey in taking note of "continuing increases in hunger and homelessness in the nation's major cities." 
 According to a chart included with the results of the survey, which was conducted in 25 major cities, demand for food assistance increased by a sizeable percentage every year since 1988. (The best year, 1995, had a 9 percent increase; the worst, 1991, was up 26 percent.) But the math behind that trend had, for the last several years, caught the eye of the conservative Heritage Foundation, which published a pre-emptive rebuttal a few days before the survey was released. 
"Policy makers should be wary of the claims of 'increasing hunger' that are likely to be made in the upcoming 2003 U.S. Conference of Mayors report," the foundation's paper warned. 
 So what's the real story? Social ills like hunger and need for food assistance are notoriously difficult to measure. In a flagging economy, or even in boom times, those on the front lines -- soup kitchen operators and food bank administrators, who must rely on donations and government subsidies -- are always in the shadow of a shortfall. So it is not surprising that the mayors' survey, which relies primarily on the collected impressions (and varied recordkeeping) of these agencies, would consistently report an increase in demand. 
"We can argue about the numbers and the methodology," said Steve Brady, the president of the Sodexho Foundation, which supports hunger-related initiatives and was a co-sponsor of the mayors' survey. "But it is certainly a clear indicator that the country as a whole is experiencing this problem."
In publishing a table titled "Hunger and Homelessness in America's Cities: A 16-Year Comparison of Data," however, the mayors' survey suggests an annual percentage increase that proves difficult to track. When asked for the numbers behind the percentages, Eugene Lowe, the assistant executive director for community development and housing for the mayors' conference, said there weren't any. 
The mayors' conference, Mr. Lowe explained, requests the percentage change in demand from each city, and from that publishes an annual average percentage change for all the cities in the study. "The cities do the research themselves," Mr. Lowe said. 
The Heritage Foundation took that methodology to task, comparing the rate of increase implied by the mayors' data with measures taken by the Census Bureau and the Department of Agriculture. Those agencies have found a slight rise in what the government calls "food insecurity" (see chart at right) in the last few years, but it remains lower than in 1995. The mayors' report has demand for emergency food rising an average of 16 percent a year in the same period. 
"No set of data is perfect," said Melissa G. Pardue, an author of the Heritage Foundation analysis. She pointed to Census Bureau figures on the topic, which are generally considered to be too low. "But the undercount is expected to be roughly the same from year to year," she said, which means the trend should be a fairly accurate snapshot of changes in demand. That snapshot is at odds with the mayors' findings. 
It is also not likely, according to Mark Nord, a sociologist with the Agriculture Department, that trends spotted in the 25 cities surveyed would so drastically deviate from national trends. "There are a lot of weaknesses in the methodology of the mayors' report," he said. "In terms of identifying trends, it's not a very good source for that."
OF course, neither side in the debate wants to divert attention from the millions of Americans who, at one time or another, need help getting enough to eat. And Mr. Lowe of the mayors' conference said it was a mistake to turn their numbers into something they are not. 
"There are always people who will try to use these percentages to reflect the actual number of people" seeking emergency food aid, he said. "But you cannot do this with our numbers." Instead, Mr. Lowe said, the trend simply shows that the pressure on the informal and formal networks intended to address this problem is always great. 
The Heritage Foundation concedes this point. "It's certainly important that we're talking about this," Ms. Pardue said. "But using exaggerated numbers is not helpful to the debate and to the needs of those people who, in the midst of a recession, may actually be hungry."
Or as a quotation attributed to the late business professor Aaron Levenstein has it: "Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."

(Photo by Tina Hager) Chart: "One Topic, Two Studies, Two Conclusions"Last month, the United States Conference of Mayors published its annual survey on the state of hunger and homelessness -- but not before the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, had already published a critique of the mayors' findings. The survey indicated a yearly growth in demand for emergency food assistance that the Heritage Foundation said was implausible. Following is a look at some of the findings, and how the government measures such need.

Food Security: How the Government Measures HungerIn response to the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990, the U.S. Department of Agriculture developed a standardized mechanism for measuring shades of what it calls "food security." FOOD INSECUREU.S. Population, 2002 Food insecure, with hunger: 3%One or more household members were hungry at least some time during the year because they could not afford enough food. Food insecure, without hunger: 8%Households that avoided hunger using strategies like eating less varied diets, participating in food assistance programs or getting emergency food from community food pantries. FOOD SECURE: 89%Households that had access, at all times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. The Mayors' MathIf this represents the annual increase in demand for emergency food, as published in the mayors' survey . . . . . . then this is how much demand has grown over the base year of 1988. Graph tracks annual increase in demand for emergency food as published in the mayors' survey and how much demand has grown since the base year of 1998. U.S.D.A.'s FindingsA more reliable look at the trend finds that the percentage of Americans considered "food insecure" is rising, but at a much slower pace.

HEADLINE: BRIEFINGS: STATE FINANCES; 
TOUGH BUDGET YEAR AHEAD

BYLINE:  NYT

 BODY:
The year is beginning with signs of economic recovery, but when the new state Legislature convenes this month it will confront a budget season that officials say will be the most desperate in years. 
 For the 2005 fiscal year, which begins on July 1, the state faces a shortfall that could amount to one-fifth of the total budget. 
And the last two budgets, patched together with elaborate effort to avoid increases in the sales or income taxes, exhausted obvious one-time fixes. 
 "Of the four budgets we've done, this is the toughest," the state treasurer, John E. McCormac, said. "A lot of easy solutions have been taken. We've cut the budget three years in a row, so the fourth year for the same reason gets a lot harder." An analysis by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services said the gap could reach $5 billion. 
 Mr. McCormac said the current fiscal year should bring an end to a two-year decline in receipts from the three major taxes -- personal income, corporate income and sales tax -- that together account for two-thirds of state revenue. But much of the revenue that closed the budget gap this year and last has been exhausted. This year's $24 billion budget relied on the last money, $1.3 billion, the state could borrow against future receipts from the national tobacco settlement, and on more than $500 million allotted the state in a federal aid package that is unlikely to be renewed. "Given the loss of those sources," Mr. McCormac said, "even if we had a billion in growth we'd still be a billion short."

HEADLINE: Detroit Focuses on Cars, and Asia on Trucks 

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
THIS is already shaping up as a topsy-turvy year for the auto industry, which brought its movers and shakers together here last week for the opening of the 2004 North American International Auto Show. 
 The domestic automakers, experts in trucks and sport utilities, are on a passenger car binge. Asian companies, masters of the automobile, have plunged headlong into trucks, especially big ones. 
 Everything seemed backward at Cobo Center: American companies are trying to regain some of the car-market share they have lost to the Japanese and the Koreans, and the Asians are going after the big profits offered by large, sumptuous trucks. 
 To emphasize its strategy, Ford declared 2004 the "Year of the Car" as it showed off a new Mustang and the Five Hundred family sedan. Chrysler has rediscovered rear-wheel drive; it will offer large sedans with powerful V-8 engines that save fuel by operating on four cylinders when eight are not needed. Honda announced it would sell an Accord this fall that will use six cylinders to accelerate but cruise on only three.
 Volkswagen showed diesel versions of its Touareg S.U.V. and Passat midsize car, and Mercedes-Benz had a diesel E320 sedan. Toyota introduced hybrid gas-electric sport utilities and Honda announced that it would sell a hybrid Accord sedan. There were also more continuously variable transmissions for better fuel economy.
 Not everything was commonsensical: Ferrari unveiled its 612 Scaglietti, a four-seater with a 6-liter V-12 engine. Aston Martin showed its new $168,000 DB9 Volante convertible with a 450-horsepower V-12. Mercedes-Benz showed its SLR McLaren, a two-seat exotic car with a supercharged 617-horsepower engine that is capable of racing to 60 m.p.h. in just 3.8 seconds. 
 For those with more limited bank accounts, there were sporty cars like the PT Cruiser convertible and Crossfire roadster, both from Chrysler.
 Here is a look at some of the new or most-changed models that will arrive in showrooms this year.

BMW 6 SERIES: The luxurious four-passenger 645Ci convertible, which will sell for roughly $80,000, shares its 325-horsepower V-8 engine with a coupe version. The styling is a sleek refinement of the high-rump look created under Chris Bangle, an American designer.

CHRYSLER 300 and DODGE MAGNUM: Arriving in the spring, these are the first large Chrysler cars to switch from front to rear drive, with all-wheel drive available. A 190-horsepower V-6 engine is standard; an option is the 5.7-liter hemi V-8 with 340 horsepower, with cylinder deactivation that allows the engine to shut down four cylinders when eight are not needed. Pricing runs from $22,495 for the Magnum sports wagon to $34,995 for the 300C flagship.

FORD FIVE HUNDRED: A little bigger than the Taurus on the outside, and a lot bigger inside, the Five Hundred has a huge trunk. Powered with a 200-horsepower V-6, this front-drive car also offers an all-wheel-drive version and a continuously variable transmission.

FORD FREESTYLE: Ford's first crossover utility wagon has three rows of seats and aims at minivan flexibility without the minivan image. It is mechanically similar to the Five Hundred.

FORD MUSTANG: Think of this as the all-new 1967 Mustang, Ford says. The rear-wheel-drive sporty car arrives this fall, with the classic profile featuring long hood and short trunk. There is a little more room, and Mustang engineers promise much better handling. The standard engine is a 4-liter V-6 rated at 202 horsepower; the GT gets an all-aluminum 4.6-liter V-8 rated at 300 horsepower.

CHEVROLET CORVETTE: The redesigned sixth-generation coupe goes on sale this summer, followed in the fall by a convertible. These are the first 'Vettes since 1962 with exposed, fixed headlights instead of pop-ups. The highest top speed for a production 'Vette ever, 180 m.p.h., comes from a 6.0-liter V-8 rated at 400 horsepower.

INFINITI QX56: Infiniti is adding this huge luxury utility vehicle, based on the Nissan Armada, in the spring. It has three rows of seats, a 5.6-liter V-8 and a choice of rear-wheel or four-wheel drive.

MERCEDES-BENZ VISION GRAND SPORTS TOURER: Conceptually similar to the Chrysler Pacifica, but more stylish and elegant, this sport wagon seats six people in three rows.

NISSAN PATHFINDER and FRONTIER: The midsize Pathfinder will have three seating rows for the first time and a new platform derived from the big Nissan Titan pickup. The Frontier is larger.

PONTIAC G6: This sporty midsize sports sedan goes on sale in the fall, replacing the Grand Am, and will be followed by a coupe and a convertible as part of Pontiac's effort to revitalize itself as sort of an American BMW. The G6 will have a 200-horsepower 3.5.-liter V-6 engine; later in the year a GTP version will get a 240-horsepower 3.9-liter V-6.

SUZUKI RENO: This five-door hatchback crossover vehicle is aimed at the youth market. Prices range from $13,000 to $15,000.

TOYOTA SCION: In June, Scion will bring out the tC, a sporty coupe with a moon roof, at less than $20,000.

TOYOTA HIGHLANDER HYBRID and LEXUS RX 400h: These gas-electric hybrid versions of the Highlander and RX 330 utility wagons will offer claimed combined city-highway mileage ratings better than 27.6 m.p.g., the current average for compact sedans. In Toyota's Prius Sedan, the batteries will have nearly double the power of the old batteries.

HEADLINE: HOME FRONT; 
In January, Restaurateurs Watch the Fat

BYLINE:  By Abby Ellin; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
April may be the cruelest month, but in the restaurant world January gets that distinction. Oh, the stomachs of city dwellers still growl, but holiday credit card bills growl louder, and many New Yorkers tend to pare their gastronomic excursions until the shock of the previous month's spending wears off. 
 "I've been in the business for 30 years, and January is historically the slowest month," said Nick Valenti, the chief executive of Restaurant Associates, one of the largest restaurant and food service companies in Manhattan. "A lot of New Yorkers travel to warm weather in January and February, and most people visit the city in warmer months, so tourism dies down." 
 Ann Nickinson, a co-owner of Kitchenette, on West Broadway and on Amsterdam Avenue between 122nd and 123rd Streets, agreed. "It's a month that you wait to get through," she said.
 Ms. Nickinson and her business partner, Lisa Hall, opened Kitchenette uptown two years ago, and it follows the theme of its downtown counterpart, serving soul-nourishing foods like turkey meatloaf and macaroni and cheese in a down-home atmosphere. Of course, there are differences: Both restaurants serve breakfast, lunch and dinner (prices run from $5.50 for breakfast to $16 for dinner), but downtown, where Wall Street executives mingle with TriBeCa trendsetters, "You can't even wave a tablespoon of cream across a soup bowl," said Ms. Nickinson. "Uptown, you just keep pouring the fat."
 And trimming it. Because though downtown usually gets a steady flow of customers year round, uptown faces a double whammy come January, when the Columbia University traffic -- a mainstay the rest of the year -- is on hiatus. "When school's not in session, our business drops off 25 percent," Ms. Nickinson said. 
 Unlike many restaurant owners who cope with the January blahs by mailing out coupons and fliers or offering two-for-one specials, Ms. Nickinson, 49, and Ms. Hall, 42, refuse. "You can't change everything you do," Ms. Nickinson said. "It always seems like a sellout, those two-for-ones. Unless you increase your inventory triple-fold you're really cutting off your noses. It almost seems a desperate action, and the bottom line is we're still looking to make money. If you have to give it away, there's a problem."
 Which means that you have to find other ways to compensate and to lure customers into your establishment. "You're careful about ordering, you're careful about staffing," Ms. Nickinson said. "You look at every element in order not to incur any extra charges. During holiday time, you don't care if you have two extra cases of butter in a walk-in, or extra hands, but at this time you cut that fat. During the heavier months we might have two bakers on all the time, but we wouldn't during these months. We're very conscious about keeping our staff, but we might cut a waiter a couple of shifts. January is a coasting month; you don't do anything, and you hope and pray that two refrigerators don't break."
 This season, to entice families living in the neighborhood, Kitchenette is serving old-fashioned pancake suppers, replete with stacks of plain or fruited silver-dollar pancakes smotheredin syrup. "When I was growing up outside of Boston you'd have pancake suppers on Wednesday nights. No one does that here. We serve breakfast all day long and we just thought about doing it for dinner," Ms. Nickinson said. 
 "We've never tried to reinvent the wheel," she said. "We've stayed true to who we are. You know when you have a black skirt in your wardrobe you wear it a lot? We're that kind of everyday in-and-out kind of thing, like a gray flannel suit. Food definitely coincides with people's emotional needs. Even if they can't afford lunch they can always afford a small treat.
 "Fortunately, there's enough base for what we do that we can stay treading water. People liked meatloaf and mashed potatoes 20 years ago, and they still like it today."

Car Dealerships Face the Great Homogenization

BYLINE:  By DAVID WETHE

 BODY:
IT'S not that Wendy Kent Churchill doesn't want a shiny new showroom. She just wishes that it could look like a place to buy a luxury vehicle, rather than a military barracks. 
 But the macho, pared-down look is what the Hummer division of General Motors is pushing Ms. Churchill, a Fort Worth, Tex., auto dealer, to build. Unlike some automakers, shesaid, the company is not offering any financial help to add a new showroom. It doesn't have to, Ms. Churchill said, because so many competitors are vying for the right to sell new Hummers. 
 The drive for the new-style showroom, complete with exposed concrete, metal rafters and helicopterlike ceiling fans, is all part of Hummer's new corporate-image program, which calls for the rollout of 164 stand-alone, look-alike dealerships by 2005. 
 "If what they're really looking to achieve is quality, well, why can't that be done without it having to look exactly the same?" asked Ms. Churchill, who has owned part of her grandfather's 68-year-old dealership, the Frank Kent Motor Company, since she was 18 and is now its president. Her current Hummer sales operation shares showroom and parking lot space with her other G.M. brands, Pontiac and GMC Truck. 
 Other dealers throughout the country are facing the same demands for change. Like clothing stores, restaurants and banks before them, automakers are now trying to convey a brand image not only with their cars but also with their stores, by leaning on their dealers to build look-alike showrooms around the country.
 "I don't know of a manufacturer now that's not demanding that their zone managers maneuver their dealers to build a new prototype," said J. Roger Crownrich, a designer based in Dallas who has built more than 300 auto dealerships across the country since 1963. "McDonald's seems to have gotten rich with an arch, and I think the manufacturers are all trying to do the same."
 Automakers are pushing for more than just a standardized logo on the side of a building. They want the dealership's architecture to be the new signature, said Paul Taylor, chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association. 
 Manufacturers like Ford Motor, Hummer and Volkswagen's Audi unit say standardized dealerships help to differentiate their brands from the competition and offer a consistent shopping experience. 
 Mike DiGiovanni, general manager of Hummer, said G.M. felt strongly about having its own Hummer stores. "To build a premium brand, consistency is paramount," he said. "If you don't have that, you're going to have a hodgepodge and people running around like a fire drill."
 Tom Durant, owner of Classic Hummer in Grapevine, Tex., was the first to build a stand-alone Hummer dealership in his state. So far, he said, Hummer's two models do not support a dealership solely for the brand. But he predicted that the new H3, a smaller and cheaper model coming next year, would make the difference. "I think the investment is going to be more than worth it," he said. 
 Car companies have names for what they hope will be a renaissance in their showrooms. Volkswagen calls its new look the "Marketplace," while Audi has named its program "The New World of Audi." 
 ALTHOUGH many states have franchise laws that prohibit manufacturers from forcing dealers to build new showrooms, they can entice them with preferential car allocations, low-interest loans and even cash. 
 Audi, for example, pays its dealers $500,000 to $750,000 to help defray costs, said Clint Sly, senior project manager for the Trammell Crow Company, a real estate company that is helping dealerships roll out the Audi program.
 With arched roofs and 20-foot-high front windows that lean outward, the newly designed Audi dealerships look a little like airport hangars. They are intended to replicate the company's 20-year-old plant in Ingolstadt, Germany, where customers often go to pick up new cars as they roll off the line. 
 Inside the new showrooms, large colorful Audi banners are meant to draw the customer's attention to the receptionist's desk at the center of the showroom. The goal is to greet all customers upon arrival, said John Peterson, manager of retail facilities for Audi of America in Auburn Hills, Mich.
 Audi says it is pleased with the results so far. Eighty of its 270 dealerships in the United States have converted to the new look. The company points to a customer survey last year by J.D. Power that showed a 22 percent increase in sales satisfaction at "New World of Audi" dealerships, compared with the older-style ones. Audi, however, declined to compare sales data for its new and old sites.
 Audi started its revamping program in 1997, but it went through considerable changes in 2000 after the company hired McMillan Doolittle, the retail consultant based in Chicago, to assess what customers wanted, Mr. Peterson said.
 The spread of standardized dealerships can be slow. On average, half of all dealers do at least some renovation once in five years, according to the dealers association. They feel pressure to do so not only from the manufacturer but also from their competition down the street. 
 Mr. Crownrich, the designer, said he might spend $100 a square foot on a dealership now, compared with $8 a square foot in 1963. The average dealership now has about 50,000 square feet of buildings on 10 acres, he said.
 But if a dealership's architecture is synonymous with a car brand, the dealer's own business loses its brand identity, said Dr. George E. Hoffer, an economics professor at Virginia Commonwealth University and a frequent consultant to the auto industry.
 "The physical facility is one way that you try to differentiate yourself," Dr. Hoffer said. If automakers demand uniformity in the look, he said, "that's an interesting way to cut down on interdealer competition, by homogenizing the dealership, because it's one less thing they compete on."
 Still, while some dealers chafe at the idea of retrofitting their showrooms, others are eager to promote the car's brand over their own corporate image. 
 "At the end of the day, it's still about the product," said Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive of AutoNation Inc., which sells 35 automobile brands in 287 locations and is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "Automotive will remain about the product, and the product brand should be supreme." 
 Yet Mr. Jackson understands that many dealers may not agree. "You'll find the vast majority want to exercise their entrepreneurial freedom and their entrepreneurial expression to distinguish their dealership in a market," said Mr. Jackson, who previously was president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz U.S.A.
 THE automotive retail industry is the largest consumer retail sector in the country, according to the Capital Automotive REIT in McLean, Va., which leases showroom property and buildings to dealers. The average dealership's profits were $615,700 in 2002, more than double the $307,000 in 1997, according to the dealers association. 
 "We saw that car dealerships have evolved from being a mom-and-pop business to a major corporation," said Todd Berko, a partner at Bel Air Partners, a firm based in Princeton, N.J., that advises dealers on the buying and selling of their businesses. 
 "Many times the car dealer is the wealthiest man in town," Mr. Berko said. "They're highly profitable, cash-flow-generating businesses."
 The physical size of dealerships is also expanding, mainly because of consumers' expectations for more amenities and larger inventories.
 "Customers are looking for a greater selection" within each brand, said Mr. Peterson of Audi. Manufacturers have found that the best way to meet that need is by offering larger showrooms and parking lots that hold more inventory, he said. 
 Indeed, the racing legend Roger Penske recently completed construction of one of the largest auto dealerships in the country, the $100 million Chauncey Ranch in Scottsdale, Ariz. Sprawling across 41 acres, it sells 11 brands in 10 showrooms, all built to corporate-image standards. The site, which had been an Arabian horse ranch, also offers a paved test track and an off-road course -- as well as a racing museum and a Starbucks. 
 The emergence of large owners of dealerships like AutoNation, UnitedAuto Group and Sonic Automotive Inc. has contributed to the spread of standardized dealerships, said Thomas D. Eckert, the chief executive of Capital Automotive REIT.
 "What the manufacturers did see is the opportunity to say to a public dealer, 'We'll let you buy this franchise, but you've got to build us a new store,"' Mr. Eckert said. 
 Mr. Jackson, of AutoNation, said that there was a reason for such a strong emphasis on corporate image programs.
 "Someone who has spent, on the average, $27,000 for a vehicle very much enjoys coming to a center that is designed to specifically meet their needs, from a practical point of view and from an emotional point of view," he said. By pushing dealerships with consistent themes that promote only one brand, automakers are convinced that customers will grow to love the automobile store as much as they love the car. Although dealers generally tend to match that passion for the brand, many don't want to be told how to create a certain atmosphere in their dealership.
 "Dealers are not cowboys, but they're individuals," said David Sova, managing principal of Car Store Design, a company based in Vashon, Wash., that represents dealers in negotiations with automakers over the design of new stores. "They don't like being told what to do and frequently will do the opposite if you try to tell them what to do." 
 Ultimately, auto manufacturers need to be careful, Mr. Sova said, because the efforts to create a uniform organization may scare off the type of people the companies need to sell their cars. "The factories need those guys," he said. "They need people that don't follow rules and will do anything they can to make a sale."

Optimism Expressed for Warehouse Market in '04

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY'S industrial real estate market has traditionally been robust, but it wilted a bit during the past two years of national economic stress. In 2004, though, analysts and brokers predict New Jersey will be among the first markets in the country to fully regain fighting trim.
 The ProLogis Research Group of Denver identified four places in a national survey of warehouse-distribution markets where recovery is expected to be speedy: the Los Angeles Basin, Reno, Las Vegas and the state of New Jersey. The report took into account the inventory of existing buildings, new construction starts, asking rents, vacancy rates and other relevant factors. 
 New Jersey industrial real estate specialists also sound sanguine about the new year. 
Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey reports the overall vacancy rate for industrial property in the state fell to 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003, a 1.1 percentage point decline from the corresponding period in 2002. In central New Jersey, Middlesex County, which is by far the state's largest industrial locale, with 217 million square feet, the vacancy rate in the fourth quarter was just 4.6 percent, according to Cushman.
In adjacent Mercer County, where there is more than 24 million square feet of warehouse and distribution property, the vacancy rate hovers at 10.5 percent. But various market analysts said this is not an unhealthy statistic, at least from a real estate broker's point of view.
"The amount of inventory out there is a good thing," said Stanley B. Danzig, an industrial specialist with Cushman. "The best situation is a good balance of available inventory and demand. If you have a lot of demand and no place to make deals, prices go up, but sales activity drops -- or else price drops, but you still can't get rid of the space because it's not what a particular company needs."
Cushman and CB Richard Ellis, another large real estate company, note in their year-end reports that the overall amount of available space continues to drop. "Each of the last several years has exceeded the previous in terms of absorption of available space," Mr. Danzig said. "There are a lot of big tenants running around right now" looking for space, he continued -- without naming any of them -- "and '04 could exceed '03 again."
A nearly complete 330,000-square-foot building in the Meadowlands, constructed on speculation as a joint venture of Rreef and Orix, is "actually generating a tremendous amount of interest," according to Mr. Danzig.
Another positive sign cited by brokers is Mercedes-Benz's recent announcement that it will enter the New Jersey industrial market, with plans to build a 650,000-square-foot distribution facility in Washington Township, at Exit 7A off the New Jersey Turnpike.
THE Turnpike corridor continues to be the most highly desirable industrial location, brokers said. And while the Turnpike Exit 8A has long been the center of industrial development, many developers are looking one or two exits south, to Exit 7 and Exit 7A, noted Frank Caccavo, also an industrial broker with Cushman.
Companies generally remain in a cycle of consolidation and contraction, said Mr. Caccavo, and the pattern of leasing reflects this, he said. "More than a dozen leases for more than 100,000 square feet were made in the last two quarters," Mr. Caccavo said. "Most of those involved are companies relocating within New Jersey."
But he and other brokers noted that the need for modern, up-to-date logistical capabilities at warehouse-distribution centers continues to drive real estate activity. In addition, interest rates remain low, Mr. Danzig said, adding that asking rents -- which dropped and then held steady during the recession -- are beginning to inch upward, creating "opportunistic urgency" for companies wanting to expand or contract."
During the lower-rent period, he observed, the garment industry seized opportunities, with many smaller companies taking advantage of decreased pricing to upgrade from Class B to Class A buildings, gaining better logistics or better locations or both.
There are a number of large vacant buildings currently on the market, some of them new and built on spec, like the Rreef-Orix center in Carlstadt, and others "second generation" -- as brokers refer to buildings whose previous tenants have decamped -- like the former Fleming Foods distribution center at Exit 8A.
"Spec buildings are still taking a little longer to fill, with more companies wanting build-to-suit," Mr. Danzig said, "but a modern distribution center will always find a tenant in New Jersey."
TWO of the biggest build-to-suit deals at the end of 2003 involved W. W. Grainger's purchase of a new 435,945-square-foot warehouse-distribution center in Washington Township, and Home Depot U.S.A. Inc.'s 12-year commitment to occupy a 771,853-square-foot structure under construction on 87 acres in Cranbury, Mr. Caccavo said.
Keystone Property Trust, which developed the Cranbury property at Exit 8A, will retain ownership of the Home Depot building, and when completed, it will expand Keystone's industrial portfolio in New Jersey to more than 10 million square feet and its 8A portfolio to nearly 4.4 million square feet. 
The Home Depot structure will have 32-foot-high ceilings, 150 dock doors, 238 car parking spaces and 426 trailer parking spaces -- with room to expand by an additional 150,000 square feet.
In a smaller deal at 8A in Cranbury, the Ford Motor Company recently committed to a 300,000-square-foot warehouse that is being built to suit it. That transaction was brokered by CB Richard Ellis, whose industrial services group is based in Paramus.
In Monroe, another town accessible from Exit 8A, Trammell Crow brokers recently closed a long-term lease renewal for Staples, the office supplies store, which has occupied a 204,369-square-foot distribution center there for several years.
MEANWHILE, at 7A, the Cranbury-based Matrix Development Group closed last month on a 135,000-square-foot build-to-suit sale with the Sleepy's Mattress Company at the Northeast Business Park in Washington Township. The mattress retailer will use the building as a regional distribution center.
With the Exit 7A submarket heating up, several brokers noted, Washington Township planners are moving to put in place this year the same sort of streamlined development approval process that the town of Cranbury used effectively over the years to position Exit 8A as the premier industrial real estate site.
Several spec-built projects, which were already in the works when the market turned sluggish, will be completed or will be substantially under way in coming months, and are now being marketed, brokers said. They include Keystone's Greenville Yards in Jersey City, a two-building 525,000-square-foot industrial center at the former train yard, with 36-foot ceilings and immediate rail access. One building is to have 24 truck bays, and the other 48 bays.
Keystone is also building the 500,000-square-foot second phase of its Cranbury East development at Exit 8A. 
The KOR Companies, in partnership with Cushman, is building 1.65 million square feet of warehouse or distribution space at Central Crossings Business Park in Bordentown, off Turnpike Exit 7. Construction on that project began in June.
"We expect speculative development activity to increase in 2004," Mr. Caccavo said, "as the inventory of Class A distribution space continues to decline."
Andrew J. Merin, an investment specialist with Cushman, said he expected the number of industrial property sales to continue to rise in the stronghold of central New Jersey, so long as interest rates remain low. Sales volume in 2003 was about 50 percent more than the year before, said Mr. Merin, although year-end statistics are not yet available.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CORONA; 
The Sidewalks Are Now Clear of Trash But, Oh, Those Restaurant Basements

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
The sign in the cramped basement of El Gran Pan de Queso, near the employee lockers and sacks of hominy grits, reads: "Please put trash in its place."
 If only it were that easy. 
 The trash's place in this small Colombian restaurant in Corona, Queens, used to be in a sidewalk Dumpster. But now, workers lug 8 to 10 dripping plastic bags of garbage a day down the stairs and leave them a few feet from those same lockers and grits. Each night, the bags go up through the dining room to the sidewalk. 
 A year ago this month, the Department of Sanitation began enforcing laws citywide that prohibit storing Dumpsters on sidewalks. Some advocates say the program, Operation Dumpster, is a success. "Sidewalks are for walking," said John Kaehny, executive director of the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives, "and the Department of Sanitation has done something to clear more space for pedestrians."
 Carlos Aldana, owner of El Gran Pan de Queso, disagrees. "It's an economic problem," he said. "It's a hygienic problem. It's an atmosphere problem." 
 Mr. Aldana said his garbage collection costs had more than tripled since last year. His restaurant used to pay about $200 a month for a carting company to make twice-weekly Dumpster pickups. His latest bill, for six-day-a-week bag pickups in November, came to $623.70, an increase of about $5,000 a year. 
 Eduardo Giraldo, president of the Queens Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said he had received complaints from many restaurant and supermarket owners. "The amount of garbage they have to keep in the basement, that brings mice," he said. "That brings cockroaches." 
 John Doherty, the city's sanitation commissioner, said the program had been a success. "I get very few complaints anymore about sidewalks being blocked by smelly, dirty Dumpsters," he said. "Nobody likes to change, but we have to adjust." 
 Queens, with its high concentration of immigrant restaurants in cramped spaces, may be particularly affected by the new enforcement, but businesses in other boroughs are also feeling the pinch. Jack Alaio, manager of Patricia's, an Italian restaurant in Throgs Neck, the Bronx, said his carting fees were up 35 percent from a year ago. 
 Some restaurant owners, like Mr. Alaio and Mr. Aldana, believe that permanent Dumpsters are more sanitary than trash bags left on the street. The workers at El Gran Pan de Queso end up cleaning the sidewalk any morning that rats or the homeless rip into exposed garbage bags. SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Pressure Builds To Cut Fund Fees

BYLINE:  By CARLA FRIED

 BODY:
MANY otherwise cost-conscious Americans have been price-insensitive about their mutual fund investments. Driving five miles to save a dollar on a quart of olive oil makes perfect sense to many people who have never questioned paying higher mutual fund fees than big institutional investors do, even though these expenses can add up to thousands of dollars in a long-term investment.
 Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, is out to change that. Fees took center stage in the settlement he reached in December with Alliance Capital Management in connection with accusations of trading abuses in the company's mutual funds. Alliance agreed to reduce its management fees by 20 percent for the next five years, generating an estimated $350 million in savings for Alliance fund shareholders. The firm will also disclose publicly how it sets fees. Mr. Spitzer has said that settlements with other mutual fund companies will focus on fees, which he has said are "grossly out of control." 
 The Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade association, issued a report on Tuesday that challenges the assumptions made by Mr. Spitzer and others. Mr. Spitzer, in turn, said in a statement that the institute's report was "fundamentally flawed." 
 What no one questions is that the pressure on mutual funds to reduce fees is beginning to come from multiple constituencies. 
 John P. Freeman, a professor at the University of South Carolina law school, said the Alliance settlement could be an opportunity for others to challenge fees in the industry. "The settlement is a signal to everyone else that there's gold in them thar hills," said Mr. Freeman, who, with Stewart Brown, wrote a 2001 study that found that retail fund investors pay higher advisory fees than pension plans and other institutional clients. "High-cost funds can book it that plaintiffs' lawyers are going to get in line."
 The heightened possibility of lawsuits over fees is bound to get the attention of fund directors, some legal authorities said. "It's not as if boards don't take the fee issue seriously now, but this heightens awareness and probably causes boards to sharpen their pencils a bit more," said Ted Laurenson, a partner at Baker & McKenzie, who specializes in securities law.
 Max Rottersman, an independent fund consultant and editor of FundExpenses.com, which includes monthly commentary on fund fee issues, also said he expected pension and 401(k) sponsors to pay more attention to fees.
 "Employees are asking, 'What are you doing to protect me?"' Mr. Rottersman said. "Everyone is waking up about who their client is and understanding they need to take a more active role in that responsibility. You can't buy performance, but you can pay attention to fees."
 Mr. Spitzer's moves are also regarded as a marketing opportunity for funds. "He's signaling to low-cost funds that they should push their competitive advantage on fees," said Lucas Garland, a research analyst at Lipper, the fund-tracking firm. Additional pressure may be coming from the NASD, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees fund advertising. An NASD proposal would require important fund expenses to be displayed prominently in all advertisements.
 In the last few months, mutual fund fees have become something of a preoccupation in Washington. In November, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would, among other fund changes, require the Securities and Exchange Commission to expand fee disclosure to investors; the bill is now before the Senate. 
 Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, an Illinois Republican who is a member of the subcommittee investigating fund fees, has called the industry's fee structure "the world's largest skimming operation -- a $7 trillion trough from which fund managers, brokers and other insiders are steadily siphoning off an excessive slice of the nation's household, college and retirement savings." 
 The S.E.C. has indicated that it will not wait for Congress to act. The commission chairman, William H. Donaldson, said he expected the S.E.C. to formally propose this month that fund fees be disclosed periodically in statements to investors as an actual dollar estimate based on an investor's assets in a specific fund. The House bill includes this provision. Currently, fee disclosure is presented in fund prospectuses and marketing material as a generic percentage of fund assets for all investors. Proponents of the personalized example say it will increase consumer awareness of the cost of various fund fees, and make fund comparisons easier.
 IN addition, the S.E.C. has proposed a rule aimed at clarifying when investors are eligible to pay a reduced front-end load. Funds typically reduce the load for large investments of $50,000 or more in a single fund or across a fund company. But a recent S.E.C. study found that these "breakpoints" are not always disclosed to an investor. The study found that investors eligible for breakpoints were entitled, on average, to $364 in discounts they did not receive. 
 The S.E.C. has also asked for public comment on how best to disclose some hidden costs to investors, including so-called soft dollar arrangements, in which funds pay higher trading costs to brokers in return for research and other services; and directed brokerage, in which funds compensate brokers and advisers for directing investors to a particular fund. 
 Fund boards are another item on the S.E.C.'s agenda. To increase the likelihood that a board will act solely in the interest of fund shareholders, as mandated in the Investment Company Act of 1940, the S.E.C. wants to require that board chairmen be independent, and that independent board representation increase from a simple majority to three-fourths. 
 But given that proposals for change have been floating around for years, is the fee structure really shifting? "I am not just hopeful, I am certain that we are going to see meaningful change that will impact fund fees," said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard fund family. Because of the new atmosphere, he said: "In the wink of an eye, 35 years of heresy has become dogma. Change is in the air." 
 Mr. Spitzer's work on advisory fees draws on the research by Mr. Freeman and Mr. Brown. In 2001, they reported that the average advisory fee paid by mutual fund investors -- without any administrative charges -- was $56 per $10,000 in assets, compared with $28 per $10,000 for institutional clients. 
 Mr. Spitzer said in November that in 2002, Putnam Investments charged retail fund investors an advisory fee that was 0.40 percentage points higher than the fee charged to the firm's institutional clients. That translated into an extra $290 million, he said. Mr. Spitzer says that retail fund investors deserve "most favored nation" treatment, which would give them the same fee structure as institutional clients. 
 In its study last week, the Investment Company Institute said that because fund management differs from pension management, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Brown were wrong to compare the advisory fees. The institute said that fund advisory fees could include charges for administrative costs that are not part of pension advisory fees. These areas, the institute said, include the cost of preparing and distributing shareholder reports, portfolio accounting charges and legal costs. 
 Sean Collins, a senior economist at the institute and the author of its study, says a "plausible way to make an apple-to-apple comparison" between funds and pensions is to limit the fund universe to those that hire third parties, or subadvisers, to manage their portfolios. In those instances, the management fee paid to the subadviser is typically only for pure portfolio management, akin to the advisory fee paid to a pension manager. In the institute study, when only subadviser fees are included, the differential is just $3 per $10,000 ($28 for pensions versus $31 for funds with subadvisers).
 In a statement, Mr. Spitzer said that the institute study looked at the 20 percent or so of funds that use subadvisers. "The other 80 percent of funds in the industry still pay affiliated management companies an inflated fee for investment advice," he said. "Those fees, which are not negotiated at arm's length, are significantly higher than the fees charged by subadvisers." 
 Big institutions like pension funds may pay lower fees partly because they bargain harder. "Institutional customers pay less because they understand the business," said Mr. Rottersman, the independent fund consultant. "They know that once a fund has at least $100 million, all the extra advisory money goes to the bottom line. But the real reason institutional customers pay less is they know high fees eat into returns and they do have to report to a board."
 While mutual fund boards certainly have the assets to push for the same lower fees, the directors, who serve both the fund company and the fund shareholder, are not necessarily inclined to push hard for lower fees. 
 Vanguard, which is owned by fund shareholders and is known for its low-cost funds, has shown that mutual fund advisory contracts can be in line with those of pension funds. The company, the second-largest fund group after Fidelity, farms out management of its nonindex stock funds to independent advisers. It negotiates with those firms much as a pension fund would: at arm's length, on the behalf of shareholders. Negotiated savings are then passed along to them.
 In their study, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Brown found that the weighted average advisory fee for 10 Vanguard funds run by outside money managers in 1999 was 0.149 percent, even lower than the 0.20 percent paid by pension plans. Those levels compared with an average of 0.50 percent for large mutual funds.
 In a recent telephone interview, Mr. Freeman said, "Vanguard's example is an embarrassment for the rest of the industry."
 The advisory fee is only one of a handful of annual charges that are bundled together and deducted from a fund's gross expenses. The combined charges, known as the expense ratio, are reported as a percentage of assets and prominently displayed in fund prospectuses as well as in fund performance tables. 
 In addition to the advisory charge, the expense ratio includes operating expenses as well as the optional 12b-1 fee, which is nominally a payment for distribution of a fund. The expense ratio does not include sales fees like front-end loads, which are paid by investors at the time of purchase, or deferred sales loads, which are levied when an investor sells fund shares.
 According to an S.E.C. report in 2000, the average weighted expense ratio climbed to 0.94 percent in 1999 from 0.73 percent in 1977. The unweighted stock fund average, according to Lipper, grew to 1.4 percent in 2002 from 0.9 percent in 1978. In dollar terms, the increase documented by the S.E.C. translates into an extra $2,410 in fees for an initial $10,000 investment held for 20 years that grows at an average annual rate of 10 percent.
 What galls proponents of fee changes is that the costs have crept up while fund assets have soared. Mr. Bogle cited a 40 percent increase in expense ratios from 1978 to 2002, despite a 114-fold increase in fund assets. 
 The absence of economies of scale in the expense ratio is in large part attributable to the industry's embrace of 12b-1 fees. Sanctioned by the S.E.C. in 1980, the 12b-1 fee was intended to help fund companies generate cash for marketing. The maximum 12b-1 fee is 1 percent. The NASD requires that no more than 0.75 percent be spent on direct marketing; an additional 0.25 percent can be designated for operational costs. 
 According to Lipper, the asset-weighted average 12b-1 fee is 0.34 percent, with a median of 0.65 percent. Total 12b-1 payments last year alone amounted to $9 billion, according to Lipper. 
 Mr. Rottersman said 12b-1 fees "were already under a lot of scrutiny before Spitzer, and now they are going to be under an even bigger political attack." 
 TO increase its share of the mutual fund supermarket business, E*Trade recently started a program that will rebate 50 percent of 12b-1 fees and some service fees to investors who hold funds in E*Trade accounts. Though E*Trade declined to provide specifics on its fund business, Lou Klobuchar, president and chief brokerage officer for E*Trade Securities, said that more than 90 percent of the funds offered through E*Trade charge the 12b-1 and service fees. Damping the impact of the rebate is the fact that the I.R.S. views the rebates as distributions that are to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. 
 The firm started working on the proposal months before Mr. Spitzer began shining a spotlight on the fund industry, Mr. Klobuchar said. He acknowledged that E*Trade's program was intended to attract more money to the company, but said it was also designed to offer a "competitive solution" to fund investors. 
 It is a solution that assumes investors are ready to be price sensitive. And in the end, Mr. Spitzer's efforts come down to the same issue: Will consumers make fees a central part of their investing strategy?
 "It's a matter of following the money," said Mr. Garland, at Lipper. "If all of this attention causes money to flow to lower-cost providers, then you will see change by the industry."

What to Do if Inflation Tries to Spoil the Party

BYLINE:  By PAUL J. LIM

 BODY:
WHILE the nation's central bankers appear convinced that the economy can continue to grow briskly without kicking up inflation fears, a growing number of money managers are not so sure. 
 Many financial planners say that for prudent investors, now is the time to deal with inflation -- before prices actually spike. 
 A December survey of U.S. fund managers by Merrill Lynch found that 71 percent thought that inflation would increase in the coming 12 months, up from just 36 percent who thought so in August. And more than a third said in December that they believed that monetary policy was too stimulative, versus only 11 percent who said so in July.
 "The Fed's motto has gone from WIN, as in 'Whip Inflation Now,' to SIN, as in 'Start Inflation Now,"' said Don Ross, chief investment officer for National City Investment Management, based in Cleveland. 
 That view, of course, runs counter to the position of the Federal Reserve. Last week, Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, reiterated that the Fed's "unusually accommodative" stance on interest rates was justified, despite concerns that the economy was recovering much faster than had been expected. (The consensus forecast is for gross domestic product to grow at an annual rate of 4.4 percent this year.)
 Mr. Bernanke said that productivity gains and a weak labor market were keeping inflation at bay. "For now, I believe that the Federal Reserve has the luxury of being patient," he told a gathering of the American Economic Association in San Diego. 
 Recent economic data appear to support his argument, at least for the short term. Core consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in November, after climbing just 0.2 percent in October. Given the absence of wage pressures, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, said, "It's hard to see inflation being a major issue for 2004." Like Mr. Zandi, Mr. Ross said he thinks that inflation won't become a real concern until 2005.
 But there are signs that inflationary pressure is simmering. The spread between the yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, and 10-year, non-indexed Treasuries has widened to 2.3 percentage points, from 1.7 in June.
 "It's a signal that inflation expectations are moving higher," said Daniel O. Shackelford, co-manager of the T. Rowe Price Inflation Protected Bond fund.
 Commodity prices, meanwhile, have continued to boom. And though prices for finished goods are stable, producer prices for crude goods were up more than 18 percent in November versus the same period in 2002, according to the Labor Department. 
 Another factor that could drive prices higher, economists say, is further weakness in the dollar, which could increase the cost of imported goods for American consumers.
 "I think we're going to have more inflation than almost everybody expects," said John Bollinger, president of Bollinger Capital Management, based in Manhattan Beach, Calif. Given the enormous amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus injected into the economy in the past two years, Mr. Bollinger said he thought that the nation could be headed toward 3 to 4 percent inflation in 2004, with an "outside chance of seeing it north of 4 percent."
 John Caldwell, chief investment strategist for the McDonald Financial Group, based in Cleveland, said he thought that was a bit high. Still, Mr. Caldwell said strong economic growth and the Fed's willingness to keep short-term rates low could produce inflation of more than 2.5 percent this year. 
 That would be a jump from present levels. The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, rose only 1.1 percent over the past 12 months. 
 "People underestimate the impact of even modest inflation in a modest-return environment," said Harold Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla. He argues that while 3 percent inflation may be tolerable in a period of 20 percent gains in equity prices, 3 percent inflation can quickly dent a portfolio earning just 6 or 7 percent annually.
 Many financial planners are advising investors to start preparing their portfolios for a possible climb in prices.
 "Since every talking head on the news and in print says they aren't worried about inflation, you better have it on your radar," says Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management in Los Angeles. 
 "You don't have to change the asset classes you invest in," Ms. Cohen said. "You just have to change the way those assets are invested." 
 For instance, she recommends that bond investors shorten the overall duration or maturities of their fixed-income investments. For those who invest in bond funds, that means going from long-term portfolios to intermediate- and short-term funds. 
 As for traditional inflation hedges like gold, financial planners say it is important to weigh their risks, just as investors should weigh the risk of inflation itself. 
 For instance, gold and basic materials stocks already enjoyed substantial run-ups in 2003 as the economy began to rebound. Gold recently shot up to more than $430 an ounce, its highest level in a decade and a half. 
 Shares of basic-materials companies, which stand to benefit from rising prices -- had a 35 percent return, on average, in 2003. These stocks are now trading at 24 times 2004 earnings, making this sector the second most expensive in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, after technology.
 An alternative is inflation-protected bonds, or TIPS. Created in 1997, these Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, as are other Treasury instruments. But unlike a traditional bond, with a fixed principal value, these securities have a principal amount that rises with inflation. So if you invest $1,000 in a 10-year TIP and inflation kicks up 10 percent over the next decade, you will get back $1,100 at maturity, in addition to the interest payments along the way. 
 Because investors must pay federal taxes annually not only on interest payments but also on the periodic inflation-adjustments made to the bond's principal (even though investors don't receive this so-called phantom income until redemption), financial planners recommend investing in TIPS through a tax-advantaged account. 
 I-Bonds, United States savings bonds that also offer inflation protection, are not tax-disadvantaged in this way. That means you do not receive interest from these savings bonds until you redeem them. They can be bought for as little as $50 at a bank or directly from the Treasury. But these savings bonds aren't that compelling today, because I-Bonds bought from now to April are yielding only 2.19 percent, less than the yield for the average two-year certificate of deposit.
 Money managers caution against ignoring the risks in TIPS, which are a relatively new asset class. "We should dispel the notion that you can't lose money in this investment,"said John Hollyer, co-manager of the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund, which invests in a variety of TIPS. 
 Eric Jacobson, an analyst at Morningstar who follows TIPS funds, notes that when interest rates spiked in July, inflation-protected bond funds lost 4.8 percent of their value that month. For 2003 over all, TIPS funds, which invest in government inflation-indexed bonds of varying maturities, produced an average gain of 7.7 percent. And over the past three years, the average TIPS fund delivered annualized returns of 10.4 percent, which explains their popularity in recent years, despite low inflation.
 Investors need to be aware of interest rate risk with these bonds, Mr. Jacobson said. For instance, if real interest rates --market rates minus the rate of inflation -- spike, the underlying price of TIPS could easily fall again, as it did in July. Sticking with intermediate-term TIPS funds, instead of long-term portfolios, may reduce but not eliminate this risk. TIPS investors may also be hurt if market interest rates rise in anticipation of inflation that never comes. If commodity prices continue to climb and the economy shows signs of accelerating, the bond market could sell off, pushing long-term market interest rates higher, even if the Fed kept short-term rates low.
 But if the bond market is wrong and inflation stays low, real rates would still climb, threatening the underlying value of TIPS.
 STILL, C. Casey Colton, manager of the American Century Inflation-Adjusted Bond fund, argues that if market interest rates rise alongside even modest inflation, TIPS funds are likely to do better than traditional Treasury bond funds. That is because "real rates would rise at a slower rate than nominal rates," Mr. Colton said. 
 The average expense ratio of the 18 TIPS funds tracked by Morningstar is 0.51 percent of assets, which is competitive with other bond fund categories. But the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund charges just 0.22 percent. And Barclays Global Investors recently started an exchange-traded fund -- an index fund that trades like a stock on the New York Stock Exchange -- that tracks the TIPS market. That fund, called iShares Lehman TIPS Bond, has an expense ratio of 0.20 percent.
Perhaps TIPS investors would face their biggest risk if the economy grew as quickly as some people now expect, and without much inflation. 
 "In that case," said Mr. Shackelford at T. Rowe Price, "there's an argument to be made that real yields offered by TIPS would start to look too low relative to returns offered by other assets" -- namely stocks.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN; 
Political Points

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
All Tax Talk, No Action?
 HOW many Democratic tax plans can dance on the head of a pin?
 While the presidential candidates are out in Iowa passionately debating precisely which parts of the Bush tax cuts they will repeal, back in Washington some observers consider it an oddly hypothetical exercise. Virtually no one on Capitol Hill expects the Democrats to win control of Congress in November. So how much chance would any Democratic president have of persuading a Republican majority in either chamber to increase taxes next year? 
 "The answer is zero," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the finance committee. "Only 3 or 4 of the 10 Democrats on my committee would vote to get rid of the tax cuts. None of the Republicans would." 
"It's about as likely as Hillary Clinton becoming a Republican," replied John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
"No chance," said Grover G. Norquist, a leading Republican strategist and the president of Americans for Tax Reform, which has secured pledges from nearly half of the members of Congress not to raise taxes.
Like other conservatives, Mr. Norquist predicts that Democratic tax policy will play badly in the campaign, but he still does not forecast an easy Republican victory in November. No matter which Democrat is nominated, he said, the candidate can benefit from other pocketbook issues that a Democratic president could actually do something about: trade policy, tort reform and privatization of federal jobs.
"The Democrats could win because their base has more at stake economically than the Republican base," Mr. Norquist said. "The unions know that four more years of Bush will mean a huge number of union jobs lost to new free-trade agreements and the outsourcing of the federal work force. Even modest tort reform could cost the trial lawyers tens of billions of dollars. It's perfectly reasonable to think that Democratic groups will spend $400 million on this election. If their team doesn't win, they don't eat."

Ye Sushi-Eating Body Piercers!
 IOWANS have just discovered your role in the vast left-wing conspiracy. They even know about your passions for eating sushi and sticking pins through your flesh. The Club for Growth, a conservative group, has put you in a $100,000 advertising campaign in Iowa. The group's attack advertisement, which made its debut on Des Moines television on Wednesday, shows a husband and wife talking about Howard Dean's proposal to repeal the Bush tax cuts.
"Howard Dean," the husband says, "should take his tax-hiking, government-expanding, latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New-York-Times-reading" -- at which point the wife interrupts to finish the sentence -- "body-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freak show back to Vermont, where it belongs."
Could this really be you, gentle reader? Given that about half of the Times's circulation is in the New York metropolitan area, a heavily Democratic region, it may be reasonable to guess that a majority of readers vote Democratic. But Catherine J. Mathis, a spokeswoman for The Times, said the newspaper itself did not know the political affiliation of its readers -- much less their preferences in coffee and Japanese food.
Stephen Moore, the president of the Club for Growth, said the commercial was not based on market research about Times readers. In fact, the original script had "NPR-listening" instead, he said, but he changed it to Times-reading to appeal to Iowans angered by a Times editorial suggesting the presidential campaign would improve if candidates skipped the Iowa's caucuses.
"We're trying to present an image of Northeast liberals," Mr. Moore said. But as a resident of Washington, doesn't he fit some of the stereotypes himself? What about sushi?
"I don't eat sushi," Mr. Moore said. "I don't drive a Volvo. I don't read The Times -- except for the Political Points column, of course. I don't drink latte. I do have my navel pierced, though."

Labels 'n' Labels For Red 'n' Blue
 FOR a more scientific breakdown of America's electoral divide, you can choose from two new surveys identifying yet more groups for candidates to worry about.
Republicans can now break their base into categories like Country Folk (whites outside metropolitan areas), The Faithful (born-again Christian fundamentalists and other Protestants) and Privileged Men (white college graduates). Those labels come from "The Two Americas," a new book by Stanley B. Greenberg, the pollster who guided Bill Clinton.
Mr. Greenberg breaks the Democratic base into categories like Secular Warriors (people who rarely attend church and do not own a gun) and Cosmopolitan States (New England, New York, New Jersey and California). While Super-Educated Women (those with postgraduate degrees) are reliable Democrats, men with postgraduate degrees are more fickle. Other groups up for grabs include Devout Catholics (white non-Hispanic Catholics who attend Mass weekly), Aging Blues (men or women over 50 without college degrees) and the Young and the Restless (whites under 30). 
In a separate poll analyzing the blue-red divide, Zogby International has identified two other groups that vote Republican: people who attend high school sports events and people who attend Little League games. This was called the division between Hometown Values and Hollywood Values by The O'Leary Report, the conservative publication that conducted the poll along with Zogby and Southern Methodist University.
The poll also found that groups called the Defenders (people whose family includes a current or retired member of the military) and Wealth-Builders (those with stocks or 401(k) plans) are significantly more likely to vote Republican. 
Like Mr. Greenberg's poll, the Zogby survey found that Democrats go to church a lot less often than Republicans do. If you believe that new commercial in Iowa, you might wonder if this is because Democrats are too busy on Sunday morning reading the paper. But that theory has not yet been investigated.

Purple Heart Award
Some might have relished the chance to snipe at a rival, but not Steve Murphy, the manager of Richard A. Gephardt's campaign. "We have been friends a long time and it is with a heavy heart that I write this letter," he began a missive on Thursday to Joe Trippi, the manager of the Dean campaign, that accused him of trying to sneak out-of-staters into the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Trippi promptly replied with a letter of rebuttal telling how saddened he was by the "sleazy tactics" of Mr. Murphy, and concluding that "it is with a particularly heavy heart that I send this letter." Whose heart tips the scales? Let them sadly share the honor.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW; 
CAMPAIGN IN IOWA IS CALLED PIVOTAL AND STILL CLOSE

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Eight days before the Iowa caucuses that will start the voting for the Democratic presidential nomination, Howard Dean and Richard A. Gephardt are battling for dominance in what many Democrats describe as the most contested and potentially decisive caucus campaign their party has seen here in 16 years.
 Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont who has spent two years methodically campaigning through all 99 counties in Iowa, heads into the final week here in the unlikely position of leading the Democratic field in national polls in his very first bid for national office. 
 The transformation of Dr. Dean's candidacy was underscored by his appearances in eastern Iowa on Saturday with two faces of the Democratic establishment: Senator Tom Harkin, the dominant Democrat in this state, whose endorsement on Friday provided a big boost to his campaign, and Al Gore, the 2000 presidential nominee. 
But Mr. Gephardt, who emerged the victor in the caucuses in 1988 and still has a strong base of support here, moved aggressively to block a Dean victory in Iowa, which his own aides said would almost certainly spell an end to Mr. Gephardt's second bid for the presidency. 
At an appearance in Waterloo on Saturday, Mr. Gephardt, a congressman from neighboring Missouri, lambasted Dr. Dean for being "all over the lot" on issues ranging from the war in Iraq to Medicare. Here in Des Moines, representatives from nearly two dozen unions spent the weekend putting the finishing touches on a get-out-the-vote operation that Mr. Gephardt's advisers said would counter what even they described as the phenomenal enthusiasm of Dr. Dean's supporters.
The competition here has been complicated by spirited bids by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, each of whom has calculated that coming in second, or perhaps third, in Iowa would lift his candidacy going into the New Hampshire primary a week later. Gen. Wesley K. Clark and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut are not competing here.
Mr. Kerry, campaigning with Senator Edward M. Kennedy at his side on a sprint across a state that might well determine whether his campaign survives the month, said, "We're going to have a hell of a fight going into the last week."
In an interview, the Iowa governor, Tom Vilsack, a Democrat said, "It is a very tight race."
The Iowa caucus contest is ending in an electoral environment quite different from what Democrats expected when planning for this moment a year ago. At the time, the nation was embroiled in a debate over whether to go to war, and the economy was in a downturn.
By some measures, the economy is showing signs of life, and it is certainly less of an issue than Democrats had hoped it might be now. In a poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers by The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times that was released on Saturday, a third said the economy was now doing well. 
And with Saddam Hussein captured, the subject of the war, which more than anything else has framed this contest, accounting for Dr. Dean's rise and the difficulties of Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Kerry, appears to command less attention. Thus, candidates and aides were more likely to be focusing on tactics and strategy than the problems facing the next occupant of the White House.
In this frenzied environment and given the number of candidates, Democratic leaders predicted a turnout exceeding the 125,000 caucusgoers who voted the last time the Democrats had such a crowded and competitive fight, in 1988. But they said that many Iowans remain unenthused with the field and undecided over whom to support. That sense was supported by interviews with Iowans over the week, and the Tribune-Times poll, which found that 40 percent of caucusgoers who said they had chosen a candidate said they could still change their minds.
"It's going to be a fight to convince the undecideds," said Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist.
And in endorsing Dr. Dean on Friday, Mr. Harkin specifically said he was trying to sway "those who are undecided." That appeal reflected concern among Dr. Dean's advisers about a last-minute rush of support to other candidates by these voters.
To muddy matters more, Democrats said it has been increasingly clear that any success by Senators Kerry and Edwards at coming in second or third could draw votes from Mr. Gephardt or Dr. Dean, pulling them out of first place. That dynamic has become particularly apparent with Mr. Edwards, who is making a concerted effort to draw votes from Mr. Gephardt, to the concern of Mr. Gephardt's advisers and to the delight of the Dean camp.
And Mr. Edwards was expected to receive a big lift from the endorsement of The Des Moines Register in its Sunday edition. 
In an indication of how Byzantine the maneuverings here have become, Mr. Harkin, in endorsing Dr. Dean, went out of his way to praise Mr. Edwards, in what Democrats saw as a not-too-subtle effort to build up Mr. Edwards's vote total at the expense of Mr. Gephardt.
Given the fluidity of the race, the focus of the campaigns has turned to the rudiments of what it takes to triumph in the arcane caucus system that inaugurates the Democratic nomination process. 
The candidates have splurged on television advertisements and attack mailings and have built huge and ambitious get-out-the-vote operations. Their efforts, apparent this weekend in bustling campaign headquarters filled with people who clearly are not from Iowa, reflect the calculation that the outcome could prove pivotal in determining whom the Democrats nominate in Boston.
Mr. Gephardt has embraced traditional methods of winning this contest, putting to service veterans of the Iowa caucuses and importing labor leaders to replicate the get-out-the-vote operation he used in winning here in 1988.
Dr. Dean has the benefit of his own union support, but his candidacy is distinguished by the excitement he has stirred among his supporters and by 3,500 reinforcements from out of state that the campaign says will help recruit caucusgoers, and get them to caucus sites on Jan. 19.
"We have more people on the ground than any presidential campaign in the history of Iowa caucuses," said Dr. Dean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, who worked on Mr. Gephardt's 1988 effort here. 
"In the last 10 days, it's organize, organize, organize," Mr. Trippi said. "It's get-out-the-vote, get-out-the-vote, get-out-the-vote."
Mr. Gephardt's campaign manager, Steve Murphy, offered a mirror view of the state of play here. "It's a very close race, and organization is going to make a difference, and Dick Gephardt has by far the best organization in the state," he said.
Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, Mary Beth Cahill, said on Saturday that Mr. Kerry was in a strong position going into the final week of the campaign. She predicted that Dr. Dean would be hurt in these final days by the confluence of a series of missteps by the candidate, including the release of a four-year-old television interview in which he disparages the Iowa caucuses.
"There's a lot of negative information about Governor Dean in the news coverage, and it's coming at a critical time," Ms. Cahill said.
By the measure of campaign polls including the Tribune-Times survey of 640 likely Democratic caucusgoers, Mr. Gephardt and Dr. Dean are fighting for the lead. In the Tribune-Times poll, conducted Monday through Wednesday, 30 percent said they would support Dr. Dean, and 23 percent named Mr. Gephardt. That difference falls within the poll's margin of error, and thus in theory, at least, the two men might be tied
Mr. Kerry was named by 18 percent of the respondents, followed by Mr. Edwards with 11 percent.
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio is also making a spirited run here, and he has pockets of support across Iowa. Former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois is running what many Democrats described as a perfunctory campaign here.
General Clark, Senator Lieberman and the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York, for their part, are focusing on New Hampshire and the other states that follow Iowa.
General Clark in particular has moved aggressively to turn his absence to his advantage, campaigning intensely through New Hampshire and, as many Democrats said, benefiting from being out of the line of fire in Iowa.
On Friday evening, General Clark's advisers said he was scaling back what was supposed to be a national fly-around to spend more time in New Hampshire. 
The decision was conveyed in a photocopied, hand-written note slipped under the doors of reporters traveling with the general. "Hope you've had as much fun this week as I've had," it read. "In fact, we're having so much fun here in New Hampshire that we've decided to come back sooner than planned! Wes Clark."
Here in Des Moines, the sense that the long build-up was over and voting nearly at hand could be found in a tour of some of the campaign headquarters here in the state capital. Dr. Dean's campaign headquarters has grown to encompass nearly a full block of Locust Street, an electric, warehouse-size expanse filled with Iowans, out-of-staters wearing knapsacks and organizers from New Hampshire. 
Mr. Kerry's office was less crowded and slightly more somber, reflecting what his own advisers described as the difficult, though hardly impossible, task he faces in trying to resuscitate his once high-flying campaign. Across town in west Des Moines, Mr. Gephardt's campaign headquarters was nearly as quiet as an insurance company; unlike the free-flowing Dean and Kerry headquarters, a receptionist checked guests at the door.
From the start, the contest here was framed by turmoil over the war in Iraq, starting with the debate in Congress over authorizing Mr. Bush to go to war and culminating late last week with reports that 12 members of the Iowa National Guard were injured in a mortar attack in northern Iraq. The anti-war sentiment largely accounted for Dr. Dean's quick rise and solid base of support here; it has also proved to be a continuing hurdle for Mr. Gephardt, one of the authors of the war resolution, and Mr. Kerry, who voted for it.
Although the discussion of the war is no longer as prevalent as it once was, its influence on the race was clear again this week. "When the war goes badly -- we had bad war news today -- I think that just fires up the people who are Dean supporters," Mr. Link said. "The war is still more of a motivating factor than the economy."
But Governor Vilsack said that at this point in the campaign, what the candidates were saying could prove less decisive than what their campaigns were doing to prepare for next Monday.
"I think you're going to continue to see shots taken at Dr. Dean, but I think over the next couple of days, those shots will be less effective," Mr. Vilsack said. "You get to the point where people tune it off and tune it out. And then it's not really about the public message, as it is about the behind-the-scenes efforts to get people to the caucuses."

 Re "Second Thoughts on Free Trade," by Charles Schumer and Paul Craig Roberts (Op-Ed, Jan. 6): 
 The fact that a worker in India now can write lines of computer code for I.B.M. does not pose an existential threat to economic theory. 
Falling transportation and information costs have allowed us to split the production of goods and some services into chunks that are done in many parts of the world. Within each industry, the jobs shifted overseas tend to be the lowest-skilled ones. The result, for us and for other countries, is lower-cost goods, more investment resources and a higher average standard of living.
If your job is the one outsourced, this is no consolation. But the appropriate job of public policy is not to protect any particular class of jobs, but to give the average American worker the skills and flexibility necessary to adjust to changes in the global marketplace.

 Re "Second Thoughts on Free Trade," by Charles Schumer and Paul Craig Roberts (Op-Ed, Jan. 6): 
 After American companies succeed in outsourcing many of their jobs in the name of cutting costs and in the process create large numbers of unemployed or minimally employed in America, to whom in the "home markets" will these companies sell their products?

To the Editor:
 Charles Schumer and Paul Craig Roberts (Op-Ed, Jan. 6) are concerned that the United States is entering a new era in which its workers at almost every job level will face global wage competition -- all because of free trade and the ability to shift resources around the world more efficiently. 
They believe that America's trade policies should be rethought. 
 Any rethinking of this issue should keep in mind another issue: the income gap between rich and poor countries. One could assume from arguments in the article that American jobs would be protected if capital and technology flows into poor countries were restricted and improvements to their educational systems curtailed. 
Limiting the free flow of goods and productive resources around the world would only exacerbate the world's income gap.

 Charles Schumer and Paul Craig Roberts (Op-Ed, Jan. 6) illustrate their doubts about free trade in the modern global economy with the following example: "Within five years the number of radiologists in this country is expected to decline significantly because M.R.I. data can be sent over the Internet to Asian radiologists capable of diagnosing the problem at a small fraction of the cost." 
 Perhaps I'm just an old-fashioned economist. Or maybe I'm just a consumer who is fed up with regular and substantial annual increases in my health insurance premium. But shouldn't American consumers be applauding anything that brings down the skyrocketing cost of health care?

Reading the Index To Beat the Index

BYLINE:  By HOWARD ISENSTEIN

 BODY:
INDEX funds mirror the market, and they appeal to investors who realize that most fund managers do not beat the market for extended periods. But by tweaking the mathematical approach taken by index funds, Dimensional Fund Advisors has often been able to beat them.
 The company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., is known in the academic world and among professionals -- those who manage assets for pension funds and other big institutions -- for its canny trading, sophisticated use of computer modeling and an emphasis on small-cap stocks. 
 But DFA, as it is often called, is hardly a household word among individual investors, largely because the company requires minimum investments of $2 million for many of its funds. (DFA funds are also available without such requirements through some 401(k) plans, and at minimums of $100,000 to $200,000 through some financial advisers.) 
 The company was founded in 1981 in the spare bedroom of David G. Booth, now the chief executive and co-chairman. According to John C. Siciliano, the company's director of global institutional services, it manages $39 billion for pension funds, like those of the Boeing Company and the states of Utah and Missouri, along with 39 mutual funds. 
 Mr. Booth and Rex A. Sinquefield, the other co-founder and co-chairman, together own half of the company. Employees and board members own an additional 22 percent, and 28 individual investors own the remainder. Among them is Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. Mr. Siciliano said that Mr. Schwarzenegger was an "outside investor" with less than 5 percent ownership of the company. "Our outside investors are strictly investors and do not have a role in the management or strategy of the company," he said.
 A spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger declined to comment.
 Both Mr. Sinquefield and Mr. Booth graduated from the University of Chicago with M.B.A.'s, and their company's investing approach has been heavily influenced by the theories of academics, some of whom are consultants or part-owners of the company. These include Eugene F. Fama, a finance professor at the University of Chicago; Kenneth French, a finance professor at Dartmouth; and Robert C. Merton, a Nobel laureate in economics and a professor at Harvard Business School. 
 Professor Fama, who owns less than 5 percent of the firm, is its director of research, while Professor French is director of investment strategy. (Professor Fama has served as an economic adviser to Mr. Schwarzenegger, said Paul Wachter, Mr. Schwarzenegger's personal financial adviser.)
 DFA uses 24 criteria to weed out stocks that it expects to underperform in a given asset class or are not germane to it, Mr. Siciliano said. For example, the firm considers only companies that have been audited by a major accounting firm, that are profitable and that do not face any material litigation. It excludes initial public offerings and real estate investment trusts (except for inclusion in its real estate fund), and stocks for which a majority of shares are not traded publicly.
 In the small-cap universe, which has about 5,000 stocks, the screens would leave about 3,500, Mr. Siciliano said. The company uses its own stock and market analysis to form portfolios, which resemble the underlying universe of screened stocks but do not necessarily mirror it precisely.
 PURE index funds adhere scrupulously to the weighting of the stocks and bonds in an underlying index. But when DFA's fund managers decide that it is time to buy or sell a security, they often wait for a few days or weeks to get better prices.
 "We get shown about 1,000 blocks" of stocks a day, Mr. Siciliano said. "We may do 5 or 20" block orders, he added, "and look for a transaction that's below the bid," or lowest price generally offered. Because the firm is a very large trader in the small-cap arena, it often succeeds, Mr. Siciliano said, adding that 40 percent of its small-cap trades were done at a discount to the market price. 
 The ability to screen stocks with sophisticated mathematical techniques and to buy below the bid are among the firm's competitive advantages, and they have been exemplified in the DFA U.S. Micro Cap Portfolio, the firm's first mutual fund. According to a DFA-financed study by Donald B. Keim, a DFA consultant and a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the Micro Cap Portfolio has outperformed its closest benchmark, an obscure index known as the CRSP 9-10, by 2.92 percentage points, annualized, since its inception in 1982. 
 DFA's funds have generally fared well in recent years. Its Micro Cap Portfolio, for example, gained 16.8 percent in the last quarter and 60.7 percent in 2003, placing it in the top 6 percent of funds in its category for the year, according to Morningstar. In the five years through 2003, it returned 16.4 percent, annualized. Its U.S. Small Cap Value fund gained 20.7 percent in the quarter and 59.4 percent for 2003, to finish in the top 13 percent of funds in its category for the year. In the five years through 2003, it returned 16.9 percent, annualized. 
 DFA keeps fees relatively low. They average 0.49 percent of assets, well above the 0.26 percent average at Vanguard but far below the average of 1.44 percent for all mutual funds, according to Morningstar. 
 Paul Herbert, who covers DFA for Morningstar, said it had "a good reputation in the financial planning and institutional communities," because of its specific style, low costs and good performance. 
 Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has a similar view. "It's a very disciplined group" in terms of maintaining investment objectives and analyzing small-cap stocks, he said.
 The firm's emphasis on small-cap stocks has not always produced good returns. From 1996 through 1999, for example, a time when growth stocks were sizzling, the small-cap value fund trailed the Standard & Poor's 500, sometimes by large margins; in 1998, the fund lost 7.3 percent, a performance that was 35.9 percentage points worse than the index's. And the 1980's were bad for small-cap stocks, which were hit particularly hard by the recession early in the decade and lagged behind the market in subsequent years. 
 But the firm stuck to its strategy, Mr. Booth said, because "if you don't have a strong belief system, then you blunder when trends are going the other way." 
 For individual investors, the most obvious problem with DFA funds is buying them. "We're really not equipped to be a retail sales organization," Mr. Siciliano said. "We're an investment research shop." 
 Mr. Herbert of Morningstar says that this is an advantage for fund shareholders because DFA does not "have to deal with finicky flows" into and out of its funds, which can hurt liquidity and returns.
 The firm's funds are available to retail investors in two ways -- through about 800 fee-only financial planners (www.dfaus.com/find--advisor) or through about 35 major 401(k) plans, including those of Verizon Communications, BellSouth and the Sandia Corporation. Many of those plans offer a handful of DFA funds, often its Small Cap, Small Cap Value, Micro Cap, International Value and One-Year Fixed Income funds, Mr. Siciliano said.

HEADLINE: Visitors See North Korea Nuclear Capacity 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
North Korea declared Saturday that it had shown what it called a "nuclear deterrent" to an unofficial delegation of visiting Americans, but officials familiar with their visit to the North's main nuclear site said they had seen the facilities to produce bomb fuel rather than an actual weapon.
 The members of the delegation, speaking in Beijing, declined to give a description of the facilities they inspected until they had a chance to brief the Bush administration, probably next week. But officials who have received sketchy reports say the tour was clearly intended to signal to the United States that President Bush's efforts to dissuade North Korea from moving forward with its nuclear program had failed, and that officials in Washington should accept the fact that North Korea is an undeclared nuclear power, much as it accepts that Pakistan and Israel are nuclear-weapons nations. 
 "This was all about saying, 'See, we've got it, so treat us with some respect,' " said an official familiar with the trip to Yongbyon, the facility two hours north of Pyongyang, the capital. 
It is at Yongbyon -- where international inspectors were ejected a year ago -- that North Korea has an extensive complex of nuclear reactors, a facility to reprocess spent nuclear fuel into bomb-grade fuel and a testing area to detonate the high explosives that would fit into a warhead.
The delegation included John W. Lewis, a Stanford University professor emeritus; Jack Pritchard, a former State Department official with long experience dealing with North Korea who resigned last year after he expressed his dissatisfaction with Mr. Bush's approach to the country; and Dr. Siegfried Hecker, a former director of Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. Dr. Hecker has high-level security clearances and long experience with nuclear weapons, and it is his judgments that the administration wants to hear, officials in Washington said Saturday.
The Central Intelligence Agency has long concluded that North Korea obtained enough plutonium to build one or two nuclear weapons in the late 1980's or early 1990's, and it told Congress last summer that the North had the designs to build a reliable weapon even without conducting a test. But one of the mysteries has been how much bomb fuel the North produced in 2003, once inspectors were ejected and its plutonium reprocessing facilities were started up. The consensus of American intelligence officials is that the reprocessing is incomplete, but that the North probably made enough fuel last year for two or three more weapons.
"That's the issue that we hope Hecker will shed some light on," a senior official said.
But several experts have noted that even if the visitors had been shown the reprocessing facility, it would be difficult to determine how much material was reprocessed last year. The delegation did not have the kind of sophisticated equipment that the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency, usually carries during full-fledged inspections.
Inviting the delegation appears to be part of North Korea's strategy in advance of another meeting with the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, which was to have taken place last month. It has been delayed, in part because North Korea and the United States could not agree on a proposal for a communique that would be issued after the meeting; the communique would point the way toward some combination of a nuclear freeze and gradual disarmament by the North, and diplomatic and economic benefits for the country from Washington and its allies.
"At this point, the Chinese have pretty much given up on holding a meeting with a pre-agreed outcome," said an Asian official involved in the process. "They are now just trying to put a meeting together."
In a statement issued on its official news service, the North Koreans, using the initials for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said: "As everybody knows, the United States compelled the D.P.R.K. to build a nuclear deterrent. We showed this to Lewis and his party this time."
But the North Korean account did not describe what kind of "deterrent" it had shown them, and American officials said it appeared to involve something well short of an actual weapon. There is little doubt that the North has the ability to build the weapon, so the major issue is whether it now has access to a steady supply of fuel.
In Beijing as he returned from North Korea, Mr. Lewis said his group had met officials from North Korea's Foreign Ministry, along with those with scientific and economic portfolios. But he declined to identify them and added: "We are a private delegation. We were not there to negotiate. We were not there to be inspectors."
The North Korean statement said the visit had ensured "transparency as speculative reports and ambiguous information about the D.P.R.K.'s nuclear activities are throwing hurdles in the way of settling the pending nuclear issue." On Friday, in a similar statement, North Korea declared that it would not follow the path of Libya, which recently agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities and allow inspectors into the country, Still, at various moments North Korean officials have suggested that for the right price, they might do just that.
On Tuesday, for instance, North Korea announced that it would suspend testing or production of nuclear weapons and even stop operating its nuclear power industry, in exchange for energy aid and other concessions from the United States. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called the statement "positive," but other administration officials dismissed it as far short of what the United States needs: full disarmament and inspection rights all over North Korea.
In part, that inspection is necessary because North Korea is believed to have at least one more nuclear fuel-production facility, one that makes enriched uranium. But American officials are uncertain of its location, and the visiting delegation was not shown it.

HEADLINE: Indian Skepticism of Pakistan's Leader Begins to Ease 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
For the last four years, the stately halls of the Central Secretariat buildings, the two sandstone, hilltop colossuses that house India's government, could be relied on for a skeptical view of Pakistan's president and America's ally, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
 In 1999, India identified the general as the architect of an offensive in the disputed territory of Kashmir. The conflict nearly caused a fourth war between the nuclear-armed rivals and humiliated India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 
 In July 2001, Indian officials bitterly blamed his cockiness for the scuttling of a peacemaking effort in the Indian city of Agra. In December 2001, enraged leaders in New Delhi accused him of backing terrorist groups that carried out a brazen assault on India's national Parliament building, and mobilized for war.
In short, General Musharraf, who seized power in 1999, was dismissed as reckless, aggressive and, most of all, not to be trusted.
Yet in a breakthrough this week at a regional summit meeting in Islamabad, it was General Musharraf who agreed to resume talks with India, a move that has pushed Mr. Vajpayee's popularity to a high point.
In return for India agreeing to discuss all bilateral issues, including the two countries' half-century-old dispute over Kashmir, Pakistan agreed to not allow any terrorism to emanate from its soil. That is seen as an implicit promise to end its support for a 14-year separatist insurgency in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. 
India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir. Each controls part of it. And for years, India has accused Pakistan of arming, training and financing separatist guerrillas and helping them cross into Indian-held Kashmir. Pakistan maintains that it supplies only political and moral support. Complicating the conflict, most Kashmiris appear to want simple independence.
Indian officials say they have witnessed a surprising transformation of the general.
The Indian foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, said in an interview on Saturday: "He's definitely changed. Hewas clearly more constructive" at the Islamabad meeting.
A senior Indian official who attended both the failed 2001 summit meeting and the negotiations last week in Islamabad called the Pakistani leader "a different man." "There, he was a commando," the official said. "Here, he has to rule the country."
Indian officials gave varying reasons for why India now trusts General Musharraf's pledges.
First, they said, there is concrete evidence of a change in Pakistan's policy toward Kashmir. Also, after four years of rule, they said, the general appears more measured. They also credited China, noting that Pakistan's positions became far more flexible after General Musharraf visited Beijing in early November. The Chinese news media reported that he promised not to allow Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group waging a separatist struggle in northwestern China, to be trained by militants in Pakistan.
Perhaps most important, the officials said, two assassination attempts may have convinced him to finally crack down on all militants, including those fighting in Kashmir.
General Musharraf sees change from India, too, with its agreement to seriously discuss Kashmir's status for the first time in years. 
Mr. Vajpayee's peace foray is being hailed in New Delhi as another step in an visionary effort to transform India's foreign policy and global image. The agreement on new talks comes six months after Mr. Vajpayee and his diplomats made headway toward resolving a 45-year border dispute with China.
Officials close to Mr. Vajpayee, who faces re-election this year, say his goal is to strengthen India's already booming economy, to speed development and lessen poverty. Western observers say he is also strengthening the case for India to be seen as a mature regional power credibly bidding for a coveted permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
For now, the Indian leader appears to face little domestic political risk. Opinion polls in India show wide public support for peace with Pakistan. Last month, Mr. Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party won sweeping victories in three of four state elections.
One Western observer said Mr. Vajpayee's political strength was at its highest point since he took office six years ago, calling his current position "unassailable."
But Mr. Vajpayee could not make peace alone. 
Indian officials said some of the first indications of General Musharraf's shift came at the line that divides Kashmir into two portions, one controlled by Pakistan and one by India. 
An Indian official who specializes in Kashmiri issues said infiltration by guerrillas from Pakistan's part of Kashmir into India's, as well as attacks, dropped sharply in October. In November, General Musharraf declared a cease-fire along the Kashmir dividing line.
The official said India had also intercepted radio messages from Pakistani officials urging militants not to cross into Indian-held Kashmir. In November and December, Pakistani forces detained two groups of militants trying to cross, the official said, and one complained that the Pakistani Army was discouraging them.
Indian officials said they would make their final judgment on General Musharraf in a few months, when the snow melts in Kashmir. That is when militants usually try to trek in over mountain passes.
As insurance, Indian officials say, they will continue the rapid construction of about 435 miles of fencing along the disputed border. 
The two December assassination attempts, meanwhile, have halted Indian dismissals of General Musharraf's claims that many militants are not under his influence. "There are elements that may not be within their control," Mr. Sinha, the Indian foreign minister, said.
One attempt was apparently carried out by men linked to an Islamic militant group fighting in Kashmir whose members see General Musharraf's moves toward peace as a betrayal. 
The Indian government, which now now has a stake in the general's survival, is facing the real threat that he may be assassinated. Some Pakistani officials predict that a successor "would not have the courage to proceed" with peace talks, the senior Indian official said.
Mr. Sinha recounted a farewell phone conversation in Islamabad between Mr. Vajpayee and General Musharraf that seemed to reflect that fear. In a display of goodwill that could scarcely have been imagined six months ago, the Indian leader wished his once-bitter rival well.
"We would wish him a long life," Mr. Sinha said, "and hope that nothing untoward will happen to him."

HEADLINE: Business Cheers Bush's Plan to Hire Immigrants More Easily, but Labor Is Wary 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Every year Frank Romano has trouble hiring enough workers to fill the vacancies at his nursing home chain in Massachusetts, from $60,000-a-year nurses to $8-an-hour kitchen and laundry workers.
 Not only are there not enough American-trained nurses available, said Mr. Romano, who hires 300 new workers a year, but hardly any Americans are willing to take the lowly, sweaty jobs in a nursing home's kitchen or laundry. 
 Mr. Romano has long savored one solution for such hiring woes: the federal government should make it easier to bring in workers from abroad. 
Not surprisingly, he joined executives in many industries, including hotels, restaurants, hospitals, construction and agriculture, to applaud President Bush's new proposals to revamp immigration policy and to make it easier to hire foreign workers.
"Americans just don't want to take a lower-paying, entry-level job," said Mr. Romano, founder and owner of the Essex Group, a chain of 15 nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, based in Rowley, Mass. "They will not apply for it. Last year, I had to spend close to $300,000 on help-wanted ads because it was such a struggle to find people to do the jobs we need done."
Mr. Bush's proposals would give renewable three-year visas to illegal immigrants already working in the United States as well as to foreign applicants who are newly hired for jobs here. But many unions and immigrant advocacy groups have denounced the plan, saying it would create a permanent, exploitable second-tier of workers who would never have the opportunity for permanent residency and full citizenship.
Mr. Bush's plan is an outline, and Congress is expected to add specifics when it takes up new immigration legislation. Under the plan, businesses would have to show that no Americans want the jobs available before they bring in temporary workers from abroad. Business wants that test to be minimal, with many embracing a White House proposal that businesses be allowed to hire foreigners if no Americans respond to job postings on Web sites.
But organized labor and some Congressional Democrats want businesses to satisfy strict criteria before hiring from abroad. One fear, for example, is that a business that now pays American construction laborers $11 an hour will say that it henceforth needs laborers at $6 an hour, knowing that hardly any Americans would take arduous jobs paying so little.
As a result, some labor unions say they want a wage floor incorporated into the immigration reforms.
"If you don't have these protections, you're going to have a race to the bottom," said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a liberal group that seeks to ease immigration rules. "You'll have $12-an-hour hotel workers undermined by the $7-an-hour temporary workers from overseas."
Like many other executives, Mr. Romano said he was not backing Mr. Bush's proposals in the hope of hiring immigrants at rock bottom levels, like the $5.15-an-hour federal minimum wage.
"We pay anywhere from $8 to $11 for entry-level jobs, and we provide health insurance, too," Mr. Romano said.
But labor and immigrant groups say many employers will pay the minimum wage with minimal benefits. They say Mr. Bush's proposal will leave immigrants in a weak position because their visas will be tied to their employer. If they get fired, perhaps for complaining that their employer is not paying them at least minimum wage or time-and-a-half for overtime, they could face deportation.
"As presented so far, it appears the Bush proposal protects the often abusive behavior of employers who hire undocumented workers, but leaves the workers themselves vulnerable and beholden to those employers for the right to stay here," said Terence O'Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America.
In presenting his proposals on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said his plan would take illegal immigrant workers out of the shadows and would, by giving them temporary visas, make them less vulnerable and better able to assert their rights. His proposal, business executives say, is not geared so much for small businesses that have a handful of illegal immigrant workers and often pay very low wages, but for larger businesses like hotels and nursing homes that need dozens or hundreds of new workers each year.
Xavier Teixido, who runs Harry's Savoy Grill and Harry's Seafood Grill in Wilmington, Del., applauded the president's proposal, saying that existing guest-worker programs hardly helped him. Those programs are more for farmers or high-tech companies and often require a lengthy application process. 
Last October, Mr. Teixido opened his seafood grill and had trouble hiring the 50 workers he needed. "We're in an industry that is creating a lot of jobs, creating them faster than we have the ability to fill them," he said. 
Finding enough workers is so hard that his two restaurants have a full-time recruiter and human resources director. That director, Nicole Micolucci, said Mr. Bush's proposal would help. "There is need for a larger applicant pool, and I think expanding the applicant pool for all industries would benefit everyone," Ms. Micolucci said.
For unions and some immigrant groups, there is a fear that Mr. Bush's plan would depress wages.
"He's talking about creating a class of workers, potentially a permanent class of workers, who are more vulnerable and less protected than the rest of the work force," said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy organization. "That's bad for them, and it's clearly bad for the rest of the U.S. work force. It will undercut the wages and working conditions for the permanent work force."
The Bush administration as well as many economists and business executives say the difficulties in finding enough workers for various industries is hurting the economy.
"Right now, we are facing a labor shortage which has the effect of depressing economic growth and job growth," said Randel Johnson, vice president for labor, immigration and employee benefits at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "When the economy grows more, that will have a beneficial effect on American workers."

HEADLINE: Sharon Dismisses Worries Of Loss of Jewish Identity 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel said Sunday that he saw no risk that Palestinians could undermine Israel's Jewish identity by gaining a demographic majority, dismissing a reason pressed by some members of his Likud faction for a swift exit from some of the occupied territories.
 "I don't see any demographic danger," Mr. Sharon said. 
 Speaking at a news conference with foreign correspondents here, Mr. Sharon also said Israel is willing to resume peace negotiations with Syria, provided that Syria halted all support for terrorism and droppped any conditions of its own for talks. 
Negotiations between the sides collapsed in 2000. Syria has recently renewed overtures for talks it first made, without success, last spring.
Mr. Sharon said Syria had continued to sponsor Hezbollah, a Lebanese group that is on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations.
"I believe that what should be done is that Syria should stop the help and support for terrorist agents, and if that happens I believe Israel will be ready," he said.
He said that in seeking talks, Syria might merely be trying to escape American pressure in the aftermath of the Iraq war.
While defending Israel's decades-old policy of settling Jews in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Mr. Sharon restated his intention to eventually move some of those settlements. As he met with the journalists in Jerusalem, tens of thousands of settlers and their supporters, including ministers in Mr. Sharon's government, gathered to protest in Tel Aviv.
Effi Eitam, the minister of housing and leader of the National Religious Party, told the crowd that he heard "sounds of weakness" from the prime minister.
Mr. Sharon said he did not know who was joining in the demonstration. "Israel is a democracy," he said. "Things are decided not by demonstrators, but by the government."
An architect of the settlement movement, Mr. Sharon said he understood the concerns of the demonstrators, but added, "I believe that in order to make peace, Israel will not be able to hold all the Jewish communities."
Like Israeli doves, some Likud leaders have argued recently that Israel must abandon some of the occupied territory of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or risk losing a Jewish majority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. 
Ehud Olmert, the vice prime minister and a Likud leader, stunned his faction last month by telling an Israeli newspaper that Israel risked being seen as an apartheid state. "I shudder to think that liberal Jewish organizations that shouldered the burden of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa will lead the struggle against us," he said.
His comments were widely seen as a trial balloon for Mr. Sharon. The concern for preserving a Jewish majority, long raised by Israel's left, has tended to be framed in moral terms -- that a minority should not rule over a majority, regardless of political rights. 
But Mr. Sharon framed the question in practical political terms, saying that Israel could not lose its Jewish majority because it had no plans to annex the occupied territories or to grant Israeli citizenship to Palestinians.
"There is no reason to worry about that," he said.
He also said the government was making a major effort to bring more Jews to Israel.
Ahmed Qurei, the Palestinian prime minister, warned Israel on Thursday that Palestinians might demand citizenship rights in a single Jewish-Arab state if Mr. Sharon proceeded with a threat of his own, to impose an Israeli resolution of the conflict if negotiations failed.
But Israeli officials, and some Palestinian officials, have played down that remark, noting that seeking rights as Israelis would be very unpopular among Palestinians.
Mr. Sharon has said his plan, which would include a withdrawal from at least some of the West Bank and Gaza, would leave the Palestinians with less territory than they could gain through negotiations. He has not revealed what areas or Israeli settlements might be vacated.
In the past, Mr. Sharon has criticized the occupation in moral terms, calling it bad for Israel and the Palestinians. "Holding 3.5 million Palestinians under occupation is a bad thing for Israel, for the Palestinians and for the Israeli economy," he said last May.
On Sunday, Mr. Sharon repeatedly stated his overall support, despite some reservations, for the so-called road map, the peace initiative favored by the Bush administration. He said he would proceed with his plan for unilateral separation only if peace efforts fail. 
Palestinian officials say they believe that Mr. Sharon's goal is to give up limited areas with large numbers of Palestinians -- the big cities -- to blunt the demographic threat while retaining as much land as possible.
In the West Bank on Sunday, Israeli soldiers shot and killed an 18-year-old Palestinian man. The circumstances were disputed. 
The Israeli Army said soldiers in the village of Beita, near Nablus, came under attack with rocks and shot a man who was lighting a homemade gasoline bomb. Palestinians said the young man was sitting on his balcony, studying for an exam.
In another incident on Sunday, a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself apart in the West Bank, injuring no one else, after spotting an Israeli patrol, the army said.

HEADLINE: America's Red Ink 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund has long been accused of failing to sound the alarm before countries with reckless fiscal policies implode. So it was nice to see staff members of the fund's Western Hemisphere department hold a press conference last week to publicize one nation's worrisome trends, which threaten foreign investors and the global economy.
 Who was in for the scolding? Haiti? Argentina? Mexico? Not exactly. It's the United States the fund is worried about. An economic slowdown and President Bush's huge tax cuts conspired to swing America's federal budget from a surplus of 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2000 to a deficit of some 4 percent in 2003. Add the states' own budget shortfalls and the country's trade deficit, the I.M.F. report notes, and the United States faces an "unprecedented level of external debt for a large industrial country." 
 Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, and Donald Kohn, a Federal Reserve governor, have also railed against the deficit in recent days. But there is something humbling about hearing it from an international organization charged with monitoring economies on the brink.
In most countries, the I.M.F. is often viewed as America's agent, preaching the inconvenient gospel of fiscal discipline and austerity. There is a certain poignancy now in having the I.M.F. preach the so-called "Washington consensus" to Washington.
The I.M.F. forcefully argues that the United States will need to adjust taxes and spending to bring its finances under control; the recovery alone won't do it. The fund's report warns that America's profligacy and its voracious appetite for credit will drive up interest rates around the world, threatening the global economic recovery and American productivity growth. 
Foreign investors are already selling the dollar in reaction to Washington's fiscal recklessness, but the fund warns that this selling could accelerate and create a currency crisis. It also notes that present trends pose dangers for the future of Medicare and Social Security. 
Most damning of all, the report attacks the "complicated and nontransparent manner" in which the administration's $1.7 trillion in tax cuts were enacted, designed as they were to mask their true budgetary impact. The I.M.F.'s frustration is understandable. The United States has provided other nations with a terrible model of obfuscatory governance. Congress and the Bush administration enacted "phased in" tax cuts that were supposed to be retired in a decade, accelerated their phasing in and then, after they were priced under the assumption that they would fade away, pledged to make them permanent.
No wonder the rest of the world is appalled.

HEADLINE: 'Spinning Into Control' 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The strategic reason for crushing Saddam was to reverse the tide of global terror that incubated in the Middle East. 
 Is our pre-emptive policy working? Was the message sent by ousting the Baathists as well as the Taliban worth the cost? 
 Set aside the tens of thousands of lives saved each year by ending Saddam's sustained murder of Iraqi Shia and Kurds, which is of little concern to human rights inactivists. Consider only self-defense: the practical impact of American action on the spread of dangerous weaponry in antidemocratic hands. 
1. In Libya, Colonel Qaddafi took one look at our army massing for the invasion of Iraq and decided to get out of the mass-destruction business. He has since stopped lying to gullible U.N. inspectors and -- in return for U.S. investment instead of invasion -- promises civilized behavior. The notion that this terror-supporting dictator's epiphany was not the direct result of our military action, but of decade-long diplomatic pleas for goodness and mercy, is laughable. 
2. In Afghanistan, supposedly intractable warlords in a formerly radical Islamist, female-repressing culture of conflicting tribes and languages have come together. Under our NATO security umbrella and with some U.N. guidance, a grand conclave of leaders freed by U.S. power surprised the Arab world's doubting despots with the elements of a constitution that leads the way out of the past generation's abyss of barbarism.
3. In Syria, a hiding place for Saddam's finances, henchmen and weaponry -- and exporter of Hezbollah and Hamas terrorism -- Dictator Bashar al-Assad is nervously seeking to re-open negotiations with Israel to regain strategic heights his father lost in the last Syrian aggression. Secret talks have already begun (I suspect through Turkey, Israel's Muslim friend, rather than the unfriendly European Union); this would not have happened while Saddam was able to choke off illicit oil shipments to Syria. 
4. On the West Bank, incipient Israeli negotiations with Syria -- on top of the overthrow of the despot who rewarded Palestinian suicide bombers -- further isolates the terror organizations behind Yasir Arafat. Under the pressure of Israel's security fence, and without the active support of Egypt and Saudi Arabia (each eager to retain protection of a strong-willed Bush administration), Palestinians now have incentives to find an antiterrorist leader who can deliver statehood. 
5. In Iran, the presence of 130,000 U.S. troops near the border was not lost on the despot-clerics in power, who suddenly seemed reasonable to European diplomats seeking guarantees that Russian-built nuclear plants would be inspected. Colin Powell has been secretly dickering with the so-called reform ayatollah for a year in hopes of being on the right side of a future revolution. The old "Great Satan" crowd has just barred four-score reformist Parliament members from seeking re-election. That panicky crackdown in Teheran is a sign of the rulers' weakness; the example of freedom in neighboring Iraq will help cause another part of the axis to fall. 
6. In Iraq, where casualties in Baghdad could be compared to civilian losses to everyday violence in New York and Los Angeles, a rudimentary federal republic is forming itself with all the customary growing pains. After the new Iraq walks by itself, we can expect free Iraqis to throw their crutches at the doctor. But we did not depose Saddam to impose a puppet; we are helping Iraqis defeat the diehards and resist fragmentation to set in place a powerful democratic example.
7. In North Korea, a half-world away from that example, an unofficial U.S. group was shown nuclear fuel facilities at Yongbyon to demonstrate that the world faced a real threat. But the U.S. has given China to understand that nuclear-armed Pyongyang would lead to missile defenses in Japan and Taiwan, a potential challenge to China's Asian hegemony. Our new credibility is leading China to broker an enforceable agreement like the kind Libya has offered, with economic sweeteners tightly tied to verification. 
The columnist Jim Hoagland cautions that it is too early to proclaim that nonproliferation is "spinning into control." But taken together, this phased array of fallout to our decision to lead the world's war against terror makes the case that what we have been doing is strategically sound as well as morally right.

HEADLINE: Bush Sought to Oust Hussein From Start, Ex-Official Says 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush was focused on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq from the start of his administration, more than seven months before the terrorist attacks that he later cited as the trigger for a more aggressive foreign policy, Paul H. O'Neill, Mr. Bush's first Treasury secretary, said in an interview broadcast on Sunday.
 "From the very beginning, there was a conviction that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go," Mr. O'Neill said in an interview with the CBS program "60 Minutes." 
 Mr. O'Neill, who was dismissed by Mr. Bush more than a year ago over differences on economic policy, said Iraq was discussed at the first National Security Council meeting after Mr. Bush's inauguration. The tone at that meeting and others, Mr. O'Neill said, was "all about finding a way to do it," with no real questioning of why Mr. Hussein had to go or why it had to be done then. "For me, the notion of pre-emption, that the U.S. has the unilateral right to do whatever we decide to do, is a really huge leap," Mr. O'Neill said.
Mr. O'Neill gave the interview to "60 Minutes" to promote a new book, "The Price of Loyalty," by Ron Suskind. Mr. O'Neill cooperated extensively on the book, turning over 19,000 documents from his two years as Treasury secretary, including transcripts of National Security Council meetings, Mr. Suskind told "60 Minutes."
Mr. O'Neill also gave an interview to Time magazine, which quoted him as casting doubt on the strength of the evidence Mr. Bush cited in making the case for war with Iraq.
"In the 23 months I was there, I never saw anything that I would characterize as evidence of weapons of mass destruction," Mr. O'Neill told Time, speaking of his tenure in the administration. "There were allegations and assertions by people. But I've been around a hell of a long time, and I know the difference between evidence and assertions and illusions or allusions and conclusions that one could draw from a set of assumptions.
"To me there is a difference between real evidence and everything else," he continued. "And I never saw anything in the intelligence that I would characterize as real evidence."
Mr. O'Neill, a former chairman of Alcoa, served in the Nixon and Ford administrations and was close to Vice President Dick Cheney and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. O'Neill had a rocky tenure as Treasury secretary. His departure came after he made it clear he differed with the White House over the need for more tax cuts. In his typically blunt style, he made no effort at the time to pretend he was not angry and hurt over being forced out.
But the account of his service to Mr. Bush, as given to Mr. Suskind, whose book is to be published Tuesday, is the first by a former senior Bush administration official. It is sure to fuel questions from Mr. Bush's political opponents about the administration's rationale for invading Iraq, and to focus new attention on Mr. Bush's management style and the balance in the White House between politics and policy.
A White House spokesman, Ken Lisaius, said on Sunday night that the administration "simply is not in the business of doing book reviews." 
Mr. Lisaius said the book and the interviews appeared to be "an attempt to justify the former secretary's own opinions instead of the results this administration has achieved on behalf of the American people."
In the interviews and in excerpts from the book, Mr. O'Neill described Mr. Bush as hard to read and seemingly disengaged from the details of many policy debates. He portrayed Mr. Cheney as unwilling to serve the role of honest broker during those debates.
In the interviews on Sunday, Mr. O'Neill did not describe in depth the early discussions about removing Mr. Hussein from power. Mr. Suskind told "60 Minutes" that he had documents dating from before Sept. 11, 2001, showing planning for the aftermath of a war with Iraq, covering peacekeeping forces, war crimes tribunals and Iraqi oil fields.
Since the Clinton administration, the official position of the United States, backed by bipartisan votes in Congress, has been to call for "regime change" in Iraq. Even before taking office, Mr. Bush had spoken to exiled Iraqi opponents of Mr. Hussein about his desire to drive the Iraqi leader from power.
But the administration has disclosed few details of its early thinking about war with Iraq and did not publicly raise the prospect of such a war seriously until August 2002.

HEADLINE: Expectations Are Low for Progress at Americas Conference 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER and ELISABETH BUMILLER; Tim Weiner reported from Monterrey, Mexico, and Elisabeth Bumiller from Crawford, Tex., for this article.

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush and 33 elected leaders of the Americas will meet here on Monday without a common vision for the future of the Western Hemisphere.
 Expectations for great progress are low and friction on important proposals is high. The leaders of Brazil and Argentina do not see eye to eye with Mr. Bush on his free-trade agenda. President Vicente Fox of Mexico will press him to do more for migrants than his proposition of temporary work permits. 
 The national security needs of the United States are being viewed by some leaders as imperious demands on their sovereignty. American agricultural subsidies are seen by some as crushing small peasant farmers and stifling competition.
Government ministers from the 34 nations at this Summit of the Americas, who have met here since Thursday, had not even agreed on a common declaration to be issued by their leaders. An American official here said there were only "possibilities at the margins" for the United States' agenda of advancing trade, security and migration control.
"There's a tremendous amount of discontent in Latin America with the United States," said Arturo Valenzuela, a former senior National Security Council staff member.
At the top of the political agenda for Mr. Bush in Mexico is his proposal to control illegal immigration by offering temporary work permits. Since more than half of the illegal workers in the United States are Mexicans, he is seeking strong support from President Fox, who says he likes the idea but wants more from Congress.
"I'm convinced it will pass," Mr. Fox said in an interview with The New York Times on Friday, "because it's very convenient for the United States" to know both the legal identities and the labor value of illegal workers.
Mr. Fox also said Friday that he would "travel to the United States as often as possible" promoting the best possible deal for Mexican migrants.
"They are working in restaurants, they are picking mushrooms, they are harvesting broccoli, working in McDonald's, working at Wal-Mart," he said of millions of illegal Mexican migrants. They should have the right, he said, to be "documented and legal," and to "go and work, return home and see their family, return and work. That's the idea, the idea that we want to endorse."
The proposal's political chances for passage depend in part on the perception of Mexico in the United States. Mr. Fox needs to discourage illegal immigration and, in particular, to continue cooperating with American officials in keeping a vigilant counterterrorism watch at Mexico's airports and borders, a United States official here said.
The United States "is very happy with the level of cooperation" on counterterrorism from Mexico, the American ambassador, Tony Garza, said in an interview. "The level of cooperation is light-years ahead of where it was even a year or two ago."
Not so with other nations. Some of the discontent at the meeting seems to rise from the "either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists" pronouncements made by the United States after the September 2001 attacks. An example is Brazil's decision to fingerprint and photograph Americans arriving at airports, mirroring what the United States is now doing to many foreigners.
Some unhappiness comes from a sense that everything south from the Texas border to Tierra del Fuego fell off the United States' radar after the attacks. "I think that there's a perception or a line of argument out there that somehow after 9/11 the United States lost interest in anything that didn't relate to terrorism and 9/11," said Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, in a briefing to reporters in Washington on Friday. "It's just not true."
More friction comes from a splintering of the so-called Washington consensus of the 1990's, which held in part that free trade could drive democracy forward and promote good government. "President Bush will have an opportunity to remind his fellow leaders of the benefit of free and open markets and open societies, and the importance of transparent elections," Ms. Rice said.
This will be the fourth Summit of the Americas since 1994. Every nation in the hemisphere except Cuba takes part. Many "are grappling with persistent political, economic, social and, in some cases, ethnic problems," said Roger Noriega, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.
Economic growth in many nations from Mexico southward is too slow to generate enough jobs or ease poverty, he said in a speech on Jan. 7 about the summit meeting. In many countries, corrupt or incompetent governments have "stunted economic development and spawned disenchantment with the label 'free market reforms,' " he said.
"Many of their people are weary of waiting for their lives to get better and for their futures to be brighter," Mr. Noriega said. "Soaring rhetoric is not going to meet their down-to-earth demands for concrete action and tangible results."
Mr. Bush is to arrive at midday on Monday for a meeting with Mr. Fox; they are expected to discuss immigration, border security and trade. He is then to hold a news conference with Mr. Fox, speak at the meeting's inauguration ceremony and meet with Presidents Ricardo Lagos of Chile and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil. On Tuesday Mr. Bush is to meet with the new prime minister of Canada, Paul Martin, and with Presidents Nestor Kirchner of Argentina and Carlos Mesa of Bolivia.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Martin are certain to discuss why Canada, because of its opposition to the Iraq war, is ineligible to compete for billions of dollars in American-financed Iraq reconstruction projects, officials said. Mr. Kirchner may respond to criticism from the Bush administration over Argentina's less than chilly relations with Cuba.
Mr. Bush will not see President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. The United States believes that Mr. Chavez may be working in concert with Fidel Castro of Cuba to undermine governments friendly to the United States, including those in Uruguay, Ecuador and possibly Bolivia.
In all, Mr. Bush is to spend a little more than 24 hours in Monterrey. In that time, American officials said, there are possibilities of agreements, marginal or not, on some of the United States' agenda, including stimulating economic growth, promoting businesses and attacking official corruption and organized crime.

HEADLINE: A Journey From a Mill Town Ends With a Run for President 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
At a meeting of Democrats in Parkersburg, Iowa, Senator John Edwards is listening closely as a woman describes her struggle to afford a nursing home for her ailing mother. "I want somebody who really knows what it is like to struggle," she says at last. 
 Mr. Edwards draws closer to her, fixing her in his steel-blue gaze, his face earnest and sympathetic. "Well, I don't know it anymore, but I did know it growing up," he says. "You don't forget where you come from. You never forget." 
 Senator Edwards's campaign for president, which won the coveted endorsement of The Des Moines Register yesterday, hinges on the notion that he has not forgotten where he comes from. He usually arrives at his events to the blaring sound of John Cougar Mellencamp singing "I was born in a small town." And it never takes him long to tell his audience he was reared by working-class parents in mill towns of the Carolinas and was the first in his family to go to college. 
When Democrats ask him on the trail why they should choose a one-term senator who has spent most of his life as a trial lawyer rather than a candidate with more government experience, he says his roots give him an understanding of working folks' problems that career politicians lack. Working-class voters are the ones he believes President Bush has abandoned, and he asserts that they will trust John Edwards, just as North Carolina juries have trusted John Edwards in a dozen big cases. 
"This president is shifting the tax burden from wealth to work and the working class," he railed at a forum in Des Moines. "I want this president to explain to middle-class working families why a millionaire sitting by a swimming pool getting a financial statement each month to see how much money he made is paying a lower tax rate than a secretary, than a firefighter, than a schoolteacher. This is not our America."
Yet the senator, having made a fortune in personal-injury law over the past two decades, is really more like the poolside millionaire than the schoolteacher, at least on the surface. He won his first and only race, for the United States Senate in 1998, with more than $6 million of his own money. Even though he may well be out of office within a year, he bought a second town house in Washington for $3.8 million a year ago because his wife found the first one unsuitable for their children. 
Mr. Edwards is a strange political animal: a multimillionaire who harbors a laborer's anger; a man with an expensive haircut who wears a cheap digital watch and worn-down shoes; the owner of four houses who employs a live-in nanny and a housekeeper but still celebrates his wedding anniversaries at Wendy's because that was what he and his wife did when first married. 
Perhaps more than any other candidate, he is running on the strength of his biography, portraying his rise in the courtrooms of North Carolina not merely as a climb up the social ladder but as a struggle to help working people like those he knew growing up. "The cause of my whole life is the cause of working people," he said. 
His speeches often sound as though they could come from a union leader. He derides President Bush as an elitist and a "phony" who cares about nothing but protecting the wealthy. He likes to end his stump speech with the declaration, "I believe in an America where the family you are born into does not control your destiny."
Mr. Edwards and his team see a clear path to the nomination for a handsome populist with a Carolina drawl. They hope to do better than most political pundits expect in Iowa and New Hampshire, pulling out a third-place finish in each state, then trounce the competition in South Carolina, the senator's native state. If Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts are crippled by losses in the first two contests, Mr. Edwards could become a middle-of-the-road Southern alternative to Howard Dean. 
He is drawing bigger crowds, and even officials in the other campaigns say his sunny rhetoric about America's future and his refusal to sling mud have given him a boost. In New Hampshire, he continues to struggle at the middle of the pack, but a good showing in Iowa might lift his chances. In South Carolina, polls suggest he can win, though many voters are undecided.

An Egalitarian Code
Mr. Edwards could be described as driven by a belief system learned from his father, who retired as a midlevel manager in the Milliken & Company textile mill in the tiny town of Robbins, N.C. It is a strict egalitarian code, founded on a distrust of big business and a simmering indignation at perceived injustices faced by working people in America. 
"He grew up a poor mill kid with wonderful parents but still with the deck stacked against him," said Richard Leonard, a federal judge in Raleigh, N.C., who is one of the senator's oldest and closest friends. "His overriding theory is to have a country where you put the starting point closer to the same place."
Espousing these populist views, Senator Edwards, who is 50 but looks much younger, was considered a hot prospect in Washington two years ago -- a kind of Bill Clinton in the making. But these days, with the country jittery over war and the economy, he must convince voters that he is more than a handsome face.
One Democratic senator close to Mr. Edwards, speaking on the condition of anonymity, put it another way: "This may not be the kind of year for someone who is new and emerging on the scene when the country is at war. The bar of gravitas gets raised." 
Still, Mr. Edwards says he has no doubts and has even gambled his short and not yet particularly memorable political career on the race, giving up a Senate seat he might have used as a platform to run in the future.
As for the gulf between his background and the ruling elite into which the president was born, the senator insists he harbors no ill feelings. But in the next breath, he allows as how "it's much harder than when I was growing up for people from my kind of background to do what I've done."
"Sometimes it feels like the field is tilted."
Beyond a five-year Senate career in which his biggest legislative accomplishment was a bipartisan health care bill that never passed the House, Mr. Edwards's main victories have been in the courtroom.
He represented many sympathetic plaintiffs, among them some horribly crippled children. He became rich doing it, racking up more than $175 million for his clients from 1985 to 1997 and amassing a personal fortune of at least $38 million, according to North Carolina Lawyers Weekly.
At the same time, he did little or no pro bono work. Nor did he pursue public-interest lawsuits. While he speaks passionately about civil rights and the bravery of civil rights leaders, for instance, he has never used his legal skills to fight against discrimination through the courts. 
Neither was he active in politics for the first 44 years of his life, except for the occasional donation to a Democratic candidate. He never ran for office or worked on a campaign. Indeed, before he burst onto the political scene in 1998, he did not even vote in several local elections, because, he says, he was too busy with his legal work.
All that changed in April 1996, when his 16-year-old son, Wade, was killed in a traffic accident while driving to the beach with a friend in a Jeep his parents had given him. A month earlier, Wade had been invited to the White House as a finalist in a Voice of America essay contest. He had written about voting with his father on Election Day: "There is no place in America where equality means as much as in the voting booth."
The death shattered the life Mr. Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth Anania Edwards, also a lawyer, had built. Mr. Edwards stopped practicing for six months, rediscovered his Christian faith and secluded himself with his wife and daughter. "Nothing in my life has ever hit me and stripped everything away like my son's death," he wrote in his legal autobiography, "Four Trials." 
Over the next year, he and his wife established an after-school program, a scholarship and a nonprofit foundation in their son's name. Mrs. Edwards gave up law to become a full-time mother again. She had two more babies in her late 40's and early 50's, undergoing hormone therapy to make it possible. 
Mr. Edwards emerged from seclusion to throw himself into politics and public life with a vengeance. Although he had toyed with running for office since the early 1990's, several family friends said, Wade's death pushed him into the public fray. He tried only two more cases.
When campaigning, he avoids talking about his son's death. He does not want his son to be remembered only as the catalyst that propelled him into the Senate, his aides say. When he does broach the subject, he seems to tap into a well of grief. On "Good Morning America" in late November, he choked up as he read from his book, "Wade is who I am."
He wears a pin on his lapel that his son earned in the Outward Bound mountaineering program a year before he died. "It's something he carries with him," said one family friend, Bonnie Weyher. "He wants to do it for Wade."
On the campaign trail, Mr. Edwards is indefatigably charming. He enters rooms with a big grin and locks eyes with everyone he shakes hands with. He calls people Sir and Ma'am and seems genuinely pained when he cannot agree with them.
He often breaks into a hearty laugh when someone throws him a curveball. A man in Concord, N.H., for instance, wanted to know what Senator Edwards thought about legalizing industrial hemp to create jobs.
"Boy I didn't see that one coming," he said, dissolving in guffaws. "I have not thought about that as a solution to the problem."
The senator is not a powerful orator, but he does well in small groups, where he can address the audience almost as if they were a jury, speaking off the cuff in simple language and ticking off points on his fingers.
"John is not good when he's scripted," one top aide said. "The best lines that have come out of this campaign have been his and have been spontaneous."

A Capacity for Bluntness
 At times he can be blunt. Two young lesbians at the University of New Hampshire challenged him on why he does not support marriage for gay couples, a stance that might seem at odds with his support for affirmative action and civil rights generally. "I don't thinkAmerica's ready for that," the senator replied. "It's very simple."
He paused, seeing the crestfallen looks on their faces. "It is heartbreaking," he said. "There is no question about that." 
Other times, however, he can be a master of lawyerly flourishes. In Oklahoma, when he was asked whether he supported tort reform, shorthand for capping the jury awards for pain and suffering, he pretended the questioner had raised the possibility of getting rid of juries. That gave him an entree to his favorite theme.
"I think people who don't like the jury system are people who hate the idea that everybody is treated exactly the same inside a courtroom, no matter who you are or who your family is or what kind of power you have outside the courtroom," he said. 
In a similar way, he has rebutted the accusation that he is overly ambitious, arguing that it would have been better for his political career if he had waited awhile before running for president. 
Asked why he has chanced his entire political future on a presidential race that he could well lose, he smiles. He says he does not mind going back to practicing law. "Remember I'm not a career politician," he said. 
Mr. Edwards's closest aides insist that his small-town perspective is no act. At staff meetings in the Senate, he often asks what people in his hometown would think about a proposal. He makes it a point to know the names of all the elevator operators, guards and other low-level employees in the Senate.
Generally, staff members say, he plays down their worries about the political consequences of his actions. "That's all just Washington noise," he is fond of saying.
Senator Edwards's anti-elitist attitude has crept into his exchanges with Dr. Dean, a son of a well-do-to Manhattan family. Senator Edwards pounced on Dr. Dean for patronizing Southerners after he said the Democrats should steer away from social issues like abortion and gun control in the South and stick to economic issues. 
"I do believe that it's important for us as a party not to look down on anybody, not to stereotype those in different parts of the country," he said in early December in Oklahoma. "We can't be a party of elitism."
For advice, Mr. Edwards relies most heavily on several Clinton veterans: his chief of staff, Miles Lackey, a former staff member at the National Security Council; his policy director, Robert Gordon; as well as Samuel R. Berger, Hugh Shelton, Richard C. Holbrooke and Mr. Clinton himself. 
Whatever his inner motivation, Mr. Edwards rocked his state's political establishment in 1998 by coming from nowhere to defeat Senator Lauch Faircloth, a conservative Democrat-turned-Republican, in his first stab at public office. 
From the start he was seen as a rising star in the Senate. And because of his trial skills, Senate leaders chose him in early 1999 to depose key witnesses and deliver the closing arguments for the defense in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. His sharp performance made him a celebrity among the nation's top Democrats. 
"I felt toward John the way 10-year veterans on the Yankees must have felt when Mickey Mantle walked on the field for the first time," said Bob Kerrey, the former senator.
So impressive were his first two years in office that Al Gore was said to have considered him seriously for vice president. The buzz about him grew. People magazine named him the sexiest politician in America. Long profiles in other magazines compared him to Mr. Clinton and pondered whether he could be the Democratic Party's savior. "Is John Edwards the next Bubba?" read a headline in GQ. Riding this wave of hype, he began mulling over a run for president almost as soon as the 2000 election was over, his political allies said. 
John Edwards was the first child of Wallace Edwards and Bobbie Wade, two teenagers from working-class homes with no prospect of anything better than a job in the local Utica textile mill in Seneca, S.C. They took him home to a three-room company-owned house attached to the mill, where his father made $35 a week on the night shift. His parents worked separate shifts to make ends meet and pay for medical bills.
Wallace Edwards, family friends say, hates condescension and treats everyone with an unfailing respect. He often used to say he could tell if a man was "talking down to him" within two minutes. His son appears to have inherited both traits, friends said.
"Johnny has always had a tremendous sense of equity," said one his oldest friends, the Rev. John L. Frye. "Even from when he was a boy he was interested in fair play and how things went for the little guy."

An Arena in the Courtroom
Raised a strict Baptist, John showed little sign in college that he would become a politician. He skipped most anti-Vietnam protests, and missed being drafted because he drew a high lottery number and the war ended before he was called up. 
"John was very conservative," said his college roommate, Bill Garner, a textile company executive. "I had long hair and a beard and was into the antiwar marches and stuff, but John never participated in that."
He graduated with honors in three years and was accepted to law school at the University of North Carolina, where he met his future wife, Elizabeth, in torts class. It was Miss Anania, a well-read and vivacious liberal Democrat, who exerted the most influence on his political thinking in college, and she continues to be his closest political adviser today, friends said. They married in 1977, a week after passing the bar together.
His first big success came in 1985, when he won a $3.7 million verdict for an alcoholic who was given an overdose of the drug Antabuse at an Asheville Hospital. The next year, he won a $6.5 million verdict on behalf of a 6-year-old girl who had suffered brain damage at birth. In his summation, he stunned onlookers by saying he felt the infant speaking through him to the jurors. It was a risky move, but he pulled it off.
"What makes him unique is that he has a great deal of charisma in front of the jury," said Bob Clay, a defense lawyer who has faced Mr. Edwards dozens of times. "He starts wooing the jury the minute he walks in the courtroom."
More than a third of the cases he handled in the 1990's were on behalf of injured newborns, according to Lawyers Weekly. 
One of the last he tried was in early 1997, when he won a $25 million award for a small girl, Valerie Lakey, who had part of her intestines sucked out when a swimming pool drain cover came loose and she was trapped by the escaping water. Just before the case went to the jury, Mr. Edwards turned down a $17.5 million settlement offer from the maker of the drain cover. The case prompted the Legislature to pass a law regulating such products.
"I would never have put myself mind, body and soul the way I did in these cases for money," he said. "There are very few people in the world who would. They had to be personal. That's what it's about."
Inside Mr. Edwards lurks a fierce competitor, his friends say. It takes nerve to turn down a settlement offer of $17.5 million. His quest for the White House is a gamble on a grander scale; he has said he will not seek re-election to the Senate.
"This man is not bedeviled by lack of confidence or lack of will," said a political mentor, James B. Hunt, the former North Carolina governor.
Judge Leonard recalls how Mr. Edwards could not take up jogging without becoming a marathoner, and how he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in 1995 despite crippling altitude sickness and a fear of heights.
One cannot escape the impression that Mr. Edwards considers the presidential race another case to be tried and won, this time before a jury of millions. He is itching to engage President Bush in a one-on-one debate, and when he talks about the possibility, his public mask slips a bit. A schoolyard machismo flashes.
"If I can be on a stage with George Bush in a debate in 2004, with my background, what I've spent my life doing, wouldn't you love to see it?" he told voters in Merrimack, N.H., in September, laughing hard. "I can beat this guy. I can beat this guy."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: OVERHAULING SCHOOLS; 
'No Child Left Behind' Brings a Reversal: Democrats Fault a Federal Education Plan

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
Never mind that most of the Democratic presidential candidates voted two years ago for a bill that Republicans and Democrats alike hailed as the most significant federal education legislation in four decades. Listening to them recently has made it easy to forget.
 As President Bush toured the country last week promoting the second anniversary of the No Child Left Behind Act, Senator John Edwards declared, "We need to fix it and we need to change it and we need to fund it." Senator John Kerry derided its heavy focus on test scores. Representative Richard A. Gephardt criticized it for placing too many federal requirements on local schools. 
 Gen. Wesley K. Clark called it "a failure," and Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, said the law was "making American education worse, not better." 
The debate over education in this year's campaign has in many ways resulted in a strange role reversal.
Republicans who for years argued that the federal Department of Education should be abolished are championing legislation that imposes a strict testing regimen and penalizes school districts for failure. Democrats, traditionally associated with federal programs and mandates, are arguing for more state and local freedom.
"This is simply federal bureaucracy run amok," Dr. Dean said last week.
The Democrats have long considered education their issue, and those the legislation aims to help -- black and Hispanic families with children in failing urban schools -- their constituency.
But in a departure from Republican tradition, President Bush used education in 2000 to help define himself as a "compassionate conservative." The education law was one of the first he pushed through Congress, and he worked with Democrats to do so.
Though some groups close to Democrats, like teachers' unions, have fundamental problems with the legislation, many Democrats say the party abandons the law at its peril, 
The centrist Democratic Leadership Council last week warned that backing away from the act was conceding leadership on education to Mr. Bush. "It is wrong to subordinate Democratic principles to a fanatical determination to oppose Bush 100 percent of the time," it said in a statement, "even on those rare occasions when he moves in the right direction, however fecklessly."
The candidates have tried to meet this challenge by arguing that the law needs to be changed and financed better, not repealed. But many Democrats say they have fallen short in explaining how to do that.
"When you start to hear national Democrats talking as if they are keynote speakers at the Federalist Society, that should be a cause for concern," said Andrew J. Rotherham, director of education policy for the Progressive Policy Institute, referring to a conservative legal group.
"It's a tightrope," added Mr. Rotherham, who was a special assistant to the president for domestic policy in the Clinton White House. "But there are plenty of ways to walk it. Just railing against it, being angry, is not only counterproductive in the short term politically, but counterproductive to the values Democrats hold, which is equity for poor and minority kids."
Until the last few weeks, the Democratic candidates have criticized the education law mainly on the grounds that the budgets from the Bush administration and the Republican-controlled Congress have not provided as much money as promised in the act. Using Congressional figures, the Kerry, Gephardt, Lieberman and Dean campaigns all say there is close to an $8 billion gap this year between what was promised and what was appropriated.
But more recently, the attacks have sharpened to focus on the law's requirements for testing, standards and achievement. The criticism reflects complaints from teachers' unions, but also groups that supported the law.
The legislation requires all schools to make adequate yearly progress on standardized tests, with sanctions for those that do not improve. But states can set their own standards for passing the tests.
Like others, Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a nonpartisan group that supported the bill, argues that states have an incentive to set a low threshold so that more students pass. States with higher standards risk penalties, even if their students score better than those in states with lower standards.
The law also requires schools to separate the scores of groups -- like blacks, Hispanics and those who are still learning English -- and to show that all groups are making progress. If a school performs well over all but one group does not, the school can be declared low-performing. All schools must show progress by 2014 or risk being shut down.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, from Connecticut, has been the most supportive of the law, arguing that the problems are natural growing pains. 
"I'll listen to the teachers and the principals about changing some of the requirements," Mr. Lieberman said in a debate on Jan. 4 in Iowa. "But anybody who says they're going to pull back and repeal No Child Left Behind is turning their back on the students, and particularly the low-income students, of America. I won't do that."
Dr. Dean has been its harshest critic, at times calling for its dismantling, a pledge that helped him win the endorsement of the New Hampshire affiliate of the National Education Association. Last week, Dr. Dean said he would not repeal the act. By the time he took office, he said, too many provisions would be in effect for that to be practical. But he said he would eliminate high-stakes tests, that is, using test scores alone to determine whether students graduate or schools remain accredited. 
Mr. Kerry, from Massachusetts, has also suggested other ways of measuring progress, like graduation rates and attendance rates. He has suggested rewarding states that set higher standards, by easing the yearly requirements for progress. And he has proposed an education trust fund to pay for the act, so that it would not be subject to appropriations debates each year. 
Other candidates have also criticized the way the act works. The Rev. Al Sharpton, for instance, has said that the threat of penalties has meant that teachers promote students who meet only minimum standards, "without regard for the child's education."
Dr. Dean and Mr. Kerry say the lack of federal money has forced states to rely on multiple-choice tests to measure progress. Such tests are cheaper but not tailored to what individual schools teach. Similarly, General Clark and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio say that the testing requirements encourage "teaching to the test" rather than what Mr. Kucinich calls a "broad-based curriculum."
Mr. Edwards, from North Carolina, criticizes the tests as simply a one-year snapshot of students in a particular grade. It would be better, he has argued, to track cohorts of students and measure their progress over a longer period of time. He has also suggested that in some schools, groups like blacks or Hispanics are often so small that it is unfair to penalize the schools when one group does not improve. He has argued for focusing on truly failing schools, giving bonuses to teachers there.
Dr. Dean, Mr. Gephardt and Carol Moseley Braun have accused the Bush administration of setting schools up to fail as a way of getting a voucher plan in place when not all schools succeed by 2014. The education law, Ms. Braun argues, is "part and parcel of a plan to just destroy public education." 
But primarily, the Democrats argue that localities should get back more control of education. In fact, it was difficult to discern the difference between Dr. Dean and Mr. Gephardt, the congressman from Missouri, in conference calls just hours apart last week, on the day Mr. Bush was promoting the law in St. Louis. 
"I think we need more input from local educators to allow some more latitude in terms of trying to determine whether or not children are reaching the standards," Mr. Gephardt told reporters.
Dr. Dean said, "I really do think that local communities can best determine the needs of their own kids and how to run their public school systems."

This is the second in a series of articles comparing the policy positions of the Democratic candidates for president.

HEADLINE: To Understand U.S. Jobs Picture, Connect the Dots, And Find the Dots 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
No economic statistic is watched more closely as a gauge of the economic recovery's staying power -- or of President Bush's prospects among voters -- than the monthly employment numbers. Yet these numbers are failing to explain what is really happening to the nation's workers.
 More people are working than have as yet been recorded in the official job count -- the one compiled by Bureau of Labor Statistics that gets all the attention. But the official unemployment rate, in turn, greatly understates the number of people who would like to be working. 
 In December, for example, the nation's employers added 1,000 new jobs, a small number, but the unemployment rate plunged 0.2 percentage points, according to data released by the bureau on Friday. How could there be only 1,000 new jobs yet 300,000 fewer unemployed people, as the December numbers suggest? 
The answer, economists say, is that the labor force has changed, and the official data no longer easily capture these changes, particularly the sharp rise in low-wage employment. The disparities in the numbers are giving politicians unusual leeway to make conflicting claims about the employment picture. 
The Democratic presidential candidates, for example, heaped scorn on the Bush administration for the almost nonexistent job creation in December. The president, on the other hand, pointed to the drop in the unemployment rate, to 5.7 percent from 5.9 percent in November, as "a positive sign the economy is getting better." And the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, N.Gregory Mankiw, said in an interview that the official job count showing 1,000 new jobs in December was not accurate by itself.
"I view all economic statistics as imperfect," he said. "They have to be taken with a grain of salt." 
In challenging the reliability of the official count, Mr. Mankiw sought to water down its message, which is that 2.3 million jobs have disappeared since President Bush took office in January 2001.
 The official count is based on a monthly survey of net job changes at 400,000 companies, called the establishment survey. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also counts monthly job changes through a less sweeping survey, one based on interviews with 60,000 households. The household survey has employment rising by 689,000 jobs in the Bush years.
"I am not going to take a stand as to which survey is more meaningful," Mr. Mankiw said -- challenging in effect the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Congressional Budget Office, which have declared the establishment survey the more reliable one.
What both surveys do is sort people into employed, unemployed or out of the labor force. But, a growing number of people do not fit neatly into these categories, economists say. More often than in the past, for example, people who lose a job list themselves as early retirees or self-employed rather than unemployed. 
 The labor force in America is limited to people who are working or who tell interviewers in the household survey that while they are not working, they are actively seeking work. These are the people classified as employed and unemployed. They totaled 146.9 million in December.
 Everyone else was on the sidelines, and those sidelines have become more crowded since the booming economy began to wind down in 2000. 
The best measure of this growth on the periphery is labor force participation rate -- that is, the percentage of the working-age population listed as either working or unemployed. It has fallen 1.3 percentage points, from a peak of 67.3 percent in the last year of the Clinton administration to 66 percent last month. 
Most of these dropouts "would still be in the labor force working or trying to work if the economy were doing better," said Andrew Sharpe, a labor economist who is helping to direct a project financed by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations to develop a more realistic measure of unemployment. "What we really want to do in this project," he said, "is measure idle labor capacity; that is, the number of additional hours people would work if the jobs were there, the pay were high enough and there was adequate child care." 
These additional hours would come not only from people lured back into the labor force, but from people listed by the labor statistics bureau as employed, but only part time and for fewer hours than they would like. The total in that category has risen by nearly 1.5 million people since the start of the recession, although last month there was a drop of 92,000, perhaps in response to the gradually strengthening economy. 
 Even the bureau recognizes the inadequacy of its official unemployment rate. Buried in its monthly employment release is an alternative unemployment rate, called "labor underutilization." That rate was 9.9 percent in December, down from 10.1 percent in November, but unchanged from the previous December and 4.2 percentage points higher than the official unemployment rate last month. 
Trying to measure more realistically the slack in the labor market, the bureau adds to the officially unemployed -- that is, those actively seeking work -- the part-timers who want more hours as well as those who tell the interviewers in the household survey that while they are not currently job hunting, they would take a job if one came along.
 Many early retirees and self-employed consultants would also like to have jobs, but since they tell the interviewers that they are retired or self-employed, they are not counted in calculating the "labor underutilization rate." If even some who fit that description were included, that rate would rise above 10 percent, economists say.
 Still, the rise of 1,000 jobs in December, as measured by the payroll survey, is probably understating actual job growth by 30,000 to 60,000. That would not be enough to get to 150,000 new jobs -- the improvement that nearly every forecaster had expected for December anticipating that a strengthening economy would finally force employers to step up their hiring -- but it would help.
 The assumption of a shortfall in the payroll survey is based on the view that the labor statistics bureau has not yet updated its formula for using net job changes at the 400,000 representative companies in its survey to project job changes at the 8.5 million corporations across America.
 The expectation is that the recovery, particularly the strong economic growth in the third quarter, has stepped up job creation at existing companies while also creating jobs at new companies not yet counted by the government. As the bureau gradually updates its survey early this year, the 30,000 to 60,000 not-yet-detected jobs presumably will show up in the monthly employment reports. 
"We cannot update the projections every month," said Patricia Getz, an economist at the bureau in charge of the group that does the updating. 
Absent the update, the payroll survey shows that employment finally turned up in August after two and a half years of almost uninterrupted job losses. But the improvement has been sub-par, averaging only 55,000 new jobs a month, including the December setback. 
 Apart from the updates, the bureau carries out a detailed annual survey of job changes at all 8.5 million companies. That expanded survey, conducted each March and announced in the early fall, just before the November election, may very well produce an upward revision sufficiently large enough to strengthen President Bush's argument that his policies are reviving employment.
"The reality is that nine months from now, when they have the March 2004 survey fully calculated, that the adjustment will show a lot more job creation," said Lee Price, director for research at the Economic Policy Institute.
In the meantime, administration officials -- Mr. Mankiw on Friday and the secretary of labor, Elaine L. Chao, last year -- point to the household survey with its more robust job growth, averaging 175,000 new hires a month since August, or three times more than the payroll survey. 
Some economists argue that while the household survey may overstate employment growth, as the bureau maintains, it nevertheless reflects, much more than the payroll survey, job growth outside the corporate sector -- and that is where much of the job growth has been happening, particularly at low wages. 
 Illegal aliens, holding many of these jobs, are more likely to show up in the household survey rather than the payroll survey. Their numbers may be exaggerated in the household survey, which is updated less frequently than the payroll numbers, but low-wage work, whoever does it, is an ever more important labor force phenomenon. 
Andrew M. Sum, a Northeastern University labor economist and lead author of a recently released study of the two employment measures that underscores the value of the household survey, put it this way in a statement: "At no other point in this nation's last five recovery periods have so many people been employed as independent contractors, as temporarily self-employed, or paid under the table."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN; 
The Democratic Presidential Candidates in Their Own Words

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements by the Democratic presidential candidates at a debate in Des Moines last night, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.:

JOHN KERRY
On the economy
 I think it's a Bush-league recovery. It's a recovery for the people in the corporate boardroom. It's a recovery for corporations to some degree, by compacting, by increasing productivity. But as you go across America it's not a recovery. 

JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN
On racism
The question of racism in America that you addressed is very much on the ballot this November, and the reality is that a president shows his priorities by where he puts his money. This president has put hundreds of billions of dollars in the pockets of the wealthiest Americans who don't need it. And, as a result, he hasn't had the money to invest in our health care system and our education system, which are unequal.

HOWARD DEAN
On the Confederate battle flag
 Let me just say, the Confederate flag is a painful symbol to African-Americans in this country because of what it represented. But what we have in common with people who drive pickup trucks and so-called Nascar dads is that everybody needs a job. The Republicans divide us by race. They've done so since 1968 in Richard Nixon's Southern strategy. When we campaign, we've got to talk. They say "race" in the South or anyplace in America, we've got to say "jobs," because everybody needs a job.

JOHN EDWARDS
On the Confederate battle flag
I'd like to say several things. Number one, the Confederate flag is not just a symbol of hatred and a divisive symbol to African-Americans. It's exactly the same thing it should be -- the same thing to all Americans. And I was about to say, before Reverend Sharpton said it, this is not just about talk. This is about doing something. . . . This is about creating real equality.

THE REV. AL SHARPTON
On Howard Dean's record
 You keep talking about race. In the State of Vermont, where you were governor, '97, '99, 2001, not one black or brown held a senior policy position -- not one. You yourself said we must do something about it. Nothing was done. Can you explain, since now you want to convene everyone and talk about race?

RICHARD A. GEPHARDT
On financial security
On this question of access to capital, I think this is the key question in helping minorities be able to have the same opportunity as everyone else. One of my proposals that I'm very interested in is changing the percentage of federal contracts that go to minority contracts from 5 to 10 percent. This would do more to get capital into minority contractors and give people the opportunity they need.

CAROL MOSELEY BRAUN
On opportunity
One of the issues has to do with the private sector and creating jobs. And when you consider that Latino women make 53 cents on the dollar, African-American women make 68 cents on the dollar, and white women make 73 cents for every dollar that a man makes, the disparities are very clear, both as to race and gender. I think the answer lies in providing capital for the development of jobs, and businesses in communities where people live.

DENNIS J. KUCINICH
On the space policy
First of all, I've been wondering why the president would, while we're still in Iraq, talk about going to the Moon and going to Mars. Maybe he's looking for the weapons of mass destruction still. And so, I think thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven, and I think that our work has to be done here on Earth. But we also have to keep in mind that there's tremendous spin-off technologies.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE DEBATE; 
In Final Debate Before Caucuses, Democrats Tangle on Race Issues

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
The Democratic presidential contenders grappled on Sunday night with issues of race, taxes and national security in their final debate before next week's Iowa caucuses, getting in sharp jabs at one another on some of the most delicate questions in American politics.
 Scrambling to sway undecided voters in the final days of the first presidential contest of 2004, eight of the nine candidates used a forum intended to address issues of special concern to blacks and Latinos to highlight their broad collective differences with Republicans. But under prodding from the two black candidates, they also squared off with one another. 
 As he has for months, Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, drew most of the fire from his rivals, on issues like the Confederate battle flag and taxes. Polls show that he and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri are locked in a tight race for first place in the precinct caucuses here on Jan. 19. 
Dr. Dean faced pointed questioning about his recent and still largely undefined promise to cut payroll taxes, with Mr. Gephardt suggesting that such a plan could weaken the Social Security system. Dr. Dean replied that he would ensure that any cut in payroll taxes would not touch the Social Security trust fund. 
In one of the sharper exchanges of the whole campaign season, the Rev. Al Sharpton confronted Dr. Dean with what Mr. Sharpton described as the lack of minority officials in senior positions in Dr. Dean's administration as governor.
"Do you have a senior member of your cabinet that was black or brown?" Mr. Sharpton demanded, after Dr. Dean had earlier suggested that hiring more minorities was a key to racial understanding in America.
"We had a senior member of my staff on my fifth floor," Dr. Dean responded elliptically, in an apparent reference to the executive offices in Vermont. 
"No, your cabinet!" Mr. Sharpton said. Dr. Dean responded quietly: "No, we did not." 
"Then you need to let me talk to you about race in this country," Mr. Sharpton said.
Dr. Dean responded, moments later, "I will take a back seat to no one in my commitment to civil rights in America." 
At another point, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina lectured Dr. Dean on Southern sensibilities. Dr. Dean had just apologized again for saying last fall that he wanted to be "the candidate for guys with Confederate flags" in their pickup trucks. He declared that the flag "is a painful symbol to African-Americans."
Mr. Edwards countered that the flag was offensive "to all Americans." 
The debate revealed no major new differences among the candidates, and for the most part allowed them to use their last joint televised appearance to restate the themes most of them have been sounding in the state for more than a year. But the strains of relentless campaigning were evident in their hoarse voices, sagging faces and short tempers.
Carol Moseley Braun, unfailingly cool and cordial in past debates, seemed roused by the bickering over race. Ms. Braun pivoted off Mr. Sharpton's exchange with Dr. Dean to ask why Mr. Gephardt, as House Democratic leader, had not pressed harder to protect affirmative action programs. And she demanded to know how Mr. Edwards could vote regularly with President Bush in Congress, yet attack Dr. Dean so readily. 
"You voted for the Patriot Act," she said. "You voted to deploy the missile defense system. And yet you stand up here and call Howard a hypocrite. This is not right."
Ms. Braun was just as blunt with Mr. Sharpton, with whom she has long had a tense relationship, suggesting that he was stirring racial divisions before a national television audience.
"It's time for us to talk about what are you going to do to bring people together because people cannot afford a racial screaming match," she said. "We have to come together. We have to come together as one nation to get past these problems." 
Mr. Edwards disputed the details of Ms. Braun's charge, saying, "Well, Carol, that was a great speech, but what you just said is not right." And Mr. Sharpton defended his decision to assail Dr. Dean's record on civil rights, declaring: "I want him to be accountable, since he brought up race. That's not racial hysteria. That is accountability."
The combined black and Hispanic population of Iowa in the 2000 census was roughly 5 percent of the state's total populace, meaning that from the candidates' viewpoint, parts of this debate were aimed as much at voters in South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 3, as at caucus-goers here.
The Iowa Black and Brown Forum, founded to represent the interests of blacks and Latinos, has been a feature of the Iowa caucuses for 20 years, and Sunday's encounter was its fifth presidential debate since 1984. This year's caucuses coincide with Martin Luther King's Birthday, and the debate was intended to address issues of particular concern to minorities.
The session started quietly, with candidates apparently trying to emphasize their positive attributes in the final week of the Iowa race. But the moderator's first question challenged Dr. Dean to explain his four-year-old criticisms of the Iowa caucuses as favoring special interests, and the debate turned progressively raucous and was filled with difficult moments for the candidates.
Dr. Dean said, "I frankly think people are a little tired of having debates about who said what 4 years ago, or who said what 6 years ago, or 8 years ago, or 10 years ago." He went on to praise Iowa and New Hampshire for giving "candidates like me" a chance.
After the debate, Dr. Dean was the only candidate who did not appear to discuss his performance with reporters, and his campaign manager, Joe Trippi, uncharacteristically cut short an exchange with journalists eager to get his post-debate take.
In the debate, when it was time for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut to ask a question of his opponents, he offered a long comment on tax policy that finally trailed off as a moderator, Lester Holt of MSNBC, triedto push him to come to a point. The event was broadcast by MSNBC and hosted by Mr. Holt and Maria Celeste Arraras of the Spanish-language network Telemundo.
When it was Dr. Dean's turn to ask a question, he attempted to address it not to an opponent, but to a member of the audience, until the moderator told him that violated the rules, as the audience snickered.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts sought, in response to a question from an audience member, to walk from behind the lectern and toward the audience until he realized that he had walked into shadows because the front of the stage was not lighted.
But Mr. Kerry distilled some of the evening's sharpest criticism against Mr. Bush, dismissing the nation's current economic situation as a "Bush-league recovery."
He added: "This recovery is a recovery for those people who have stock. It's a recovery for those people who are able to walk away with the highest salaries." And he said that "those people who run around this country talking about compassionate conservatism have shown compassion only for conservatives and the wealthiest people in the country." That led Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio to say: "The economists who are talking about recovering are the same economists who believe that a certain amount of unemployment is necessary to a functioning economy. Easy for them to say. They have jobs."
But if the candidates were united in their view of the Republican in the White House, they nevertheless continued to outline differences among themselves. Only Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who has chosen not to compete in Iowa, did not attend.
Mr. Gephardt tried to raise doubts about Dr. Dean's emerging position on the potential for a payroll tax reduction, saying "my worry is that it would undermine Social Security." But Dr. Dean said if he did eventually propose such a cut, "it will come out of the general fund in the form of a tax credit. We will not touch Social Security."
At another point, one of the questioners asked if any of the presidential candidates had hired an illegal immigrant. Not a single candidate raised a hand, and all appeared stunned at the question.
Mr. Kerry said that any noncitizen who served in the military should automatically become a naturalized citizen and criticized Dr. Dean for suggesting in an earlier answer that that should not be the case.
Dr. Dean said he supported the philosophy behind the idea but was concerned that young Hispanics would enlist in the military as a route to winning citizenship. "The concern I have is I don't want Hispanic kids choosing to go to Iraq in order simply to gain citizenship," he said.
After Mr. Kucinich questioned how Dr. Dean could balance the budget without cutting Pentagon spending, Dr. Dean replied that he would re-order military priorities. He said he would not build a missile defense system or tactical battlefield nuclear weapons, but instead would focus on other needs like expanding Special Operations Forces. 
"This president is not keeping us safe," Dr. Dean said.
Mr. Kucinich, who has often delivered some of the biggest laugh lines at the debates, produced another one early in the debate in response to a question about the emphasis he would place on the space program if elected. "You know, first of all, I've been wondering why the president would, while we're still in Iraq, talk about going to the moon and going to Mars," he said. "Maybe he's looking for the weapons of mass destruction still."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about the final debate among Democratic presidential candidates before the Iowa caucuses next week, referred imprecisely to Howard Dean's contacts with reporters afterward. While he did not join other candidates taking questions, he indeed spoke with one reporter, for the MSNBC program "Hardball With Chris Matthews," who stopped him in a hallway as he departed.

PERSON: Chauncy Dennison Harris 

HEADLINE: Chauncy Harris, 89, Geographer Of a Little-Known Soviet Union 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Chauncy Dennison Harris, a geographer who helped to put the Soviet Union on maps when the Kremlin sought to keep it terra incognita to prying foreigners, died on Dec. 26 at his home in Chicago. He was 89.
 He was the Samuel N. Harper distinguished service professor of geography emeritus at the University of Chicago, which announced his death. He had been associated with the university since his student days 70 years ago, and was a faculty member from 1940 until 1984. 
 Dr. Harris wrote and edited geographical reference books starting with his 1940 doctoral dissertation, "Salt Lake City: A Regional Capital." But he became known internationally for his many studies of the vast expanse of the Soviet Union, while it lasted. He also produced other important work on political, economic and urban geography.
Chauncy Harris was born in Logan, Utah, the son of Franklin S. Harris, an agronomy professor who became president of Brigham Young University when Chauncy was 7. He graduated from Brigham Young at 19 in 1933, when he enrolled at the University of Chicago.
He was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, earned a B.A. there in 1936, studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science and received his Ph.D. in geography at Chicago in 1940 before adding an M.A. from Oxford in 1943. He studied Russian while a geographer for the State Department in World War II.
Commissioned a first lieutenant in the Army, he was detached to the Office of Strategic Services just as war and mutual suspicions began to shut most of Soviet society to Western scrutiny. Despite the dearth of available data, he wrote two papers on urban growth and the ethnic complexities of cities in Soviet outlands for the Geographic Review in 1945.
He made 14 trips to the Soviet Union, gaining the confidence of scholars and others as a serious and objective researcher. Starting in 1949, he edited the voluminous "Economic Geography of the U.S.S.R."
He also focused on both the geography of the Soviet Union and its urban development and industrial and agrarian resources. This included a number of geographical bibliographies and detailed portraits of the country's urban centers.
He and Theodore Shabad of The New York Times started and contributed extensively to the journal Soviet Geography, Review and Translation, published by the American Geographical Society.
More recently, he was an editor of "A Geographical Bibliography for American Libraries" (1985).
He was a president of the Association of American Geographers and the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.
Dr. Harris is survived by his wife of 63 years, Edith Young Harris; a daughter, Margaret Harris of Philadelphia; two sisters, Leah Jensen of Pocatello, Idaho, and Mildred Bradley of Salt Lake City; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: GOLF; 
Appleby Holds Off Singh by a Shot

BYLINE:  By CLIFTON BROWN

DATELINE: KAPALUA, Hawaii, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
For Stuart Appleby, what looked like a Hawaiian breeze turned into an interesting finish.
 In the most significant achievement of his career, Appleby built a six-stroke lead at the turn Sunday and held off a charging Vijay Singh for a one-stroke victory at the Mercedes Championships. 
 Appleby's victory kicked off the 2004 PGA Tour season with a twist. Never mind that Singh, Tiger Woods, Davis Love III, Ernie Els and other Tour heavyweights were in this 30-player event. Appleby outplayed them all, winning $1.06 million and a new Mercedes-Benz. 
Not a bad way to start the year, and not a bad way for Appleby to take his game to another level.
"What it does is confirm that what I'm doing on the golf course is working," said Appleby, a 32-year-old native of Australia.
It was the fifth Tour victory of Appleby's career, but he had never beaten a field like this. And Singh made Appleby earn it, making birdies at Nos. 14, 15 and 16 to put pressure on Appleby down the stretch.
Appleby finished at 22 under par for a 270 total. Singh was a stroke back and Darren Clarke finished third, at 275. Tiger Woods, who never mounted a serious challenge, finished tied for fourth with Retief Goosen, seven strokes behind.
Beginning the final round with a two-stroke lead, Appleby led by a commanding six strokes as he reached the 10th tee, and it was easy to picture someone handing him the keys to the Mercedes. But not so fast. Singh won the money title last year for a reason, and surrender is not in his nature.
Even after Appleby bogeyed No. 12, he still led by five strokes as he reached No. 14, before Singh finally began to put pressure on him.
Starting his charge, Singh made a 12-footer for birdie at No. 14, a 9-footer for birdie at No. 15 and a 20-footer for birdie at No. 16. After Singh finished at No. 16, Appleby had a chance to answer, but he missed a 9-foot birdie attempt. That left Singh just two strokes behind as they headed for the 17th tee.
"I did believe that Vijay was never going to go away," Appleby said. "To the benefit of me, he ran out of holes." 
After Appleby settled for par at No. 17, Singh had a chance to close to one, but he needed to make a 16-footer for birdie. His attempt tailed to the left near the cup, leaving Appleby with a two-stroke cushion as they reached the par-5 final hole. After Singh barely missed a 96-foot putt for eagle, Appleby secured the victory with his par. Singh tapped in for birdie and finished one stroke behind.
"I had a lot of chances," Singh said. "Stuart played really well. He made the putts when he needed to and he deserved to win. I'm not disappointed finishing second. I'm just disappointed not winning."
Singh had hoped to begin the year making a statement with a victory, but his charge came too late. He did not make a birdie until the ninth hole, and by that time, Appleby was pulling away. Singh's putting, perhaps the only inconsistent part of his repertory, was shaky early. He missed a 6-footer for birdie at No. 6 and a 6-footer for par at No. 8, which could have kept him closer.
Singh helped Appleby early, when Singh three-putted for bogey at the second hole and fell three strokes behind. Appleby went four strokes ahead by making a 14-footer for birdie at No. 4, and on the next hole, he went five strokes up by making a 6-footer for birdie at No. 5.
Appleby was in command, and he did not let up. Continuing the strong putting he displayed all week, he poured in a 24-footer for birdie at No. 7, and what was expected to be an intense battle was turning into a possible rout.
This was the breeziest day of the tournament, and the toughest day for scoring, but with his comfortable lead, Appleby could play conservatively and not worry about firing at flags. Singh, however, continued to grind. Appleby gave back a stroke at No. 12 with a bogey, then Singh's late charge made things interesting.
In his last nine Tour starts, Singh has finished no worse than sixth. With a career-high four victories last year, Singh has risen to No. 2 in the world ranking. He has given early notice that he will not be resting on his laurels.
Appleby will try to continue his winning ways at the Sony Open in Hawaii, which begins Thursday. Michelle Wie, a 14-year-old prodigy, will be making her PGA Tour debut, playing on a sponsor exemption. But Sunday belonged to Appleby, who started 2004 in impressive fashion.

CHIP SHOTS
The defending champion, ERNIE ELS, had a disappointing week, finishing in a tie for 21st. The reigning Masters champion, MIKE WEIR, was also off his game, tying for 24th. Last year's British Open champion, BEN CURTIS, finished last at five over. . . . With his tie for fourth, TIGER WOODS crossed the $40 million mark in career earnings. "That's not too bad," Woods said. "I love inflation." Woods is not expected to play again until the Buick Invitational, from Feb. 12 to Feb. 15. "I'm taking my off-season right now, so you won't see me for a while," he said.

HEADLINE: Where Roma Soap Meets Dove 

BYLINE:  By Rossana Fuentes-Berain; Rossana Fuentes-Berain is a journalist and professor at the Mexico Institute of Technology.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
A supermarket is a curious window into a country's history. I remember shopping in my neighborhood grocery years ago. Then, in the early 1980's, before Mexico City was gentrified, the district of Colonia Condesa was a destination for college students like myself. Rents were cheap, even if buildings were old and run down. 
 As President Bush and other leaders gather in Mexico at the Summit of the Americas to discuss the future of our slice of the globe, I feel compelled to look back. In pre-Nafta times, doing your daily shopping on the corner of Amsterdam and Michoacan was no different from doing it in your parents' suburban market. When I was growing up, Mexico had one party: the PRI; one church: the Roman Catholic; and one brand available for every product: a Mexican one. The soap was Roma, the soup was La Moderna, and for the sweet tooth there were Carlos V chocolates and La Palma jellies. 
 In the decades after World War II, Mexico operated on a mode of self-sufficiency, even if it meant living with less than acceptable goods. Trade barriers kept out foreign products -- and most cultural influences, for that matter. That world started to change rapidly in the last decade of the 20th century. One of the most visible transformations came in Mexico's relationship with the United States. Geography had tied us together but history made us drift apart after the 1847 war, in which our border was forcibly redefined. The popular saying, "Poor Mexico: so close to the U.S. and so far away from God," was part and parcel of our dealings with the "gringos" until 1992, when Mexico's baby boomers made a bold move and signed Nafta.
Today, you can see the results on the shelves of my local grocery. Mexican brands now compete side by side with products like Gatorade, Hershey bars and Dove soap. Colonia Condesa has changed as well. It and other urban neighborhoods have become magnets for affluent people working in service industries, many of them tied to international companies. 
Along with economic changes have come cultural ones. By the mid-90's, it was O.K. to admit that you spoke English. Bookstores, coffee shops and movie theaters reflect a cornucopia of international influences. Amsterdam Avenue, an odd elliptical street at the heart of Condesa, is now described as one of the trendiest spots in town (at least according to last September's Vanity Fair).
Nafta's first decade has not only changed Mexican supermarkets, it has transformed American ones. "Made in Mexico" labels have popped up on products on the shelves of states as unlikely as Iowa, as our exports to the United States more than tripled. The free flow of capital and goods in North America has rightfully established itself, yet we are still lacking one important part of the equation: the free flow of workers. President Bush's new efforts on immigration reform are a first step. I've also done my share of shopping in Los Angeles and New York and I know that for many of the Mexicans working there, those reforms could bring much relief.
But while my own small world may well have improved, 10 years after Nafta took effect, the overall gains made in Mexico certainly feel incomplete. Employment rates and salaries are internationally competitive just for a small percentage of the urban population. Half of Mexicans live in shameful poverty. One third of the population, still reliant on agriculture, is in danger of losing its way of life, partly because of the trade agreement. Development funds are badly needed to help those Mexicans benefit from Nafta. 
So I walk home with my grocery bags through a city where the daily struggle can be seen at every corner. I think about the billions of dollars America is spending on rebuilding Iraq. And I can't help but wonder why in the past decade Mexico and the United States have worked so much on becoming good trading partners and so little on becoming good neighbors.

HEADLINE: Tourist-Minded Rio Resists Fingerprinting of Americans 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
After Brazil's left-leaning national government decided over the weekend to continue fingerprinting and photographing American citizens arriving in this country, the municipal government here, fearing damage to tourism with carnival approaching in a little more than a month, on Monday obtained an injunction against the practice.
 The appeals court ruling applies only in Rio de Janeiro, the main port of entry for the more than 500,000 Americans who visit Brazil annually, though late on Monday afternoon, the federal police said they had not begun carrying out the change because they had not received official notification. For at least the next 30 days, Americans arriving at other Brazilian cities will still be subjected to the security measures, which have resulted in long delays and official complaints from the American government. 
 Brazil introduced the measures at the beginning of the month in response to a new American program that applies to all foreigners who require visas to enter the United States. A federal judge in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso took offense, describing the American policy as "violating human dignity, xenophobic, and worthy of the worst horrors of the Nazis," and ordered that all Americans arriving in Brazil be subjected to the same treatment. 
The Brazilian Foreign Ministry has justified the action by citing the principle of reciprocity, which it described as "a basic element of international relations." But the appeals court judge who issued the Monday ruling, Catao Alves, rejected that position, noting that the heightened security measures here were not taken for the same reasons that the United States has cited for its measures.
"If the United States of America has reasons to adopt the measures that have been questioned by the prosecutor's office," the judge wrote, "Brazil, with no plausible motive since the fear of terrorist attacks happily is not part of national life, cannot do the same solely on the basis of reciprocity, because that would cause millions of dollars of damage to the national economy."
Over the weekend, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva brushed aside objections that the judiciary was interfering unconstitutionally in making foreign policy and decided not to appeal the initial lower court ruling, which led to the Rio government's appeal. An executive order published Monday sets up an interministerial working group instead and gives it 30 days to determine permanent security procedures for arriving foreigners.
After initial delays of up to nine hours for arriving Americans, the inspection procedures at Brazilian airports and seaports are gradually improving. The Brazilian Federal Police acknowledge that they were caught by surprise when the measure was announced and are moving to install electronic machines similar to those used in the United States.
The inspection procedures applied to Brazilians arriving in the United States have been a sore spot since they were imposed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In January 2002, the Brazilian foreign minister at that time, Celso Lafer, was forced to allow his shoes to be examined when he arrived in Miami. The action was considered petty and disrespectful here and generated considerable resentful comment.
Though government officials have repeatedly said the countermeasures, widely popular here, are not a reprisal against the United States, few take those declarations seriously. "In private, mainly at the Foreign Ministry and the presidential palace, there are people who adore this saga and want to give the judge a kiss on the forehead," a columnist, Eliane Cantanhede, wrote in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo last week.
Mr. da Silva, a former factory worker and labor leader, belongs to the Workers' Party, which has often expressed anti-American sentiment during its 24-year history. Since taking office a year ago, however, Mr. da Silva, while consistently criticizing American foreign policy, has sought accommodation with the Bush administration on economic and trade issues.
Mr. da Silva and Mr. Bush are scheduled to meet Monday night in Monterrey, Mexico, at a conference of Western Hemisphere heads of state. Brazilian officials said they expected the fingerprinting dispute to come up at the talks, but indicated that they would not back away from their insistence that Americans can only be exempted from fingerprinting here if Brazilians are exempted from the heightened security procedures in the United States.

HEADLINE: Partnership Rights for Gays 

 BODY:
New Jersey struck an important blow for equal rights yesterday, when Gov. James McGreevey signed a gay domestic partnership law. The new law gives gay couples significant new rights, including financial benefits and hospital visiting privileges. New Jersey's action, which produced surprisingly little controversy, should encourage other states and municipalities to redress discrimination against gay and lesbian couples. 
 While Massachusetts's recent court decision that gay people have a right to marry was grabbing all the headlines late last year, New Jersey legislators were quietly promoting a bill to extend many of the benefits of marriage to same-sex couples. They succeeded last week when the bill, which had already been approved by the Assembly, was passed by the Senate, 23 to 9. It was striking how little opposition the bill generated: before the Senate voted, not a single senator spoke against the measure. 
 The new law addresses a wide array of injustices in New Jersey. Gay partners will no longer be excluded from hospital rooms because they are not legally recognized as family members, and will be able to make important medical decisions for each other. The law extends to gay people many of the tax advantages married couples enjoy, including the right to claim a partner as an exemption on state income tax filings. Gay partners in New Jersey are still denied some of the rights of married people, including significant financial rights. Gays should be allowed to marry, as Massachusetts's highest court recently held. But New Jersey has taken an enormous step forward.
New Jersey joins four other states and countless municipalities in recognizing gay partnership rights. In a recent cover story, Governing magazine reported that the newest group to join the fight for such laws was the business community, which increasingly views the laws as crucial to attracting the young, highly skilled work force that is needed to compete in today's economy. If this theory is right, New Jersey has helped the entire state by standing up for its gay residents.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
MEMO PAD

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
International Traffic Up For Most U.S. Airlines
 Despite tightened security measures that included more than 15 canceled foreign flights over the holidays, most domestic airlines carried significantly more international traffic last month than in December 2002, according to the airlines' monthly traffic reports.
 Foreign airlines are also reporting more robust traffic on overseas routes. British Airways' passenger traffic on routes to North and South America rose 5.9 percent in December, even though it was among the airlines forced to cancel a handful of flights because of security fears over the holidays. The airline said it had a 4.7 percent increase in traffic in first-class and business-class seats, mostly attributable to heavier demand for premium seats on long-haul flights. 
 A discernible increase in business travel has been lifting international traffic across the board, said Philip Roberts, editor in chief of the Unisys R2A Scorecard, a monthly research report.
 International traffic was not "impacted in any measurable way" by the tightening of security and the canceled foreign flights, Mr. Roberts said. In fact, he added, "there seems to be a message that customers are feeling travel is safer" as a result of the higher security at domestic airports and the introduction last week of stricter visa procedures for visitors to the United States.
 Mr. Roberts said that the increase in foreign travel had not led to higher international fares and was not likely to for some time because of intense competition on both Atlantic and Pacific routes. However, he said, the demand for business-class seats is rising in tandem with the increased capacity in airlines' premium cabins on international flights. 
 "If you don't book far enough in advance" he said, it is now sometimes "difficult to get the flights you want."

JetBlue Will Charge For Fox Programs
 JetBlue Airways, which already offers 24 channels of live television on in-seat screens, said that it was adding movies, satellite radio and other features to its inflight entertainment systems. Customers will have to pay a fee, to be announced later, JetBlue said, for the movies and other new digital video programs, though the existing DirecTV and the new XM Satellite Radio programs will be free.
 The News Corporation's Fox Entertainment Group will supply the first-run movies, as well as television features, news and sports programs, promotions for Fox products and other features. JetBlue said it would begin testing that service in the spring and expected to have it operating on all planes in the fall.
 JetBlue said it would install an "in-seat credit card reader" system for passengers to purchase selections on the new multichannel digital video system with Fox programming.

Demand Increases For High-Speed Links
 Demand for high-speed Internet service grew sharply among business travelers in 2003, hotels and other businesses say. 
 One indication of that comes from Wayport Inc., a leading supplier of high-speed Internet service for business travelers. According to Wayport, which is based in Austin, Tex,. total customer connections more than doubled in the second half of 2003.
 The company provides Ethernet and Wi-Fi service in more than 140,000 hotel guest rooms and 700 hotels, as well as in 12 airports and more than 100 McDonald's restaurants. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: To Avoid Fuel Limits, Subaru Is Turning a Sedan Into a Truck 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The Subaru Outback sedan looks like any other midsize car, with a trunk and comfortable seating for four adults.
 But Subaru is tweaking some parts of the Outback sedan and wagon this year to meet the specifications of a light truck, the same regulatory category used by pickups and sport utilities. Why? Largely to avoid tougher fuel economy and air pollution standards for cars. 
 It is the first time an automaker plans to make changes in a sedan -- like raising its ground clearance by about an inch and a half -- so it can qualify as a light truck. But it is hardly the first time an automaker has taken advantage of the nation's complex fuel regulations, which divide each manufacturer's annual vehicle fleet into two categories. Light trucks will have to average only 21.2 miles a gallon in the 2005 model year. By contrast, each automaker's full fleet of passenger cars must average 27.5 miles a gallon. 
The move will let Subaru sell more vehicles with turbochargers, which pep up performance but hurt mileage and increase pollution. "It was difficult to achieve emissions performance with the turbos," said Fred D. Adcock, executive vice president of Subaru of America. They also made it hard to meet fleetwide fuel economy standards for cars.
Subaru's strategy highlights what environmentalists, consumer groups and some politicians say is a loophole in the fuel economy regulations that has undermined the government's ability to actually cut gas consumption. The average fuel economy for new vehicles is lower now than it was two decades ago, despite advances in fuel-saving technology.
 "This is a new low for the auto industry, and it would make George Orwell proud," said Daniel Becker, a global warming expert at the Sierra Club.
 It is particularly striking that Subaru wants to call the Outback a light truck because many of its owners see the wagon version as a rugged alternative to a sport utility, and the Outback sells best in those parts of the country, like college towns, where many people think it unfashionable to own an S.U.V.
 "I probably can't count my friends with Outbacks on one hand -- I'd have to use feet and toes," said Elizabeth Ike, 29, a fund-raiser at Sweet Briar College, which is an hour south of Charlottesville, Va. She said "the Outback might as well be Charlottesville's official car," adding that the town "likes to think of itself as an island that is more globally aware than the rest of the state."
 "I don't want to speak for my friends, but I think they probably don't want to be that person in the Excursion," she said, referring to Ford's largest sport utility.
 Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, says the new Outback, which will make its debut next month at the Chicago auto show and go on sale this spring, will retain its not-an-S.U.V. image because the changes being made are technical in nature. What customers will notice will be the new Outback's glossier look, executives said. Further, the base model will be more fuel efficient than the current version.
 They said that calling the Outback a light truck will also let them offer the option of a tinted rear window not allowed on passenger cars.
 Subaru executives noted that the sedan version of the Outback accounts for only about 8 percent of the model's sales, or about 3,500 vehicles a year; the rest are wagons. But critics say the actual numbers are less important than the precedent that the reclassification would set.
 "If they can do it with a sedan, then anyone can do it with a sedan," said John DeCicco, a senior fellow and fuel economy expert at Environmental Defense. "It's almost like anything goes at this point."
 Federal regulations originally set less-stringent fuel economy and emissions requirements for light trucks to avoid penalizing builders, farmers and other working people who relied on pickups. But the exemption opened the way for automakers to replace sedans and station wagons with vehicles that fit the definition of a light truck, notably sport utility vehicles and minivans.
 Light trucks now account for more than half of all passenger vehicles sold in the country, up from about a fifth in the late 1970's.
The Transportation Department oversees corporate average fuel economy regulations and fines companies that do not comply with the rules.
 Companies that change a borderline vehicle can benefit in two ways, because a big wagon that can sink an automaker's car average may improve its truck average. That, in turn, makes it possible to produce more big trucks and still meet the overall truck standard.
 Since the regulatory system was put in place after the oil shocks of the 1970's, the industry has not only invented the minivan and greatly expanded the sport utility and pickup markets, but also started selling wagonlike "crossover" vehicles, like Chrysler's PT Cruiser, that blend cars and S.U.V.'s but are designed to meet the specifications of light trucks.
 There are different ways to make a car meet the federal definition of a light truck, including making the rear seats removable to give a wagon a flat loading floor or raising a vehicle's ground clearance to at least 20 centimeters, or a little less than 8 inches. Subaru will raise the Outback's height from a minimum of 7.3 inches to as much as 8.7 inches next year, and will make other adjustments, like altering the position of the rear bumper, to meet light truck specifications.
 Significantly raising the ride height can have a hazardous effect on a vehicle's stability. Part of the current Outback's appeal is that it performs better than S.U.V.'s on rollover tests.
 "I live in the northern suburbs of New York and I saw a lot of S.U.V.'s on their backs like turtles," said Ralph Schiavone, 46, a consultant who lives in Westchester County, N.Y., explaining why he bought an Outback.
 Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department, said a vehicle either met the specific technical requirements of being a light truck, or it did not. "They aren't a judgment call," he said.
 Added to the complexity of the system is the fact that tailpipe emissions of pollutants are overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency, which has classification rules that do not match those of the Transportation Department. The E.P.A., however, has said it will phase out the distinction between cars and trucks this decade.
 Congressional efforts to change fuel economy standards face entrenched opposition from some members of both political parties. But last month, the Bush administration proposed an overhaul of fuel regulations for light trucks and an altered definition to rein in classification problems.
 Environmental groups and consumer advocates have generally criticized the administration's proposals as potentially making a complicated system even more prone to manipulation, though they say aspects of the plan -- in an early, undetailed form -- could be beneficial.

HEADLINE: Fast Gaining in Technology, China Poses Trade Worries 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
To high-technology companies, China has been a land of seemingly pure promise in recent years. Not only is it a fast-growing consumer market, but it has also become a low-cost workshop for assembling technology products for American, European and Japanese concerns.
 But as China moves to expand its own technology industries, the government has taken unusual steps that are leading to new trade tensions with the United States, according to Silicon Valley executives, trade experts and United States officials. These measures include efforts to develop Chinese software standards for wireless computers, the introduction of exclusive technology formats for future generations of cellphones and DVD players -- even tax policies that favor computer chips made in China and sold in the Chinese market. 
 "The issue here is what path will China take as it develops its technology industries," said Bruce P. Mehlman, a former technology policy official in the Bush administration who is the executive director of the Computer Systems Policy Project, an industry group. "Will it take a more global, market-based approach, or will it try to change the rules and disadvantage others?" 
 Concerns over China's strategies intensified last month when it announced that foreign computer and chip makers that want to sell certain kinds of wireless devices in the country would have to use Chinese encryption software and co-produce their goods with a designated list of Chinese companies.
 Foreign computer makers, led by American companies, have protested the decision. In addition to their concern about the separate standard, foreign companies are worried about the possible loss of intellectual property if they are forced to work with Chinese companies that have the potential to become competitors. 
 The quarrel over technical standards compounds the friction over a longer-standing dispute on tax policies. The semiconductor industry is protesting a Chinese tax that is as much as 14 percent higher on imported computer chips than on those designed or manufactured in China, whether by domestic or foreign companies. The higher tax rate applies to chips used in products sold into the Chinese market but not to exported products.
 The American chip industry contends that the tax is discriminatory and will force companies to do more advanced manufacturing and design work in China, skewing investment and trade patterns. It also argues that the differential tax on imports violates World Trade Organization rules that a nation's tax policies must not discriminate against imports. The industry is pressing the Bush administration to file a complaint with the W.T.O. by March unless China modifies its policy. 
 "This tax is one of the measures that is underpinning China's semiconductor strategy, but we think it violates the W.T.O. rules," said George M. Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association.
 Chinese officials insist that they are firmly and irrevocably committed to developing an outward-looking market economy, particularly since China joined the W.T.O. in November 2001. "We want to introduce foreign competition to help release the potential of our people and our economy," said Tian Jun, counselor for economic affairs at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. "It's a pretty open market in China."
 Mr. Tian said that American concerns on technology issues were mostly misunderstandings, matters that could be resolved with further discussions -- or actions China had every right to take as a sovereign nation. "Chinese companies are working on their own technology and their own standards," he said, "but we are targeting the world market."
 Some Chinese practices may not conform yet to world trading rules, he added, but those will eventually fall away as China moves toward openness. "We don't focus on short-term trade quarrels," Mr. Tian said.
 So far, China has shown little interest in addressing the grievances of American technology companies, according to industry executives and government officials. It responded to complaints about the wireless encryption standard by giving companies until June to comply, and has offered no indication that it plans to back off on enforcing its own standard.
 The impact is likely to be greatest on devices that permit short-range wireless, or Wi-Fi, connections to the Internet, which have become popular for use in homes, offices and coffee shops. The need for improved security for such data communications is widely recognized, and a group from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is working on it.
 "Having a different standard from the rest of the world fractures the market," said Ann Rollins, director of technology and trade policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Dell, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Intel, Microsoft and others. "The implications of this are dangerous going forward."
 The wireless encryption step, according to industry executives and government officials, is part of a broader trend of China going its own way in developing technology standards. It is a movement that promises to increase trade tensions beyond Bush administration complaints about China's surging trade surplus and its tactic of keeping its currency fixed against the dollar, giving it a competitive advantage in selling to the United States. 
 "Standards have become the new battleground, unfortunately," said Phillip J. Bond, under secretary of commerce for technology policy. How the issues of standards will play out is uncertain. The wireless encryption standard, if unchanged and mandatory, could prompt a trade challenge from Washington. "That is both a trade concern and standards issue," Mr. Bond said. "This looks much more like a government regulation than a standard."
 Encryption codes for communications have often been regarded as a matter of national security and thus rightfully determined by governments. Over the years, the United States has also tried to control computer cryptography standards.
 But the American critics of China's wireless encryption standard contend that Wi-Fi communications, which typically extend no more than a few hundred feet, are a purely commercial use and not a national security concern.
 Given its huge consumer market and an economy in rapid ascent, trade experts say, China will increasingly have the power to influence standards in technology, just as Britain set standards in the 19th century and the United States in the 20th century.
 Today, the principal international standard-setting organizations have representation from many countries, including China, but American interests often carry the greatest influence.
 "We are accustomed to the United States being the biggest market and the technology leader, so the standards have largely been American standards," said Clyde V. Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a former trade negotiator. "But China is going to be the biggest in the world for a lot of things. If the Chinese have the biggest market for cellphones, DVD players, computers and other things, they will have a lot of power to set technology standards."
 China's effort to develop its own technical standards for the next generation of DVD's appears to be an effort to avoid hefty royalty payments to patent-holding corporations in Japan, the United States and Europe. About half of the world's DVD players are now made in China.
 The new discs will hold four to five times the digital video and audio data of those currently on the market. The next-generation discs and their players will not be widely available until at least 2005, but the world's largest electronics, computer and entertainment companies are already battling over whose technology will become part of an industry standard.
 The Chinese standard, called EVD, appears to be "more an escape hatch around the patent pools of the established companies than a technology breakthrough," said Richard Doherty, president of the Envisioneering Group, a technology consulting firm.
 Yet the Chinese standard is less than completely indigenous. For example, the video compression software for the standard comes from On2 Technologies, a company based in New York. After more than a year of negotiations, it won out over software offerings from larger rivals like Microsoft, Douglas A. McIntyre, On2's president, said. 
 Indeed, a significant restraint on China's freedom to set standards is that it is not yet a wellspring of technological innovation. To become a leader in innovation, analysts say, China needs to work closely with and learn from the leading American companies -- and that would suggest cooperation on standards as well.
 The Chinese have, in fact, adopted roughly 8,000 international product standards, but they have also created 20,000 national product standards. "China has national standards that are basically what we would say are regulations," said Oliver R. Smoot, president of the International Organization for Standardization, a federation of national standards bodies based in Geneva. "It's totally different from the U.S. approach, which is for producers to write a document and call it a standard. Then, people are free to adopt it or not."
 The question, Mr. Smoot said, is how China will proceed as it becomes an increasingly prominent player in the global economy. "What most people would like," Mr. Smoot said, "is for China to join in and we all roll forward together."

HEADLINE: Employment Giant Discloses Accounting Problems 

BYLINE:  By FIONA FLECK and FLOYD NORRIS; Fiona Fleck reported from Geneva for this article, and Floyd Norris from Paris.

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Shares in Adecco, the world's largest employment-services company, plunged Monday morning after the company said that problems with accounting and financial controls would force an indefinite delay in its 2003 profit figure.
 At the low in Swiss trading, the stock was down 48 percent, but it recovered some of its losses later on and ended with a loss of 35 percent, falling 28.8 Swiss francs to end at 53 Swiss francs, or $43.40. 
 In an interview Monday, Adecco's chief financial officer, Felix Weber, said the company's announcement made the problems sound worse than they were. In a statement released before the Swiss market opened, Adecco said that it had found "material weaknesses in internal controls in the company's North American operations of Adecco staffing." 
 The statement added that Adecco was also looking into "possible accounting, control and compliance issues in the company's operations in certain countries," which it did not identify, and that its results would be published once all of these issues had been resolved.
 An independent lawyer, who was not identified, was appointed by the board's audit and finance committee to conduct an investigation, the company said.
 Mr. Weber, the chief financial officer, said the problems should not be seen as accounting irregularities, the view taken by many analysts and news reports.
 "It doesn't mean you have irregularities, but that the control environment is not so good," Mr. Weber said, referring to the company's statement. "It's not a question of mistakes, but a question of judgment," he added, speaking from the corporate headquarters in Wallisellen outside Zurich.
 "We wanted a delay due to a change of audit approach and due to material weaknesses identified," he said. "Because of this, we have ordered an audit and review of compliance in other markets," he added, saying the checks in other countries were spot-checks rather than complete reaudits.
 "We do not feel comfortable that we can rely on the control environment in the U.S.A.," he said.
 Adecco was formed in 1996 when Adia of Switzerland was merged with Ecco of France. It acquired Olsten in the United States in 2000 in a $1.6 billion cash and stock transaction.
 Adecco was audited until 2001 by Arthur Andersen, which collapsed in the wake of the Enron scandal. It was audited in 2002 by Ernst & Young, which gave Adecco a clean opinion and said that it complied with United States accounting rules. Ernst will conduct the reaudit in New York.
 Adecco's shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as in Switzerland. In later New York trading, American depository receipts, representing a quarter share, were down almost 26 percent, or $4.37, to $12.56.
 Last fall, Adecco reported that its United States operations had run into operating headwinds, but it was not clear Monday whether those problems played a role in the control issues the company cited.
 In its third-quarter financial release, it said that United States sales rose 4 percent in dollars but were down 9 percent in euros. The company said that "profitability was again affected by higher costs for workers compensation and unemployment insurance." It added that "operating costs have been further reduced, but these reductions do not cover the loss of gross margin."
 A large shareholder in Adecco, Klaus Jacobs, a former co-chairman of the company whose son now serves on Adecco's board, reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that a company controlled by his foundation sold shares in December.
 The company, KJ Jacobs A.G., reported selling 78,938 shares in the Swiss stock market from Dec. 2 through Dec. 15. The shares sold for the equivalent of $8.3 million, or $3.1 million more than they were worth at the Zurich close on Monday.
 In a telephone interview, the chief financial officer of KJ Jacobs, Daniel Pfister, said that he had made the decision to sell the stock, which he said was a small part of the overall position. The filing said KJ Jacobs owns 21.9 million shares, or 11.8 percent of the company.
 Asked why the shares were sold last month, Mr. Pfister replied, "We don't comment on our investment decisions."
 That same S.E.C. filing reported that KJ Jacobs had transferred 6.39 million shares to members of Mr. Jacob's family. Ekkehard Kuppel, the chief executive of KJ Jacobs A.G., said the transfer had long been planned and took place on Dec. 12 because that was the 18th birthday of Mr. Jacobs's youngest daughter.
 He declined to say if the family members had since sold any shares. The block transferred to them in December was worth $645 million at the time. It was worth $414 million at Monday's closing price in Zurich.
 Mr. Weber said that Adecco had an opinion on when the company would issue its delayed 2003 results, but he said he could not give it because he did not want to pressure the auditors as they went over the company's North American accounts again and double-checked Adecco audits in other countries.
 Asked who was responsible for Adecco's weak control or accounting environment, Mr. Weber said, "It goes right down from the C.E.O. to regional management."
 Mr. Weber said that he regretted that analysts and investors appeared to have misinterpreted Adecco's statement. He said the wording had been determined by the company's United States lawyers, who wanted to assure it complied with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Earlier, an Adecco spokeswoman in Zurich, Vanessa Muir, said that neither she nor anyone else at the company was authorized to comment at this stage "because of legal restrictions." But Mr. Weber broke the company's silence.
 In the interview, Mr. Weber said the problems disclosed on Monday were unrelated to an incident two years ago, when analysts said the company appeared to have overstated profits.
 Ronald Wildmann, head of Swiss equity at Bank Leu in Zurich, said that in the first quarter of 2002 "there were some fears that accrual adjustments were credited back" to the profit-and-loss statement, he said. "As a result the worry was that the published increase in gross margin was probably overstated."
 Mr. Wildmann said that Mr. Weber explained at the time that itwas just a timing issue between quarters and in the end, Mr. Wildmann and other analysts accepted Adecco's assurances that this was a one-time issue of relatively little importance.

DISNEY TO CLOSE ANIMATION STUDIO IN ORLANDO

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 The Walt Disney Company said yesterday that it was closing its animation studio in Orlando, Fla., and cutting more than 250 jobs as it shifts to computer animation from hand-drawn animation. 
Some of the employees will be offered jobs at Disney's animation studios in Burbank, Calif., the company said. Disney has been steadily shrinking its animation department, from a peak of 2,200 employees in 1999 to 600 today. The company has also been cutting back on hand-animated films, which are more labor-intensive and cost far more than movies animated by computer. The Orlando studio, opened in 1989, animated movies like "Lilo & Stitch," "Mulan" and this year's "Brother Bear."

HEADLINE: At Conference, Fox Backs Bush's Guest-Worker Plan 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
President Bush won strong support on Monday for his plan to overhaul the nation's immigration system from President Vicente Fox of Mexico, who called it "a very important step forward for many Mexican workers in the United States."
 For his part, Mr. Bush acknowledged that politics played a part in his proposal to offer legal status to millions of illegal workers, but he said that did not undercut the merits of his plan. 
 "Yes, there's politics involved," Mr. Bush said in a joint news conference with Mr. Fox in this bustling commercial center in the Sierra Madre, where the two were meeting at a conference of 34 leaders from the Western Hemisphere. "And there will be politics probably involved in whether or not it passes Congress. But the reason I proposed the initiative is because it is the right thing for America to do." 
Both leaders used the occasion to make up publicly after their split over the war in Iraq, which was opposed by Mr. Fox, once one of Mr. Bush's closest friends among world leaders. Mr. Bush essentially said here that the argument was past.
"Vicente Fox is a good enough friend for him to be able to express his opinion to me without the loss of friendship," Mr. Bush said as he stood with Mr. Fox during the news conference, at the Quinta Real Hotel. "And he didn't agree with the decision I made. But the decision I made was the right one for America."
The immigration plan is critical to the domestic politics of both men. For Mr. Bush, it offers an opportunity to appeal to the Hispanic voters who are essential to his success in the election this year. For Mr. Fox, it offers an opportunity for realizing part of a long-held goal to help Mexican migrants.
"This has been a priority of the Fox administration, and they have made that clear," said Tony Garza, the United States ambassador here. Midway through Mr. Fox's six-year presidency, much of his domestic agenda -- tax, fiscal, energy and social reforms -- has been stalled by his opponents in Congress and his own political failings. He badly needs a victory, and may have a better chance in the United States Congress than at home.
Mr. Bush said he did not see his proposal as a simple offer of legal status to Mexicans who had broken American laws, which is the view of many conservatives in Congress. Under the plan, an illegal immigrant would have to have a job and a sponsoring employer to apply for legal temporary worker status in the United States. He reiterated Monday that temporary workers would be expected to return permanently to their home countries after their work period expires.
"This plan is not amnesty," Mr. Bush said. "I oppose amnesty because it encourages the violation of our laws and perpetuates illegal immigration."
Mr. Bush's trip here to Monterrey, in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, about 150 miles from the border city of Laredo, Tex., is his fourth to Mexico since he took office. During the news conference, he invited Mr. Fox and his wife to visit his ranch in Crawford, Tex., on March 5 and 6.
As the summit meeting formally began Monday evening, the nations still had no agreement on a declaration that is supposed to be issued by their leaders on Tuesday. Such texts are usually agreed upon well in advance. The lack of a statement indicated the depth of disagreement among the leaders.
The United States wanted the summit meeting to set a goal of 2005 for a hemispheric free-trade zone, the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. It would include the 34 members of the Organization of American States, whose economies together total $11 trillion. Cuba is not included.
But not even Mr. Fox, nor Canada's leader, Prime Minister Paul Martin, thought that was realistic. This conference, Mr. Fox noted, was not called to discuss free trade.
The conference presents Mr. Bush with the opposition of what amounts to a "new left" in South America, led by President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil. Those leaders see the world through their nations' own wrenching experiences with the free market.
Brazil has urged other countries to refuse to ratify a conference declaration including free trade unless Mr. Bush addresses the United States' $20 billion in annual farm subsidies.
Another thorn in Mr. Bush's side in Monterrey is President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. He lashed out at the very idea of formal dinners and conferences among world leaders.
"While we, the presidents, go from summit to summit, our people go from abyss to abyss," he said in an interview with a local television station. "These summits are social gatherings -- we fly, we say hello, we share one or two meals, we sign a paper, we have a photo taken, and that is all."
Whether the nations would have a paper to sign remained in some doubt on Monday night.
Another stumbling block emerged. Some leaders objected to an effort by the United States to oust nations deemed to have corrupt governments from the Organization of American States and ban them from future meetings.
Mr. Bush separately issued an order barring people deemed corrupt from entering the United States.
The United States would equate corrupt governments with undemocratic ones. The question is who decides who is corrupt. The proposal faced "a lot of resistance," said Bill Graham, the foreign minister of Canada.
"All countries have corruption," he said. "Who will decide whether a country is invited or not?"

HEADLINE: The Awful Truth 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
People are saying terrible things about George Bush. They say that his officials weren't sincere about pledges to balance the budget. They say that the planning for an invasion of Iraq began seven months before 9/11, that there was never any good evidence that Iraq was a threat and that the war actually undermined the fight against terrorism.
 But these irrational Bush haters are body-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freaks who should go back where they came from: the executive offices of Alcoa, and the halls of the Army War College. 
 I was one of the few commentators who didn't celebrate Paul O'Neill's appointment as Treasury secretary. And I couldn't understand why, if Mr. O'Neill was the principled man his friends described, he didn't resign early from an administration that was clearly anything but honest.
But now he's showing the courage I missed back then, by giving us an invaluable, scathing insider's picture of the Bush administration. 
Ron Suskind's new book "The Price of Loyalty" is based largely on interviews with and materials supplied by Mr. O'Neill. It portrays an administration in which political considerations -- satisfying "the base" -- trump policy analysis on every issue, from tax cuts to international trade policy and global warming. The money quote may be Dick Cheney's blithe declaration that "Reagan proved deficits don't matter." But there are many other revelations.
One is that Mr. O'Neill and Alan Greenspan knew that it was a mistake to lock in huge tax cuts based on questionable projections of future surpluses. In May 2001 Mr. Greenspan gloomily told Mr. O'Neill that because the first Bush tax cut didn't include triggers -- it went forward regardless of how the budget turned out -- it was "irresponsible fiscal policy." This was a time when critics of the tax cut were ridiculed for saying exactly the same thing.
Another is that Mr. Bush, who declared in the 2000 campaign that "the vast majority of my tax cuts go to the bottom end of the spectrum," knew that this wasn't true. He worried that eliminating taxes on dividends would benefit only "top-rate people," asking his advisers, "Didn't we already give them a break at the top?"
Most startling of all, Donald Rumsfeld pushed the idea of regime change in Iraq as a way to transform the Middle East at a National Security Council meeting in February 2001.
There's much more in Mr. Suskind's book. All of it will dismay those who still want to believe that our leaders are wise and good.
The question is whether this book will open the eyes of those who think that anyone who criticizes the tax cuts is a wild-eyed leftist, and that anyone who says the administration hyped the threat from Iraq is a conspiracy theorist.
The point is that the credentials of the critics just keep getting better. How can Howard Dean's assertion that the capture of Saddam hasn't made us safer be dismissed as bizarre, when a report published by the Army War College says that the war in Iraq was a "detour" that undermined the fight against terror? How can charges by Wesley Clark and others that the administration was looking for an excuse to invade Iraq be dismissed as paranoid in the light of Mr. O'Neill's revelations? 
So far administration officials have attacked Mr. O'Neill's character but haven't refuted any of his facts. They have, however, already opened an investigation into how a picture of a possibly classified document appeared during Mr. O'Neill's TV interview. This alacrity stands in sharp contrast with their evident lack of concern when a senior administration official, still unknown, blew the cover of a C.I.A. operative because her husband had revealed some politically inconvenient facts.
Some will say that none of this matters because Saddam is in custody, and the economy is growing. Even in the short run, however, these successes may not be all they're cracked up to be. More Americans were killed and wounded in the four weeks after Saddam's capture than in the four weeks before. The drop in the unemployment rate since its peak last summer doesn't reflect a greater availability of jobs, but rather a decline in the share of the population that is even looking for work. 
More important, having a few months of good news doesn't excuse a consistent pattern of dishonest, irresponsible leadership. And that pattern keeps getting harder to deny.

HEADLINE: A Glimmer of Hope on Trade 

 BODY:
Quite unexpectedly, the Bush administration has indicated a desire to revive efforts to make the global trading system fairer to poor countries. Robert Zoellick, the United States trade representative, sent letters yesterday to more than 140 other members of the World Trade Organization to express his hope that 2004 not be a "lost year" and set forth some ideas for breaking the impasse reached by trade negotiators at a meeting in Cancun, Mexico, last September.
 This is the most constructive overture by the administration since Cancun, where more than two years of negotiations to make global trade more expansive and fairer seemed to fall apart. The main culprits were negotiators from Europe, Japan and the United States, including Mr. Zoellick himself. They refused to agree, without conditions, to begin dismantling the subsidies and agricultural tariffs that hurt farmers in the developing world. 
 In Cancun's acrimonious aftermath, the Bush administration appeared content to let the talks founder. Washington portrayed Brazil and other developing nations that insisted on a clear resolution of the farm subsidy question as obstructionist, and indicated that it would negotiate bilateral agreements with more willing partners.
Yesterday's initiative suggests that the administration is wisely reconsidering that take-it-or-leave-it attitude. The United States can ill afford, on either economic or political grounds, to allow the global trade liberalization talks to fail.
Indeed, the timing of Mr. Zoellick's letters was telling -- they were sent the day President Bush flew to Mexico to meet with hemispheric leaders. America's lavish subsidies, which give our farmers an unfair advantage in the global marketplace, fuel anti-American resentment throughout Latin America.
It was especially significant for Mr. Zoellick to say he did not want 2004 to be wasted. The W.T.O.'s deadline for the now-threatened round of talks falls at the end of this year. But there has been widespread concern that the United States will be incapable of addressing the issue in an election year. 
The administration seems to be rethinking its determination to make common cause with the Europeans. In contrast with his stand at Cancun, Mr. Zoellick conceded in yesterday's letters that W.T.O. members must agree to ending export subsidies -- the most egregious kind of support, doled out mostly by the European Union -- by a specified date. The most convincing way for Washington to reclaim its moral leadership on trade, however, would be to phase out cotton subsidies, which have proved so devastating to the fragile economies of West Africa. 
The administration has floated ambitious agricultural trade proposals in the past, only to retreat from them when it mattered most. But we hope that this time, the change in tone signals the beginning of a more lasting and meaningful policy realignment.

HEADLINE: Bush Disputes Ex-Official's Claim That War With Iraq Was Early Administration Goal 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
President Bush on Monday disputed a suggestion by Paul H. O'Neill, the former Treasury secretary, that the White House was looking for a reason to go to war with Iraq from the very beginning of his administration.
 Responding to an account provided by Mr. O'Neill in a book to be published on Tuesday, "The Price of Loyalty," by Ron Suskind, Mr. Bush said he was working from his first days in office on how to carry out an existing national policy of promoting a change of government in Iraq. But the president said his focus at the time was on re-evaluating the ways in which the United States and Britain were enforcing the "no flight" zones in northern and southern Iraq. 
 "And no, the stated policy of my administration toward Saddam Hussein was very clear," Mr. Bush said at a news conference in Monterrey, Mexico, when asked whether he had begun planning within days of his inauguration for an invasion of Iraq. "Like the previous administration, we were for regime change."
"And in the initial stages of the administration, as you might remember, we were dealing with desert badger or fly-overs and fly-betweens and looks, and so we were fashioning policy along those lines," Mr. Bush continued, apparently referring to confrontations with Iraq over the no-flight zones. "And then all of a sudden September the 11th hit."
Administration officials said Mr. Bush had taken office determined to adopt a more aggressive approach toward Iraq. They said he sought a broad review of issues and options, from the effectiveness of economic sanctions imposed on Iraq to the possibility of covert action to depose Mr. Hussein.
While the administration also did contingency planning for dealing with any threat that Iraq might pose, the officials said, it was not looking for pretexts to mount a military campaign, as Mr. O'Neill suggested in the book, which was written with his cooperation and tracks the two years he spent as treasury secretary before being dismissed.
"It's laughable to suggest that the administration was planning an invasion of Iraq that shortly after coming to office," a White House official said Monday when asked about Mr. O'Neill's account.
The Treasury Department said it had referred to its inspector general for a possible inquiry the question of how a Treasury document marked secret came to be shown on a segment about the book on CBS's "60 Minutes" on Sunday. Mr. Suskind, who was given access by Mr. O'Neill to 19,000 documents that were turned over to him by the department after his departure, said the document that was shown on "60 Minutes" was the cover sheet for a February 2001 briefing paper on planning for a post-war Iraq. But he said Mr. O'Neill was not provided with the briefing paper itself. 
The book describes Mr. O'Neill's surprise at the focus put on Iraq at the very first National Security Council meeting held by Mr. Bush, on Jan. 30, 2001. Iraq was also the primary topic at the second meeting of the council, two days later. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld spoke at the second meeting about how removing Mr. Hussein would "demonstrate what U.S. policy is all about" and help transform the Middle East, the book said. 
Mr. Rumsfeld talked at the meeting "in general terms about post-Saddam Iraq, dealing with the Kurds in the north, the oil fields, the reconstruction of the country's economy, and the 'freeing of the Iraqi people,' " the book said.
The book portrays Mr. O'Neill, who was a member of the National Security Council, as concerned that Mr. Bush was rushing toward a confrontation without a sufficiently rigorous debate about why doing so was necessary.
"From the start, we were building the case against Hussein and looking at how we could take him out and change Iraq into a new country," the book quotes Mr. O'Neill as saying. "And if we did that, it would solve everything. It was all about finding a way to do it. That was the tone of it. The president saying, 'Fine. Go find me a way to do this.' "
The question of how and when Mr. Bush made the decision to go to war with Iraq has been a simmering political issue since even before the conflict began last year. 
Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, said at a news conference in Iowa on Monday that Mr. O'Neill's account amounted to a "very serious allegation"against Mr. Bush. 
But administration officials said that Mr. Bush was simply looking for more effective ways to carry out an established policy that had bipartisan backing and that there was no early decision to go to war.
In 1998, Congress passed, with strong bipartisan support, the Iraq Liberation Act, which said the United States policy should be "to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq." President Bill Clinton signed it into law. Later that year, Mr. Clinton ordered airstrikes against Iraq on the eve of the House's vote to impeach him, citing Mr. Hussein's efforts to thwart the work of United Nations weapons inspectors.
Mr. Bush, whose father decided to allow Mr. Hussein to remain in power after the 1991 war to expel Iraq from Kuwait, had made clear even before taking office that he intended to step up efforts to oust the Iraqi leader.
Imam Sayed Hassan al-Qazwini, the leader of the Islamic Center of America in Detroit, one of the nation's largest mosques, said in a telephone interview on Monday that he had spoken to Mr. Bush six or seven times, before and after the 2000 election, about removing Mr. Hussein. 
Imam Qazwini said that on Jan. 29, 2001, the day before the first National Security Council meeting of the administration, he met with Mr. Bush at the White House. The president, he said, was supportive of efforts to oust Mr. Hussein, but did not mention war as a means of doing so.
"No method was discussed at all," Imam Qazwini said. "It was a general desire for regime change."
In an interview just days before his inauguration, Mr. Bush did not sound like a man who had decided to mount an invasion of Iraq.
"We're developing our strategy," he told two correspondents from The New York Times. 
The strategy he described appeared to center on strengthening economic sanctions, which he said "resemble Swiss cheese" because so many nations had ignored the United Nations mandates on what kind of trade with Iraq was prohibited.
"Let me say this to you," Mr. Bush said at the time -- nine months before the Sept. 11 attacks, and before his first national security meeting. "Saddam Hussein must understand that this nation is very serious about preventing him from the development of weapons of mass destruction and any thought in his mind that he should use them against our friends and allies in the Middle East."

HEADLINE: Sharp Currency Fluctuations Worry Europe 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
In a toughening of Europe's stance, the chief of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said on Monday that the Continent was concerned about the "brutal" fluctuations of the currency markets.
 Mr. Trichet added, however, that Monday's gathering of the Group of 10 industrialized nations did not address the dollar's rapid slide as a risk to the global economic recovery. 
 The absence of a common front on currencies from the Group of 10, the world's top manufacturing nations, suggested that the United States was not yet willing to halt the fall of the dollar, which has dropped 18 percent against the euro in the last year, analysts said. 
 Europeans, though, took a strong line, telling the central bankers representing the 10 countries that they are concerned about sharp foreign exchange moves.
 "There was a mention by Europe that excess volatility and brutal moves were not welcome and not appropriate," Mr. Trichet said after the meeting. "We are concerned. We are not indifferent."
 Mr. Trichet, who acted as chairman of the meeting, then said that foreign exchange risk was not part of the discussion at the meeting of the group. 
 The group gathers every two months to assess the pace of the economy, which the central bankers lately see as improving steadily.
 "It was not discussed as a risk," Mr. Trichet said after the talks here. 
 The central bankers in the Group of 10, Mr. Trichet said, noted that financing conditions were favorable enough to support a firming global recovery, and saw the risks to the steady improvement in world growth as balanced.
 Analysts said the lack of any initiative on the foreign exchange issue raised questions about whether the Group of 7, which includes most members of the Group of 10, will be able to reach a currency accord when they meet in Boca Raton, Fla., next month. 
 A source from the Group of 7 told Reuters that its finance ministers would probably discuss global tensions surrounding the dollar's weakness at the meeting.
 Europeans are pressing hard on the currency issue and placed it firmly on the table at the Group of 10 gathering, even toughening their language somewhat from last week. France and Germany have expressed fears that the soaring single currency would hurt the euro zone's economic recovery, which depends heavily on exports.
 The governor of the Bank of Japan, Toshihiko Fukui, said in Basel that instability in the foreign exchange markets was troubling for every country. 
 "Foreign exchange," he said, "is seen as a risk factor by policy makers in relation to the global imbalance issue."
 This hardening in Europe's stance against the dollar's sharp drop took some steam out of the euro's rally. The single currency slipped to $1.2742 after hitting a record high against the dollar at $1.2899 earlier in the day. Yields on euro zone government bonds pushed higher.
 But analysts said that the retreat of the euro might prove short-lived because the United States seemed unconcerned by rapid currency moves.
 "Europe would prefer that the U.S. express some interest in stabilizing the dollar," said Stephen Englander, chief currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. "But from the U.S.point of view, they simply don't see it in their interest to do that. There is no downside for the U.S."
 For the Bush administration heading into the presidential election, the dollar's decline is a blessing. It quiets complaints from American manufacturers that they cannot compete with cheap imports from Asia and it helps increase American exports, lifting overall growth.
 Europeans, meanwhile, are bearing the brunt of the dollar's decline, particularly since many Asian countries are buying dollars to weaken their own currencies and protect their exports.
 France, a member of the Group of 7, is especially vocal in stressing that the exchange rate is hurting its growth prospects. 
 In Paris, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the prime minister, said officials must act quickly to bring the euro-dollar exchange rate into line, echoing complaints by President Jacques Chirac last week.
 "Instability is neither in the interests of the United States nor in the interest of Europe," Mr. Raffarin told reporters on Monday. "We must together, quickly, find the ways to ensure parities that are more compatible with economic reality."
 Italy later said that if the euro rose much further, its exporters would face a critical situation. 
 "The euro at $1.30 is the emergency threshold for our exports," Adolfo Urso, Italy's deputy minister of industry, said in a statement.
 Belgium's Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt and Germany's economy minister, Wolfgang Clement, also expressed concerns last week, calling on European Central Bank to cut interest rates to offset the euro's strength and keep European growth on track.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Urges Nations To Resume Trade Talks 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

 BODY:
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, sent letters to more than 140 countries yesterday saying he hoped to push for renewed global trade talks this year.
 Adopting a conciliatory tone, Mr. Zoellick said he would visit four countries next month to promote the convening of a top-level trade meeting this year. 
 He said that he hoped to invigorate the global trade agenda for developing nations that has languished since the World Trade Organization talks fell apart in Cancun, Mexico, last year, according to a summary of the letter released by his office. 
 "Outreach, listening is an important part of this," Richard Mills, the spokesman for Mr. Zoellick, said.
 After the collapse of the earlier talks, Mr. Zoellick accused several developing countries of being "won't do" nations that were good at making demands but poor at creating compromises. 
 Now, according to a statement released by his office, Mr. Zoellick wants to promote an approach to trade that would focus on agriculture, goods and services. But he offered few new concessions by the administration.
 Instead, Mr. Zoellick suggested compromises that would require that Europe make most of the concessions, a big step away from the agreement he reached with Europe last year. 
 For instance, Mr. Zoellick's letter said that the W.T.O. needed to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies by a certain date, a concession that hits Europe rather than the United States, which does not use those subsidies. 
 European officials said yesterday that they "very much welcome the engagement from the U.S. to reinject life into the W.T.O. talks."
 Anthony Gooch, the spokesman for the European Union in Washington, said, however, that to focus on European export subsidies without considering the United States export credits for agriculture was unfair.
 "It may look politically correct," Mr. Gooch said, "but this does not necessarily make it the necessary precondition."
 The original proposal by the United States, released in 2002, calls for a global reduction of farm subsidies that would largely leave intact the administration's annual $19 billion in farm subsidies.
 Three former United States trade representatives said at a forum last night that Mr. Zoellick was wise to break away from the Europeans and reach out to developing nations to find a compromise. "The letter was wonderful," said Carla A. Hills, who was trade representative under the first President Bush.
 The letter was reported in The Financial Times yesterday. Through a spokesman, Mr. Zoellick said he would not speak directly to the news media about his initiative.
 Mr. Zoellick is facing criticism that his trading strategy is faltering. He missed the deadlines for bilateral trade agreements with Australia and Morocco last month. He scaled back his ambitions for a free trade area for the Americas, although President Bush will try to revive that discussion in talks this week in Mexico at the Summit of the Americas. In the trade agreement reached with four Central American countries, his only new trade pact last year. Mr. Zoellick fell short of his goal of including Costa Rica, the richest nation of the five Central American nations in the talks. 
 "Bob Zoellick has no momentum and he may be backsliding," said C. Fred Bergsten, director for the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
 Some 20 developing countries -- including China, Brazil and South Africa -- formed a new trading group at the Cancun talks solely to pressure the United States, Europe and Japan to reduce or eliminate their agriculture subsidies estimated at $300 billion a year.
 They said that the unwillingness of wealthy countries to address the developing world's concerns about agricultural trade was the real stumbling block. 
 Special attention has been focused on the $12.9 billion the United States pays in subsidies to farmers to grow cotton and to United States textile companies to buy that cotton.
 The W.T.O. allowed several West African nations to make a proposal at Cancun that the United States and other nations reduce or eliminate subsidies to farmers and textile companies. The African nations said the subsidies distorted trade and unfairly destroyed the livelihood of some of the world's poorest farmers.
 In his letter, Mr. Zoellick makes no concessions on cotton but does say he will discuss the issue.
 Brazil has mounted a legal challenge to the cotton subsidies, in the first case that the W.T.O. has accepted on agricultural subsidies. A preliminary decision is expected this spring and could open the door to more cases against farm subsidies in the wealthier nations.

Subaru Avoids Fuel Limits With Changes to Outback
Subaru is tweaking some parts of the Outback sedan and wagon this year to meet the specifications of a light truck, the same regulatory category used by pickups and sport utilities. The move is mostly to avoid tougher fuel economy and air pollution standards for cars.
 Subaru's strategy highlights what environmentalists, consumer groups and some politicians say is a loophole in the nation's fuel economy regulations that has undermined the government's ability to actually cut gas consumption. Page A1.

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIALLOWERS EARNINGS ESTIMATE

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The Countrywide Financial Corporation, a mortgage lender, said yesterday that its earnings for last year would be less than expected. 
The company, based in Calabasas, Calif., said earnings were probably $12.30 to $12.45 a share, compared with a previously forecast range of $12 to $13.50. "As anticipated, refinance activity declined during the quarter due to higher mortgage rates," Stanford L. Kurland, the president, said in a statement. Countrywide forecast that 2004 earnings would be $9 to $12 a share, the same as an earlier prediction. Analysts expected the company to earn $13.05 in 2003 and $10.25 in 2004, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson First Call.

HEADLINE: Alaska Thaws, Complicating the Hunt for Oil 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: DEADHORSE, Alaska 

 BODY:
Harry Bader slogged across a patch of America's only Arctic shore, leaning into a late December gale that filled the midday twilight with blowing snow and sent the wind chill to 40 below. 
 Despite the weather, Mr. Bader, the state's land manager for the oil-rich North Slope, was consumed with one thing -- the warming climate. Oil-prospecting convoys in search of new deposits are allowed to crisscross the fragile tundra only when it is snowy and solid. But over three decades, rising temperatures have cut this frozen season in half, to 100 days from 200. 
 Environmentalists have begun to point out the contradictions in a situation where Arctic-wide warming, which many scientists say is at least partly driven by smokestack and tailpipe emissions, is curtailing the quest for a fossil fuel that is a prime source of such pollution. Nowhere is the warming trend more acute than here on this Minnesota-size stretch of pond-pocked plains and shrubby foothills. 
But even as temperatures have risen, so has the demand for oil from the Slope, which holds the country's last big known domestic reserves. And Mr. Bader's agency, the Department of Natural Resources, is bound by the State Constitution not only to protect the land, but to increase extraction of the oil and gas beneath it.
Something had to give -- and the only flexibility lay in the rules for tundra travel. So, with $270,000 from the federal Department of Energy and the help of the oil industry, Mr. Bader was out on the frigid plains testing a new way to measure the landscape's ability to withstand the impact of oil exploration.
He hiked through drifts by the light of a headlamp, leading a Caterpillar bulldozer, a Tucker Sno-Cat and other machines in Figure 8's to measure their effect on the vegetation beneath the snow. After repeating this ritual every two weeks through the winter, he will return in the summer to assess any damage.
Mr. Bader was unabashed in saying that his goal was to give oil companies and state and federal officials what they wanted, an expanded oil-hunting season, by replacing what he called an overly protective rule with something more precise.
For decades, officials have relied on a simple test to determine when the spongy soil and the carpet of lichens, sedges and other vegetation were shielded from scarring by the heavy vehicles. Six inches of snow and a foot of frozen ground -- measured by hammering a finger-thick steel bar into the earth -- meant the convoys could roll. With those rules, the exploring season had dwindled.
All of this was happening as the Bush administration, Gov. Frank H. Murkowski, the oil industry and Mr. Bader's agency were pushing more than ever to expand oil exploration. Established wells were playing out and the Senate still refused to allow the oil hunt to expand into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the most familiar part of the North Slope.
"We have to find out what the standard really ought to be," Mr. Bader said. "When the season was 200 days a year, who cared if we were off by 40 days? But we're right on that cusp of the minimum number of days now."
The oil industry says it needs 120 days a year to avoid having projects drag out expensively. "We still want to protect the Arctic environment," said Larry Houle, general manager of the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, a trade group for oil subcontractors. But because of the shrunken season, he said, "if you discover oil today it's going to take you eight years to get it developed."
Mr. Bader said he was braced for attack, knowing that environmental groups were already saying any rule revision would inevitably amount to a relaxation of protections. And his work is being watched by the Bush administration, which recently announced that it planned to open to oil development a new area of 8.8 million acres of federal lands at the western side of the Slope. The only way for oil companies to get there is to cross state lands, where access is increasingly constrained by the tundra rules.
Some tundra ecologists support the project, saying it may result in better protection. For example, they say, abundant snow is not always beneficial. If it falls too early in the season, it can act like insulation, preventing the soil from freezing. A more flexible way of assessing conditions could take such issues into account.
But others say it is folly to propose lengthening the potentially destructive travel season amid a sustained warming trend. This is particularly true, they say, on the treeless tundra, where a veneer of boggy vegetation overtops a few inches to a foot or so of soil that thaws and comes alive a few months each year, providing food and habitat for hundreds of species of birds and mammals. That living layer sits on up to 2,000 feet of perpetually frozen ground, called permafrost. If the permafrost starts to thaw, that process is hard to stop.
"I don't think one can be overly protective, but underprotective is a distinct possibility," said Prof. Bruce Forbes, a tundra expert on the other side of the Arctic, at the University of Lapland in Finland. 
Tundra damage is already far worse, he said, in places like Siberia, where warming is as sharp and rules are rarely enforced. "It is ultimately a matter of the risks one is willing to accept," he said. "Rehabilitation of tundra vegetation is extremely difficult in northern Alaska, and once the ice-rich permafrost substrates have melted, they are not coming back."
Mr. Bader, 41, who is completing a forestry doctorate at Yale to go with a Harvard law degree, said he was confident he could fulfill his dual mission: to protect and exploit the North Slope. He emphasized that he was merely creating a new tool for policy makers, not setting a new standard -- yet. "Science can inform what your options are, but at the end of the day, every single resource management decision is political," he said.
For the moment, Mr. Bader, who left a tenured professorship at the University of Alaska for this state job in 2001, was consumed with gathering the data, and clearly reveling in the work. Over the howling wind and diesel roar, he yelled: "Big toys, big science, big country! It doesn't get any better than this." 
The day before the big vehicles rolled, he and an assistant, Todd Nichols, spent long, cold hours using a device that is replacing the hammer and rod of old -- a custom-built "slide hammer," to measure ground hardness. It is a calibrated steel rod with a 15-pound sliding weight that is dropped, not pounded, giving a precise measure of the force needed to pierce a foot of soil.
"What we want here is repeatability," Mr. Bader said. The old test could vary, depending on who swung the sledgehammer. 
Dr. Max Brewer, a retired geologist and former state conservation commissioner who first worked on the Slope in 1949, is widely credited with creating the "6 and 12" standard after assessing damage from early careless practices. Now 79 and living in Anchorage, he said he supported Mr. Bader's effort to bring some scientific precision to the tundra-travel analysis. 
But he said a new policy expanding access to the oil would require cooperation between environmentalists and industry engineers. "If they don't work together, you don't have a chance of success, because you either overcontrol or undercontrol," he said.
For now, environmentalists are expressing strong concern. They say economic pressures to relax the standard are too great; the Department of Natural Resources has a built-in conflict of interest; and the study is assessing just two 40-acre sites out of more than 50 million acres of variegated territory and running over just two summers.
"This is America's only Arctic heritage," said Deborah Williams, executive director of the Alaska Conservation Foundation. "How much do we push the envelope in this fragile ecosystem that is experiencing so much change and warming?"
In a telephone interview, Governor Murkowski, a Republican, said any changes in the way the state regulates the tundra season would be done "responsibly," adding: "We're not influenced or encouraged by industry. Either conditions are right to warrant activity or, if not, they've got to get out."
But something has to change if oil development is to continue, he said. And oil remains the lifeblood of his state. 
Mr. Bader, who a decade ago had his right arm bones splintered by Serb captors while working as a human-rights investigator in Bosnia, said he was not fazed by the pressures that come when industry meets ecology. As he crisscrossed the tundra with his slide hammer and shepherded the vehicles over his test plots, he repeatedly cited his hero, Gifford Pinchot, the pioneering American forester. "You've got to make wealth for society while stewarding the environment," he said. "That's what trips my trigger."
Even this single round of tests, however, revealed how variable the tundra is, and how complicated the task of protecting it with more precision will be. 
At one test site, in the generally softer foothills, 59 drops of the weight were required to reach a foot on one attempt. Just a yard away, it took only 6 to reach the same depth.

VISIBLE SCARSIf the ground is too soft, vehicles can compress the soil and shred it as they turn sharply. Current rules for tundra travel demand at least 6 inches of snow and ground frozen to a depth of 12 inches, but oil companies and the State of Alaska are looking for ways to extend the travel season. LOW CLEARANCERounded tufted plants called tussocks have less snow cover and can be scraped. MELTING PERMAFROSTDamaged soil can cause permafrost to melt, making an area wetter. Some plant species, like lichens, can be replaced by hardier species, forcing animals that eat lichens to forage elsewhere. VEHICLE TRACKSCompressed soil creates troughs that fill with water as snow melts. These scars can last for decades. WEB OF TRACKSFleets of seismic and camp vehicles exploring for oil in 2001 scratched paths in the tundra. The following summer, tracks were still etched on the landscape.

New SARS Reports, New Questions on Tracking

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
What a difference a year can make in the international tracking of infectious diseases like SARS, which created havoc with international travel and economies in 2003.
 A year ago, the transmission of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, was occurring in Guangdong Province in China. But provincial and Chinese officials did not report SARS to the World Health Organization, as they were supposed to do. Initially, officials kept secret the cases of the new disease that were first detected in November 2002. Then officials lied until the disease spread from Guangdong and China to other countries in Asia and Canada in February 2003. 
 Confronted with that evidence, China could no longer deny the beginning days of what the W.H.O. called the first severe and easily transmissible disease to emerge in the 21st century. 
Now, in an effort to persuade the world that they are cooperating and taking steps to control the disease, Chinese officials have slaughtered hundreds of civets and other animals in which the SARS coronavirus has been found. Also, they are reporting even suspect SARS cases to the W.H.O., something that is not required, said Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the United Nations agency.
But the spate of new cases reported by China -- one confirmed and three suspected -- has caused some confusion and some concern. From a reporting standpoint, this is a more honest approach compared with reactions to previous cases, when not only China, but also other countries lied, despite agreements to share such information.
Unintentionally, the more open reporting may be distorting the picture. The reports have sparked concerns over the possibility of a new outbreak in China and Hong Kong, although no one is certain.
So far this year, epidemiologic investigations have found no link between any two of the four cases. Epidemiologists have traced hundreds of people who came in contact with the patients in the early days of their illnesses, but the experts have not turned up more infections.
That, in turn, raises the crucial question: how severe is the problem if doctors identify cases but health officials cannot find the sources? W.H.O. officials say they do not know. The agency says that it is still very early in its investigation and that it urgently needs more information about what Chinese officials know about the four cases.
The Chinese officials had agreed to send specimens from the first patient to other laboratories in the W.H.O. network and said they would do the same for the second case. Presumably, they will do the same for the others.
Without definitive test results, there are several possible explanations for the uncertainty surrounding the new cases. Diagnostic tests in the initial stages of SARS are imperfect. They tend to be more reliable as a patient recovers.
Test results are relayed from local to national to international officials in China, as they are in the United States and elsewhere. So there could be delays in relaying results from Guangdong to Beijing and then to the World Health Organization.
If Chinese officials broaden the definition of a possible SARS case, they will probably turn up cases unrelated to SARS, like other respiratory diseases with similar symptoms.
Even the significance of the one confirmed case is unclear. The patient is a 32-year-old freelance television producer who was discharged from a hospital in Guangdong after recovering fully and uneventfully from pneumonia. The man denied having any contact with civets, an animal related to the mongoose. All 81 of his contacts are well, and the observation period is over, the World Health Organization said.
The second reported patient is a waitress, 20, at a restaurant in Guangzhou, the province capital. She is hospitalized and is reported to be recovering. She reported coming in contact with 100 people in the 14 days before her illness, and all are so far reported well.
Responding to an invitation from Chinese officials, the W.H.O. has sent experts in epidemiology, infectious diseases, sanitation and other fields to Guangdong to seek a possible source of the man's infection. The team is also expected to help Chinese officials investigate possible environmental sources of transmission from other humans and animals.
Chinese officials have not disclosed the number of people tested for possible SARS. If they have tested hundreds of people and only the four have shown some evidence of SARS, then SARS might represent less of a health problem.
Because the available tests to detect SARS in its earliest stages have serious limitations and the virus often cannot be detected in sputum in the first days of the illness, the health organization has recommended that doctors take specimens from the nose, throat, stool and blood. No stool specimen was taken from the television producer, according to a scientist involved in the investigation.
The initial tests on the producer caused confusion. But other tests on similar specimens did not, prompting some virologists to question whether the initial specimen was contaminated at a lab where earlier tests for SARS had been conducted.
The W.H.O. now says, "Each specimen should be divided into samples at the bedside, rather than in a laboratory, where the risk of contamination is heightened."
The advice is needed, the agency said, because "it is likely that numerous other suspected cases will be reported over the coming weeks."
Health officials say they believe that they need to investigate each suspected case and that health workers should wear gowns, gloves, masks and other cumbersome equipment to care for patients in isolation. The reason is that outbreaks of many infectious diseases start with one case. The costs of chasing down a number of false alarms is less than missing the one case that could start another international epidemic like the one last year.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Joseph E. Stiglitz ("The Broken Promise of Nafta," Op-Ed, Jan. 6) correctly identifies the geopolitical benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement as being far more important than its modest economic benefits. 
But we take issue with his attack on Nafta's foreign investment provisions. 
 The main issue is fairness, not some new set of corporate rights. Nafta obliges governments to treat foreign investors equally vis-a-vis their domestic counterparts, including in matters of expropriation. This precept is deeply embedded in United States law and practice. Thus Nafta raised the bar for legal protection of private property in Canada and Mexico.
Nafta does not inhibit the ability of governments to regulate in areas like the environment, health or safety. It simply says that government regulations must be applied fairly and not serve as a cloak for protectionism.

Rebrand Fido? An Idea Best Put Down

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
MANY years ago, so far back that "orange alert" meant your Uncle Maury was returning from Florida with a crate of citrus fruit, Jules Feiffer drew a cartoon strip about poverty. It was a series of "talking head" panels, each with the same man. He used to be poor, he said.
 But someone told him that "poor" was defeatist. He was, instead, needy. Then another person came along and said "needy" was no good. Our man was "underprivileged." So he went around being underprivileged, until someone else said he should really think of himself as "disadvantaged." 
 He still didn't have a dime to his name, the man finally said.
But he was building a heck of a vocabulary.
That old Feiffer strip came to mind the other day with word that the city pound, formally known as New York City Animal Care and Control, planned to give pit bulls a makeover. Think of it as "Clear Eye for the Stray Pup."
An obvious problem with pit bulls is that their very name does not exactly inspire universal confidence or affection. So Animal Care and Control, a nonprofit agency that works with the city's health department, decided that a new label -- and perhaps with it a new image -- was in order. Thus was born the "New Yorkie."
Faster than you could say Rin Tin Tin, New Yorkers made clear that they thought this the most misbegotten idea since jalapeno soda. Their growls reached Ed Boks, the animal control agency's executive director. In short order the New Yorkie as an idea was, if you will, put down.
"It was a hot-air balloon to see how people would react, and we've pretty much scrapped it," Mr. Boks said. "It sort of misfired. It turned more into a distraction than anything else."
Perhaps it was inevitable that the suggested name change would invite derision. This is a city where people are ready to boo their own grandmothers if they feel the situation calls for it. Mr. Boks may not have seen the Bronx cheers coming because he had arrived here only recently, from Arizona.
His intentions were honorable. Each year, his agency arranges for the adoption of 11,000 animals; cats and dogs reign. But 35,000 others, including nearly 6,000 pit bulls, have to be killed, though the approved word is the much nicer-sounding "euthanized."
Mr. Boks ("rhymes with jokes") wants to bring that number down to zero in five years. "It may take longer," he said, "but there's a lot to be said for deadlines."
INDEED. We know from deadlines. But there is simply no accomplishing what he wants without persuading more people to take a dog or a cat home. With that in mind, he figured that giving pit bulls a cuddlier name would be one way to give them a leg up.
They're really not as bad as many think despite their reputation as child-killers, Mr. Boks said. In the right hands, he said, a pit bull can be as personable as any breed. It's when drug dealers and other ne'er-do-well owners enter the picture that bad things happen to good dogs.
Although his tactic backfired, it was no different from what many people do when faced with what might be called a branding problem. Movie producers sometimes reissue a poorly received film under a new title in the hope that it will not bomb a second time.
Some leading hip-hop labels altered their names recently to clean up their misogynist, violence-prone reputations. Murder Inc., for example, now calls itself The Inc. Another label, Death Row, recast itself as Tha Row. Tha reason for tha changes is plainly to bring in more dollaz.
Government has long been a leader in rebranding. In Edward I. Koch's first term as mayor, his budget people proposed "service delivery system consolidations." That was what they called school closings. Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, welfare offices became "job centers."
Long before that, prisons were turned into "correctional facilities" and their wardens became "superintendents." 
And politicians of all stripes have never been eager to acknowledge that they preside over economic decline. Rather, they experience "negative growth."
After all that, labeling an animal with image troubles a New Yorkie doesn't sound so absurd.
Maybe Mr. Boks would find less resistance if he renamed not the dogs but the owners. He could call them "heroes." The word is already so overworked that stretching it a bit further would be barely noticed.
Better yet, ask Jules Feiffer if he has any thoughts. He's proved himself to have a keen ear for an enriched vocabulary.

HEADLINE: Once More, a Waft of Smoke; 
Citing Hardship, Upstate Bar Wins Reversal of State's Ban

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: CICERO, N.Y., Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Decades ago, David A. Damon Jr. used to come to his father's bar and banquet hall to spin records, the vinyl kind, for the regulars. 
 It was a place where people stopped after fishing on Oneida Lake. Or for banquets celebrating another year of bowling competition. For nine years, the Elks ran the hall, about 10 miles north of Syracuse, as their private club. But in 1996, when the club could no longer afford the mortgage payments, the son took it back as his retirement venture. 
Mr. Damon never meant to make much money. His business, Damons, was just a place where the memories were as old as the chairs (also the vinyl kind). 
 But he never meant to lose money, either. And he did after the state's smoking law went into effect last July. "I got killed," said Mr. Damon, 69, a retired engineer. "I didn't just lose the smokers; I lost the friends of the smokers, the nonsmokers, who didn't want to hang out without them."
 "People used to come in after golfing," he added. "I stopped seeing fishermen, too. I used to have bowling banquets, but people decided they'd rather shake hands at the last game and go home. They changed their lifestyles."
 When the weather began to turn last fall, even the bar's loyalists dropped off after growing tired of tramping out to the gravel parking lot in the cold for a smoke. Mr. Damon said his receipts were down by $1,000 a week. He laid off his only employee, a part-time bartender, and was using his retirement savings and Social Security checks to keep the bar open.
"There used to be 15 to 20 cars in the parking lot, and now you see two," said Michael Smith, a regular who gave up smoking years ago.
 Alarmed, Mr. Damon went to Onondaga County officials to exercise a provision in the smoking law intended for just such a predicament. After he proved his economic hardship, and demonstrated that the bar had a separate room suitable for a smoking lounge, the county granted a waiver. Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, a trade group, said he thought the waiver for Damons was the first in the state.
Apparently it will not be the last. "There's going to be a few more that meet the criteria," said Gary R. Sauda, the director of environmental health for the county, which is considering 24 other applications.
The association believes that 10 percent of the state's 16,000 restaurants and bars that are licensed to sell alcohol will ultimately find ways around the tobacco law. How they do so will vary.
When smoking restrictions in the state Clean Indoor Air Act were tightened last year, the state law superseded local smoking laws. But it allows New York City and those counties with full-service health departments to decide whether they will grant waivers and under what conditions. In rural counties without full-service health departments, the state policy for exemptions takes over, said Claire Pospisil, a State Health Department spokeswoman. 
Some places, like New York City, and Westchester and Suffolk Counties, do not offer waivers, health officials said. Nassau County recently decided to offer them. "It's happening as we speak," said Cynthia Brown, a spokeswoman for the county's Health Department. 
Other counties decided to offer waivers but did not establish guidelines for applications, a situation that has stalled the process. 
Some counties may have been waiting for direction from the state,which issued guidelines just in December suggesting that bars that lose 15 percent of their business may be eligible, said Mr. Sauda, the Onondaga environmental health director. Onondaga decided to not require a certain percentage, only a substantiated drop. 
Two "economically depressed" counties in the state may try to give waivers to any bars that ask for them, Mr. Wexler said, though he declined to name the counties.
The delays and different rules have led to confusion, frustration and perhaps action, Mr. Wexler said. "News that a bar in Cicero is getting a waiver has stimulated the effort for a level playing field," he said. "The smoking ban will be a major topic in the Legislature this year. I just don't think it's going away."
 Since news of the waiver broke, Mr. Wexler said, his office has been getting about a dozen calls a day from bar owners who feel hopeful for the first time since the law was passed. 
 Even in counties that have guidelines in place, like Onondaga, bar owners face a lengthy approval process. Mr. Damon said the paperwork took weeks, "not including thinking time," he said, "because I guess thinking time doesn't count." He turned over financial records comparing receipts from August through October over a three-year period, and they showed a 40 percent drop in business last year, after the ban took effect. He escorted county inspectors through Damons, showing them a separate banquet room and ventilation system.
 His application was approved and the waiver was hand-delivered during the holidays. "Now I have to see if I can get customers back," he said. 
 As reports of the waiver have spread, he has picked up some new patrons. "I saw it on the news," said Shawn Prell of North Syracuse, "and I said, 'Good! We're going to this place.' " Ms. Prell stopped in for a drink on a recent afternoon with her husband, Ed. "We even called our friends."
 The Prells confirmed what Mr. Damon believed: that smokers cut down on the number of times they went out to bars or restaurants, but not on their cigarettes, after the ban took effect. "We used to go out every week, but now we go out once a month," Ms. Prell said. "We're saving money."
 Mr. Damon clearly hopes to change that. He pointed the Prells toward the smoking lounge and poured their first drink.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Family Stays United and Determined, Despite Mother's Death From Cancer

BYLINE:  By LILY KOPPEL

 BODY:
" 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring . . . " Brendan Miller, 7, paused as he read the words of the holiday poem from a photocopied page. He looked up, stealing a glance at his audience. Then he continued: ". . . Not even a mouse."
 Meanwhile, that audience, Robert Landrau, nodded to the boy's rhythm as if it were jazz. 
 It is moments like these that make holidays and every other day special for Mr. Landrau and his family.
In February 2002, Mr. Landrau's wife, Gloria Quinones, 37, died of cervical cancer. Mr. Landrau, 33, was faced with raising the family on his own. In addition to his daughter, Stephanie Landrau, 15, there are Ms. Quinones's two sons, Pablo Anthony Rodriquez, 12, and Angel Matos, 17. Recently, Mr. Landrau has also become a father figure to Brendan, the son of his companion, June Hollins, who now shares their small apartment in a public housing project in Manhattan.
"She was fighting cancer for five years," Mr. Landrau said of his wife. "She got operated on and they said she was free of cancer, and it came back. She fought for a year and it got worse and they couldn't control it anymore. It spread all over her body. It's been very hard for us."
Making it harder still to confront that loss and those new family responsibilities has been the fact of grappling with unemployment. Mr. Landrau, a nurse, worked full time until the last stages of his wife's illness, when he quit to devote himself to her care. "What made me do that was one time she stopped breathing and I had to give her CPR," he said. "I was scared after that to leave her alone."
Although the composition of the family has changed, Mr. Landrau emphasizes strengths that have remained constant. "No matter how difficult or how different it looks," he said, "I tell them, since Mom hasn't been here and things have been different, that no matter what things are, they are still the same. Just because things look different it doesn't just mean that. Everything is just love and care and as long as you have that, you have everything in life."
Despite the pain of their loss, the family strives to remain optimistic. That is evident all around their apartment, which is decorated with stuffed animals and teddy bears, most of which were given to Mr. Landrau by his patients. He had won the largest toys for Ms. Quinones at an amusement park.
Brendan, pointing to a metal box containing Ms. Quinones's ashes, said, "Anthony says that Gloria's in there." It is in the center of an arrangement of photos, mementoes and artificial roses, the family's homemade shrine to Ms. Quinones.
The children support each other. Stephanie and Pablo help Brendan with homework. Pablo writes poetry and has Brendan hooked. "They get along very well," Mr. Landrau said. "They feed one another to get the strength and the power in that."
To get to this point, the family has had some help along the way. Since a few days after his wife's death, Mr. Landrau's family has received homemaker services from the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The homemaker, Marian King, comes six days a week -- after school on weekdays to help coordinate pickup from school, homework and dinner, and all day on Saturday. The help has been indispensable to the family and has also allowed Mr. Landrau to look for work. The family's minimal resources come from welfare and food stamps.
Through the Children's Aid Society, the family and children have been receiving counseling services. Stephanie and Pablo are working on their erratic performance in school, while Pablo is dealing with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Angel recently spent more than a year at a residential treatment facility, working on behavioral issues.
Searching for a bright spot, the family participated for the second straight year in the Children's Aid Society's Homemaker Service holiday gifts project, which was started in 1999 with funds from the Neediest Cases. The project gives $10 per parent to a homemaker, who then helps the children buy or create inexpensive gifts for their parents. Last year, the Neediest Cases contributed $810 to the initiative.
A gift for their father was a rare opportunity for the children. Brendan worked hard on a letter and picture for him. "About how nice he is," Brendan said.
Together, the children, Ms. King and Ms. Hollins planned the big gift for Mr. Landrau. One day, Mr. Landrau received a call on his cellphone. It was Ms. King, asking him to meet her and the children because they had been acting up. "I go out there and they're like, 'Merry Christmas!' " he said. "They had all these different tropical fishes for me."
For Mr. Landrau, the fish were a precious gift. But the holidays also brought a present for the whole family, one that allowed them to focus not on loss, but on its happy opposite: on Dec. 19, Angel came home.
"There is no better time than to have him back just before Christmas," Mr. Landrau said. "It was very special and wonderful."

HEADLINE: Proposal Would Tax Businesses That Do Not Insure Workers 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Two powerful interest groups, health workers and hospitals, are proposing an audacious and costly effort by New York State to cover one million people without health insurance and modernize hospitals. The proposal would be financed by a tax on businesses that do not insure their workers and by a billion-dollar state bond act.
 The plan by 1199/S.E.I.U., the health care workers' union, and the Greater New York Hospital Association comes at a time when the powers in Albany are vowing to rein in health care costs and not to raise taxes. The proposal, which would require changes in state law approved by the Legislature and the governor, is certain to draw criticism from conservatives in government and influential business lobbying groups. 
 But the union and the hospitals are a formidable political force in New York, with a history of spending millions of dollars on advertising, lobbying, phone banks and campaign contributions to bend lawmakers to their will. In the past, they have won approval from Gov. George E. Pataki and legislators in both parties for major expansions of state health care programs and state spending. 
The core of the plan is what in Albany has been called play-or-pay, a $3,000 tax on employers for each worker they do not insure, with a smaller levy for small businesses that pay low wages. No state imposes such a tax of any significant size, health care advocates say. Some of the money would be used to increase the number of people in New York's state-subsidized health plans like Medicaid, Family Health Plus and Healthy New York, which together already constitute the most expansive such system in the country.
Hospital and union officials, who control a multimillion-dollar lobbying fund, said they would use it to begin an advertising campaign in the next few weeks to promote their plan, a tactic they have used to great effect in the past. "We will do whatever it takes to educate New Yorkers of the benefits of this initiative," said Dennis Rivera, president of 1199/S.E.I.U.
The plan calls for the sale of $1 billion to $2 billion in state bonds, possibly through a November ballot question, to provide low-cost loans to New York's financially troubled hospitals. The proposal puts some broadly worded restrictions on that money, saying that it would be used, for example, to make hospitals safer and more efficient.
It calls for the state to relieve New York City and the counties of their contribution to the Family Health Plus program, a fast-growing burden that local governments complain is forcing them to raise taxes. It also gives subsidies and tax breaks to businesses that already insure their employees. The aid to counties and businesses is meant, in part, to win allies in what will surely be an uphill legislative battle.
"It is the boldest initiative we've ever undertaken," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the hospital association.
The plan's authors say that aides to Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders were briefed on it last week, and the authors intend to go public with it this week.
Reaction from the Capitol yesterday was cautious. John McArdle, chief spokesman for the Senate's Republican majority, noted that the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, had worked with Mr. Rivera and Mr. Raske in the past, and that they had pledged to help the Senate curb the cost of Medicaid, the government health plan for the poor. One obvious area of agreement, he said, is a state takeover of the counties' share of Family Health Plus, which covers low-income adults who do not qualify for Medicaid.
"At this point, I would just say we're looking at their plan, and we share the same goals here and we get there in different ways," Mr. McArdle said.
The governor's office did not return calls seeking comment.
Charles Carrier, chief spokesman for the Assembly's Democratic majority, would say only, "The Assembly is reviewing it."
The National Federation of Independent Business, the main lobbying group for small businesses, vehemently opposed the plan. "A lot of these companies don't even show a $3,000-per-employee profit, so if you hit them with a $3,000-per-employee tax, you put them under, you bankrupt people," said Mark P. Alesse, director of the New York arm of the group.
He disputed a contention by Mr. Rivera and Mr. Raske that the tax would persuade many employers to begin providing insurance.
But Clifford R. Donaldson, Essex County manager and president-elect of the New York State Association of Counties, embraced the proposal. "We believe that every New Yorker, regardless of ability to pay, deserves access to health care, and we also welcome anything that recognizes that counties can no longer afford to pay such a big share of that effort," he said.
The $3,000-per-employee assessment would be reduced, on a sliding scale, for businesses that have 25 employees or fewer and pay workers less than about $27,000 a year. Under the plan, the state would also pay 20 percent of the cost for a small business to buy worker coverage.
The people Mr. Raske and Mr. Rivera hope to cover are mostly the working poor. More than 3 million of New York's 19 million people have no health insurance. Of those, about 2 million have jobs or are supported by people who work. Most of those families have low incomes, but not so low that they would qualify for Medicaid or other government programs.
"We're talking about getting at more than half of them, more than one million," Mr. Raske said.
The state adds taxes to hospital bills to help pay for care for the uninsured so that, in effect, employers who cover their workers help carry the weight of those who do not. Lowering the number of uninsured would allow the state to significantly reduce those charges.
In recent weeks, the talk of health care in the Capitol has been about restraining the rising cost of Medicaid, which has become the biggest piece of New York State's budget. Last month, the Senate Republicans unveiled a detailed plan to curb Medicaid expenses. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, is expected to propose his own Medicaid trims when he unveils his 2004-5 budget this month.
The goals of curbing Medicaid costs and a major new program to cover the uninsured are not necessarily contradictory, but they point in opposite directions, philosophically and fiscally.
From anyone else, a plan like that put forward by 1199 and the hospitals could be dismissed as pie in the sky, especially in a weak economy. But officials in Albany say their track record requires a serious look at the proposal.
In 1999, the two groups proposed raising the state cigarette tax to pay for creation or expansion of several programs for the uninsured. The plan was at first viewed as a long shot, but the union and the hospitals spent $10 million on ads promoting it, they threatened to spend more to attack politicians who stood in their way, and they got what they wanted.
Two years ago, the state faced a budget deficit, and health care cuts were expected. Instead, 1199 and the hospital association persuaded lawmakers to approve the conversion of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to a profit-making company, and to devote much of the resulting windfall to hospitals, to pay for workers' raises.
In return, 1199, a historically Democratic union, supported the re-election of Mr. Pataki and many Republican legislators.

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students learn about the quest for a balance between oil exploration and a concern for the environment in Alaska. They then synthesize their knowledge by debating the current length of the oil-drilling season.
Author(s):
Georgia Scurletis, The New York Times Learning Network
Yasmin Chin Eisenhauer, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour
Objectives:
Students will: 
 1. Interpret a political cartoon about drilling for oil and its potential impact on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
 2. Examine how assessing the potential impact of oil prospecting in Alaska is being revised by reading and discussing "Warmer Arctic Threatens Hunt for More Oil." 
 3. Research different perspectives regarding the length of the oil drilling season in Alaska. 
 4. Synthesize their understanding of the oil drilling season in Alaska by participating in a class debate on the length of the season; write letters expressing their views regarding the length of the drilling season.
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils 
 -copies of Clay Bennett's political cartoon on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge [the cartoon can be downloaded and printed from Clay Bennett's Web site (http://www.claybennett.com/pages/arctic_refuge.html)] (one per group)
 -classroom blackboard
 -copies of "Warmer Arctic Threatens Hunt for More Oil" (one per student)
 -resources about Alaska and the oil industry (geography textbooks, encyclopedias, books on Alaska, computers with Internet access) NOTE TO TEACHERS: Prior to class, arrange desks in groups of four or five. Place a copy of Clay Bennett's political cartoon on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on a desk located in each grouping [the cartoon can be downloaded and printed from Clay Bennett's Web site (http://www.claybennett.com/pages/arctic_refuge.html)].
Activities / Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Upon entering class, students are directed to sit in groups of four or five (these groupings can be random or assigned). Instruct each group to follow the instructions written on the board prior to class: "Study the political cartoon given to your group. What is the man doing in the cartoon? What is the location depicted in the man's map? On what specific area of the map did the man's ink spill? What is the man's facial expression? What do you think the ink may represent? Based on your group's answers to the previous questions, discuss how you think the cartoonist Clay Bennett feels about drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?" After a few minutes, ask each group to share their interpretations of the political cartoon with the class. What is the perspective of the oil companies searching for oil in Alaska? How do students think global warming could potentially affect drilling for oil in Alaska?
 2. As a class, read and discuss "Warmer Arctic Threatens Hunt for More Oil," focusing on the following questions: 
 a. How have rising temperatures affected the oil drilling season in Alaska's North Slope? 
 b. How is Bader attempting to measure "the landscape's ability to withstand the impact of oil exploration"? 
 c. What is Bader's goal, in terms of his impact on the "oil-hunting season"? 
 d. What test did officials previously use to assess the protection of the tundra's ground surface? 
 e. What is permafrost? 
 f. Why is it important that permafrost remains frozen? 
 g. What does Bader consider as his "dual mission"? 
 h. How does a "slide hammer" work? 
 i. What is Governor Murkowski's perspective on the oil drilling season?
 3. Divide the class into two large groups. Explain that half of the class will be preparing to debate in favor of lengthening the oil drilling season in Alaska (Group A), and the other half of the class will argue in favor of protecting the shortened oil drilling season (Group B). Assign each group a side of the debate, as mentioned above. Before each group begins researching their assigned perspective for the debate, they should familiarize themselves with the environmental conditions of the tundra. Additionally, they should also consult a map of Alaska to determine where the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is located and its proximity to the "North Slope" of Alaska. Once this background information has been established, they should begin work on defending their stance in the upcoming debate.
 Group A (in favor of lengthening the oil drilling season in Alaska) should be divided into three smaller subgroups, each in charge of researching one of the following questions. An informative Web site that takes this stance is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge site (http://www.anwr.org). Using all available resources, students answer the following questions through their research: 
 --Why is Alaska a vital oil drilling region? 
 --How can drilling for oil in Alaska alleviate the United States' dependency on oil from other countries? 
 --What are the current protections in place that safeguard the tundra's environment from oil drilling practices?
 Group B (in favor of protecting the shortened oil drilling season in Alaska) should be divided into three smaller subgroups, each in charge of researching one of the following questions. An informative Web site that takes this stance is the Save the Arctic Refuge from Big Oil site (http://www.savearcticrefuge.org). 
 Using all available resources, students answer the following questions through their research: 
 --How does oil drilling endanger the Alaskan terrain? 
 --How does oil drilling endanger the vegetative life in Alaska? 
 --How does oil drilling endanger the animal life in Alaska?
 Once background research and research questions to help gather information for their upcoming debate is completed, students should decide who will present each aspect of their group's findings at the upcoming debate on the oil drilling season in Alaska.
 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Regardless of whether or not they are presenting their research at the upcoming debate, each student prepares a different aspect of their group's perspective for homework. For example, one Group B student may design a graphic display to show how the tundra's permafrost is affected during drilling season, while another student may choose to show how scarce oil resources have become in the United States (Group A perspective).
 In a later class, groups will present their findings in a class debate. After the debate, individual students should express their feelings about the length of the drilling season in letters addressed to Governor Frank H. Murkowski, Alaska's governor. Students may want to include their perspective on the American forester Gifford Pinchot's quote "You've got to make wealth for society while stewarding the environment" in their letters.
Further Questions for Discussion:
--How could the Alaskan tundra's ecosystem change if global warming continues at its current pace? 
 --How could each of the biomes be affected by global warming? 
 --How could expanding our energy resources affect our dependence on oil? 
 --Where are the major oil mining regions in the world? 
 --Why was the Trans Alaskan pipeline a controversial project? 
 --How have technological advances assisted oil industries that aim to protect the environment while they drill?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on their participation in small group and class discussions, thorough group research and presentations at the debate, as well as thoughtful completion of letters addressed to Governor Frank H. Murkowski, Alaska's governor. 
Vocabulary:
slogged, gale, convoys, smokestack, emissions, curtailing, quest, acute, domestic, frigid, assess, unabashed, precise, lichens, sedges, dwindled, cusp, inevitably, constrained, folly, veneer, boggy, permafrost, substrates, exploit, tenured, reveling, lifeblood, fazed, shepherded, stewarding
Extension Activities:
1. Create a diorama that represents the ecosystem of the Alaskan tundra. The diorama should include examples of vegetation, animal life and the terrain. Include a written explanation of how this representation of the tundra could potentially change due to the effects of global warming.
 2. In the article "Warmer Arctic Threatens Hunt for More Oil," Bader refers to the American forester Gifford Pinchot. Research Pinchot's contribution to forestry and conservation in the United States. Also research Pinchot's relationship with President Theodore Roosevelt. Based on your research, write a posthumous letter from Pinchot to Bush, expressing how you think Pinchot would feel about Bush's stance on drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Region.
 3. Create a succession of calendars that illustrate how the oil drilling season has gradually dwindled in Alaska. Record the average temperatures on the calendars as well.
 4. Research the protected land in your local area. How did the government designate these areas as "protected"? Why were they chosen? Are there any current efforts to threaten the protection of this area? Draw a map of your area and the protected lands within its borders. Add annotations to your map that briefly tell "the story" behind each protected space. 
Interdisciplinary Connections:
American History- Research the Trans Alaskan pipeline that was constructed during the 1970's. Write a research paper that shows how the pipeline has changed Alaska's economy, environment and communities.
 Geography- Use a world map to indicate the major oil drilling regions. Create a code to show how much oil is mined in each region.
 Global Studies- Research the Kyoto Protocol and the standards it sets to prevent further global warming. Which nations supported the Kyoto Protocol? Which nations declined to support it? Design an informational presentation designed to familiarize your peers with current strategies attempting to address global warming.
 Technology- Create a "How it Works" poster that illustrates how an Arctic Platform works. An Arctic Platform is a lightweight drilling unit on stilts 12 feet above the tundra that minimizes the effects of drilling on the tundra surface.

HEADLINE: Proposed Tax For Health Care Faces Fight In Legislature 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
A proposal to tax businesses that do not provide health insurance to workers got a cool reception on Tuesday. Republican leaders said they would be loath to raise business taxes when the economy is just beginning to recover.
 The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said he strongly supported the goal of providing health insurance to everyone, but would not support raising business taxes to do it. And aides to Gov. George E. Pataki said he was worried that the proposed tax, part of which would go to provide insurance to the uninsured, could damage the state's ability to keep companies from moving to neighboring states. In addition, it is hard for fiscal conservatives to vote for a tax increase in an election year. 
 "We don't believe this is a time to be raising taxes," said one senior Pataki aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The timing makes it difficult."
Asked about the proposal at a news conference, Mr. Pataki said, "I just don't know the specifics, but obviously I oppose taxes."
Even the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who has been a champion of expanding health care for the working poor, said he did not want to raise taxes. At the same time, however, he voiced strong support for forcing employers that do not provide health insurance to pay some of the health costs their employees eventually incur.
"There is merit in the idea of leveling the playing field among competitors, and of providing incentives to employers to provide health insurance to their employees," he said. "Somewhere in that mix we have to come up with something to accomplish both of those goals."
The proposal was floated by the state's largest health care employees union, known as 1199/S.E.I.U., and the Greater New York Hospital Association, two powerful and well-financed groups that have been enormously successful in pushing their proposals through the Legislature.
In essence, the proposal would shift some of the burden for caring for uninsured people from businesses that provide insurance to businesses that do not. Currently, businesses that provide insurance must pay a surcharge for each employee, which goes into a pool to cover hospital costs for treating the uninsured.
The plan would tax businesses that do not provide health benefits $3,000 for each worker, then use part of that revenue toenroll more people in state-subsidized health plans like Family Health Plus and Healthy New York, as well as Medicaid, the main health insurance plan for the poor. About three million New Yorkers lack health benefits. State bonds would also be sold as part of the plan to provide $1 billion to $2 billion to financially troubled state hospitals.
The Business Council of New York State immediately denounced the plan as another burden on struggling businesses. Matthew Maguire, a spokesman for the group, said a better strategy to encourage more employers to provide coverage would be to reduce the cost of private health insurance by repealing laws that mandate insurers must cover a broad array of costs. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, a small-business group, meanwhile, predicted many small businesses would go bankrupt if they had to pay a tax on uninsured workers.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
S.E.C. HAS FOUND PAYOFFS IN SALES OF MUTUAL FUNDS

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Federal officials announced a new front in the investigations into the mutual fund industry on Tuesday, saying they had uncovered widespread instances of brokers receiving undisclosed payments for steering investors toward specific funds. 
 Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission described a kind of mutual fund payola -- arrangements where a significant number of mutual funds provided cash and other compensation to the brokerage houses that sell fund shares. 
 The findings come from a nine-month examination of 15 of the largest Wall Street brokerage firms by the S.E.C. 
In one particularly prevalent form of compensation, S.E.C. officials said, the funds steered the trading of the stocks in their portfolios to brokerage houses that would promote the funds to their brokerage clients, in exchange for the trading business.
Such arrangements between fund companies and brokerage houses can be legal, if they are fully disclosed to investors. The problem in too many cases, S.E.C. officials said, is that fund investors were kept in the dark about such payments and about their brokers having a financial interest in promoting a particular fund. 
The officials said that federal securities laws and the industry's own rules required both the brokers and the funds to disclose such conflicts of interest.
The S.E.C. officials compared the issue to the conflicts that became prevalent during the stock market boom, when securities analysts were writing ostensibly objective reports about the companies that were giving investment banking business to the analysts' firms. 
"A customer has a right to know what the incentives are when the selling broker recommends a particular fund family," said Stephen M. Cutler, the head of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division. He said the agency had recently begun investigating 8 broker-dealers and 12 mutual fund families on suspicion that they had not adequately disclosed such arrangements. 
"Even if it is the best-performing fund," Mr. Cutler added, "a customer has a right to know whether a broker received anything for recommending that fund transaction."
Details of the S.E.C. examinations remained somewhat sketchy, as the commission declined to identify which brokers and funds might have been involved. But Tuesday's announcement elevated the mutual fund scandal to a new level, one that has the potential to affect millions of investors directly. 
Inadequate disclosure of payments by the fund companies to the brokerage houses has long been suspected, but for years the matter was largely ignored by securities regulators.
Last April, though, S.E.C. inspectors began to focus more intensely on such practices during examinations of mutual funds and Wall Street brokerage firms. The inquiries were a response to evidence that some funds were using brokerage firms to execute stock trades in their portfolios even though there were less expensive trading alternatives, officials said. 
The inquiries gained urgency after regulators began in September to look harder at trading practices and corporate governance at the mutual fund companies, having previously focused on the brokerage houses. 
Most of the mutual fund cases of the last four months have involved accusations either that a particular large investor received preferential treatment, or that mutual fund executives made trades for their own benefit in ways not available to regular shareholders. In such cases, any financial harm to individual shareholders might be abstract and indirect -- perhaps resulting in individuals' not getting quite as good a return on their investment as they might have otherwise received. 
But the new disclosures suggested that many ordinary investors were misled, with their investment decisions influenced by brokers who did not adequately disclose relationships that may have colored their recommendations.
S.E.C. officials said they hoped and expected that a new round of enforcement cases against fund companies, combined with a new set of rules, would force the fund companies to be more forthcoming and eliminate conflicts of interest, resulting in lower fees and expenses for investors.
The S.E.C. had already been planning on Wednesday to issue a new set of proposed rules aimed at cleaning up the mutual funds industry. The proposed rules, some of which have been fiercely opposed by the industry's main lobbying organization, will require the boards of fund companies to have chairmen from outside the companies and to allow no more than one-quarter of their directors to be insiders.
The rules would also require the funds to provide clearer disclosures on their fees and expenses and on any conflicts of interest before an investor purchased shares in a fund, and to provide a comparison of the fees and expenses with those charged by other funds. 
The S.E.C. has come under political pressure to take steps to clean up the industry and restore investor confidence. The pressure is both from Congress and from state officials, notably the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Spitzer began to pursue enforcement cases against the mutual funds last year, saying the problems had been missed by the S.E.C. 
More recently, he has been attacked by top officials of the commission for trying to induce fund companies to lower their fees as part of terms to settle those cases. 
William H. Donaldson, the S.E.C. chairman, and other officials have repeatedly said that it is not the government's business to set fees. But they have also said they hoped that by requiring greater disclosure of fees and conflicts, the fund industry would be forced through competitive market pressures to bring their costs down.
Two months ago, the commission indicated it was examining the issue of compensation that mutual funds pay to brokerage houses when Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $50 million to settle a suit brought by the S.E.C. and NASD, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers. The complaint said the firm had set up preferential arrangements with 16 mutual fund companies. 
Shortly before the Morgan Stanley settlement, the nation's oldest mutual fund company, MFS Investment Management, suspended its longtime practice of directing brokerage commissions to securities firms that sold its funds.
S.E.C. officials said on Tuesday that the results of the latest round of examinations demonstrated that the conduct in the Morgan Stanley case might have been prevalent throughout the mutual fund industry. 
The officials said that 14 of 15 Wall Street brokerage houses the S.E.C. looked at had received cash from the funds, and that 10 of the 15 had received revenue-sharing payments in the form of commissions for trading stocks for the funds' portfolios. 
The officials declined to identify any of the brokerage firms or funds, saying that they remained the subject of examinations and possible enforcement actions.
They said that their examinations found that only about half of the brokers disclosed their revenue-sharing arrangements at all, but that even in many of those instances, the disclosures appeared to have been inadequate.
Officials said the compensation to the brokers from the funds was typically for "shelf space" at the brokerage houses -- meaning access to sales staff members, promotional material and inclusion on the brokers' recommended lists. The payments varied from 0.05 percent to 0.40 percent on sales, and up to 0.25 percent of the value of the investor's assets managed by the broker. In other words, for every $100,000 in new sales, the broker would receive $50 to $400 annually, and for every $100,000 that remained invested through the broker, the broker would receive up to $250 a year.
Mr. Cutler, the head of the enforcement division, said the examinations raised significant questions about the extent to which directors of the funds knew about the financial arrangements. He also read excerpts from several prospectuses of mutual funds that suggested they had not been sufficiently forthcoming. 
Lori Richards, director of the commission's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, summarized the matter. "The central issue is, Does the customer know that a broker or registered representative has a conflict of interest?"

HEADLINE: Rise in Import Prices Is Below Expectations 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The rise in the prices of goods imported into the United States was less than had been expected in December, a government report showed on Tuesday, suggesting a weakening dollar has yet to cause inflation pressures.
 Import prices rose 0.2 percent in December, the third consecutive gain, after increasing 0.5 percent in November, the Labor Department said. 
Wall Street economists had expected a rise of 0.4 percent. 
"The thing I would just note about the import prices is that it just shows that even with a weakening dollar there hasn't been the sort of import price inflation that would cause any sort of concern within the Federal Reserve," said Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers.
Rising petroleum costs helped push up the price of imports. Excluding the 1.8 percent increase in the price of petroleum products, import prices rose just 0.1 percent.
The department said export prices rose 0.2 percent in December, helped by a 1 percent increase in the cost of foods, feeds and beverages. The price of meat exports dropped 3 percent after rising 1.7 percent in November.
The data may reinforce economists' views that the Federal Reserve has little to fear from inflation when deciding monetary policy.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
A Miami Makeover for an Aspiring SoHo of the South

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Once a drab stucco structure with a heavy cornice, the Newton Building has a new skin. Now the 1970's building on Northeast Second Avenue, just west of Biscayne Bay, sports a shimmering aluminum cylinder with a turret emerging from the roof. By day, the metal has a moire pattern. Illuminated at night, it seems almost diaphanous.
 The $500,000 makeover, designed by Walter Chatham, a New York architect, is the latest transformation in the Design District, a neighborhood of 18 square blocks that aspires to be Miami's SoHo. 
 These days, many developers across the country are building open-air shopping malls that seek to simulate an urban neighborhood, with stores spilling onto a sidewalk and apartments perched above the retail spaces. But Craig Robins, a developer who was a catalyst in the revival of South Beach, has a different strategy and objective. He wants to bring back moribund urban areas and make them better than they were originally, and more profitable. 
The buildings that Mr. Robins acquired a decade ago for what he says was $20 to $30 a square foot are now worth $120 to $150 a square foot, said Jonathan Kingsley, the managing director for Grubb & Ellis's South Florida office.
In all, Mr. Robins's company, Dacra, has bought 35 properties in the Design District -- bounded by Northeast 41st Street to the north, Northeast 36th Street to the south, Federal Highway to the east, and North Miami Avenue to the west -- and rehabilitated 20 buildings, with 500,000 square feet of space. This makes him by far the neighborhood's largest landlord, with an estimated $50 million investment. Now Dacra plans to construct new buildings, adding another 500,000 square feet at a cost of about $100 million.
The projects will be financed by borrowing against the equity in the Design District and other Dacra projects, he said. Some members of his team of architects and planners are also involved in Dacra's $225 million Aqua project, consisting of 151 houses and apartments on the private Allison Island in Miami Beach. 
The son of a Miami developer, Mr. Robins, 40, is also an art collector and local celebrity whose photograph regularly appears in the region's many magazines. Because of his flair for publicity, some real estate specialists have questioned whether the Design District can ever live up to the hype. Indeed, more than a decade after his initial investment, the neighborhood is not exactly bustling with foot traffic, except during special events like the recent Art Basel Miami art fair, and as much as 50 percent of the space in the district is unoccupied, according to John Protomaster, the owner of a furniture store bearing his name, and the president of the local merchants association. (Mr. Robins said his vacancy rate was 20 percent.) At night, the sidewalks are deserted.
Still, the neighborhood has managed to attract about 150 shops, restaurants, art galleries and sleek showrooms, including some of the biggest names in high-end home and office design, including Holly Hunt, Kartell, Knoll, Poliform, Poltrona Frau and Waterworks, and 38 architects' and designers' offices. In May, the Latin Recording Academy of Arts and Sciences, which administers the Latin Grammys, moved into 8,000 square feet in the Buick Building on Northeast Second Avenue.
Pamela Jones, a Knoll vice president, said her company, which specializes in office furniture, took a risk in 1998when it moved from Coral Gables to a 5,000-square-foot showroom on Northeast Second Avenue, becoming one of the first major retailers in the district. "You're not going to go down there and see hordes of crowds," she said. "But we have people coming down every day. And our business has picked up tremendously."
And in keeping with Mr. Robins's goal of making the Design District an extension of South Beach, which is about seven miles away, the neighborhood now has a trendy night spot -- Grass Lounge, where food with Indonesian and Peruvian accents is served under a thatched roof.
Once a thriving wholesale district for home furnishings, the Design District has only a few buildings from the 1920's -- most notably, the Moore Building, a former furniture store that was also restored by Mr. Chatham. In the late 1970's, as crime and other problems intensified in the surrounding Buena Vista neighborhood, the area began a steep decline. 
It seemed destined to vanish entirely in 1985, when the Danto Investment Company of Troy, Mich., opened its glossy Design Center of the Americas about 20 miles to the north. Known as Dcota (pronounced dakota) it now has 770,000 square feet of showrooms spread over three marble-tiled buildings, each surrounding an atrium.
In 1997, Miami officials asked Duany Plater-Zyberk, a nationally known urban planning company based in Miami, to draft a master plan for the Design District. "We understood that the neighborhood had some good bones," said Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, a principal in the firm. "It had a walkable street grid, and a lot of buildings were in place, and it had a wonderful location."
The firm suggested creating a street with a public square to break up Northeast 39th and Northeast 40th Streets, both long blocks, and make them more pedestrian-friendly while also giving the district a new center. Construction of the square, to be called Oak Street Plaza, will begin this spring, Mr. Robins said.
The plans also call for a nine-story mixed-use building to be built on a new street between Northeast First Avenue and Northeast Second Avenue, and for four two-story buildings along a curved road that will serve as a new eastern gateway to the district. 
About $12.5 million of city and Miami-Dade County money has been earmarked for street improvement projects in the Design District, said Mary Conway, the city's transportation director.
Terence Riley, a partner in Keenen/Riley, the New York firm that designed several of the new projects, characterizes the Design District as a "place for invention and experimentation" of the kind that is no longer possible in pricey South Beach.
As he invested in the Design District, Mr. Robins became a critic of the design industry's practices, like the requirement that purchases be made through a professional designer. "How arcane," he said, "for them to be hiding in fortresslike malls."
Mr. Robins acknowledges that people outfitting luxury homes are likely to seek professional assistance, but he said that making the stores accessible to shoppers would expand the market for good design. "The audience for art and design is much smaller than it should be," said Mr. Robins, who requires his tenants to admit the public to their showrooms.
The public is also free to browse the Design Center of the Americas showrooms, but Joan Kerns Kauffman, the general manager, defends the "to the trade" convention, saying that consumers need professional help to avoid costly mistakes.
She said the revival of the Design District has not affected business at Dcota, which is 97.5 percent leased. At the end of 2002, the center began opening on the second Saturday of the month, when most customers come without decorators, but Ms. Kauffman said this policy was not a response to Mr. Robins's policies at the Design District. "I give him credit for taking something very rundown and trying to reinvent it," she said, "but I don't think it has anything to do with design."
Miami officials, however, say that the district is so successful that it is stimulating development nearby. Developers Diversified Realty of Beachwood, Ohio, plans to begin construction this summer on a 600,000-square-foot big-box shopping center on land just south of the Design District that the Port of Miami uses as a container depot, and thousands of new apartments are to be built during the next three years, both to the south and southeast, said Otto Boudet-Murias, a senior adviser on economic development to Mayor Manuel A. Diaz.
"This investment," he said, "came as a result of Craig Robins focusing on the Design District. He definitely was ahead of the curve in finding the potential and capitalizing on it."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET --Manhattan; 
Law Firms Led Last Year In Acquiring Office Space

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
The law firm of Pillsbury Winthrop will move from its quarters at 1 Battery Park Plaza, the latest in a series of downtown Manhattan buildings that has been its home since the 1860's, to slightly larger offices at 1540 Broadway in Midtown.
 The company will occupy 180,000 square feet on seven floors at the Times Square building. It also has options for at least 60,000 additional square feet, said Donald G. Kilpatrick, managing partner of the firm's New York office. 
 Though Pillsbury Winthrop is the only major law firm that chose to move to Midtown from downtown in 2003, its 15-year deal was one of the 141 lease renewals and expansions by law firms that made legal offices the leaders in acquiring space in Manhattan last year. 
Over all, the legal industry absorbed nearly 3.9 million square feet of office space in Manhattan in 2003, outpacing for the first time in five years financial services concerns -- typically the most active sector, which took 2.9 million square feet -- according to a report by Jones Lang LaSalle, the real estate services firm. 
Of the total amount of space taken by law firms, 1.1 million square feet was expansion, helping to stabilize the market, said Lisa J. Kiell, executive vice president of Jones Lang LaSalle.
Cushman & Wakefield and Newmark, other real estate services firms, agree with that assessment. But Newmark's figure for the space taken by law firms was higher -- 4.5 million square feet -- because it included the deal by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, not yet closed, for 450,000 square feet at 1 World Financial Center. 
While law firms absorbed the most space in 2003, they did not overtake financial services firms in the overall space they occupy.
According to Newmark, law firms occupy 29 million square feet of the office space in Manhattan, compared with 74 million for financial services firms. 
Michael T. Cohen, president and chief executive of GVA Williams, said the 2003 leasing numbers were "more reflective of the paucity of activity by other sectors than an increase in activity by law firms." 
Still industry professionals agree that the legal industry will remain active in 2004 and perhaps even retain its lead.
Gary Greenspan, an executive director at Cushman & Wakefield, says that his company estimates that law firms are in the market for about two million square feet of office space.
One indicator of that demand was the announcement last week that Morgan & Finnegan signed a lease to move from 345 Park Avenue to just more than 100,000 square feet at 3 World Trade Center.
In making the move, Morgan & Finnegan becomes the first major law firm to choose to leave Midtown for downtown since the attacks of Sept. 11.
Ms. Kiell attributes law firms' hearty appetite for space in 2003 to "a lot of pent-up demand" by companies that finally took advantage of a soft market. She also said firms wanted "a greater New York presence." 
Barry Gosin, vice chairman and chief executive of Newmark, added that while the legal industry lost jobs over the last few years diversified firms were less affected by the recession than other industries.
Even in "times of economic turmoil," he said, a law firm's practices that deal with bankruptcy and mergers and acquisitions, for instance, remain active.
Mergers, consolidations, lease expirations, expansions, as well as future growth as the economy improves were other factors that prompted law firms to take more or different space.
Ms. Kiell added that firms also wanted to change or make more efficient use of space by, among other things, highlighting public spaces like conference rooms and moving to standardize -- and generally reduce -- the size of individual offices.
Mr. Gosin said more firms chose to stay or expand in their existing buildings rather than move.
Dewey Ballantine, for example, will expand by nearly 100,000 square feet, to just under 500,000, at 1301 Avenue of the Americas, between 52nd and 53rd Streets, and Epstein Becker & Green will expand by 25,000 square feet, to 100,000 square feet, at 250 Park Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets. 
A partner, Jeffrey H. Becker, said that "being able to get contiguous space was a major factor" in remaining at the Park Avenue building. Mr. Becker would not disclose the rent, but he did say it would "be below what we are now paying."
Mr. Greenspan of Cushman & Wakefield said law firms were the most active in Midtown, despite the generally lower rents and government incentives available downtown. He said they accounted for 27 percent of all leasing activity in transactions over 10,000 square feet, for a total of 1.8 million feet. 
Midtown's convenience, Mr. Kilpatrick said, was important to Pillsbury Winthrop's 165 lawyers and clients, half of them based overseas. The firm was created when Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts merged three years ago with Pillsbury Madison & Sutro of San Francisco.
Of his firm's rent at 1540 Broadway Mr. Kilpatrick would say only that "it is less than $50 a square foot, almost the same as we now pay."
This move, he added, puts his firm, which plans to grow to 210 lawyers, "in the best position for the next 15 years."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Corporate Earnings Jitters Send Shares Modestly Lower

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks posted moderate declines yesterday as investors, worried that fourth-quarter earnings might not meet heightened expectations, decided to cash in on some of the market's recent advance.
 Analysts said the selling reflected concerns whether the financial reports would justify recent stock gains. The anxiety overshadowed comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the United States could finance its widening current-account deficit without much consequence for the world financial system and that the dollar's decline had not brought about inflation. 
 Brian Bruce, director of global investments at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston, said: "We're in earnings season so that's completely dominating what most market watchers are looking at. They want to see no disappointments." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 58 points, or 0.55 percent, at 10,427.18. Broader stock indicators also declined. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 6.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,121.22. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index lost 15.34 points, or 0.73 percent, closing at 2,096.44.
Market breadth was slightly negative. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,618 issues advanced yesterday and 1,679 declined. Volume increased to 1.60 billion shares from 1.51 billion on Monday.
Trading has been uneven this week as the market awaits the earnings news. Stocks have risen recently, even as the number of new jobs in December fell far short of expectations and the dollar lost ground in the currency markets. Late in New York yesterday, the euro settled at $1.2750, slightly weaker than the $1.2755 on Monday. The British pound surged again, settling at $1.8720, up from $1.8464 on Monday.
The fourth-quarter financial results of Intel, the dominant maker of computer semiconductors, are due today and are eagerly awaited by investors looking for signs that the upswing in technology stock prices is sustainable. The Nasdaq composite index has been trading at levels not seen in two years.
"If Intel has a hiccup, it could burst this whole bubble on tech, at which point the whole rally could fall off," said Bill Groenfeld, head trader for vFinance Investments. "If it does well, then we can reassess where we are and we can take off again."
Intel finished down 56 cents yesterday at $33.59 on trading of more than 66 million shares. Some other technology stocks also declined. Yahoo slipped 94 cents to $48.80, and Applied Materials, a leading maker of chip equipment, fell 78 cents, closing at $23.85.
In the banking industry, shares of BB&T of Winston-Salem, N.C., closed down $1.16, at $36.63, after it reported fourth-quarter earnings in line with expectations but warned that profit growth this year would be slower because of soft demand for commercial loans.
Investors also sent AmSouth Bancorp lower despite earnings that met expectations. The stock dropped 24 cents, to $24.30.
A deal by Abbott Laboratories to buy TheraSense for $1.2 billion in cash to bolster its diabetes drugs sent TheraSense up 31 percent , gaining $6.34, to $26.64. Abbott rose 24 cents, to $44.43.
Transkaryotic Therapies fell $4.01, or 23 percent, to $13.04 on word that it was dropping its United States marketing plans for a new treatment for a genetic disorder.

	 	 		--------------------	 	

Treasury Prices Climb
(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury prices rose yesterday after Alan Greenspan said that a 25 percent decline in the dollar against some major currencies since 2002 was not accelerating inflation.
His comments reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve bank would leave short-term interest rates at a four-decade low for most of the year, even as the economy accelerates.
By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 21/32, to 101 30/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.01 percent from 4.09 percent on Monday.
Here are results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUE; 
Democrats See A New Urgency In Health Care

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Ten years after the political collapse of President Bill Clinton's health plan, the Democratic Party's presidential candidates are proposing, once again, major new programs for guaranteed, affordable health insurance, setting the stage for one of the starker contrasts with President Bush in the general election campaign.
 The nine candidates for the Democratic nomination disagree, often sharply, on how they would expand coverage, how they would pay for it, whose plan would work best and how many of the more than 43 million uninsured Americans they would try to reach. But beneath these disagreements is a consensus that a health care crisis of soaring costs and declining coverage has returned. 
 Here in Iowa, affordable health care is at the center of the middle-class populism most Democrats are advancing in campaign commercials and on the stump. At a speech here this morning, Senator John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat newly energized by The Des Moines Register's endorsement on Sunday, declared that it was time to "make health care a birthright for every child born in America, for the first time in American history." 
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who has built his campaign around a $214-billion-a-year plan to cover every American, describes it as nothing short of a moral issue. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts says health care legislation would be the first bill he would send to Congress as president.
One of Mr. Kerry's most frequently broadcast commercials in Iowa features a family in which the husband lost his job and the wife had breast cancer. "To keep her health insurance, she had to keep working right through the chemotherapy," Mr. Kerry declares. "We need to change that." 
And Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, promotes his record of achieving near universal coverage of children in his state and often concludes, "This is not some crackpot liberal idea from Vermont -- Harry Truman put universal health insurance in the 1948 Democratic platform."
The idea of guaranteeing health insurance to every -- or nearly every -- American has deep roots in the Democratic Party. But the failure of the Clinton health plan in 1994, amid a barrage of accusations that it would constitute a big-government takeover of the health care system, left many Democrats gun-shy of the issue for the rest of the 1990's.
This year, "the thing that strikes you is the progression we've made," said Kenneth E. Thorpe, a former Clinton health adviser who is a professor of health policy at Emory University. Most of the Democrats try to avoid the wholesale restructuring of the Clinton plan, which roused fears among many insured Americans that they would have to settle for less so that everyone could be covered.
Still, "they're all pretty bold plans," Professor Thorpe said.
Most of the leading Democratic candidates' health plans are many times more expensive than the main Bush proposal for the uninsured, an $89 billion, 10-year package of tax credits, he noted.
Bush administration officials and Republican strategists say they have no plans to cede the issue to the Democrats. They say the president will campaign as having already delivered the biggest expansion of Medicare in 38 years, adding prescription drug benefits for the elderly, and can thus be trusted to improve the health care system for all. "The question now is who has the track record," a Bush campaign adviser said.
So far, Democratic candidates seem uncowed by the president's Medicare accomplishments; Mr. Edwards, for example, on Tuesday described the prescription drug bill as simply shipping "billions of your dollars into the H.M.O.'s." But in a general election campaign, Republicans are convinced that the legislation will be a big advantage.
Administration officials also reject the idea that spending more federal money is the only -- or the best -- way to cover more uninsured Americans. They say that some of the president's proposals, like limiting jury awards in medical malpractice suits, will hold down health costs and make insurance more affordable. At the same time, the president's tax cuts and tax-free savings accounts give people more money and flexibility to meet their families' needs, administration officials say.
Still, Mr. Bush is expected to outline more aggressive policies this year to help the uninsured and the underinsured, and the issue could be front and center this fall. "It has the potential to both mobilize voters and persuade voters," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "You can get African-American voters, liberals, very fired up, but the flip side is, it also persuades swing voters."
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, said one of his surveys last month found that "affordable health care" ranked second, just below the economy and jobs, and above terrorism and national security, when voters were asked to list their most important issues. It is particularly important among women, Mr. McInturff said.
The Democratic debate over health care is inextricably linked to the debate over Mr. Bush's tax cuts, with most of the candidates advocating using at least part of that money to finance their health care plans. Mr. Gephardt and Dr. Dean have proposed repealing all of the Bush tax cuts, including those for the middle class, and redirecting the money toward health care. (Dr. Dean, whose health plan is less expansive than Mr. Gephardt's, would also use some of the Bush tax money for deficit reduction and other areas.) 
Their support for total repeal has drawn increasing fire from several of their rivals, who say it would be unfair to eliminate the tax cuts for the middle class. But Mr. Gephardt has argued in recent days that his health plan is a better way "to put more money on the kitchen table of middle-class families," stimulating the economy, lowering employees' premiums and providing, for the first time, true health care security.
Mr. Gephardt, in many ways, set the pace for the Democrats last April when he released a broad proposal that requires all employers to offer health coverage to their workers, and provides them with major new tax credits to do so. The public programs -- Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or Schip, and Medicare -- would be expanded to insure those not covered through work, and the Gephardt campaign estimates the plan would ultimately come close to universal coverage.
Mr. Gephardt calls his proposal "Matt's Plan," in honor of his son, who struggled with cancer as a child and is now well. Mr. Gephardt says Matt was saved by aggressive, experimental treatments that would not have been available if his family did not have good health insurance.
Dr. Dean, whose physician persona is at the heart of his campaign, says his plan is the most politically realistic, because it essentially expands the existing system. "My plan was designed with Harry and Louise in mind," he says, alluding to the insurance industry commercials against Mr. Clinton's plan. The advertisements featured a couple in their 40's expressing their fears over shadowy bureaucrats taking control of the health care system.
Dr. Dean says his first priority would be to get people covered, not to reform and restructure the system, which the Clintons proposed. "We can have a big fight later," he says. In the meantime, he would expand Medicaid and Schip, intending to to cover every child and young adult in a low-to-moderate-income household and use tax credits to help others buy insurance.
Mr. Edwards also puts a heavy emphasis on children; he would require that everyone younger than 21 have insurance and give parents new assistance to provide it. So do Gen. Wesley K. Clark and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who advocates a "Medikids" program that would offer families a variety of private plans, with premiums based on income.
Most of the candidates talk about the health care issue as not only covering the uninsured, but also as lowering costs for those who have insurance. Mr. Kerry, for example, proposes a federal program to reimburse employee health plans for their most expensive, catastrophic cases, which would, in turn hold down premiums, he says.
"The problem with health care in America is not just bringing in 43 million Americans who don't have insurance at all," Mr. Kerry has said. "The problem with health care in America is reducing costs for the 163 million Americans who get their health insurance in the workplace, and for the others who get it privately. And what's happening in America is every year the premiums are going up, the co-pays are going up, the deductibles are going up, the benefits are going down, and Americans are just fed up with a system that seems out of control."
Carol Moseley Braun, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio all advocate some form of national government-run health insurance.
Health care experts say it is not surprising that the issue has re-emerged this year. Health spending rose 9.3 percent in 2002, the government reported last week, the largest increase in 11 years. Premium costs and out-of-pocket spending by consumers are climbing as well, reflecting greater pressures on those with no insurance or insufficient insurance. Moreover, the fiscal crisis in many states has forced cutbacks in their health programs.
Even so, experts say, the Democrats' proposals will be shadowed by the deficit. Some health advocates have long said they see a potential deal in Congress, between the Democrats who would like to see the public programs cover more people, and the Republicans who advocate a tax credit approach. But, they add, that would be hard with the current budget constraints.

A14) Chart: "Health Insurance: Where the Candidates Stand"Wesley K. ClarkGENERAL APPROACH: Would create a single-payer national health insurance program, folding the multiple layers of public and private health insurance into one system. The plan would decouple health insurance from employment and cover all necessary and reasonable medical costs.COVERAGE: Would cover everyone.ESTIMATED COST: Would cost about a trillion dollars annually and be paid for through the income tax system. Carol Moseley BraunGENERAL APPROACH: Would mandate health insurance for every American up to age 22, through a combination of tax credits and expansion of Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or Schip. Would allow all Americans who cannot get health insurance through their jobs to buy coverage through the same system that insures members of Congress. Would provide new assistance to help cover low-income adults and workers between jobs through expansion of the government programs and new tax credits.COVERAGE: Would cover 31.8 million of the 43.6 million uninsured.ESTIMATED COST: Would cost $695 billion over 10 years after savings from "modernizing" the health care delivery and purchasing system. Would be paid for in part by repealing some Bush tax cuts. Howard DeanGENERAL APPROACH: Would aim to reduce the number of uninsured by building on the existing system. Would redefine and expand public programs like Medicaid and Schip, offering coverage to every American under 25 with incomes up to three times the federal poverty level (about $55,000 for a family of four in 2003). Would also create new tax credits to help the uninsured buy coverage and establish a new Universal Health Benefits Program open to most Americans, modeled on the insurance plans available to federal employees and members of Congress.COVERAGE: Would cover 31 million of the uninsured.ESTIMATED COST: When fully put into effect in 2008, would cost $88.3 billion a year. Mr. Dean would roll back the entire Bush tax cuts, part of which would go to paying for his health plan. John EdwardsGENERAL APPROACH: Would emphasize covering children, with a new requirement that every American under 21 have health insurance. Provides new tax credits to help parents and others buy insurance; expands Schip and other public programs. Builds on existing employer-based system, including new assistance to help small businesses cover their workers, and adds aid for workers between jobs.COVERAGE: Would cover 21 million of the uninsured.ESTIMATED COST: Would cost about $53 billion a year. To help pay for it, he would roll back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Richard A. GephardtGENERAL APPROACH: Would aim to guarantee coverage to every American, and stimulate the economy, by providing substantial new subsidies for the cost of insurance. All employers would essentially be required to offer their workers health insurance, but they would get a big new tax credit to do so; state and local governments would get comparable subsidies for the cost of health insurance coverage for their employees. Medicare, Medicaid and Schip would be expanded to insure those not covered by employers.COVERAGE: Would aim at universal coverage, his campaign says.ESTIMATED COST: Would cost an estimated $214 billion a year in 2005 if fully put into effect and would increase in later years. Would roll back the entire Bush tax cuts to pay for it. John KerryGENERAL APPROACH: Would emphasize reducing the cost of insurance for all Americans by reimbursing employee health plans for the most expensive, catastrophic cases. Employers would be reimbursed, reducing their costs of insurance, so long as they agreed to use savings to reduce the cost of workers' premiums. Aims to expand coverage of children and low-income adults by offering states new financial assistance. Offers all Americans access to a version of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan.COVERAGE: Would cover nearly 27 million uninsured.ESTIMATED COST: Would cost $72 billion annually for the first five years, covered by rolling back Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Dennis J. KucinichGENERAL APPROACH: Would create a new national health insurance program, "enhanced Medicare for all," which would replace the current, employer-based system of private health insurance. Would be financed by a payroll tax on employers of 7.7 percent.COVERAGE: Would cover everyone.ESTIMATED COST: Would gradually move all health care spending, which totaled $1.55 trillion in 2002, to the federal government. Joseph I. LiebermanGENERAL APPROACH: Would phase in a new Medikids program offering a menu of private plans to all children and young adults, modeled on the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, with premiums based on income. Also sets up a similar Medichoice plan for adults. Uses refundable tax credits to help individuals buy insurance.COVERAGE: Would cover 31 million uninsured.ESTIMATEDCOST: Would cost $55 billion a year for the first five years, paid for in part by repealing Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest. Al SharptonGENERAL APPROACH: Would support the adoption of a national single-payer health care plan that is publicly financed by the federal government. Would be financed by redirecting current health care spending by the government and a surtax on the wealthiest Americans.COVERAGE: Would cover everyone.ESTIMATED COST: Not available.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Offers an Optimistic View 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said yesterday that the United States was able to finance its near-record current account deficit with few consequences to the global financial system and that the dollar's decline had not caused inflation.
 The United States ran a deficit of $135 billion in its current account in the third quarter of last year, the third largest on record. The gap, the broadest measure of international trade because it includes investments, equaled 4.9 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, compared with a record 5.2 percent in the first quarter of the year. 
 "There is, for the moment, little evidence of stress in funding U.S. current account deficits," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech in Berlin. So far, he said, the widening to record levels of the ratio of current account deficit to gross domestic product had been, "with the exception of the dollar's exchange rate, seemingly uneventful."
The United States economy and markets have not been hurt, Mr. Greenspan said, by a 25 percent decline in the dollar against major currencies since early 2002.
But the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said on Monday that the bank was concerned about "brutal" currency swings. Ernst Welteke, a central bank member, said yesterday that the euro's appreciation could "put a brake" on a recovery in Germany.
Euro-area exporters "have been under considerable pressure," Mr. Greenspan said in his speech at a Bundesbank event in Berlin. Yet, stock prices have risen and the cost of borrowing has fallen worldwide, helping European economies as well.
And in a response to a question, Mr. Greenspan said he was "quite optimistic" there would not be a dollar crisis because individual economies were more flexible than in the past.
In New York, the euro fell to $1.2750, from $1.2755 late yesterday.

HEADLINE: European Call To Reactivate Trade Talks 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Europe's top trade minister added his voice to the call for reinvigorating global trade talks one day after the United States began its campaign to breathe new life into the stalled negotiations.
 Pascal Lamy, the European trade commissioner, said in a speech before the European Parliament on Tuesday that Europe would make several concessions to increase the prospects of new trade talks, adding that he welcomed the new initiative by Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative. 
 Mr. Lamy said Europe was willing to end its export subsidies on a list of agricultural products that would be negotiated with developing nations, a pledge that falls short of a demand by developing nations that all such subsidies be eliminated. 
He also said Europe was prepared to remove as many as four of the issues that were strongly opposed by developing nations. Europe's insistence on including those issues helped cause the collapse of the World Trade Organization's talks in Cancun, Mexico, in September.
"We are now in far better shape than at the end of the Cancun conference," Mr. Lamy said.
To promote a resumption of talks, Mr. Lamy said he had already traveled to Brazil and would leave this week for Bangladesh, India and Indonesia.
The European trade commissioner made no direct reference to the demand by Mr. Zoellick that all agricultural export subsidies be eliminated, a proposal that falls heavily on Europe and signals that the United States is dropping its earlier cooperation with Europe.
Instead, Mr. Lamy left the door open to the United States, saying "for our part, we will obviously be continuing our quest for alliances with the United States, Japan and other key members of the W.T.O."
Many trade officials had feared that the current global trade talks, known as the Doha round, aimed at helping developing nations, might continue to languish with the United States' attention focused on the 2004 election campaign. The talks, with a 2005 deadline, could have serious repercussions for the global economy.
Several trade economists praised both initiatives.
C. Fred Bergsten, director for the Institute for International Economics in Washington and an expert who has been worried about the course of United States trade policy, said on Tuesday that he strongly supported the move by Mr. Zoellick.
"It does clear the air about U.S. intentions and with Mr. Lamy's statement today, it may mean they will be able to complete the round," he said.
In a letter sent to more than 140 trade ministers this week, Mr. Zoellick listed several ideas for moving talks forward but said he was not trying "to launch breakthrough proposals."
Mr. Lamy said that the W.T.O. should be able to reach initial agreements on the overall questions, including agriculture, no later than April. 
"I am convinced of the possibility of real progress if the W.T.O.'s members want it," Mr. Lamy said.

HEADLINE: Study Disputes View Of Costly Surge In Class-Action Suits 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
A new study has concluded that both the average price of settling class-action lawsuits and the average fee paid to lawyers who bring them have held steady for a decade, even though companies have said the suits are driving up the cost of doing business, hurting the economy and lining lawyers' pockets.
 The issue is a fiercely divisive one that has fueled a heated debate over whether to place limits on class-action lawsuits. Legislation to curb class actions is a priority of President Bush and many Republicans in Congress. 
 The two law school professors who conducted the study, which was not financed by corporations or by trial lawyers, expressed surprise themselves over the results. "We started out writing an article about fees," said Theodore Eisenberg, a law professor at Cornell and one author of the study, "but the shocking thing was that recoveries weren't up." 
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican and the chief sponsor of a bill that died in October in the Senate, has attacked the current system of class-action litigation as "jackpot justice, with attorneys collecting the windfall." Thomas J. Donohue, president and chief executive of the United States Chamber of Commerce, has complained that "companies spend millions of dollars each year to defend against class-action lawsuits -- money that should be used to expand, develop new products and create jobs."
But the new study undermines some of those criticisms. It covers the biggest sample to date of class-action cases, ranging from civil rights violations to securities fraud. Its results, published in a new law publication, the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, and already circulating, will certainly be used by lawyers trying to head off such legislation. 
"This empirical study comes out and says the system is working correctly," said David S. Casey Jr., president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, who was in Washington last week meeting with officials planning the body's legislative strategy for 2004. "I'm glad there are empirical studies being done," Mr. Casey said. "The whole effort by what I call the tort reform industry is based on myth and fabrication."
Those who advocate limiting class-action filings -- and changing the nation's tort laws more generally -- are dismissing the study's results. "I'm not sure that these findings end up meaning a lot," said Stan Anderson, executive vice president and chief legal officer of the United States Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Class Action Coalition, a group of 100 companies supporting legislation to change rules governing class-action lawsuits. "You can't argue against class actions per se or its efficacy. What we argue is very simple, that there are problem jurisdictions around the country."
Reliable data on the total number of class-action lawsuits filed or settled in a given year do not exist. Such data could bolster corporate defendants' arguments that even if the size of settlements is not increasing, the number of cases is rising. The number of suits filed in federal court has risen steadily, roughly doubling from 1997 to 2002, according to the Administrative Office of United States Courts. But state courts probably oversee the most class-action suits, and they produce the least data, said Nicholas M. Pace, a researcher at the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, which studies legal issues for the RAND Corporation.
"People will continue to research this thing for years -- and fight about it," Mr. Pace said.
In their article, Mr. Eisenberg and his co-author, Geoffrey P. Miller, a New York University law professor, write that if the effects of inflation are taken into account, then from 1993 through 2002, "contrary to popular belief, we find no robust evidence that either recoveries for plaintiffs or fees for their attorneys as a percentage of the class recovery increased." 
According to the study, the average settlement over the 10-year period was $100 million in inflation-adjusted 2002 dollars. It rose as high as $274 million in 2000 -- a result of four settlements that year for more than $1 billion each -- and fell as low as $25 million in 1996. "The mean client recovery has not noticeably increased over the last decade," the professors wrote.
The study also found that "neither the mean nor the median level of fee awards has increased over time." The average fee rose as high as $31 million in 2000, but exceeded $10 million in only two other years. The professors also report that as one might expect, the larger a settlement, the smaller the percentage allocated to legal fees. For the largest 10 percent of settlements, which averaged $929 million, lawyers received an average of 12 percent. For the smallest 10 percent, which averaged $800,000, lawyers received nearly 30 percent. Fees were higher in cases that were more risky and were higher in federal court cases than in state courts.
"No real-dollar increase in the level of fee awards in major cases over the course of a decade is not the sort of fact we are accustomed to hearing," the professors wrote in the report. 
Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Miller spent several months reading about 400 state and federal court opinions describing class-action lawsuits. Mr. Eisenberg has used statistical analysis to examine where companies choose to file for bankruptcy protection and on trends in punitive damage awards; Mr. Miller has studied class-action litigation and legal fees. Each has served as a consultant to defense and plaintiffs' lawyers.
Their initial goal, both men said, was to find out how courts historically apportioned fees to help guide judges. The study is the most comprehensive to date and draws on original research that others have not attempted, according to people who have studied class-action litigation.
"The Eisenberg and Miller study is in many senses a real advance" because its authors read actual court cases to learn the provisions in settlement agreements, said Deborah R. Hensler, a law professor at Stanford who has also studied class actions. 
"I'm not surprised by the findings in the Eisenberg and Miller study in most regards because they seem quite consistent with many of the patterns we found in our much smaller pattern of case studies," Ms. Hensler said.
Todd Foster, a senior consultant at NERA Economic Consulting, said that his firm also had not found an upward trend in settlement amounts.
There can be no doubt that some lawsuits are frivolous and that they do impose substantial costs on businesses, as other studies have found. A report released a few weeks ago by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, a consulting firm that primarily serves insurance companies, concluded that tort litigation costs rose 13.3 percent in 2002, to $233 billion, "which translates to $809 per person." 
Those results, which draw on data supplied by the insurance industry, proprietary data on medical malpractice claims and estimates of costs borne by self-insured companies, did not measure the same thing as the two law professors' study. The Tillinghast study covered all payments made or expected to be made, whether as a result of a jury verdict or a settlement, in a class action or individual lawsuit, said Russ Sutter, a principal at Tillinghast and the primary author. He added that the study did not have a political agenda. "It's our job just to keep score," he said. 
A Bloomberg News study last week found that jury verdicts in the United States (as opposed to settlements) last year resulted in damage awards of $13.8 billion against companies in just a subset of cases -- those involving suspected fraud -- up from less than $1.5 billion in 2002. 
Supporters of changes to the nation's tort laws, which govern civil litigation in personal injury cases, have numerous criticisms of the Eisenberg-Miller study. 
Some jurisdictions are known for presiding over excessive settlements and jury verdicts, said Mr. Anderson of the Chamber of Commerce.
"Many states, we don't have problems with what happens," he said. Averaging outcomes in states where lawsuits result in large settlements with those in other states, he continued, may not show anything.
The article also relied on court opinions describing settlements, Mr. Anderson said, and those tend to be federal cases. 
State court cases may be a major source of outsize settlements, he said. "It's a critical piece of information that wasn't there," he added.
Mr. Eisenberg responded that in the absence of published court opinions it is very difficult to learn about state court settlements. 
Ms. Hensler, the Stanford law professor, said that one flaw in the study was that the amount of the settlement could be less than the amount actually received by plaintiffs, driving up the percentage paid to lawyers. The types of cases may also have changed over the last decade, she said. For example, smaller settlements might be reported more or less often. Mr. Eisenberg said that a larger study would be helpful, along with access to more detailed information on settlements. But critical facts are often sealed by the courts, he said. For now, he added, "there's no better data."

So did the fees lawyers collected from settlements. There were two spikes in the average settlements during the period. They were a result of a $5 billion settlement in 1994 and four settlements of more than $1 billion each in 2000. Graphs track cost of class-action lawsuits and lawyers fees for lawsuits since 1993.

A Neighborhood Mainstay, Against the Odds

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
COL LEGNO turns 14 this year, which in restaurant years is getting up there. Though a handful of places can measure their age in decades, most restaurants, especially of the neighborhood variety, do not last until 10. What makes Col Legno remarkable is that it survives in an area of continual upheaval.
 In 1990, when Col Legno opened, the East Village was notorious for its bars, clubs, after-hours dens and general outrageousness, but was not particularly known for its selection of restaurants. Nowadays, by my unscientific count, the East Village has more Italian restaurants than unemployed guitarists, surely a sign that the balance has changed. And yet Col Legno soldiers on, offering essentially the same Tuscan trattoria menu as it did when it was new, at prices that are not much different. 
 In many ways, Col Legno is a time capsule, circa 1990. That's not so long ago, perhaps, but remember, these are restaurant years. Back then, New York's fascination with Tuscany was still near its peak. Food critics were marveling over the rising appeal of trattorias in previously Francophile New York. Words like "rosemary" and "wood-burning oven" exerted a romantic pull, and every inexpensive Italian restaurant seemed to have the same rusty red floor tiles and mottled yellow walls. Even tiramisu was considered new and unusual. 
Col Legno's interior was appealingly simple, almost stark. Even today, though a series of watercolors has been added, the visual focus is the wood-burning oven in the rear, which also perfumes the air with the warm, appetizing scent of smoke. The individual pizzas ($8.95 to $10.95) are mostly excellent. The crust is smooth and elastic, burnished brown around the circumference. Toppings like sweet sausage and mushrooms are fine, and the tomato sauce is nicely spicy. 
The exception is the plain pizza margherita, a dreary package made with slices of fresh tomato, predictably tasteless and rubbery in January. Without the spicy tomato sauce, the lack of salt in the crust stands out as well.
Instead of one of the modest antipasti to start, I suggest some of the side dishes, like a platter of classic Tuscan white beans ($6.95), richly flavored with sage, garlic and olive oil, or fried baby artichokes ($7.95), as crisp as autumn leaves. 
Ten years ago, the best dish I had at Col Legno was pappardelle in a robust sauce made with ground wild boar. Today, it is still the best dish, the fat noodles just right in the savory, spicy ragu, the nutlike flavors of the meat a sturdy match for the rosemary seasoning ($13.95). I also remember the tagliatelle in a peppery mushroom sauce ($12.95), and it too holds up well. One pasta I don't remember is the lively spaghetti alla fiaccheraia ($12.95), a spicy tomato sauce with little chunks of pancetta and roasted peppers embedded within. If you are a rosemary fanatic, you will love tagliatelle al porri ($12.95), made with tomatoes, leeks and lots and lots of rosemary. For me, though, it's a cautionary reminder that rosemary is far preferable as a supporting player rather than the dominant flavor.
Col Legno's meat courses are simply prepared and satisfying. The best is a meaty, slightly gamy grilled quail ($16.95), subtly flavored with sage and a judicious touch of truffle oil, served with firm grilled polenta. Pork chops flavored with fennel ($14.95) and a decent grilled steak ($16.95) round out the top choices. I would skip dessert, however. The gelati selection ($5.50) can include four different flavors, which all taste the same, while tiramisu ($5.50) has long since lost its sense of freshness.
It would be wrong to think that Col Legno's survival hasn't been a struggle. The owner, Chris Trilivas, resists changing the menu, despite the seemingly endless procession of trattorias, osterias and wine bars showing different sides of Italy all over the neighborhood. Instead, Mr. Trilivas, who used to cook but now waits tables most nights, has streamlined his operation as much as possible, doing as much as he can himself.
Strangely, as so much of the rest of the East Village embraces Italy, Col Legno's block, once a hodgepodge of different sorts of restaurants and businesses, is now largely Japanese, full of noodle shops, sake lounges, sushi bars and herb-and-shiatsu parlors. In a way, Col Legno has come full circle. In 1990, the restaurant was a novelty in its neighborhood. Now it's a novelty on its own block.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
Giddy Times for Champagne Makers

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS and others who should know are saying that the economy's upturn in recent months has bypassed the working class and particularly benefited the country's elite.
 Recent sales figures for high-end Champagne and sparkling wines, the traditional celebratory beverages of the economically favored, tend to bear that out. As of October, French Champagne sales for the first nine months of last year were up 15 percent over the same period in 2002, industry analysts say. Top California sparkling wines, made by the traditional Champagne method, were doing even better. Roederer Estate was up 26 percent over 2002, Schramsberg 35 percent and Iron Horse 25 percent, according to The Wine Market Report, a trade publication. 
 Joy Sterling, a principal at Iron Horse Vineyards, in Sebastopol, said the "frenzied demand" from distributors recalled the extraordinary sales of sparkling wine in fall 1999, leading up to the millennium celebrations. After a drop in 2001 and 2002, Iron Horse's sales are moving back to levels near those of 2000, Ms. Sterling said, noting that they were 25 percent higher last November than in November 2002.
Rich Cartiere, publisher of The Wine Market Report, predicted that once the 2003 figures are complete, they could show that California's top producers of premium sparkling wines sold 100,000 to 150,000 more cases of sparkling wine than in 2002. "If you exclude 1999 and the millennium excesses, 2003 was the best year ever for the super-premium sparkling-wine makers," he said.
In that group, he included Schramsberg, Domaine Mumm, Domaine Carneros, Domaine Chandon, Pacific Echo, Gloria Ferrer, Iron Horse, Roederer Estate and Piper Sonoma. (All use the traditional methode champenoise, in which secondary fermentation takes place in each bottle.) He did not include Korbel, the largest domestic user of the method, because, he said, it is not in the same super-premium price range of $15 to $20 and more.
Overall numbers are more modest. Gomberg-Fredrikson, a California consulting firm that tracks wine prices, said that final figures for sparkling-wine sales in the United States should show an increase of about 5 percent, or 12 million nine-liter cases, in 2003 over 2002. Total California sparkling-wine growth should be up about 2 percent, and imports, which probably slowed some in November and December as a result of unfavorable exchange rates, should be up about 10 percent, said Jon Fredrikson, the firm's principal.
Through September, French Champagne sales in this country totaled about 1.5 million cases, up from 1.3 million for the same period in 2002, Gomberg-Fredrikson figures show. The biggest proportional increases were for German sparkling wines, which were up 50 percent through September, admittedly from a very small base: 34,800 cases, as against 23,200 a year earlier.
It's more than likely that prices of French Champagne will increase appreciably in the next year. A survey of importers and distributors by The Wine Market Report over the last month predicted price rises of 10 to 30 percent for all imported wines if the dollar continues to fall. A euro was worth $1.28 on Monday, and importers said it could reach $1.35 or $1.50 in coming months. The dollar's fall may give domestic winemakers a chance to recover market share lost over the past 18 to 24 months to imports, particularly from Australia and Italy. Imports accounted for 27 percent of the total United States wine market last year and almost 50 percent of all supermarket sales of wines costing $5 to $12.
Some French Champagnes have been selling for less than $20 a bottle in recent months, seriously challenging the domestic sparklers. Whether American sparkling wines can retake some of that market remains to be seen. Champagne is still seen as a luxury product and less subject to market changes. The best American sparkling wines are made by the methode champenoise, the only process permitted in Champagne. Most inexpensive sparkling wine is made by the Charmat or bulk process, in which the wine is fermented in large steel tanks before bottling.
Charmat process sparkling wines can be produced in a few months. Methode champenoise wines come along at a more leisurely pace. Most spend several years maturing in the bottle before release. Maison Krug, in Reims, is just getting around to releasing its 1990 brut. The price? Oh, around $200 a bottle.

HEADLINE: Apple Cart Upset: Who Runs Greenmarket? 

BYLINE:  By AMANDA HESSER

 BODY:
LAST year, after a period of turmoil during which two longtime managers of New York's Greenmarket program were fired, the Council on the Environment of New York City, which oversees the markets, set out to find a new director. Search committee members say they were looking for a director who not only understood farmers' markets but who could also overcome longstanding divisions and make Greenmarket a forward-thinking model of sustainable agriculture.
 Their search led them to Nina Planck. Ms. Planck, 32, had grown up on a farm in Virginia that depended entirely on farmers' markets. She had created a system of 13 for-profit farmers' markets in London, and later opened a market in Washington. She was articulate about farmland preservation and had a clear agenda for Greenmarket. 
 Ms. Planck started her job as director of Greenmarket last July. She was fired on Dec. 23. 
To some, her dismissal came as no surprise. "There was a sense of distress in the community, and I think Nina created it," said Eugene Wyatt, the owner of Catskill Merino, a sheep farm, and a Greenmarket farmer. "It was a relief to have her gone."
To others it was yet more evidence of troubles that have long stalled Greenmarket's potential. "They didn't know who they hired: someone who was really ready to make changes," said Mary Cleaver, the owner of the Cleaver Company, a caterer that buys from Greenmarket farmers.
For most New Yorkers, Greenmarket, the largest farm-market system in the country, is a beloved institution, a gift of rural life and its bounty to the city. According to Tom Strumolo, the former assistant director who has replaced Ms. Planck, Greenmarket has helped preserve 25,000 acres of farmland in the region. 
But for some who have seen more innovative markets, particularly in San Francisco and in Europe, it seems shabby and lacking in variety and quality. Search committee members say they hired Ms. Planck to bring Greenmarket up to speed, as she had done with the markets in London and Washington.
Interviews with more than 20 farmers, search committee members and restaurateurs, some of whom asked not to be named, indicate that Ms. Planck quickly met resistance at every turn. She was, it seems, stonewalled as she encouraged farmers to keep their stalls tidier, and as she tried to rewrite the rules, add to the diversity of products at each market, improve the integrity of farm inspections, have better signs and increase the number of farmers at the smaller markets. Ms. Planck was even criticized for painting the crumbling Greenmarket offices.
But even many of those who supported her said that the problem was not so much her ideas as her style. It was, insiders say, too much, too fast. Ms. Planck has been described as aggressive, slick, imperious, aloof and a poor listener (although she was said to be well liked by her staff). She was certainly not intimidated as she took on an entrenched structure in which a group of farmers hold as much power as the council that runs the market. Ultimately, supporters and opponents say, she antagonized those farmers and lost the council's support.
Ms. Planck would not comment in detail. She said, in a written statement: "Having sold at many farmers' markets -- a few managed well, most badly -- and created a network of farmers' markets in London, I have many thoughts about what works. Tom and I often talked about the best way to go about it. But that is for Tom to decide, and it's not appropriate for me to comment."
Greenmarket was founded by Barry Benepe and Bob Lewis in 1976 at 59th Street and Second Avenue. Today, there are 32 market sites and 185 farmers -- 185 independent businesses attempting to coexist in a market environment.
The most desirable market in the system is the one in Union Square, the largest and busiest in the city, with as many as 70 producers on a Saturday.
Greenmarket, a nonprofit organization, has its own management but is a program of the Council on the Environment, which falls under the aegis of the office of the mayor. While the council's executive director, Lys McLaughlin, and the Greenmarket's director ostensibly have the power to make changes, in general, no change is put into place without the approval of the Farmer Consumer Advisory Committee.
The committee is advisory and has no official power. Or so some committee members say. But others present a different picture. Fred Wilklow, a farmer member, said: "I really believe that in the past few years the decisions have been made through the F.C.A.C., and they've been followed."
Ms. Planck's dealings with the committee have been the source of most of her troubles.
"Greenmarket has been around for 26 or 27 years, and in my experience it has a diffuse nature of power which flows from the bottom up and from the top down," Mr. Wyatt said. 
One of the first things Ms. Planck did when she arrived was to rewrite the rules and regulations, adding everything from a table of contents, which the rule book never had, to new and controversial rules like requiring jam makers to use locally grown fruits instead of, for instance, black raspberries from Washington State.
She presented her revision to the committee in August. It was not received with bouquets of flowers. John Gorzynski, an owner of Gorzynski Ornery Farm in Cochecton Center, N.Y., and a member of the search committee, said that while he liked many of her ideas, "things take time, and she wasn't working that way."
A search committee member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "Look, when she had her mind set on something, no one was going to change it. And that was a problem, especially when something was arrived at prematurely."
At a meeting in October,according to a number of participants, Ms. Planck cried as she disputed anonymous accusations that she did not support small farmers.
"She said, 'The thing that upsets me most is that people are saying I'm for corporate agriculture and not for local foods,' " Mr. Wyatt said. "Boohoo. Boohoo."
But Peter Hoffman, the owner of Savoy Restaurant and a former member of the committee, said: "I, too, would stand up at a meeting and cry if I couldn't get people to understand that I was looking out for farmers in the long term."
"So why didn't Lys back her up?" Mr. Hoffman continued. "If the waiters are having a hard time with a policy that one of my floor managers thinks is really important, I better back him up. Otherwise, if in any way I undermine him, I have nothing. I have no manager. I have just a man standing at the door."
Ms. McLaughlin said, "Well, I did lean over and embrace her in front of everybody." "I worked very closely with Nina," she added, "and I have great admiration for her. She has tremendous ideas and tremendous enthusiasm. I'm really sorry it didn't work out." 
Ms. McLaughlin said that she feels it's important for Greenmarket to be run democratically. "It's an emergent system," she said. "It's a dynamic creature. And it moves and it changes."
The Greenmarket director does not seem to have much leverage. For instance, Ms. Planck proposed to several meat producers that they be grouped together so that the shopping experience would be more like that at a grocery store. But Mr. Wyatt said that he told her that putting the lamb farmers together would drive down prices, his prices in particular. Similar responses from others discouraged her from pursuing it further. 
The conflicts have a long history. In 1993 Ms. McLaughlin said in a memorandum to Mr. Benepe and Tony Mannetta, then the director, that a "vocal minority" of farmers would object to fines for refusing unannounced inspections of their farms. Ms. McLaughlin wrote, "It would be a shame to invite lawsuits, bring further unrest to Greenmarket by going with the rules and regs as they are here."
A majority of farmers on the committee have spaces at Union Square (Mr. Strumolo said that he is hoping to broaden the representation). One recurring issue on which the Greenmarket management seems to have taken a firm stand is "continuity," the idea that farmers should be allowed to sell their spaces at Union Square when they sell their farms. The issue has never advanced beyond a discussion. 
"On a certain level," Mr. Hoffman said, "it's sad and understandable that their economics are so tight that they make small-minded decisions that are about turf, and fight over tiny market share. And that's where I felt that Nina had a larger vision. And the market needs a larger vision."
Farmers' markets in other parts of the country appear to be increasingly innovative. At Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in San Francisco, some producers have permanent indoor spaces with running water and electricity. Large, attractive signs describe the farms and their methods of production. Shoppers can check their bags at a stall and then keep shopping.
"The Ferry Building is very well organized," Dan Barber, an owner of Blue Hill restaurant in Greenwich Village, said. "And the city does a lot to support that, not just organizationally, but spiritually. You go there and you feel like you're in 2004."
In the late 1970's, John McPhee wrote in The New Yorker of his experience as a salesman at the Greenmarket during its second year. The article suggests that discontent at the market is nothing new. The farmers grumbled about the rules as much as they grumbled about one another. Of Bob Lewis, who was running the market with Mr. Benepe, Mr. McPhee wrote, "If he is ready to rebuke the farmers (for selling West Coast peaches) he is also ready to listen, without limit, to their numerous problems and even more numerous complaints."
Complaints may have helped push out Ms. Planck, but she remains a Greenmarket supporter. "I was happy to make a contribution to Greenmarket," Ms. Planck said in her statement. "I'll keep working for small, ecological farms and telling people why local foods are better. If you love to look at farmland, you've got to eat the view -- or lose it."

HEADLINE: Inviting All Democrats 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia 

 BODY:
I'd like to invite Richard Gephardt and the other Democratic candidates to come here to Cambodia and discuss trade policy with scavengers like Nhep Chanda, who spends her days rooting through filth in the city dump. 
 One of the most unfortunate trends in the Democratic presidential race has been the way nearly all of the candidates, including Howard Dean, the front-runner, have been flirting with anti-trade positions by putting the emphasis on labor, environmental and human rights standards in international agreements. 
 While Mr. Gephardt calls for an international minimum wage, Mr. Dean was quoted in USA Today in October as saying, "I believe that trade also requires human rights and labor standards and environmental standards that are concurrent around the world." 
Perhaps the candidates are simply pandering to unions, or bashing President Bush. But my guess is that they sincerely believe that such trade policies would help poor people abroad -- and that's why they should all traipse through a Cambodian garbage dump to see how economically naive these schemes would be.
Nhep Chanda is a 17-year-old girl who is one of hundreds of Cambodians who toil all day, every day, picking through the dump for plastic bags, metal cans and bits of food. The stench clogs the nostrils, and parts of the dump are burning, producing acrid smoke that blinds the eyes. 
The scavengers are chased by swarms of flies and biting insects, their hands are caked with filth, and those who are barefoot cut their feet on glass. Some are small children. 
Nhep Chanda averages 75 cents a day for her efforts. For her, the idea of being exploited in a garment factory -- working only six days a week, inside instead of in the broiling sun, for up to $2 a day -- is a dream. 
"I'd like to work in a factory, but I don't have any ID card, and you need one to show that you're old enough," she said wistfully. (Since the candidates are unlikely to find the time to travel to the third world anytime soon, I put an audio slide show of the Cambodian realities on the Web for them at www.nytimes.com/kristof.)
All the complaints about third world sweatshops are true and then some: factories sometimes dump effluent into rivers or otherwise ravage the environment. But they have raised the standard of living in Singapore, South Korea and southern China, and they offer a leg up for people in countries like Cambodia. 
"I want to work in a factory, but I'm in poor health and always feel dizzy," said Lay Eng, a 23-year-old woman. And no wonder: she has been picking through the filth, seven days a week, for six years. She has never been to a doctor. 
Here in Cambodia factory jobs are in such demand that workers usually have to bribe a factory insider with a month's salary just to get hired. 
Along the Bassac River, construction workers told me they wanted factory jobs because the work would be so much safer than clambering up scaffolding without safety harnesses. Some also said sweatshop jobs would be preferable because they would mean a lot less sweat. (Westerners call them "sweatshops," but they offer one of the few third world jobsthat doesn't involve constant sweat.)
In Asia, moreover, the factories tend to hire mostly girls and young women with few other job opportunities. The result has been to begin to give girls and women some status and power, some hint of social equality, some alternative to the sex industry. 
Cambodia has a fair trade system and promotes itself as an enlightened garment producer. That's great. But if the U.S. tries to ban products from countries that don't meet international standards, jobs will be shifted from the most wretched areas to better-off nations like Malaysia or Mexico. Already there are very few factories in Africa or the poor countries of Asia, and if we raise the bar higher, there will be even fewer. 
The Democratic Party has been pro-trade since Franklin Roosevelt, and President Bill Clinton in particular tugged the party to embrace the realities of trade. Now the party may be retreating toward protectionism under the guise of labor standards. 
That would hurt American consumers. But it would be particularly devastating for laborers in the poorest parts of the world. For the fundamental problem in the poor countries of Africa and Asia is not that sweatshops exploit too many workers; it's that they don't exploit enough.

At 99 Cents, Mystery Sells Cheap

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
ANOTHER customer, perusing the odd items of yet another 99-cent store in this city, selects a synthetic black belt from a rack and wonders aloud whether it is long enough to complete the loop around his formidable girth.
 Yes! And with room to spare. 
 "How much is this belt?" he asks, his smile suggesting that he already knows.
"Ninety-nine," answers the proprietor, Rocko. 
Yes! The pleased belt sampler calls two aisles over to his wife, who is admiring some 99-cent socks. "Baby," he says with triumph. "I got my belt."
His reaction, in turn, pleases Rocko, who believes in the economic promise of his business, the American 99 store, in the Allerton section of the Bronx. Leave it to others to scoff at the exotic provenance and eclectic selection of his merchandise. He is meeting a community need, he says, and he is doing it straight up.
"This store here is one of the true 99-cent stores," he explains. "When you come here, you know that everything is 99 cents or less. It is what it is. A lot of the others, they sell 99-cent items, but they also sell merchandise that's more than 99 cents. Their signs say 'and up.' " Rocko spells that last word aloud -- "U.P." -- to punctuate his penny's worth of a point.
The stodgy five-and-dime store of the past has been replaced by the wacky 99-cent store of thepresent. The essential attraction of discounted stuff is the same, but today's 99-cent stores seduce customers with the added allure of cheap mystery. Where does this stuff come from? What new item that I never knew I needed will appear on the shelves this week? And how do the owners squeeze out enough pennies to make a profit?
Rocko, a stocky man tucked into a University of Kentucky sweatshirt, takes a break from unpacking boxes to provide a 99-cent primer. His real name is Kasho Ramdin, he is 33, he moved here from Guyana in 1990 and he has a wife and two young sons whom he rarely sees. That is because he works seven days a week amid boxes of odd-brand cereals ("Forelli's Frosty Corn Flakes"?), rows of scented candles ("Opium"?) and, and
"Glue traps for mice?" a woman asks.
"In the back, along the wall," he answers.
He says that he used to work in electronics sales, until his older brother explained the potential in discount stores. Now their family operates three stores in the Bronx, including this one on Burke Avenue, a few steps away from an elevated subway line. 
Rocko emphasizes that he is not one of those 99-cent magnates who saves pennies by exploiting workers. He is a hands-on boss, he says, one who works every day but New Year's Eve; who believes that "if you put in now, you get back later."
Most of the merchandise comes from distributors who sell the excess of stock intended for other countries; those boxes of Close-Up toothpaste, say, which "verskaf berkerming teen tandbederf" (provides protection against tooth cavities). Some items, like those six-inch ceramic ducks in sailor outfits, come from cheap-labor operations in China. And some things come from wholesale auctions; those cans of Carpet Wizard, for example.
On average, he pays about 65 cents for what he sells for 99 cents. Some products, like laundry detergent, cost him more, but those essential items draw customers to the store. Once they're inside, he reasons, who knows what might catch their eye? Perhaps those 99-cent men's blazers that somehow made their way to the Bronx from England.
"Hi, Sweetie Pie," says a woman, a regular customer. "You got more bath mats?"
ROCKO says that he works hard to create an inviting environment for his multiethnic clientele, going so far as to rotate the style of music that emanates from the store's sound system. "In the mornings we play religious music for one hour," he says. "Then Spanish. Then reggae. And in the evening, calypso."
"I can't play my own stuff," he adds. "Heavy metal and hard rock."
This attention to customer service paid off during last summer's protracted blackout, he says, which prompted many stores along Burke Avenue to yank down their steel gates. His store remained open, selling flashlights and an inordinate amount of scented candles. "I had nothing stolen," he says. "Matter of fact, my customers were helping me out."
A woman asks about brooms. A man cannot find the flashlights. Some delivery people are unloading socks and undergarments. Rocko has to get back to work.
"A lot of my customers say, 'Why don't you go up in price?' " he says. "But I maintain, no. I want to be a 99-cent store."

HEADLINE: Tests Suggest Scientists Have Found Big Bang Goo 

BYLINE:  By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 13 

 BODY:
At least three advanced diagnostic tests suggest that an experiment at the Brookhaven National Laboratory has cracked open protons and neutrons like subatomic eggs to create a primordial form of matter that last existed when the universe was roughly one-millionth of a second old, scientists said here on Tuesday. 
 The hot, dense substance, called a quark-gluon plasma, has managed to generate intense disputes in the 15 years or so in which scientists have pursued it. In 2000, a major European laboratory claimed that it had, for the first time, liberated particles called quarks from where they are normally trapped in protons and neutrons, a big step on the way to creating the plasma. 
 Possibly seeking to avoid the outpouring of criticism that followed, Brookhaven scientists at the meeting here recited a series of striking new measurements from their particle accelerator in Upton on Long Island, but refused to say that they had actually produced the plasma. 
Creating such a plasma would fulfill some of scientists' biggest dreams, because it would enable them to study the earliest moments of the Big Bang, the colossal explosion that is believed to have been the birth of the entire universe. 
"I think the most economical explanation of what we're seeing is a quark-gluon plasma," said Dr. William Zajz, a Columbia University physicist who is the spokesman for an experiment, Phenix. "But we're holding ourselves to rigorous, very scientific standards, precisely to distinguish it from previous claims." 
Other scientists here said it was clear that the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider had achieved a milestone.
"The evidence for the quark-gluon plasma is overwhelming," said Miklos Gyulassy, a theorist at Columbia. 
Each of the 197 protons and neutrons that make up a gold nucleus has three quarks and a handful of other particles called gluons that transmit the strong force that holds the quarks together. By the strange rules of subatomic physics, swarms of other quarks and gluons flit into and out of existence in each nucleus.
Physicists would like to study the quarks individually, but the force carried by the gluons is something like a rubber band that never loses its elasticity. So a given quark can never escape the embrace of another quark and roam free. The lone exception -- theoretically, at least -- should occur when a collection of ordinary particles becomes so hot and dense that their innards can spill out and form a kind of quark soup, the quark-gluon plasma.
That is the state that the universe is thought to have been in a few millionths of a second after the start of the Big Bang, before the zoo of ordinary particles like protons and neutrons and pions and kaons had coalesced from the primordial soup. A speck of that soup is what the Brookhaven collider seeks to generate, by smashing together gold nuclei at close to the speed of light.
Previous measurements have shown that the lump of material at the center of that collision is from 10 to 100 times as dense as normal nuclear matter. Its temperature is more than a trillion degrees. 
The new data, from particle detectors known by their acronyms -- Brahms, Star, Phenix and Phobos -- showed that this searing goo had a remarkable number of properties expected from the plasma.
One finding focused on the almond-shape region, possibly filled with plasma, created when two spherical gold nuclei strike each other, but not quite head on. Theory predicts that fast particles trying to escape the region should become hung up in the gooey plasma and sometimes stopped completely.
That general effect, called jet quenching, had been seen before. But observations by Star have shown for the first time that particles escaping down the long dimension of the almond are more likely to be stopped than those escaping along the short dimension, where there is less plasma to travel through.
"This is demonstrating, if you will, that our understanding is correct about the jet quenching," said Timothy Hallman, a Brookhaven physicist on the Star experiment. "But it's not proof positive of the quark-gluon plasma."
Another finding indicates that two kinds of particles -- mesons, containing two quarks each, and baryons, containing three -- speed from the collision point in ways suggesting that they were formed in the hot brew of quarks and gluons.
Still another measurement shows the narrow part of the almond-shaped region, the most tightly compressed part, expanding faster than the rest, in just the way expected of a plasma expanding because of its own pressure.
"The fact that the particles march in lockstep, with the pressure that's expected from the quark-gluon plasma, is sufficient for me," Dr. Gyulassy said. "That's my definition of the quark-gluon plasma."

HEADLINE: McGreevey Sets Limited Goals As New Jersey Faces Strains 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey, facing a third year of fiscal strain, used his annual address to the Legislature on Tuesday to set out modest plans to build on recent economic gains and environmental protections.
 Speaking hours after swearing-in ceremonies for new legislators, Mr. McGreevey greeted a Legislature that is controlled by Democrats for the first time since 1991. But even with his own party enjoying a comfortable majority in Trenton, the governor kept to more limited and attainable goals. 
 He proposed incentives for start-up companies working with the state's research universities, a statewide after-school program to be developed with seed money from the state and measures to consolidate municipal and school services to ease local budgets. He called for New Jersey to be the first state in the country to offer parents a plan that would require large employers to give them 16 hours of paid time off to attend their children's school functions.
He urged assessments for developers and set a goal of cutting diesel emissions by 20 percent, saying, "I invite the Legislature to join me, but I will continue alone if necessary."
But, as Republicans noted sharply, Mr. McGreevey made only glancing references to climbing property taxes, and he did not renew the promise he made last year to seek far-reaching campaign finance legislation. Both were major themes of Mr. McGreevey's election campaign two years ago.
Leonard Lance, who was installed on Tuesday as the Senate minority leader, said the governor's remarks on ethics issues had been "modest at best" and said his office had helped stymie legislation limiting campaign contributions from government contractors. "We need to end the horrible system of pay to play, which is rotten to the core," Senator Lance said.
Much of the governor's 50-minute address reviewed his own first term in office at its halfway point. 
He cited the overhaul of the corporate business tax, auto-insurance reform and stronger protections for drinking water sources and open space. 
"Our economy is strong, as strong as any in the nation," Mr. McGreevey said, noting that New Jersey had gained 40,000 jobs since 2001 while the nation lost 2 million. 
To accelerate that growth, he said, he will reorganize state worker training programs and set up resource centers for small businesses to help them find workers and deal with government agencies.
The governor also proposed "innovation zones" near the state's three research universities, offering tax credits and other incentives for start-up companies. He invited biotech and pharmaceutical companies as well to take advantage of New Jersey's support of stem-cell research.
Mr. McGreevey's education proposals included a nonprofit corporation set up by the state to raise private funds for after-school programs that would serve 20,000 pupils by the end of the next school year. 
He did not say how much money the state would contribute, but his aides said several million dollars would be required. 
The governor did not hint at any increased state aid for municipalities and school districts for the next fiscal year; his proposals for aid levels will not be announced until his budget address on Feb. 24. Rather, in the state with the highest per-pupil costs in the nation, Mr. McGreevey urged the consolidation of purchasing and administrative services in smaller districts.
Last year, in his first state of the state address, Mr. McGreevey struck a single major theme, suburban sprawl, and in language that taunted developers, set out far-reaching plans to combat it. Most of those proposals withered in the Legislature, although the governor said on Tuesday that "we did more in two years to stop sprawl than was done in the entire decade before." 
In his more scattered proposals this year, he was being "realistically ambitious," said Ellen Mellody, a spokeswoman for Mr. McGreevey. 
As if anticipating disappointment with the scope of his proposals, the governor spoke proudly of his fiscal record, contending that he had held overall spending below the rate of inflation. "No one has done that in nearly 15 years," he said. 
The Assembly speaker, Albio Sires, said, " I was happy that he listed his accomplishments. I was happy that he got that out."
Acknowledging the treasury's estimate of a $5 billion deficit next year, Mr. Sires said he would lobby Mr. McGreevey, as he did last year, to consider a tax increase on incomes of more than $1 million. 
As of Tuesday, Mr. Sires has a firmer grip on the Assembly, having gained six seats for Democrats for a 47-to-33 advantage. The Senate, split 20-to-20 for two years, now has 22 Democrats and 18 Republicans.
Mr. Lance said the Senate Republicans would make campaign-finance limits their first priority in the new session. 
The Assembly Republicans' new leader, Alex DeCroce, made the same plea in his remarks in chambers. "Every member of the Republican caucus is ready, today, to put an end to pay to play," Mr. DeCroce said.

HEADLINE: A Jolt of Democracy in Georgia 

 BODY:
The country of Georgia has a fierce political history and remains torn by separatist guerrillas. Bombs explode regularly in the capital, Tbilisi, and large parts of the government, the security forces and the business sectors are controlled by mafias. 
All of that makes Georgia an unlikely site for what have been relatively hopeful events in the last several weeks.
 First, Georgians staged a popular rebellion against a corrupt and autocratic regime. Then, in a clean election, they voted overwhelmingly for Mikhail Saakashvili, the hero of that revolution, who is 36, educated in New York, personable, confident and politically adept. 
 He brings unusual assets to face Georgia's crushing problems, and he must be exceedingly careful not to squander them. 
Mr. Saakashvili's most important advantage is his alliance with two former speakers of Parliament, who both gave up their presidential ambitions to support him. The three of them are part of a dynamic generation of educated young leaders. Mr. Saakashvili, who can be arrogant, must maintain this alliance. The others can push needed changes through the Parliament, and will help him avoid the temptation to make a cult of his leadership.
His major challenge will be the economy. Georgia produces very little that it can sell abroad. Corruption helped many Georgians get rich but discourages legitimate business. And Georgia is perhaps the most corrupt remnant of the Soviet Union, which is no small distinction. Theft in the energy sector is particularly pernicious. Mr. Saakashvili should tackle that first, and then he must repair relations with Russia.
Mr. Saakashvili has been justice minister and head of Tbilisi's City Council, and he is aware of the challenges he faces. If he can resist falling into demagoguery, he is perhaps better equipped than his predecessors to meet them.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Washington: Embargo On Import Of Civet Cats Linked To SARS In China 

BYLINE:  By John Files (NYT)

 BODY:
 The federal government imposed an immediate embargo on the import of civet cats, a relative of the mongoose, because of concerns that they have spread the SARS virus to humans in China. "This embargo will help us protect the American public and prevent introduction of SARS in the United States," said Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services. 
This month, officials in Guangdong Province in southeastern China ordered the killing of every civet cat in captivity in the province after researchers found that a Guangdong man had fallen ill with a new strain of SARS virus that is genetically similar to a strain found in civet cats. The civet is considered a delicacy in parts of China. John Files (NYT)

Paul O'Neill, Unplugged, or What Would Alexander Hamilton Have Done?

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ

 BODY:
Read Robert Rubin's recently released memoir and "The Price of Loyalty," Ron Suskind's new book on Paul O'Neill's time in the Bush administration, and a few things become apparent. The first is that Mr. O'Neill would have really liked having Mr. Rubin's job.
 Of course, Mr. O'Neill thought he was getting Mr. Rubin's job when George Bush appointed him Treasury secretary, but in fact he was only assuming the title. Mr. Rubin's job, as described in his book, "In an Uncertain World: Tough Choices From Wall Street to Washington," was to analyze an often mystifying world, alongside Alan Greenspan and an insatiably curious president, and to shape domestic and global economic policy accordingly. 
 Mr. O'Neill, who had been a budget wiz in the Nixon and Ford administrations and a successful chief executive at Alcoa, was able to sift through economic data to his heart's content with his old pal, Mr. Greenspan. But he soon discovered that this was merely an academic undertaking. In addition to the damage that Mr. O'Neill did to himself with his erratic public statements, he was serving in an administration that was not eager to have facts get in the way of policies set by a "praetorian guard" of ideologues surrounding the president. 
Mr. O'Neill can't tell you what it feels like to steer the world economy. For that, read Mr. Rubin's book. Mr. O'Neill's is a woeful tale of what it feels like to sit in the office once occupied by Alexander Hamilton and be subservient to people like Karl Rove and Karen Hughes.
"We need to be better about keeping politics out of the policy process," Mr. O'Neill told Dick Cheney, his old friend from the Ford administration who had recommended him for the job early on. In this tale, the Treasury secretary repeatedly implores the vice president to foster a more open and rigorous policy-making process in the White House, but to no avail. These scenes are reminiscent of a spy thriller in which the protagonist warns the head of counterintelligence that there is an enemy mole in their midst, only to discover that his confidant is actually the mole.
Long after the reader has figured it out, Mr. O'Neill finally realizes that Mr. Cheney is the leader of the inner circle, which keeps facts -- whether about global warming, the deficit, steel tariffs or Iraq -- from getting in the way of policy. 
Mr. O'Neill did manage, for a time, to head off talk of a tax cut on dividends. But when the issue comes up once more right after the midterm elections, and Mr. O'Neill again notes that the country cannot afford it, Mr. Cheney cuts him off: "Reagan proved deficits don't matter. We won the midterms. This is our due." 
To his credit, President Bush, who is depicted as having a hard time following the discussion, wonders at the same meeting whether he hasn't already given wealthy people enough of a break. That's when Mr. Rove chimes in that the president ought to "stick to principle."
Mr. O'Neill came to feel that he, Christie Whitman and Colin Powell were essentially hired for cover by a president who had pledged to govern from the center, but really had no intention of doing so. 
Mr. O'Neill was a Nixonian Republican caught up in a Reaganite restoration. He had admired how President Bush's father, when faced with a dire fiscal outlook, had reneged on his "no new taxes" pledge. And while some Democratic liberals had viewed President Bill Clinton's fiscal discipline as a betrayal, for the likes of Mr. O'Neill it represented the triumph of Republican values.
The new Treasury secretary and Mr. Greenspan shared concerns that even the bulk of the first round of tax cuts in 2001 could prove unaffordable if projected $5.6 trillion surpluses over the next decade turned out to be a mirage (as they did). That's why Mr. O'Neill, whose presidentially conferred nickname was downgraded over time from "Pablo" to the "Big O," tried to get Mr. Bush to agree to condition the phasing in of these cuts on the availability of surpluses. 
He failed. "I won't negotiate with myself," the president told his Treasury secretary, as if responsible economic stewardship was a compromise too far. 
The White House is upset that a departed cabinet member has provided such an intimate and devastating portrait of presidential decision-making -- in an election year, no less. But Mr. O'Neill, who comes across as somewhat naive and politically tone-deaf in this thick stew of self-justification and insider revelation, also feels betrayed by a White House that discouraged any serious policy debates. 
Whether it's Mr. Cheney's energy task force, the supposedly independent commission on Social Security reform or the president's ridiculously scripted Waco economic summit meeting in the summer of 2002, the Treasury secretary continually registered his deep shock at what he rightly considered shoddy, if not dishonest, decision-making. 
"When you have people with a strong ideological position and you only hear from one side, you can pretty much predict the outcome," he says of the energy task force. Too often, the fix was in, as when steel tariffs were imposed, and when Mr. O'Neill's post-Enron efforts to make chief executives more accountable for their companies' misbehavior were thwarted by White House concerns about "the base."
When Mr. Cheney finally called to fire his old friend in November 2002, the O'Neill account quotes him as saying, "We'd really like to do this in an amicable and gracious way."
It was clearly too late to start down that road.

HEADLINE: Bush Meets Skepticism on Free Trade at Americas Conference 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush spent hours here during the past two days at the Summit of the Americas mending fences with his neighbors, Mexico and Canada. But he left the leaders of some other countries feeling shut out. 
 The way in which the United States uses its money and power in this part of the world still makes some of its allies angry. 
 The past decade of free trade involving the United States, Canada and Mexico was "a decade of desperation" for their neighbors to the south, who live with "the awful reality of widespread and disgracefully increasing poverty," President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil said Tuesday. 
The meeting of 34 Western Hemisphere nations was supposed to seek ways to help tens of millions of poor people in the region. For Mr. Bush, that meant more trade.
On Tuesday morning he said, "Trade is the most certain path to lasting prosperity." On Monday night he said, "The best way to eradicate poverty is to encourage trade between nations."
Many leaders of the nations at this conference disagree. Having had wrenching experiences with free market economies and forces like the World Bank, they say nations do not live by trade alone.
The president of Chile, Ricardo Lagos, signed a free trade agreement with the United States; it took effect on Jan. 1. He is politically moderate, leaning a little to the left, and his country has one of the region's strongest economies.
Yet Mr. Lagos spoke plainly of economic injustice and poverty and of the great divide throughout the hemisphere between rich and poor. "This isn't the poorest continent" -- that would be Africa -- "but it might be one of the most unjust," he said.
Another skeptic about trade might be the Argentine president, Nestor Kirchner, who took office in May in the swirl of an economic crisis that has left millions unemployed.
"Not just any free trade accord will work," he said. "Signing one will not be any easy or direct path to prosperity."
"A free trade accord cannot be the sole road in a single direction," he said. "A pact that does nothing to resolve deep existing imbalances will do nothing but deepen injustice and the breakdown of our economies."
The main issues for the Americas, Mr. da Silva said, are "the fight against hunger, poverty and social exclusion," not expanding the borders of free trade agreements.
Even the World Bank's leaders do not fully agree with Mr. Bush.
"Free trade definitely brings new economic opportunities," David de Ferranti, a World Bank vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a report on the North American Free Trade Agreement and its implications for a Free Trade Area of the Americas, the hemispheric pact Mr. Bush seeks with the nations gathered here. "But the lessons from Nafta for other countries negotiating with the U.S. are that free trade alone is not enough without significant policy and institutional reforms," the report said.
Those reforms, especially ways to create economic opportunity for poor people without access to the global mall -- international trade, commercial credit, computers, cellphones, shopping centers -- were supposed to be the subject here.
In the end, the leaders produced a largely boilerplate declaration little different from the one they signed in 2001, at the last such meeting. President James Patterson of Jamaica publicly asked that it not be dismissed as "another pious statement of intent."
The declaration did not give the United States precisely what it sought. Washington wanted a deadline of 2005 for the Free Trade Area of the Americas. The declaration does not set a firm date. Nor does it ban "corrupt" governments from those meetings, as the United States wanted. Nor does it adopt Mr. Bush's thinking that trade is the best, most certain path to prosperity.
The populations of the United States, Canada and Mexico together represent about half the 800 million people who live in the 34 nations represented at the conference. The discussion was supposed to be largely about how the other half lives. Perhaps 200 million or more are surviving on a dollar or two a day. Their numbers are increasing.
Mr. Bush's hand in steering the discussion toward free trade was seen as overreaching by some Latin American leaders.
With many millions of landless peasants, they are less interested than Mr. Bush in issues like how to "strengthen property rights so that land can be leveraged as a source of capital," as Mr. Bush said. For nations without land registries or functioning legal systems, those are faraway goals. 
As the summit meeting closed on Tuesday night, the consensus seemed to be that President Bush and the leaders critical of his policies had failed to find much common ground or a common language.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about tensions between the Bush administration and leaders of Latin American and Caribbean countries at the Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico, gave an incomplete name for the Jamaican leader and misstated his title. He is Percival James Patterson, not James. (He commonly uses the name P. J. Patterson.) He is prime minister, not president.

HEADLINE: First 10,000 Units Are Coming In Housing Plan, Mayor Says 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that 10,000 units of new or refurbished housing -- the first of 65,000 units he has promised will be built or rehabilitated over the next five years -- were now under development, and that his administration would offer a loan program in cooperation with four commercial banks to develop thousands more abandoned or decaying properties in the city over the next few years. 
 Within the next year, about 2,000 units will be ready for occupancy as part of Mr. Bloomberg's housing plan, the most aggressive of its kind since the Koch administration. Just over a year ago, Mr. Bloomberg vowed to build or rehabilitate 65,000 units of housing, much of it for poor or middle-income New Yorkers. Of the first 10,000 units, roughly half will be brand-new units, said a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. 
 While Mr. Bloomberg has staked his mayoralty on the success of his education policies, his housing proposals are almost nearly as aggressive and difficult to achieve. "Clearly we are seeing housing as a top priority for the city," said Joseph Weisbord, staff director of Housing First!, a group that advocates for housing for poor and middle-class people. "The question is, as the city's economic situation begins to improve, how do we build on their commitment?" Mr. Weisbord and others have called for a larger program, but Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that he preferred something smaller but attainable. 
The Bloomberg administration is trying to encourage private development by changing zoning laws, streamlining the building code and devising plans to attract investors. Under the plan, the city will provide $200 million in low-interest loans for developers to acquire land for housing development, generally on abandoned manufacturing sites and waterfront areas that are being rezoned for housing. Four city banks -- Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and JPMorgan Chase -- have committed the first $40 million toward those loans, and the city has put forward $8 million through the Housing Development Corporation to guarantee them. 
"Housing is really one of the keys along with jobs and great quality of life that gives New York City a future," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
Mr. Bloomberg was able to attract major banks to his plan by showing a willingness to get behind projects in which developers have a chance to make money, Seth H. Waugh, the chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, said yesterday. "I think the mayor is very commercially minded," Mr. Waugh said in an interview. "And he has cut through a lot of stuff that other people get backed up on because he comes from the corporate world. From our perspective, the willingness has always been there but not the program. To have it be sustainable you have to have it be somewhat commercial. We hope we don't lose money but we might."

Channeling Bruckner, Maestro Illuminates Elusive Score

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
The conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch, 80, who has been suffering from chronic health problems, seemed to defy time on Tuesday night in an extraordinary performance of Bruckner's daunting 80-minute Symphony No. 5 in B Flat. Mr. Sawallisch seemed at his artistic peak, delivering a luminous and probing account of an elusive and complex work.
 Last May, when he made his farewell appearance at Carnegie Hall as the music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, he had been suffering from fatigue and dizziness and looked frail. Mr. Sawallisch rallied to give vibrant readings of symphonies by Beethoven and Schumann that night. Still, it was hard to avoid wondering if we were seeing his last performance in New York. As it turned out, he was not able to conduct the remaining concerts on a farewell tour with the orchestra he led with distinction for 10 years. 
 So it was heartening to have Mr. Sawallisch back with the Philadelphians on Tuesday night for this uncompromising program, consisting of only the Bruckner.
Sitting on a tall stool that kept his back upright, Mr. Sawallisch seemed more commanding a figure than ever, conducting with elegantly economical gestures and projecting calm authority. If was as if he were not just performing the symphony but also channeling Bruckner. 
Listening to this shimmering account of the score it was hard to understand why Bruckner's orchestration was considered so curiously austere that Franz Schalk, who conducted the premiere performance in 1894 (Bruckner was too ill to attend) in Graz, Austria, boldly reorchestrated long passages, giving it more Wagnerian heft. Mr. Sawallisch conducted the original version, which is now accepted. Even in subdued passages he drew such uncannily balanced, warm and enveloping tones from the orchestra, especially the rich string section, that you would have thought the Carnegie Hall stage floor had turned into the sound board of some gargantuan cello.
Mr. Sawallisch had the simple opening of the first movement -- just a soft, plucked descending and ascending unison scale motif -- seeming like the most significant initial statement of any 19th-century symphony. As the ruminative movement evolved, he captured all its stately beauty: for example, the passage when a recurring chorale tune played in pizzicato lower strings is commented upon by a discursive melody in the violins. 
The plaintive slow movement flowed by inexorably. The deceptively genial third movement seemed here a gripping apotheosis of the Landler, a slowly waltzing Austrian dance. And the sprawling Finale, which can easily come across as rambling, sounded organic and inevitable. He made riveting drama of the pauses between the halting phrases that lead up to the final fugue, then caught you off guard by sneakily slipping into that complex fugue, executed with restrained intensity until the triumphant final flourishes.
That the ovation went on and on was no surprise. With its dynamic new music director, Christoph Eschenbach, in place and Mr. Sawallisch, one hopes, on the mend and able to continue as conductor laureate, the Philadelphia Orchestra is in great shape.

HEADLINE: Surf's Up at Sundance: Documentary Is First Film 

BYLINE:  By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Hollywood packed up its parkas and sheepskin boots on Wednesday to head to Park City, Utah, for the 20th annual Sundance Film Festival, which will start on Thursday. For the first time, its opening film is a documentary.
 That film, "Riding Giants," is a fast-moving look at the origins of surfing by Stacy Peralta, who made his mark at the festival in 2001 with his first film, "Dogtown and Z-Boys," about skateboarding in Southern California. 
 The festival will include 137 full-length films -- 91 features and 46 documentaries -- and 88 shorts. Another 30 short films can be seen at www.sundance.org, an online version of the festival. 
Festival programmers said they were optimistic about this year's slate, buoyed by the success of many of last year's entries, among them "American Splendor" and "The Station Agent," which were acquired by distributors and have gone on to critical acclaim and recognition during the current awards season. 
"The success of the films that were in the festival last year was very high," said John Cooper, the festival's director of programming. "That has us coming into this year on a high." 
Mr. Cooper noted a number of films this year that deal with memory and time, among them "The Machinist," "November" and "Trauma." He also observed that many of the entries experiment with nontraditional filmmaking techniques, such as mixing animation into a narrative or actors addressing the camera directly. "Those things don't throw the audience out of the film like they used to," he said. 
Already there was buzz around some films available for acquisition, including "The Motorcycle Diaries" by Walter Salles, about Che Guevara's journey into political activism, and "Open Water," a thriller about two people left to face sharks in the middle of the ocean. 
As has become the norm at the festival, there will be numerous films with major movie stars in them, including Julianne Moore, Kevin Bacon, DMX and this year Robert Redford, the prime mover behind Sundance. 
"It's a sign of the economics of indie films," said Laura Kim, a consultant to Sundance and an executive with Warner Independent Pictures. "You get your films financed if you put stars in it. That's not just Sundance. That's the film economy."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
A Real-Life Debate On Free Expression In a Cyberspace City

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
Peter Ludlow said he was only trying to expose the truth that Alphaville's authorities were all too happy to ignore. In his online newspaper, The Alphaville Herald, he reported on thieves and their scams. He documented what he said was a teenage prostitution ring. He criticized the city's leaders for not intervening to make it a better place.
 In response to his investigative reporting, Mr. Ludlow says, he was banished from Alphaville. He was kicked out of his home; his other property was confiscated. Even his two cats were taken away. 
 Alphaville is not a real town but a virtual city in an Internet game called The Sims Online, where thousands of paying subscribers log on each day to assume fictional identities and mingle in cyberspace. Indeed, none of Mr. Ludlow's possessions existed outside the game. But the recent decision by the game's owner, Electronic Arts, to terminate Mr. Ludlow's account -- forever erasing his simulated Sims persona -- has set off a debate over free expression and ethical behavior in online worlds that is reverberating in the real one. 
"To me, it was clearly censorship," said Mr. Ludlow, whom the Internet magazine Salon.com described as "an unabashed muckraker." 
A Yale Law School student, writing on the school's Web log, condemned Electronic Arts as "a classic despot" that is "using its powers to single out individual critics for the dungeons and the firing squads."
The issues are actually not that clear-cut. But the episode has called attention to the little-known netherworlds of a popular computer game genre known as "massively multiplayer online role-playing games," which now regularly attract a million or more Americans. In Sims Online, Everquest and others where the border between fantasy and reality is increasingly blurry, the games have become more than simply a source of entertainment. They are also a gateway to a complex social network that takes on a life of its own. 
But in a setting where the point is to play out fantasies, there is little agreement among players about the real-world consequences of their online actions. At the same time, the games' corporate owners are finding themselves at odds with some subscribers, who want more control over how the communities they play, fight and live in are governed.
That repeatedly wielding highly realistic, albeit fictional, weapons will contribute to real-life violence has long been a concern about traditional video games. But players and social critics say the ethical questions multiply when thousands of other real people are behind the characters on the screen. 
Is it all right for teenagers to slaughter other characters in Everquest, but not for them to engage in sex chat in Sims Online? Is it fine for adults in Sims to engage in private sex chat, but not acceptable to advertise virtual bondage and discipline services, as dozens of Alphaville's virtual residents now do? 
Within the game world, the 80,000 Sims Online subscribers are a relatively small group. Electronic Arts has said it has failed so far to attract the expected audience in part because it released the game last year before the software was quite ready. But Sims is seen as the forerunner of a new game genre whose goal is to let people play in social environments that more closely approximate real life. In those worlds, experts say, the overlapping of fact and fiction becomes both more significant and harder to sort out. 
"Part of the original reason people went to these games was for a sense of time out," said Sherry Turkle, a psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied Internet role-playing. "But as these spaces get more integrated with real life the kind of boundaries people want are still being negotiated."
In a Sims city like Alphaville, players see the same stretch of green pixels on their computer screens, dotted with cartoon houses and stores. Love shacks, too. They visit each other. Some hold poetry readings; others pagan sacrifices. Some vie to be on the "most popular Sims" list, or to get rich, but there is no way to "win" the game.
The players themselves are represented by animated figures and become entirely responsible for their own online identities, which can reflect who they are in real life or deviate from it drastically. The median age of Sims subscribers is 28 to 30, and about 60 percent of them are women. The game is officially off limits to children under 13.
Because they believe that such graphical environments are turning into important vehicles for communication, economists, lawyers and social critics have lately begun to study the world of multiplayer games as virtual laboratories that can provide insight into familiar realities even as they breed a new hybrid. 
"As more of us spend more time in these environments, everyone is going to have a stake in making sure their rules are fair," said Jack Balkin, director of the Information Society Project at Yale.
The details of Mr. Ludlow's case are murky. Electronic Arts says he was kicked out because he broke one of the game's main rulesby including a link on his profile to his Alphaville Herald Web site, which in turn linked to sites that tell people how to cheat. Mr. Ludlow, a philosophy professor, said he was nabbed on a technicality. Many players agree that the company enforces the rule selectively.
"They were out of line," said Mr. Ludlow, who said he joined the game in part to do research. "There has to be some responsibility that comes with running a kind of social common space like that."
Yet some of the game's most avid players also question the integrity of Mr. Ludlow's reporting, such as it was. Were 13-year-old subscribers really playing prostitutes in the game, exchanging the online equivalent of phone sex for simoleans, the game's currency? His source, a boastful 17-year-old player famous for cheating new players out of their money, has been assailed as unreliable. 
Even some of Mr. Ludlow's biggest detractors, however, worry about some of the same issues he sought to highlight, particularly whether the range of role-playing Electronic Arts allows is appropriate in a game open to teenagers. And they chafe at what they say are unnecessary restrictions about what they can talk about on the game's message boards. 
"For us to be gagged so we can't criticize other Sims is an enormous frustration," said Catherine Fitzpatrick, 47, a freelance translator in Manhattan. "You can't improve this society without being able to talk about what's wrong with it." 
As competition heats up among game companies, they may be forced to listen to such concerns. Online games cost a lot to develop and several have recently failed, but their economics are luring more entrants: customers, after buying the software, typically pay about $12 a month to subscribe. 
Everquest, the most popular of the games among Americans, has 430,000 subscribers who spend an average of 20 hours a week in a vast medieval kingdom. (Its addictive quality has earned it the nickname Evercrack.) More than two million South Koreans play Lineage, where princes and elves fight for control of feudal villages.
And the line between "reality" and fantasy is blurring. The currency of several online games can now be regularly purchased for real dollars on Internet auction sites, allowing people to buy their way into a higher level much as they might pay to get a child into a better nursery school. A Sims cheetah, the kind of rare-breed cat that Mr. Ludlow owned, is selling for $25 on eBay. The high-end rate for Sims "prostitutes," about 500,000 simoleans, fetches about $15.
Mr. Ludlow said the fact that fantasy money had lately taken on a real market value made the notion of selling sex online more worrisome. And he accused Electronic Arts of turning a blind eye to sexual elements of the game that might not be appropriate for teenagers.
But defining a community standard for the game's teenage players is not any easier than it is in the real world. In the bondage neighborhood that has sprung up in Alphaville, for instance (the Black Rose Castle describes itself as offering "collaring services but not weddings"), most residences state that players must be over 18 to enter. But carding the animated avatars that enter poses obvious difficulties. Many players argue that it is the responsibility of parents, not the game company, to monitor their children's "sexual" activities online.
Jeff Brown, vice president for communications at Electronic Arts, said the company would investigate if a player reported that a teenage player had adopted the persona of a prostitute, but added that it would need to respond case by case. "If someone says that is going on in cyberspace, is it lost on anybody that it's not actually happening?" Mr. Brown said. "No law was violated. It's a game."
Sims sex is, indeed, simulated. It consists mostly of players at a keyboard typing into a dialogue bubble displayed above the heads of their pixelated characters, perhaps while using the "slow dance" command or lying on a simulated bed. 
Harassment, cheating and use of obscene language are prohibited under the game's "terms of service" that players agree to when they subscribe. If one player is breaking the rules, another can click a button to alert an Electronic Arts employee, who may then intervene, suspending or banning the violator. 
That may have been what happened to Mr. Ludlow, who appears to have had as many critics in Alphaville as he had loyal readers. But even if Mr. Ludlow could prove Electronic Arts bounced him because it did not like his reporting, legal scholars say he does not have a First Amendment case, at least for now.
Game companies are not like phone companies, which have a legal obligation to carry all speech over their lines. They are more like a private club, which can reserve the right to expel members at will. And the Constitution does not protect speech once it has been signed away by contract, which is what players do when they subscribe. 
But that could change as virtual worlds increasingly intersect with the real one, some legal experts contend. It is considerably more painful to switch game worlds, abandoning pets, property and friends, than it is to switch phone companies, they note. Games may come to be regarded in the same gray area as shopping malls, which several state courts have ruled can be forced to uphold free speech rights despite being private property.
For now, Mr. Ludlow has been reduced to sneaking back into the game under other players' accounts and publishing his findings on his Web site, www.alphavilleherald.com. He still keeps track of Alphaville doings on a blackboard in his office, he said, in an obsession he likens to law enforcement officers trying to figure out the structure of a mafia crime family. 
"You almost get this sense that, well, I can't just leave, that it would be irresponsible," Mr. Ludlow said. "People come to me and I can help them. It gives me some -- possibly illusory -- feeling of playing a role in the community."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Trade Surplus Declines 

BYLINE:  By Bernard Simon (NYT)

 BODY:
 Canada's foreign trade surplus shrank in November for the second consecutive month, increasing the likelihood, analysts said, that the Bank of Canada would lower interest rates at its next review of monetary policy on January 20. Statistics Canada reported that the surplus fell to 4.3 billion Canadian dollars ($3.4 billion) from 5.1 billion Canadian dollars in October. The agency ascribed a 1.1 percent drop in exports chiefly to the strengthening Canadian dollar and unsettled demand from the United States, by far Canada's biggest foreign market.

HEADLINE: Strong Depth Of Emotion And No Frills In 2 Footprints 

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
Reflecting Absence is a plea for calm. Tranquillity has been in short supply in Lower Manhattan. Perhaps the city is ready to let this quality rise to the surface for a time.
 Designed by Michael Arad, Reflecting Absence is the winning entry in the competition to design a memorial to the victims of 9/11. First presented last month with seven other finalists at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, the proposal is being redesigned by Mr. Arad and the landscape architect Peter Walker. The version unveiled yesterday is still a work in progress. 
One major shortcoming has been addressed. Instead of hard paving, picturesque parkland now surrounds the two pools of water where the twin towers once stood. Mr. Walker's landscape design contributes more than prettiness: it confers meaning. It signifies the abundance that sometimes follows a rupture in the natural order of things. 
 The landscaping helps to clarify the strength of Mr. Arad's proposal. It brings more vividly to mind why ground zero was worth treating as an architectural subject. Contemporary urban renewal is an art of consciousness. Reflecting Absence revives New York's civic identity by embracing stoic ideals.
 Unlike the other finalists in the competition, the design does not impose superfluous forms onto the site. Rather, it uncovers the depth of feeling that has come to be associated with the two empty squares once occupied by the towers. Only God creates, George Balanchine used to say; the artist reveals. Reflecting Absence has the potential to be art in this sense.
 Indeed, of the designs officially adopted for the site so far, this is the only one that approaches artistic stature. That is partly because of the work's intrinsic merits, partly because of the process through which it came to be selected. Much has been said about the need for spirituality at ground zero. Secular creature that I am, I equate the sacred with integrity. Judged by this standard, the memorial competition was conducted on the side of the angels.
 In renderings, the design recalls a fairly standard modern use of pure geometric form. But the location, shape and size of the two pools adhere strictly to the foundations of the towers. Sept. 11 happened here, not just on that day, but in the weeks and months that followed, as the footprints became the bifurcated center of public attention.
 This blurring of realism and abstraction is emphasized by water. Cascades of it, falling into the pools, will evoke for many the Gothic tracery of steel in which the architect Minoru Yamasaki encased the twin towers. In effect, visitors looking into the pools will see watery reflections of the buildings that no longer tower above.
 Doubling is the motif throughout. Water plunges down where the towers thrust up. Deep below ground, the cascades convey three-dimensional impressions of the towers turned inside out. But the essential doubling of this psychologically sophisticated design is the pairing of our inner and outer worlds. The water transposes the usual relationship between these spheres.
 "You walk close to your dreams," Eleanor Clark observed in her classic essay on the fountains of Rome. Clark saw water as a medium through which the individual subconscious passed into the waking life of the living city. The most conspicuous virtue of Reflecting Absence is its exemplary use of that medium. By tapping into our emotional architecture it will provide a public, social space.
 The effect is similar to that achieved by Maya Lin in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, with its reflective surfaces of dark, polished stone. Memorials are for the dead and the living. They reflect ourselves in the act of remembering.
 That is why if I were to describe this project as Narcissus and his Double, I would intend it as praise. Meaning is in the eye of the beholder. If I favored Reflecting Absence over the other finalists, it is partly because the minimalist design encouraged the maximum range of individual reflection.
 "I can't go on. I'll go on." Survivors of staggering loss often face this painful conflict. It may not be resolvable. Still, it is helpful to know that others have faced it. I can't claim to be a fan of the rage for memorials that has overtaken the United States in the years since Maya Lin's masterpiece was completed. But in a society like ours, where the idea of death is shunned, it is hard to fault public reminders of it.
 Reflecting Absence puts us in mind of societies where birth and death were understood to be aspects of life. That is its signal virtue. Though it outlines the specifics of a contemporary tragedy, the design draws deeply upon historical memory.
 This gazer into Mr. Arad's pool sees the reflections of a usable myth. Artists like Frank Gehry and Twyla Tharp nudged me in this direction in late 2001.
 Mr. Gehry urged me to read Seneca, but Marcus Aurelius proved more helpful. Where have we come from? Where are we going? What is the nature of this place? Ms. Tharp boxed my ears until I admitted that continuity matters more than rupture, especially at times when rupture isn't hard to find. She suggested reading Carl Kerenyi's "Eleusis," a Jungian study of the religious center of ancient Athens. Subtitled "Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter," the book characterizes the Eleusian mysteries, which were initiated by Demeter's search for Persephone, as a quest for identity. 
 This seemed like an accurate way to describe what New York was going through as it began to fantasize its future. But where might that quest lead?
 It led me to question whether New York still practices the Western arts of self-renewal. It has been decades since the city's cultural institutions have exercised leadership in this regard. The erosion of that leadership is part of the twin towers' story. Never was this clearer than in the weeks following 9/11, when the city's rear-guard activists began clamoring for the restoration of Ye Olde New York street patterns to the World Trade Center's superblock site.
 I could understand the archaeological impulse. But why stop with Olde New York? Why not keep digging and digging until we get to the dark, archaic bottom of things? To Eleusis itself, for example, and to the Callichoron, the Well of the Beautiful Dances. According to legend, Demeter came and sat by the well to mourn the loss of Persephone, her daughter, to the underworld.
 The women of Eleusis gathered round to comfort her, an event later ritualized in dance as part of the Eleusian mysteries. For two millennia, Athenians went there to be initiated into the belief that death is a blessing, not a curse. Separation, reunion, abundance: that was the eternal Mediterranean cycle, for cities as for crops. Remembering follows dismemberment. You go down into the earth to be separated. You return to be reunited and to flower. Mr. Walker's deciduous trees will keep the city mindful of change.
 If we are a Western city, and if we believe that Western values are worth fighting for overseas, the peaceful struggle must be conducted here at home. A Western identity, even a hybrid one, cannot be taken for granted. It must be earned anew, by redescribing it, on civic occasions, in terms that acknowledge changing times. T.S. Eliot urged modern audiences to be conscious of the pastness of the past as well as of its presence. That consciousness is what Mr. Arad and Mr. Walker have made.
More than that, the two have set a standard by which other designs for ground zero will be judged. They have struck a balance between the private and the public, and revealed a social space where the two can merge.

J.P. Morgan Chase to Buy Bank One for $58 Billion
J.P. Morgan Chase agreed to acquire Bank One for $58 billion in stock in a deal that would transform J.P. Morgan, already the nation's No.2 bank, into a true rival to Citigroup.
 The deal is the latest in a recent wave of mergers in an industry that has been gradually consolidating for years, and some analysts suggest it will presage more. Page A1.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Taking Care of the One Who's Been There for Them

BYLINE:  By LILY KOPPEL

 BODY:
Inside the Jones household, there are two kinds of sounds. One is of illness and adversity: The children's chronic coughing. The motor of an inhaler machine that helps them cope with their asthma. The tapping of their grandfather's cane on the linoleum floor.
 And the other? It's laughter. It's the sound of a family gamely trying to meet adversity head-on. Inside their apartment in Manhattan, Billy Jones lives with his daughter, Utara, and her six children: Quantil, Xandria, William, D.J., James and Amanda. Among them, there are frequent asthma attacks, things they cannot control. But one thing they can control is taking good care of their grandfather, whose own health needs have sidelined him after a lifetime of being the one who helped others in need. 
 Until recently, when Mr. Jones received a motorized scooter, paid for with money from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, he could not get around on his own. "Even when I laid down," he said, "I had to get one of my grands to straighten out the legs." 
With the scooter, he can now spend time with his grandchildren outside their cramped three-bedroom apartment in a housing project. The children transform the daily task of exercising his stiff, painful limbs into a game they loudly compete over.
Being so dependent on others goes against the grain of Mr. Jones, who has long been active in his community. He was a Parent-Teacher Association president when his own children were in school.
Starting in the early 1980's, he worked as an outreach worker at the Dunlevy Milbank Center of the Children's Aid Society, one of seven charities supported by the Neediest Cases. As a single father raising three of his own children, in addition to eight of his sister's, whom he adopted, he found the center to be indispensable.
When his children were young, Mr. Jones used to walk them to the center and wait for them so that he could make sure they got home safely. One day, while he was waiting, it suddenly occurred to him to get up and start helping out. 
From that point on, "it was a love thing," he said.
He started volunteering at the center and became increasingly more involved. He became known around the neighborhood for visiting homes to inquire about a child whose participation had dropped or to inform families about beneficial programs at the center, like one on sex education. He also recalled negotiating with drug dealers to try to keep them away from play areas.
But things changed in 2002. Mr. Jones, who is diabetic, began to have weakness in his legs. A mysterious ailment hit him hard and fast and within days he was at home, unable to work. In November his unemployment insurance expired; since then it has been a struggle for him to pay for his insulin and medications for his legs. Before Christmas, Wayne Dawson, the director of the Dunlevy Milbank Center, got $1,695 from the Neediest Cases for the scooter.
Though he can no longer run around or play ball, Mr. Jones has not lost his desire to do some good. He works hard to inspire his grandchildren, who, he recognizes, already have much harder lives than he does. 
To keep them hopeful he tells them: "You can go as far as you want to go. Tomorrow is nothing but a dream. A dream is the future. And keep going for that."
And still, there are the difficulties of the present to contend with. Often, the burden falls hardest on Ms. Jones. ""She's daughter, she's mother, she's the father, she's the nurse," Mr. Jones said of his daughter, who between trips to the doctor manages their tight budget. 
Ms. Jones used to work as a pharmacist technician at a drug store, but after her last child was born she found that her time was consumed by the needs of her family.
D.J., short for Don Jenkins, was born with cerebral palsy and receives $587 a month in Supplemental Security Income. They also get $423 a month in food stamps, and the children receive Medicaid.
Still, things have been getting worse. "He wakes up in the middle of the night, complaining about headaches," Ms. Jones said of D.J. She explained how his growing brain is creating pressure in his head.
At the same time, James and D.J. have speech impediments that require therapy. Meanwhile, Xandria, who was found to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is working to keep up her performance in school.
"You're wanted and you're loved," Ms. Jones said she tells her children. "You're going to be something. There is no other option. There's no when or if I graduate high school. It's when I graduate college." 
In that moment, the apartment was once again filled with laughter, the sound that helps the Jones family face everything else. From her playpen, the baby Amanda shared a laugh with her grandfather. Ms. Jones watched the scene unfold.
"I tell them, our life makes for a good story," she said.

HEADLINE: BUSH BACKS GOAL OF FLIGHT TO MOON TO ESTABLISH BASE 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush on Wednesday set a goal of returning to the Moon by no later than 2020 and eventually using a lunar base as a launching pad to Mars. But in a speech that offered a sweeping vision for space exploration, Mr. Bush offered little new money for his idea and few technical details. 
 "We'll build new ships to carry man forward into the universe, to gain a new foothold on the Moon and to prepare for new journeys to the worlds beyond our own," Mr. Bush said to an audience of astronauts and other employees at NASA's headquarters here. Excerpts, Page A26. 
 To accomplish the goal, Mr. Bush said, the United States would retire its aging fleet of space shuttles six years from now and replace it with a crew exploration vehicle, capable of ferrying people to a lunar base where, at some time the president left unspecified, they would depart for Mars or beyond. But officials said they had not decided what that vehicle would look like, and under the president's plan, there would be no American manned access to space between the shuttle's retirement in 2010 and the launching of the exploration vehicle, envisioned for 2014. 
Speaking 17 days shy of the first anniversary of the loss of the space shuttle Columbia and its seven astronauts, an event that revealed major failings at NASA and led to a broad re-evaluation at the White House of the nation's future in space, the president said he would seek an additional $1 billion over the next five years to begin research on the program. And in a move with profound implications for other space science, he directed NASA to divert $11 billion from existing programs, especially the shuttle, from its current budget of $86 billion for the next five years to support development of the technology need to reach the Moon and Mars. 
Summoning the spirit of Lewis and Clark, who set out two centuries ago to explore the wilds of the uncharted West, Mr. Bush noted the United States' pathbreaking history in space but also said the nation was working on goals set years ago with technology that is now generations old.
For 30 years, he said, no human has ventured more than 386 miles from Earth, roughly the distance from Washington to Boston.
"It is time for America to take the next step," the president said.
Drawing a distinction with the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions and the rush to beat the Soviet Union to the Moon during the cold war in the 1960's, Mr. Bush invited other nations to participate.
"The vision I outline today is a journey, not a race, and I call on other nations to join us on this journey in a spirit of cooperation and friendship," Mr. Bush said.
Sean O'Keefe, the administrator of NASA, was asked Wednesday whether those nations could include China and India, which have ambitions to reach the Moon.
"Who knows?" Mr. O'Keefe replied. "I wouldn't want to speculate."
In his speech, Mr. Bush was vague about even the basic details of a manned mission to Mars, including when the technology would be ready to make it possible. He described the Moon as the stepping stone, saying that its soil could be turned into rocket fuel, and that its comparatively small gravitational pull would make it far easier to launch missions to other places in the solar system -- one of several theories about how best to propel astronauts to Mars. 
"We do not know where this journey will end, yet we know this: human beings are headed into the cosmos," he said. 
In 1989, President Bush's father envisioned a permanent base on the Moon and a manned mission to Mars, and the next year he set a goal of reaching Mars by 2020, the outside target date the current President Bush has set for a return to the Moon. The first President Bush's plan came to naught; but the program announced on Wednesday was somewhat more specific, a series of missions that would start with robots and culminate, someday, in lengthy human explorations.
But if the vision Mr. Bush sketched was expansive, it was at least partly rooted in earthly political concerns.
With the nation deeply divided along partisan lines on the most pressing issues of the day, including the war in Iraq, tax cuts and the environment, Mr. Bush's political advisers backed the plan as a way of associating the president with a unifying and uplifting election-year goal that transcends politics.
But with the budget deficit growing rapidly and Democrats pressing for a greater focus on health care, education and other issues, Mr. Bush's plan is sure to face scrutiny on Capitol Hill on fiscal, scientific and ideological grounds. Under the rough budget issued on Wednesday, relatively little new money would be spent over the next five years. Money would be shifted from the shuttle and the International Space Station, which would be considered complete around 2010, and the big spending would probably not come until 2014. Democrats were quick to question whether Mr. Bush's projections were rooted in reality. 
"While I'm encouraged by the administration's renewed interest in the space program, their interest doesn't reflect an honest assessment of the fiscal and organizational realities facing NASA and the financial realities facing the country," said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina. "Disregarding these concerns will only further jeopardize the safety of our astronauts, the integrity and viability of our broad American agenda for space and the nation's fiscal health."
The plan was put together under the direction of the National Security Council. Participants said that Vice President Dick Cheney had run several meetings and that the deputy national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, had organized many of the options. "The president didn't make these choices, but he approved them," a senior official said.
In the end, they came up with a program that embraces the economical efficiency of using robots and probes -- like the Spirit, the robotic rover now on Mars -- to pave the way for the kind of far riskier manned missions that excite the imagination and loosen the purse strings in Congress. 
The plan also resolves the question of what to do with the aging fleet of shuttles, which suffered two catastrophic accidents in 17 years. The retirement date of 2010 is intended to coincide with the completion of the building phase of the International Space Station, and would save the agency the arduous process of recertifying the shuttles' safety, a step the Columbia accident investigation commission insisted on.
Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., who led the commission, said he was pleased that the national debate on the direction of the space program was beginning. That, Admiral Gehman said, could avoid again designing the next-generation space vehicle without defining its purpose.
"The board was not pleased to find ourselves here this late in the shuttle life span and not have a replacement on the drawing board, much less under construction," said Admiral Gehman, who is retired. He said the shuttle "doesn't have a lot of life left in it."
The shuttle, said Eugene A. Cernan, the last man to leave his footprints on the Moon, was no longer suited to America's needs. "It's sophisticated, it's high-tech, but it doesn't go anywhere and it's expensive," Mr. Cernan said on Wednesday.
But Mr. O'Keefe, the NASA administrator, left open the question of what the replacement would look like, or even whether it would be a reusable vehicle like the shuttle or a one-time shot, like the Apollo space capsules. 
"We have to avoid getting fond of a design," said Mr. O'Keefe, a former deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget and chief financial officer of the Defense Department.
No matter what the answer to the design problem, building a vehicle with the kind of range and sustainability that Mr. Bush described on Wednesday would be a huge undertaking. John Logsdon, the director of the space policy institute at George Washington University and a member of the commission that investigated the Columbia accident said Mr. Bush had done a good job of describing the mission, but added: "It's a modest beginning to a rather bold vision. But given the budget and political realities, I think this is the best we can do."

HEADLINE: Mayor to Quadruple Size of Security Aid Request to Washington 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to call on the federal government to quadruple the amount of security money it sends to New York City when he unveils the outline of his third city budget today, a mayoral aide said yesterday. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who has long complained that the federal government shortchanges the city on homeland security money, plans to ask for $400 million, the aide said. The city received about $100 million in such aid last year, he said. 
 In unveiling his budget proposal, Mr. Bloomberg will have to walk a fine line between spreading good news about the city's economy while still seeking help from Albany, municipal unions and Washington. He will also have to explain how he intends to close a nearly $2 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
"The message I am going to give tomorrow is upbeat but it is cautionary," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference yesterday. 
For the mayor, who has sometimes been criticized by opponents for not being aggressive enough when it comes to seeking money from Albany and Washington, the demand for more federal money will be a slight departure in tone if not in substance. 
The city will ask the state to take over part of its Medicaid expenses, including all of the payments for the Child Health Plus insurance program, according to another aide. It will continue to press for initiatives the city has sought in the past, including a fifth pension tier for future employees that would pay less generous benefits. 
The mayor announced the biggest budget news last week when he said he would call for a $400 property tax rebate for the owners of one- to three-family homes, co-ops and condominiums, more or less wiping out the 18.5 percent property tax increase that he pushed through in 2002. That tax rebate would cost the city $250 million. 
Yesterday the mayor suggested that the rebate might become permanent, saying in an interview on WOR radio that "it is going to be an annual thing."

HEADLINE: Will Antiques Regain Their Polish? 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THE SUPER BOWL of antiques shows, the Winter Antiques Show, opens tonight on Park Avenue at the Seventh Regiment Armory, celebrating its 50th year. It once again pits George III against 18th- century America, American Indians against the colonials and Napoleonic France against Czarist Russia, as giltwood mirrors, imperial porcelains and hairy-paw-footed desks tackle each other over the recently fatted wallets walking the silk-brocade carpet on the exhibition floor.
 The show, with its prestigious gala party, kicks off the new year's social season and the big antiques-buying season. This year, there is high expectation and high anxiety, say exhibitors and others in the antiques world, as well-heeled shoppers and collectors get their first big chance, at show, to make good on talk of a strengthening economy and a bolder market. 
 Earlier this week, optimism among the 74 exhibitors peaked and dipped like this winter's temperatures. And at bread-and-butter shows like the White Plains Antiques Show at the Westchester County Center last weekend, where prices run in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands of dollars, sales reflected caution as well as confidence, not the true luster of a brilliant return. 
Leigh Keno, a specialist in Americana, said that he thought the general psychological moment was right for recovery. Mr. Keno, who stars with his brother, Leslie Keno, the head of Sotheby's Americana department, in "Find!" and "Antiques Roadshow," cited the capture of Saddam Hussein in December and the Mars landing on Jan. 3.
"What's Mars got to do with it?" he said, with an affable chuckle. "That's about optimism. You're not looking for antiques there, but it does help with a sense of pride. Things like that affect people's mood about buying a $30,000 Chippendale table."
Mr. Keno said that he had been buying more stock over the last year and a half than in any comparable period in his 18 years in business. That included seven of the 10 top-selling lots at the Sotheby's Americana sale in December.
Several dealers acknowledged that aggressive buying on their part, in addition to a reviving competition between collectors, had produced newly aggressive pricing. Mr. Keno has with him at the armory a desk made by Benjamin Reead in Marblehead, Mass., in 1771, priced at $380,000. (The price when new, as detailed on the desk, was $:10 British sterling.)
But Thomas Woodham-Smith, a managing director of Mallett Inc., a specialist in English and Continental furniture with showrooms in London and New York, was less ebullient about a bounce-back.
"Crystal-ball gazing, isn't it?" he said of the current fortune of antiques. Business was slower in 2003 than in 2002, Mr. Woodham-Smith said. "Our experience is that this market is later to turn than other markets," he added. "When the Nasdaq was going disastrously wrong, we were still selling lots of art." (Mallett Inc. is 139 years old.) Mr. Woodham-Smith, who is showing an 1825 Empire table from the Skottorp Palace in Sweden, priced at $315,000, said that he was "timidly optimistic."
Dealers discounted the extent to which strong signals from the economy might encourage antiques collectors to sell. Though the April sale of the Forbes collection of Faberge Easter eggs at Sotheby's, announced earlier this month, appears well-timed, antiques collectors typically have lived with their collections and behave accordingly.
"The market doesn't flush out sellers -- these people become attached to their furniture," said Clinton Howell in New York, who specializes in English furniture. Mr. Howell joined the show's coveted exhibitors' lineup last year when he received an invitation to replace Richard Green, an English dealer. Mr. Green dropped out at the last minute amid speculation that his sales to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco International executive now on trial for larceny, had made the gallery's appearance in New York problematic. (The gallery is exhibiting in the show this year. Mr. Green, through his lawyer in New York, declined to comment on the reasons for last year's absence.)
"Death, debt and divorce -- those are the three things that bring things to market," Mr. Howell said.
On one point dealers agreed. The high spots at the high end of the antiques market are selling briskly, and the middle range is disappearing like the ink on an old love letter. Important, well-documented provenance and full A-plus reports on condition are providing the kinds of assurances that are making collectors, eager for a reward after a little good news, reach for their pockets. And pretty items without any real claim to fame or uniqueness, which appeal to people who are furnishing and not collecting, are slow leaving the gate, and getting slower. That could mean bargains among the B material as dealers clear inventory to trade up.
At the same time, interior decorators are less of a force than they have been in several years, dealers said, as academic interest and fresh directions in scholarship again take the helm. Several new books, including "The Furniture Masterworks of John and Thomas Seymour"(Peabody Essex Museum and the University Press of New England, 2003), a book by Robert D. Mussey Jr. on two New England furniture makers of the Federal period, are producing enthusiasm in the collecting market for perhaps undervalued work.
"If you have a masterpiece in whatever field, there's a good chance you'll sell it," said Barry Friedman in New York, who specializes in 20th-century art and design. Mr. Friedman, who spoke on Tuesday after returning from what he said was a very successful showing at Palm Beach Contemporary, a fair, said that in the last six months the interest among buyers was for more expensive things. At the armory, he has a chair designed by Gerrit Rietveld, a seminal Dutch Modernist, and painted by Rietveld in 1923 for his own use. It is priced at $225,000.
On Sunday, at the White Plains Antiques Show, the light gray thin cashmere sweaters, the suede brogues, the British racing-green car coats and corduroys were as much in evidence as the Spode foot baths, the mahogany knife boxes, the hunting scenes and the silver.
Attendance was light, several dealers said, though the weekend also experienced record cold. "People buy -- when they come," said Bruce Phillips of Fair Trade Inc. in Shelburne Falls, Mass., which specializes in Anglo-Indian and British colonial furniture. "No one is beating down the door at shows."
Much that dealers who will participate in the Winter Antiques Show noted seemed evident in White Plains.
Decorators, who made up 70 percent of Mr. Phillip's sales three years ago, now amount to 30 percent. He said that there had been no substantial upswing in his business in the last year, attributing the situation to an absence of belief in the economic news being reported by the Bush administration.
Mark Schedlbauer, an Americana dealer from New Salem, Mass., said that "the economy might be coming back, but it's not back."
He added that he thought the more modestly priced middle of the antiques market was dwindling because "the middle class is shrinking -- we see it in our business."
But Simon Powell, of Freshfords in Bath, England, sold several items that topped $10,000 each, including a mahogany cellaret, or liquor cabinet, circa 1810, for $12,000, which justified the excursion, he said.
And David and Hilary Lehv, two lawyers who live in White Plains in an old house for which they buy old pieces, and who enjoy the circuit of weekend antiques shows, bought a serious dining table at Artemis Gallery, a North Salem, N.Y., dealer, after several years of shopping for one.
Last year, they passed on a table they liked because of qualms about the money, Ms. Lehv said. This year, she explained, as Mr. Lehv hit the floor to measure the $13,500 three-leaf American campaign-style table they had just committed themselves to, "the moment seems more right to buy."

HEADLINE: TURF; 
One Bedroom, Many Bids

BYLINE:  By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
FOR around $470,000, recent listings show, you could buy a four-bedroom, four-bathroom traditional house in Dallas with granite kitchen countertops and vaulted living room ceilings. In Columbus, Ohio, you could buy a sprawling four-bedroom house with two fireplaces, a whirlpool and a ravine outside your front door. 
 Or you could buy a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. 
 Buyers paid an average of $469,960 in the final quarter of 2003 for one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan below 96th Street on the East Side and below 112th Street on the West Side, according to the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview, one of the most comprehensive surveys of the real estate market in that area.
Despite such high prices, demand heated up: though two-bedrooms still represented the highest proportion of sales -- 43 percent -- one-bedrooms grew from 32 percent of all sales in the last quarter of 2002 to 39 percent in 2003, according to Miller Samuel Inc., the real estate appraisal company that compiles the report. 
The average price of one-bedroom co-ops vaulted, to an average of $444,373, up 7.2 percent from the previous quarter.
"There's just not enough inventory out there," said Sheila Lokitz, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Manhattan. "And what comes on just absolutely flies off the market." Condos, a much smaller part of the one-bedroom market, fell to $536,634, from $574,580 in the third quarter.
Buyers could take some relief from the fact that the average price of all co-ops and condos -- a measure strongly affected by extremes at either the high or the low end -- was down 1.5 percent, to $903,259, compared with $916,959 in the previous quarter. But the third-quarter figure was inflated by the record-setting $45 million sale of a penthouse at the Time Warner Center.
Basically, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, "all the indicators are up," as low interest rates, a rebound on Wall Street and a growth of confidence in the economy prompted more New Yorkers to pour money into a dwindling supply of apartments.
The number of apartments on the market dropped 7.3 percent, to 4,843 at the end of the fourth quarter, from 5,224 at the end of the third -- the first time in seven quarters that inventories fell below 5,000. "All of our brokers are scrounging around and fighting over the same number of listings," said Steven James, director of sales at Douglas Elliman, one of the city's largest brokerage firms.
One of his firm's chief rivals, Corcoran, will also release figures today, showing that the average price of condos and co-ops rose nearly 9 percent, to $854,000 in the fourth quarter, compared with $784,000 the quarter before. Corcoran's figures cover Manhattan sales below West 125th Street and East 96th Street.
"I think the story of the year was coulda, shoulda, woulda," said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group. "If you didn't buy in the first half of the year, you spent a lot more money in the second half for the same type of apartment."
Buyers of one-bedroom co-ops certainly were learning that lesson all year. With mortgage rates low, the monthly cost of buying an apartment was often close to the cost of renting one, or even lower, even though rents dropped by nearly 30 percent, said Neil Binder, a principal at the Bellmarc Companies, a real estate firm in Manhattan. 
"Based on the monthly carrying costs, for the one-bedroom buyer it became a very exciting alternative," Mr. Binder said.
Then, toward the end of the year, apartment buyers started to panic at the prospect that interest rates might increase or that the improving economy would draw out even more buyers. As a result, bidding wars were common, and those who hesitated or made lowball offers suddenly found themselves priced out of the market.
For sellers, who just a few years ago were worrying that one-bedrooms were not a good investment, the buying boom has turned into a boon. In September, when MaryJo Palumbo, an agent at Douglas Elliman, took on a listing for a one-bedroom co-op apartment in Chelsea, she advised the seller to price it at $399,000. But the seller decided to ask $425,000.
At first, offers trickled in: $385,000, $395,000, $400,000. The seller turned them all down. 
Then, in the first week of December, Ms. Palumbo said, four buyers offered the asking price, and one raised it by $11,000. The seller accepted an offer at the asking price, Ms. Palumbo said. 
"People who have been on the fence about buying one-bedrooms are looking at the economy improving and believe that prices and interest rates are going to go up this spring," Ms. Palumbo said. "So they're buying right this second, before anything happens."
The trend appears to be continuing. Ms. Lokitz of Corcoran said she was supposed to take a client to an open house for a "charming and quaint" co-op on the Upper West Side on Sunday. But with the temperatures icy, the client, who was feeling ill, decided to wait. When Ms. Lokitz called the seller's broker on Monday to arrange a visit, "they already had four offers," she said. 
According to the Elliman Market Overview, the average size of an apartment sold in Manhattan last quarter shrank to 1,280 square feet, from 1,302 in the third quarter and 1,437 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2000.
"People realize they have to be more receptive to things that normally they might not have been able to accept before," Ms. Lokitz said. "A few years ago, if you said to somebody that you had a one-bedroom for 600 square feet, they were appalled and said, 'I can't live in that amount of space.' "
At the other end of the market, the shrinking supply of two- and three-bedroom apartments hurt buyers hoping to upgrade from their one- or two-bedroom homes. 
The average price of a two-bedroom rose 9 percent in the fourth quarter, to $1,140,377, from $1,045,648 a year earlier.
In the condo market, the price increases for larger places were even more striking. The average for a two-bedroom apartment rose 7.2 percent, to $1,450,640 in the fourth quarter, from $1,353,520 in the third quarter. A three-bedroom condo averaged $3,278,823 in the fourth quarter, up 13.2 percent from $2,895,705 in the quarter before.
Amanda Brainerd, an agent at Warburg Realty, said condo prices were driven in part by the fact that the supply was limited, but also by an increase in demand from relatively young buyers who were finding it difficult to meet the financial requirements of co-op boards.
"Let's say there's some 38-year-old guy on Wall Street who makes $1.2 million a year in salary, has three kids and wants to buy a $5 million condo," Ms. Brainerd said. To qualify for a co-op, she said, the buyer would probably have to show that he had $10 million to $15 million in liquid assets. "He hasn't had enough time to sock away $10 million or $15 million in cash," she said. "But if you're buying a condo, you just need enough money for adown payment and to be able to pay your monthly mortgage. The higher the prices get, the higher the stakes are with the co-op boards."
Sales of two- and three-bedroom condos picked up in the last quarter of the year. For example, Robert E. Doernberg, director of condominium sales at Warburg Realty, said that at Bridge Tower Place, a 38-story skyscraper at 401 East 60th Street, five three-bedroom apartments sold in the fourth quarter, with price rises of more than 10 percent within just three months.
"Some of them were languishing on the market, and all of a sudden -- boom, boom, boom! -- they sold in the fourth quarter," Mr. Doernberg said. He said one sold for $1.85 million at the beginning of the quarter, and an identical unit on a different floor sold for $2.1 million in December. 
Although brokers have been exchanging hyperbolic anecdotes about the return of the "super luxury" category -- above $3 million -- the Elliman Market Overview showed that in the fourth quarter the average sale price of luxury apartments fell 7.8 percent, to $3.19 million, from the prior quarter. But that might have been in part because buyers were having to make do with slightly smaller apartments: the average square footage of a luxury apartment dropped to 2,516 square feet, from 2,702.
That's almost an incentive to move to Dallas. That four-bedroom, four-bathroom house with granite countertops and vaulted ceilings, for $470,000? It's 3,189 square feet.

HEADLINE: Telavi Journal; 
Georgia's Huddled Children, Bleakly Awaiting Tomorrow

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: TELAVI, Georgia, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Finally, a few months ago, when the cracked walls of the dormitory seemed about to burst, a foreign aid group hired someone to put metal bands around the building to hold it together.
 In the small, unheated rooms inside, there is a wool blanket on each of the wood cots, but no one has found the money to buy pillows. 
 "Everything is a problem for us," said an administrator here at the Telavi Boarding House and School for Orphans and Abandoned Children. "When a window breaks, we don't know how to replace it." 
One of the children, Madona Pitskhelauri, 13, said that what she likes best is to watch television on the school's one set, but this is not very often because it costs too much to run the generator.
Georgia is a country where cities are often dark at night because there is no electricity, where the winter air is sweet with wood smoke because there is no gas for heat, where low-paid teachers sell books at the roadside to earn a living.
It is a country where most people do not have regular jobs or travel abroad to find work, and where foster homes are crowded with abandoned children.
The wave of public fury that drove Eduard A. Shevardnadze from the presidency in November was not at heart about stolen elections, corruption or repression. It was because people in this once comfortable little nation are cold at night and hungry and jobless, without a pane of glass to fix a window.
In this country rich with fruits and vineyards, many people do not live much better than the 173 children at the boarding house in this city about 35 miles east of Tbilisi.
Some of the children, who range in age from 3 to 15, are orphans, but most have been abandoned or sent here by parents who cannot support them.
Now, though, in the shivering corridors of the boarding house as in much of the rest of the country, people are warming themselves with hope.
Their young new president -- "Misha the Revolutionary," some people call him -- seems to embody in his age, his American education and above all his energy and determination a bright and different world as each person imagines it.
"I expect that we've got a president who will start right away with the kind of children who come to this school," said Dodo Zedelashvili, a deputy director here. "There won't be a need for schools like this and all the children can be raised by their families."
The president, Mikhail Saakashvili, 36, has warned against extravagant hopes. He cannot simply reopen Georgia's dead and empty factories, switch on the gas and electricity and start handing out paychecks to teachers and policemen.
But some people seem too desperate with relief and yearning to listen to him.
"After the revolution I go around happy all the time," said the chief social worker here, Tina Gogiashvili. "I have no father and no mother, I have no husband or children, and I ask myself, 'Why am I happy all the time?' It's not just that we have a new president, but we have a new era."
For now, it is a disembodied happiness as Georgia waits, as barren as a leafless tree, for its season to change. The smoky cobbled streets of Telavi, like those of other cities, are listless and its shops are mostly dark. Its men, standing in small clusters, seem exhausted by idleness.
The boarding school is quiet now too, with classes suspended for the holidays. But one-fourth of the children remain here, including a dozen preschoolers, with no one to take them in for the holiday.
"What can you say about parents who don't even take their children home on Christmas Day?" said Omar Peikrishvili, who has run the foster home for 21 years and is a surrogate parent to the children here.
Mr. Peikrishvili does show the difference one man can make, maintaining his institution through force of will and hard work -- painting walls, fixing furniture, hanging pictures, leading dance classes, celebrating birthdays. He has tried without much success to get supplies and textbooks for his classrooms.
"He is everything for us," said Valery Vartanovi, 15, who has lived here since he was 3.
Valery is one of the rare students who has studied well enough to be accepted at a local institute and allowed to keep his bed at the foster home. "I'd like to study finance or oil production," he said, although he also whispered that he would like to go to America.
In Georgia, though, most youngsters graduate directly from institutes and colleges into joblessness. Unless the economy somehow comes to life, one school official said, the other children are also likely to follow their parents into poverty and unemployment.
Already the lassitude of the outside world seems to have seeped through the dormitory walls along with the winter cold. With their teachers on holiday and classes suspended, the older students gather in what is known as the television room, bare except for the darkened set placed high on one wall.
Without books or other ways to pass the time and without the money for excursions outside, they wait out the afternoon together in their winter coats, huddled around a small iron stove.
They are the future of their country, their teachers keep telling them, but it is hard to know what that means.

HEADLINE: Fed Report Hints At Signs of Recovery 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
The economy was continuing to rebound as the new year began with many regions of the country reporting that retailers enjoyed a lift from last-minute holiday shopping, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday.
 "Reports from the Federal Reserve districts suggest that the nation's economy has continued to improve since the last survey," the Fed said in the regional roundup. 
 The Federal Reserve's interest rate policy committee will next meet on Jan. 27 and 28. Most analysts expect the Fed to leave the benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at 1 percent for much of this year.
Even beaten-down manufacturing industries showed signs of life, the report, known as the beige book, said. Housing and auto sales were strong.
In another report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent in December, reflecting higher costs for gasoline and other energy products. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core rate of inflation fell 0.1 percent for a second month.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Plan Would Force Fund Boards To Change 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
A deeply divided Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules on Wednesday that would force most of the nation's mutual funds to replace their board chairmen with outsiders independent of the firms that manage the funds.
 The proposal, which is expected to win final approval in the next few months, will affect not just mutual fund companies that have figured in recent investigations but giant firms like Fidelity Investments, the Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Associates, which have been left unscathed by the industry's scandals. And several mutual fund companies involved in the investigations have independent chairmen and boards for their funds. 
 Still, some industry experts and government officials said that the proposal, if adopted, could begin to alter the way mutual funds govern themselves. Analysts estimate that the boards of about 80 percent of the nation's mutual funds have chairmen who are senior executives of the funds' management companies and would have to be replaced under the new rule. 
Critics of the plan, including two Republican members of the commission, argue that by removing insiders from leadership roles at fund boards, the S.E.C. could seriously undermine those boards' effectiveness on behalf of investors.
But the supporters of the proposal -- including the S.E.C.'s chairman, William H. Donaldson, and the commission's two Democratic members -- reject that view, saying fund managers would still be consulted and could have a voice on the board, albeit a less dominant one.
As expected, the commission on Wednesday also proposed rules that would require funds to provide investors with greater disclosure of their relationships and potential conflicts of interest with brokers who recommend their funds. On Tuesday, the commission disclosed that a nine-month investigation had found widespread evidence that brokers received undisclosed payments for steering investors toward specific funds.
The proposals were part of a series of rules that the commission intends to adopt in the coming months in response to the scandals in the mutual fund industry.
Most of the proposals have provoked little debate, but the one about increasing the independence of the board to 75 percent of the directors, from the current 50 percent, and forcing the funds to appoint independent chairmen prompted a sharp discussion over governance and the costs and benefits of such an approach. The industry's heavily influential trade organization, the Investment Company Institute, has lobbied against the proposal to require independent chairmen and prevailed upon a House committee last year to strip the provision from a bill on mutual fund regulation. In November the bill was approved by the House by a vote of 418 to 2.
While all five commissioners at the S.E.C. supported issuing the proposals for comment, two of the Republican commissioners expressed serious misgivings about the plan. 
The two Republicans, Cynthia A. Glassman and Paul S. Atkins, indicated that they intended to vote against the proposal when it comes up for final vote in a few months. Theysaid there was no economic evidence to support the idea that raising the level of independence of fund leadership would have any positive impact on the governance or performance of the companies.
"My concern is that this proposal may put form over substance," said Ms. Glassman, who is an economist. "I am sure this position will be criticized by some as anti-investor, but I believe it is quite the opposite."
"To the extent that there are resulting costs, they would likely come out of the pockets of the shareholders," she said. "Second, the fact of having this required governance structure could give shareholders a false sense of confidence that improvements have been made, when, in reality, it is not clear that the structure improves anything." 
She noted that Putnam Investments, which has settled accusations of fraud, had an independent chairman and a board that was predominantly independent. Several other firms under investigation, including One Group, which is owned by the Bank One Corporation, and Nations Fund, owned by the Bank of America Corporation, also have independent chairmen. 
But the two Democratic commissioners, apparently with the support of Mr. Donaldson, said the recent wave of mutual fund scandals required that the commission move swiftly to restore investor confidence and overhaul the way the funds govern themselves.
"I have great respect for economists and economic experts, but there are moments where logic and experience and anecdotal evidence compel certain conclusions," said Harvey J. Goldschmid, a commissioner and a professor of law from Columbia University. "This for me is one of those areas. These independent directors must be made stronger and more active. They must bark and, where appropriate, they must bite. This proposal will help get us there."
Mr. Donaldson pledged to listen to the comments that will be filed by supporters and critics of the proposal before making a final decision, but he indicated that he favored the plan.
"I understand that there are concerns about whether these changes will ameliorate the problems that have beset the fund industry," he said. "I anticipate that commenters will express a variety of views, and I will pay serious attention to the comments we receive. Nonetheless, I do believe that these proposals are taking us in the right direction, and if adopted, will strengthen the hand of independent directors when dealing with fund management and result in better service to fund shareholders."
Industry critics said that the proposal was productive but would not solve all the problems.
"It's potentially very significant and a reform that is long overdue," said John C. Bogle, founder of Vanguard, one of the nation's largest mutual fund companies and a leading critic of the industry. "But what really has to change is the ethos and the climate in the boardroom." 
He said that the experience of funds with largely independent boards and independent directors had "often been disappointing."
Gary Gensler, a former Treasury under secretary in the Clinton administration, former co-head of finance at Goldman Sachs and co-author of the book "The Great Mutual Fund Trap," said that governance of the funds was the core issue that had been exposed by the scandals, and that more needed to be done to make boards more vigilant.
"Directionally, what the S.E.C. did is a good thing, and it will change the atmospherics in the room," he said. But he added that, over the years, independent directors "have been rather passive in performing their duties," and that the biggest problem was that thecourts had imposed a relatively low standard of care for the duties of fund directors.
"The real question is, how do the independent directors make decisions, and will they act as real representatives of the investors?" Mr. Gensler said.

HEADLINE: Tax Withholding Proposed for Independent Contractors 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The taxpayer advocate, created by Congress to help the public deal with the tax system, proposed yesterday that taxes be withheld from payments to independent contractors, from truck drivers to freelance writers, and that the alternative minimum tax be repealed or at least revised so that it no longer applies to the middle class.
 The advocate, Nina E. Olson, also said it was vital that the Internal Revenue Service develop a serious research capability to understand how changes in the economy are affecting taxpayers, the amounts they pay and how some people escape taxes. 
 Congress created the taxpayer advocate office in 1998 after hearings into whether the I.R.S. had been abusing taxpayers. Subsequent investigations found no evidence of any systematic mistreatment of taxpayers, but by then Congress had enacted several changes, including creating a small office to look at the tax system from the point of view of taxpayers and how to make the system easier and fairer. 
Ms. Olson said she hoped that her 509-page report would spur serious discussion on Capitol Hill about growing unfairness to honest taxpayers and the almost complete lack of I.R.S. capacity to do basic research into how the tax system affects them. Congress requires an annual report from the advocate listing in order of significance the biggest problems faced by taxpayers. Ms. Olson listed reform or repeal of the alternative minimum tax first, but it was her second recommendation, to withhold taxes from payments to independent contractors, that seems likely to stir the most opposition. 
For years, the number of workers who are classified as independent contractors, rather than employees, has been rising. Debate has raged in economic conferences, Congress and in courthouses over whether this means more freedom for workers, especially those in intellectual jobs, to move about as free agents or whether it is in significant part just a tax dodge. Federal law requires that income, Social Security and Medicare taxes be withheld from the paychecks of employees, but not from payments to independent contractors.
Ms. Olson proposed a basic withholding rate of 5 percent on payments to independent contractors, with lower rates for those in low-margin businesses. She said her proposal would "level the playing field" between companies that comply with the law and those that evade taxes by not properly classifying workers as employees, from whose paychecks taxes are withheld, or by not reporting payments made to contractors.
Ms. Olson also said it would be fair to individuals by reducing the number of people who do not report part or all of their income and may not even file tax returns because there is no record of their income. She said it would also reduce burdens on people who fail to set aside money for taxes and end up in debt to the government.
A labor lawyer who represents the management side, Nancy Joerg in St. Charles, Ill., said the proposal was the wrong way to attack tax cheating among entrepreneurs who file a tax return with a Schedule C, which is used by many small businesses to report income and expenses.
"There are many legitimate contractors," said Ms. Joerg, a partner in Wessels & Pautsch, "and to categorize all of them as tax cheats and take away all of the entrepreneurial advantages of being an independent contractor" and "imposing additional costs onto independent contractors just to discourage the classification of people as independent contractors is misguided."
Ms. Joerg said Schedule C tax cheating would diminish with "more employer education" about how to properly classify people as employees or independent contractors and more enforcement of existing rules.
William F. Gale, a Brookings Institution tax economist who often does freelance consulting, said the withholding proposal "is a great idea." 
"I am certain that a lot of Schedule C tax cheating is going on," he said, citing his own experience with companies that did not want to issue him a Form 1099, which shows money paid to independent contractors. "A 5 percent withholding rate is not going to bankrupt anybody, but it is going to provide a record of the payment so the taxes get paid."
The most pressing need, the report said, is repeal of the alternative minimum tax, which critics call the stealth tax because it reduces the deductions that individuals receive for themselves, their spouses and children, their state and local property taxes and some medical bills -- and can even wipe out the standard deduction.
"The A.M.T. is bad policy and its repeal would simplify" the tax code, Ms. Olson wrote.
The tax, first enacted in 1969, was intended to make sure that very high-income taxpayers cannot escape all income taxes. In 1966, there were 155 taxpayers who made the equivalent of $1 million or more in today's dollars who paid no income taxes, the Treasury disclosed in 1969. The alternative minimum tax was set up for these people.
But by 2010, an estimated 33 million Americans will pay this tax, most of them middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers who will lose their deductions.
Repeal would allow about 1,500 people with incomes of more than $1 million at the end of the decade to live tax free, according to a computer model that Mr. Gale helped develop.
He said that if the tax were reformed by removing routine deductions taken by the middle class, then only 300,000 taxpayers would pay the tax and about 400 people with million-dollar incomes would pay no tax.
Ms. Olson said a serious research capability could answer that and many other questions and help Congress enact a fairer and more effective tax code.

Trade Deficit Falls on Rise In Exports

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit shrank unexpectedly in November to $38 billion, the government said Wednesday. That is the smallest trade gap since October 2002, reflecting a rise in exports, especially of civilian aircraft.
 November's decline, from $41.6 billion in October, surprised most analysts and helped strengthen the dollar against the euro. 
 American exports increased around the globe -- to China, Japan, Europe and Mexico. The rise in exports, by 2.9 percent, was credited in part to the weakness of the dollar, which has helped make American goods and services more competitive.
At the same time, United States imports remained relatively flat, with a small dip despite growing consumer demand.
"On an underlying basis, we may have turned the corner and seen an end to constant rises in the trade deficit," said David J. Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
"In the short run we could see a widening of the trade gap, but the weakness of the dollar is definitely helping United States producers," Mr. Greenlaw said.
He and other analysts said the trade figure could have a significant effect on how much the gross domestic product grew in the final quarter of 2003. He said he thought the estimate of growth could increase to as much as 5 percent from 4.25 percent.
Aircraft sales, which are occasional at best, accounted for at least half of the rise in exports and were largely responsible for the decrease in the deficit with Japan, to $5.7 billion from $6.4 billion.
No analyst predicted a drastic decrease in the trade deficit, but several did say that the narrowing reported on Wednesday could be explained by the lagging effect of the two-year drop in the dollar's exchange rate.
"We haven't seen the full impact of the dollar's decline," said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist for National City.
Working against a further improvement in the trade balance is the growing demand to replenish the nation's basic inventories, which were depleted last summer. If demand continues to grow, the United States could increase its imports, offsetting the greater volume in American exports.
Over all, Asia, especially China, was responsible for the greatest increase in the purchase of United States products. In the face of growing discontent in the United States with China's trade policies, which have become a campaign issue as well as the focus of new legislation, China reduced its deficit with the United States by nearly $3 billion in November. Agriculture products -- soybeans and raw cotton -- topped the list of Chinese imports from the United States.
At the same time, Chinese exports of toys and apparel to the United States declined.
Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup, said the weakening dollar had had little effect on the trade balance with China, which pegs its currency to the dollar.
"China's imports have been booming as part of China's economic boom," Mr. DiClemente said.
The narrowing of the trade deficit helps bolster the dollar, because it means the United States depends less on foreign financing of its current account deficit, the combined measure of the nation's trade and international capital flows.

HEADLINE: SMALL BUSINESS; 
Struggling With the Falling Dollar

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
Larry Lazin checks his computer regularly to see how the dollar is doing on the currency exchanges of London, New York and Tokyo. Every week, he calls his currency trader in California from his office in a New York suburb to buy euros, capitalizing on the later West Coast closing to search all day and into the evening for the best deal.
 Mr. Lazin is not a banker, a hedge-fund manager or a day trader speculating from his spare room. He sells lighting fixtures to architects and interior designers, and like a lot of small-business owners he has become painfully aware of how the dollar's weakness resonates on his bottom line. 
 Since hitting its lowest point in October 2000, the euro has shot up by more than 50 percent against the dollar, effectively raising the prices that American businesses pay for European goods -- from Portuguese cork and French oak barrels to English antiques or Italian machine tools -- by about as much in dollars. 
Similar gains have occurred with the currencies of America's other major trading partners, notably Canada and Britain. And with domestic inflation low, American businesses find it difficult to pass along the extra cost to their customers.
"For small little companies like us, that is a hard quest," Mr. Lazin said in a telephone interview from his business, Global Lighting Inc., in Irvington, N.Y. "You can't raise prices as much or as often as you need to." 
He figures his profit will shrink at least 10 percent this year, even after he raised prices. 
Small businesses that export their goods, meanwhile, are benefiting almost as much as importers are suffering because the dollar's weakness tends to make their goods significantly cheaper and more competitive abroad. That presents an opportunity not seen for decades, said Harvey D. Bronstein, senior international economist at the Small Business Administration.
"It's a great time to be an exporter," Mr. Bronstein said in a telephone interview. "If you're an exporter to Canada or Europe, you have had the effect of putting your goods for sale at a 40 percent discount without taking a hit on your profit."
More than 212,000 small businesses, with fewer than 100 employees, exported goods in 2001, the latest year for which the Commerce Department has data. Another 18,000 midsize companies -- with 100 to 500 employees -- also sent products abroad that year. Together, they accounted for $182 billion in trade, or 29 percent of all exports.
There are no comparable reports on importers, said Howard Schreier of the Office of Trade and Economic Analysis at the Commerce Department. The change has become more acute since last summer, with the euro and the British pound climbing 18 percent since September; since the end of July, the Japanese yen has risen 13 percent and the Canadian dollar 11 percent.
The cost of imports from China, the United States' fastest-growing trading partner, has not gone up significantly because Beijing pegs its currency, the yuan, to the dollar. 
Yet that exchange parity has added to the pain of some American small-business owners who import goods from Europe and elsewhere that compete with Chinese-made products. Complicating matters, China has come under international pressure to revalue the yuan, and any relaxation of its policy could suddenly make its goods more expensive to Americans, too.
Small and midsize importers are scrambling to find a way to weather the weak dollar. 
"Some of the little guys are stung pretty bad by it," said Paul W. Vierck, a vice president in the Oakland, Calif., office of Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. "They call and say, 'What can I do about the exchange rate?' I say, 'Not much. It's a trillion-dollar-a-day market."'
One thing small businesses can do is lock in a rate now if they expect the dollar to weaken further. Companies like Commonwealth sell "dollar forward" contracts in which an importer agrees to buy a certain amount of euros, yen or some other currency at a specific date in the future -- or over a specified period -- for a price agreed upon now.
Such contracts are a gamble. If the dollar strengthens, buyers could lose money. But if the dollar continues to weaken, they can avoid a loss. Companies that buy forward contracts at least lock in an exchange rate, which makes it easier to see the profitability of a particular transaction.
Many small importers would welcome the chance to reduce the risk of the dollar weakening further, particularly if they were caught unprepared for the rapid swing of the last six months. 
"Some are taking drastic measures -- raising prices when they can, burning through inventory or delaying payment to their suppliers," said Mr. Vierck, whose company, based in Providence, R.I., specializes in trading currencies for software developers and other midsize companies as well as smaller businesses like art galleries, spice merchants and wine importers. 
Often, he said, "suppliers overseas have been pretty sympathetic" to long-term customers who are delaying payment. 
Mr. Lazin, who imports lamps and other lighting fixtures from three companies in Spain and one in Italy, said he had not postponed paying his suppliers. But he has had to innovate and act fast to stay in the black.
Like many small-business owners importing from Europe, Mr. Lazin made some assumptions about what the euro would be worth against the dollar after the European Union introduced the currency in 1999. Soon after the European Union began using the euro in banking transactions, its value against the dollar fell, padding the profits of small-business exporters like Mr. Lazin.
After bottoming out toward the end of 2000, however, the euro flattened and then began to climb steadily against the dollar in 2002. It took a while for it to reach the value -- the peg -- that Mr. Lazin said he had assumed in 1999. "When it passed that peg," he said, "I knew I was in trouble." 
Economists give several reasons for the dollar's weakness, but the chief ones are historically low American interest rates, which discourage foreign investments, and the country's ballooning trade deficits, which create unwanted dollar surpluses overseas. 
"From a macroeconomic perspective, this country has been importing too much and exporting too little," Mr. Bronstein said. "People overseas are tired of taking pieces of paper with pictures of dead presidents in exchange for Lexus cars and mozzarella cheese."
Scrambling to stay ahead of the falling dollar, Mr. Lazin offered to pay suppliers sooner than was customary if they offered a discount, usually 2 percent; they agreed. That had the added benefit of letting him avoid some of the dollar's slide in the time between early payment and the usual invoice date.
He has also adjusted the volume discounts that he offers his clients, as well as the commissions he pays his representatives across the United States and Canada. Product lines with thin profit margins were weeded out, he added, and a year ago he widened the profit on the fixtures he kept. "It's a lot more work, a lot more confusing," he said of business today.
Customers have not always welcomed higher prices and narrower product lines. "Some of them don't understand" about exchange rates, he said, especially if they also buy goods from China, which had lower prices to begin with. "Not everyone can work with us on prices," he said.
Mr. Lazin has also developed his own approach to reducing his risk. Once a week, he buys a fraction of the total amount of euros he estimates he will need during the year. It is a form of cost averaging, of spreading out the risk of a price move in either direction.
The strategy has not completely insulated him from the weak dollar, he said, but "it makes it very easy at the end of the year to see what your costs were." 
That, he added, has helped him plan better and take a longer view of his business.
"In importing," he said, "you have to look at how you do over three years because there is too much movement in the currency."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rise Broadly; Technology Issues Fall After Hours

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares were broadly higher yesterday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advancing for the sixth time in eight trading days.
 A regional report of economic strength from the Federal Reserve contributed to the market's strength, as did an unexpected decrease in the monthly trade deficit and investor expectations of strong earnings by technology companies. 
 More than half the S.&P. 500 companies release quarterly financial results this month. Earnings reports yesterday included those of Intel, Apple Computer and Yahoo. All three, issued after the close of regular trading, were robust, yet all three suffered notable drops in their share prices after hours. 
James Luke, who helps manage $13 billion at BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C., was positive on the outlook for corporate earnings. "I would expect to see rising estimates," he said. "First-quarter earnings may be surprisingly good."
In trading yesterday, blue-chip stocks outperformed the surging technology sector. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 111.19 points, or 1.07 percent, to 10,538.37, with 26 of the 30 Dow components gaining. 
The S.&P. 500 gained 9.30 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,130.52. 
The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index added 14.69 points, or 0.7 percent, closing at 2,111.13. Telecommunications companies rose, led by AT&T Wireless Services.
On the New York Stock Exchange, more than two stocks advanced for every one that fell. Volume, though substantial at 1.54 billion shares, was down from 1.60 billion on Tuesday.
Shares of aircraft-parts makers like United Technologies gained in response to an increased profit forecast from Rockwell Collins, a maker of aircraft cockpit instruments. Rockwell added $2.39, or 8 percent, to $32.36. It raised its earnings forecast for the 2004 fiscal year to a range of $1.50 to $1.60 a share from the previous forecast of $1.40 to $1.50.
United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, climbed $2.45, to $95.85. Honeywell International, the leading maker of aircraft electronics, jumped $1.12, to $36.17. General Electric, a manufacturer of jet engines, added 39 cents, to $32. 
Stocks extended recent gains after a Federal Reserve report said the economy strengthened from late November to early this year. The S.&P. 500 index has gone more than nine months without dropping 5 percent from its high point, according to Ned Davis Research. Perversely, perhaps, this prompted some investors to predict that rising earnings were already accounted for in share prices.
A separate report yesterday showed that the trade deficit unexpectedly shrank in November to $38 billion and exports climbed, buoyed by a weak dollar that made American goods relatively inexpensive overseas. 
The narrowed monthly trade deficit is "further confirmation that the recovery is under way," said Keith Gertsen, head of corporate block trading at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. "It validates the rally to a certain extent."
Bank One, which late in the afternoon announced plans to combine with J.P. Morgan Chase, gained 61 cents, to $45.22, on reports of a deal. After hours, it eased 7 cents, to $45.15. J.P. Morgan, up 1 percent during the regular session, dropped $1.40 after hours, to $37.82.
AT&T Wireless gained $1.44, or nearly 17 percent, to $9.99, on news that two of the enormous regional Bell companies, SBC Communications and BellSouth, might buy it. SBC rose 23 cents, to $26.68, and BellSouth added 28 cents, to $29.21. 
Intel, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, eased 20 cents, to $33.39, in regular-session trading. After hours, despite earnings that widely surpassed Wall Street forecasts, Intel shares fell 94 cents further, to $32.45. Some analysts cited the company's outlook for lower first-quarter revenue. 
Apple rose 8 cents, to $24.20, then dropped $1.35, or 5.6 percent, to $22.85, after hours. Apple reported a net profit of 17 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of 2 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier. But its United States market share in personal computers declined to 3.2 percent from 3.5 percent, according to an International Data Corporation survey. An analyst said Apple needed to reduce its prices. 
Yahoo, the owner of the most-used group of Internet sites, fell 41 cents, to $48.39, during the session, then tacked on a further loss of $1.84, to $46.55, after hours. Yahoo estimated first-quarter revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, in a range of $475 million to $505 million, and for the year at $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Wall Street apparently considered those figures inadequate. 
On the credit markets, Treasury prices were higher. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained 3/32, to settle at 102 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.99 percent from 4.01 percent.

HEADLINE: BANKING GIANT: THE REACTION; 
Big Mergers Have a Long History of Failure and Troubles

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
If history is any guide, at least one sure-fire "bet the house and then double-down" winner will emerge from J.P. Morgan Chase's giant acquisition of Bank One.
 That would be Citigroup. 
 Megamergers like the one announced yesterday have a long and glorious history of failure and troubles. Ask the shareholders of Time Warner and America Online. Or Chrysler and Daimler-Benz. Or Hewlett-Packard and Compaq. Or J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan. Or Bank One and First Chicago NBD. Or Wal-Mart and wait. 
Wal-Mart does not do big mergers, though it will buy much smaller competitors in so-called tuck-in acquisitions. Southwest Airlines, Microsoft and many of the other truly successful growth companies and stocks of the last generation do not depend on big mergers either. Citigroup is something of an exception, but even it has stopped making really big deals since 1998, when it was created by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group.
In general, great companies prefer to grow "organically," as Wall Street likes to say. That is, from the inside out, by finding new markets or by taking market share from their competitors.
Which makes growth by mergers inorganic, nonliving growth. Companies buy customers when they cannot win new business on their own. They merge when their executives do not have a better idea of what to do. Those are often the facts missing from the splashy announcements of big deals. They are especially true of mergers between lagging companies.
And J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One are nothing if not lagging. Over the last five years, their stocks have each fallen about 15 percent, ranking fifth and sixth among the seven largest banks in the United States. That dismal performance is directly related to the fact that J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One are each the product of a megamerger.
(Wachovia, the only other big bank whose stock has performed worse over that span, is also the product of a series of mergers.)
In 2000, Chase Manhattan bought J.P. Morgan for more than $30 billion in stock, a deal intended to make Chase a leader in investment banking. The deal came just after Wall Street had peaked, and opened Chase to expensive lawsuits related to J.P. Morgan's conduct during the boom. Profits at Chase, which renamed itself J.P. Morgan Chase, immediately plunged, from $3.46 a share in 1999, to $1.67 a share in 2002.
Now, J.P. Morgan Chase has finally begun to recover from that ill-timed purchase, said Steven Wharton, a bank analyst at Loomis Sayles & Company who owns J.P. Morgan Chase shares. For all of 2003, its per-share profits are expected to be $3.12, according to analysts' estimates. Mr. Wharton said he did not understand why J.P. Morgan Chase was so eager to join with Bank One, whose strength is in credit cards and other products for consumers, at a time when the investment banking business is finally recovering.
"If J.P. Morgan had such leverage coming into the economic recovery, why dilute it now?" Mr. Wharton asked.
At Bank One, under James L. Dimon, who became its chairman in 2000, the company has begun to slough off the hangover from its ugly 1998 merger with First Chicago NBD. After its profits fell from $3.45 a share in 1999 to $2.77 in 2002, they are expected to rise to $3.05 this year.
Must be time for another deal. But the reasons that mergers, especially bank mergers, do not work are legion.
Information technology departments must spend enormous amounts of time and money worrying about integrating big computer systems with billions of pieces of customer data. Managers must spend big amounts of time and money worrying about integrating themselves with new bosses. In its announcement of the deal yesterday, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One estimated that their merger would cost $3 billion to complete. The companies expect to save $2.2 billion over three years, in part by cutting 10,000 jobs. 
Making matters worse, it is nearly impossible for outsiders to determine whether a deal is working. Writing on his site bankstocks.com about potential problems with mergers, Thomas K. Brown said: "The combined entity has no extended operating history, outsiders can't definitively identify inflated expenses here or a revenue shortfall there. They have to take management's word."
And managements generally do not like admitting problems until they become too big to hide.
Citigroup, meanwhile, continues to steam along, taking business from its distracted competitors. Since 1999, its profits have risen from $2.22 a share to $3.41, and its stock price has doubled.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE; 
Deal Expands Gap Between Leaders and Pack

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
The merger of Bank One and J.P. Morgan Chase will substantially widen the gap between the nation's three largest banks and the rest of the industry, making it virtually impossible for the smaller banks to catch up, analysts and investment bankers said.
 The combined bank will be close to Citigroup in assets, and just slightly larger than Bank of America, which announced its own merger with FleetBoston Financial just three months ago. 
 "This creates a super-tier of banks that is just untouchable," said Richard Bove, an analyst with Hoefer & Arnett, an independent research company. 
Smaller banks will by necessity have to be more focused in strategy and may have to divest themselves of those businesses in which they are now also-rans, Mr. Bove said. "It simply isn't possible to be a do-anything bank anymore," he said.
"This definitely puts pressure on mid-tier banks," said Steven Wharton, a banking analyst with Loomis, Sayles & Company.
Analysts have been expecting a wave of bank deals for some time, now that the economy is recovering and banks have recovered from the ill effects of the last wave of mergers in the late 1990's. But the scale of the deal announced yesterday makes it hard to match, they said. 
An oft-rumored combination of Wells Fargo and Wachovia, now the fourth and fifth largest banks, according to SNL Financial, would result in an institution 25 percent smaller than the new J.P. Morgan. 
In the last wave of bank takeovers, the stronger banks traded at far higher multiples of earnings than the weaker banks, said Brock Vandervliet, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. But after a recent rally in bank stocks, "there is no real currency advantage" for the healthier banks, he said in a recent report.
Still, other analysts noted that the cost of potential bank mergers now appears more reasonable. J.P. Morgan is paying a 14 percent premium to Bank One's stock price at the close of trading yesterday. That is less than half the premium offered in October by Bank of America to FleetBoston shareholders, a price many analysts and bankers called too expensive then.
Mr. Vandervliet said the latest deal would put pressure on Bank of America to justify the price it is paying for FleetBoston. "This price is so cheap" in comparison to the Bank of America deal, he said. Jon Balkind, head of banking research at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, said, "Some potential sellers may now be willing to accept a lower premium." 
If some smaller mergers follow this deal, likely targets include U.S. Bancorp, SunTrust and PNC Financial Services, as well as Washington Mutual, Mr. Balkind added.
The merger of J.P. Morgan and Bank One would bump the combined Bank of America-FleetBoston from its anticipated slot as the second-largest bank into third place based on assets, but Bank of America would remain the largest United States bank in deposits, SNL said. 
"Bank of America is still the premier domestic bank," Mr. Bove said. 
Very different motivations were behind the two giant mergers, analysts said. Bank of America sought geographic diversification, with FleetBoston allowing it to enhance its consumer banking business in the Northeast. J.P. Morgan sought to broaden its business mix, giving it a bigger consumer operation to balance the volatility of its dominant investment banking division.
Further deals are possible for the new J.P. Morgan, analysts said. The combined bank still has a modest presence, compared with Citigroup, outside the United States, Mr. Bove said. "They could do follow-on deals."

HEADLINE: France Seems To Try Acting Affirmatively On Muslims 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Has Aissa Dermouche, an Algerian-born educator, been given the job of prefect of the Jura region, near the Swiss border, because of affirmative action or because he is the best candidate?
 The appointment on Wednesday of Mr. Dermouche, 57, makes him the only prefect (department head) who is foreign-born or Muslim in France. But it was announced without fanfare along with others at the weekly Council of Ministers meeting. 
 After all, affirmative action or "positive discrimination," as it is called here, is not supposed to exist in France, which does not gather data according to race, religion or ethnicity, even in its census. The practice has been seen as an ill-conceived American invention that encourages divisivness.
But in a television debate last November, the interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, broke a political taboo and touched off a fierce public debate by arguing in favor of the practice to help raise Muslims out of poor suburban ghettos and give them a place in French society.
Since then the French government has found itself caught between the impulse to respond to the needs of its large ethnic Arab and Muslim population and the desire to reject any practice that threatens the French republican ideal of equality.
"There are parts of France and categories of French citizen who have loaded on their heads so many handicaps that if we do not help them more than we help others, they will never escape," Mr. Sarkozy, who is said to have presidential ambitions, said in a debate this month.
By contrast, in a meeting with high school students in Tunisia in December, President Jacques Chirac said that discrimination could not be positive and that it was not "acceptable" to "appoint people based on their origins."
Then last Friday, during a New Year's reception for the press at Elysee Palace, Mr. Chirac said that he had told his ministers in July that they had to come up with a candidate for prefect from "immigrant origins." Otherwise, he would not approve any new appointments, he said. And the palace announced last week that someone of "immigrant origin" would be named one of the country's 200 prefects.
On Wednesday, in a statement released from his office, Mr. Chirac said that the nomination was based on "a basic republican principle -- that top civil service appointments are based on the recognition of merit, whatever the origins of the persons involved."
Sensitive to the fact that the expression "positive discrimination" is a loaded one, French officials are hunting for alternatives.
Mr. Sarkozy proposed on Wednesday that it be replaced by "republican voluntarism." The phrase, which he did not define, could be interpreted to mean the granting of jobs and educational opportunities to further the cause of the French republic.
In an interview with Europe 1 radio last November, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said he preferred "positive mobilization," adding, "The idea that there are good forms of discrimination on the one hand and bad ones on the other might be seen as a confused notion."
Despite the center-right government's official position against affirmative action, there are exceptions. As Mr. Sarkozy said in his debate, "When we create quotas for the disabled, when we pass a law so that half the people on party lists at elections are women, when we set up economic and educational priority zones, what is that if not positive discrimination?"
In 1982 the then Socialist government created zones of priority education in poor neighborhoods throughout France, which receive special funds for extra teachers and aides and salary increases for them.
Within the regular police force are security officers of Arab or Muslim origin often recruited from the tough, largely immigrant suburbs of major cities. 
Although the first Muslim prefect was appointed in 1942, there have been few others, despite France's growing Arab and Muslim population. (Although there are no official figures, there are an estimated five million Muslims in France, about 8 percent of the population.)
Mr. Dermouche came to France when he was 18. Since 1989 he has headed the Audencia school of management, one of the selective grandes ecoles where France trains its elite.
In a telephone interview from Nantes, Mr. Dermouche called his appointment "a great honor" but declined to speculate on why he was chosen. 
He also declined to say whether he favored affirmative action, adding, "I can't cast judgment, which would be a political judgment, on positive discrimination."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE STUMP SPEECH/Gen. Wesley K. Clark; 
Rising Above Politics, as High as Commander in Chief

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark is trying to transcend politics.
 "I'm running for president because America needs a higher standard of leadership," he says as he races across New Hampshire, the first primary state. 
 "We need a leadership that puts the national interest above special interests," he says. "One that looks beyond the next election to what's good for America. One that sets measurable goals and doesn't mind being held accountable." 
The phrases are aimed at President Bush, who himself once promised "to restore honor and dignity" to the White House.
But General Clark is also trying to set himself apart from the rest of the Democratic field, most particularly Howard Dean, who has risen in the polls by channeling the anti-Bush anger of the Democratic base. 
"I'm not running to bash George Bush," the retired general says. "I'm running to replace him."
At other times, he says outright: "I am not a politician. I'm a leader."
But if General Clark's military persona is his biggest strength, it is also in some ways his handicap.
A Democrat for little more than three months, he is still finding that he needs to introduce himself to party primary voters, to explain why a candidate who has never stood for elected office and who voted for Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan is the best qualified Democrat to run against Mr. Bush.
Again he turns to his defining attribute, his 34-year military career. It will not make him sure-footed just at national security he says. He portrays himself as an executive with credentials on a par with those of any elected official, one who has long had to grapple with domestic issues. 
"Some people think generals just fight battles," he said recently in Somersworth, N.H. "But to be honest with you, most of the battles I've fought were to make sure that our troops had the tools and equipment they need, that our families were living in decent houses, that our school kids in the military were going to good schools, that the mess halls served good food." 
He does not apologize for voting for Republicans in the past. He says that as a soldier he wanted a president who was strong on defense. And much like another son of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, he treads firmly onto terrain that is sometimes claimed by Republicans as he defines his campaign in terms of values.
In his case, he speaks of patriotism, faith, family and inclusiveness. "To me patriotism is about serving your country," he tells crowds, after which he usually asks all of the veterans in the audience to raise their hands or to stand. "Thank you for your service," he says, and applause usually begins to drown him out.
Then, he takes the thought a step further, in a jab at Mr. Bush.
"To me, patriotism is not dressing up in a flight suit and prancing around on the deck of an aircraft carrier," General Clark says, a reference to the president's appearance on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln in May to announce the end of major military action in Iraq.
Sometimes, with an American flag as a backdrop, he tells supporters that dissent, even in wartime, is part of democracy, and that no political party had cornered the market on patriotism. "I served under this flag," he says. "I fought for this flag. I saw brave men and women buried under it. And no Tom DeLay, John Ashcroft or George W. Bush is going to be able to take that flag away from this party and this country."
To discuss faith, he tells of being born to a Jewish father and a Methodist mother, of attending a Baptist church in Arkansas, marrying a Catholic woman and converting to Catholicism in Vietnam, and now attending services at a Presbyterian church in Little Rock, his hometown. "Every religion I've ever studied," he says, "has one thing in common: if you're more fortunate in life, you help those who are less fortunate. There's only one party that does that, and that's the Democratic Party."
When it comes to family values, he lays out his policy ideas: to provide health insurance to all children up to age 22; to improve education by raising teacher pay and cutting dependence on standardized testing; and to enforce environmental laws.
He argues that his definition of family values differs from that of the Republicans. "I hear that other party using this term, family values," he says. "But they use it as a way of dividing people, grading people, sorting them out. There's these good people over here, they're the family value people, and over here there's these other people, they're not the family value people. It's a way of separating people."
General Clark then closes his speeches with a plea for inclusiveness, one that again draws on his Arkansas roots. "Some of us in Little Rock were a little hardheaded," he said recently in Nashua, N.H. "It took the 101st Airborne Division to convince us that everybody ought to be treated equally."
The reference, of course, is to President Dwight D. Eisenhower's dispatch of troops there in 1957 to enforce a federal school integration order. It is an event General Clark draws on to introduce his experience as a champion of affirmative action in the military.
The general is clearly growing more comfortable on the stump. But he still seems to have difficulty navigating between formal speeches and more informal discussions of his proposals and ideas. When he stands behind a lectern with a prepared text, he is as stiff as a well-starched dress uniform. But as soon as he steps off the podium and begins to engage the audience in a question-and-answer session, the starched general dissolves into a more approachable candidate. 
He acknowledges as much. "It's true," he said in a recent interview. "I just prefer to have conversations with people."
These days, he has gathered a stock of applause lines. Speaking of the 2000 campaign, he reminds listeners that Mr. Bush once introduced his economic plan by saying, "I know what to do with a surplus." General Clark, notes, as a way to emphasize that the nation's budget is in deficit, "And that's one promise he kept."
And when he talks of cities he has visited, he speaks of lost jobs, of the toll taken on average Americans and, more recently, of how an upturn in economic statistics was not registering with people who had seen their jobs leave for distant shores. "Under George W. Bush," General Clark says, "America's greatest export has been American jobs."
In his stump speech, General Clark usually speaks only fleetingly of the war in Iraq or Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda. After all, he has defined himself by his opposition to the war in Iraq, and he can be relatively confident that those topics will be raised by the audiences that come to hear an anti-war general. When asked, he is highly critical of what he calls "a world-class bait-and-switch" in which President Bush promised to get the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks but then sent the armed forces to Iraq. He suggests that the president is looking to the past, finishing up his father's war. 
"This president seems to think America's best days are behind us," he says. "I think our best days are still to come."

This article is the third in a series looking at the basic campaign speeches of the presidential candidates.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: A CRITIC; 
Kennedy Says War in Iraq Was Choice, Not Necessity

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
In a blistering and at times deeply personal -- critique of President Bush and his policy on Iraq, Senator Edward M. Kennedy declared on Wednesday that Mr. Bush "broke the basic bond of trust between government and the people." He also accused the administration of marketing the war like a "political product" to help elect Republicans. 
 "We are reaping the poison fruit of our misguided and arrogant foreign policy," Mr. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a speech before the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy organization in Washington. "The administration capitalized on the fear created by 9/11 and put a spin on the intelligence and a spin on the truth to justify a war that could well become one of the worst blunders in more than two centuries of American foreign policy." 
 This is not the first time Mr. Kennedy, who has previously worked with Mr. Bush on education and health care, has lashed out at the administration on Iraq. But his remarks on Wednesday were more pointed and partisan than in the past. 
The speech drew an immediate and harsh reply from Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican leader. "His hateful attack against the commander in chief would be disgusting if it were not so sad," Mr. DeLay said, adding that Mr. Kennedy "insulted the president's patriotism."
The White House response was more muted. "Let me remind you that the world is safer and better because of the action that we took to remove a brutal regime from power in Iraq," Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said, adding, "The president worked to exhaust all diplomatic means possible before taking the action that we took."
Mr. Kennedy, who has served in the Senate for 40 years and is regarded by many as the chamber's leading liberal Democrat, often gives a major speech in January, typically focusing on domestic policy. 
In the speech on Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy made the case that the administration used "scare tactics" to persuade Congress to approve a resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, just as the hotly contested 2002 election campaigns were coming up, to distract attention from the economy and the failed effort to find Osama bin Laden. 
The senator did not mince words. At one point, he called the administration "breathtakingly arrogant"; at another, "mean-spirited and vindictive." He also singled out Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, for particular criticism, labeling them "the axis of war" -- a reference to the "axis of evil" phrase Mr. Bush has used to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea. 
"War in Iraq was a war of choice, not a war of necessity," Mr. Kennedy said. "It was a product they were methodically rolling out."
He went on to complain about a "gross abuse of intelligence," citing in particular the president's State of the Union address last January, when Mr. Bush said the British government had learned that Saddam Hussein "recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa" -- an allegation that American intelligence officials had previously discounted.
"No president of the United States should employ misguided ideology and distortion of truth to take the nation to war," Senator Kennedy said. "If Congress and the American people knew the whole truth, America would never have gone to war."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Paper currency canhave value without government backing, but such backing adds substantially to its value.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California at Berkeley.

 BODY:
WHY is that dollar bill in your pocket worth anything? One answer is that it's valuable because it says it is. To the left of the portrait of George Washington, the dollar proclaims: "This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private."
 Dollar bills are "fiat" money -- they are valuable because the government in power says so. People can, however, write contracts that specify payment in other currencies. If a contract specifies payment in euros, dollars will not fulfill the contract, despite what is printed on them. 
 A more profound, and perhaps slightly unsettling, reason that a dollar has value is simply that lots of people are willing to accept it as payment. In this view, the value of a dollar comes not so much from government mandate as from social convention.
In the jargon of economists, the value of a dollar is a result of "network effects." Just as a fax machine is valuable to you only if lots of other people you correspond with also have fax machines, a currency is valuable to you only if a lot of people you transact with are willing to accept it as payment.
Indeed, one can have currencies that have no government backing. Gold has been used for centuries as a medium of exchange; cigarettes were used for payment in prisoner-of-war camps in World War II; and countless other goods, including cowrie shells and peacock feathers, have functioned as money throughout history. They were money because people were willing to accept them as payment for debts, public and private. Gold, cigarettes, cowrie shells and peacock feathers all have "use value" in addition to their "exchange value." These items were originally valued for their utility or their beauty, and they became used as currency. It is rare to see a purely paper currency functioning as money without the backing of some government or financial institution.
Rare, perhaps, but not unheard of. Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, cited an interesting example -- the Iraqi dinar -- in the Ely Lecture delivered at the recent American Economics Association meeting in San Diego. (Mr. King's speech can be downloaded from http://www.bankofenglandco.uk/speeches/speech208.pdf.)
Here is the story Mr. King told:
After the gulf war of 1991, Iraq was divided in two: the south ruled by Saddam Hussein, the north governed by the local Kurds. Mr. Hussein needed money to finance government spending, and in the time-honored tradition of dictators, created it himself.
The government could not import more of the bank notes then in use, because of United Nations sanctions, so Mr. Hussein ordered the local printing of a new currency. In May 1993, the Central Bank of Iraq announced that citizens had three weeks to exchange their old 25-dinar notes for the new "Saddam dinars," which bore his portrait. 
During the next few years, so many Saddam dinars were printed in southern Iraq that they became virtually worthless. The face value of cash in circulation rose from 22 billion dinars in 1991 to 584 billion in four years, and inflation averaged about 250 percent a year over that period.
Residents of northern Iraq could not exchange their notes. The 25-dinar notes continued to circulate and became known as the "Swiss dinars," because they were printed with plates made in Switzerland.
The fact that the Swiss dinars continued to be used at all speaks to the power of social conventions. The Kurds in the north despised the Baghdad government, and would have much preferred to have their own currency. But there was no government in place powerful enough to mandate a currency change, so they kept using the old Swiss dinars by default.
The Swiss dinar was in fixed supply, while the Saddam dinar was flying off the printing presses, so it is not surprising that the Swiss dinar quickly became more valuable. By spring 2003, it took 300 Saddam dinars to buy one Swiss dinar.
The more interesting economic effect was the behavior of the Swiss dinar against the dollar. In fall 2002, as it became more and more likely that the United States would invade, the Swiss dinar became more and more valuable.
This appreciation was driven by expectations. If the Kurds had expected that they would once again fall under Saddam's sway, the Swiss dinar would have quickly become worthless. As this became less likely, and the belief that future governments would accept the Swiss dinar became more widespread, the local currency became more valuable. Of course, every exchange rate movement can be interpreted in two ways: in the north, the Kurdish regional government initially interpreted the rise in the Swiss dinar against the dollar as a fall in the value of the dollar.
The government soon realized, however, that since the dollar was stable against other currencies, the correct explanation was that recounted above: the increasing belief that the Swiss dinars would, in fact, be honored by future governments.
The government was right. On July 7, 2003, the American occupation administrator, L. Paul Bremer III, announced the creation of a new Iraqi dinar that would be exchanged for the two existing currencies at a rate that implied that one Swiss dinar would be worth 150 Saddam dinars.
Interestingly, the currency markets valued the Swiss dinars somewhat higher than the official 150 exchange rate, primarily because many counterfeit 10,000-dinar Saddam notes were in circulation.
This story illustrates that paper currency can take on a life of its own, even in the absence of government backing. At the same time, it is clear that government backing makes a significant contribution to the value of paper currency: the more likely it became that the Swiss dinars would be valued by a subsequent government, the more valuable they became.

HEADLINE: Life (and Death) on Mars 

BYLINE:  By Paul Davies; Paul Davies, professor of natural philosophy at the Australian Center for Astrobiology, is author of "The Fifth Miracle: The Search for the Origin and Meaning of Life."

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia 

 BODY:
President Bush's announcement yesterday that the United States will soon be pointing its rockets toward Mars will doubtless be greeted with delight by space scientists.
 After all, there are plenty of good reasons to mount such a trip. For a start, Mars is one of the few accessible places beyond Earth that could have sustained life. Though a freeze-dried desert today, it was once warm and wet, with lakes, rivers, active volcanoes and a thick atmosphere -- all conditions conducive to life. Microbes might even remain alive there, lurking in liquid aquifers deep beneath the permafrost. 
 If life began from scratch on both Mars and Earth separately, then evidence for a second genesis would await us, providing a heaven-sent opportunity to compare two bio-systems and learn how life emerges from non-life. And if life were found to have started twice within the solar system, it would signal that the laws of nature are inherently bio-friendly, implying a universe teeming with life. 
An alternative possibility is that life started on Mars and spread to Earth inside material blasted into space by the impact of comets crashing into the Martian surface. Mars and Earth trade rocks, and hardy bacteria could have hitched a ride to seed our planet with microbial Martians. Just possibly the journey was reversed, with life starting on Earth and hopping to Mars. Though such cross-contamination would compromise hopes of identifying a genuine second sample of life, it would stillrepresent a biological bonanza, enabling scientists to study two versions of evolution. The economic and practical benefits would be incalculable.
Mars is alluring in another respect. Alone among our sister planets, it is able to support a permanent human presence. As Robert Zubrin of the Mars Society has remarked, it is the second safest place in the solar system. Its thin atmosphere provides a measure of protection against meteorites and radiation. Crucially, there is probably the water, carbon dioxide and minerals needed to sustain a colony. 
And yet the scientific community's enthusiasm will surely be tempered by skepticism. Scientists, it's worth remembering, rejoiced when President George H. W. Bush unveiled a Mars project in 1989. The same scientists then despaired when the plan quickly evaporated amid spiraling projected costs and shifting priorities. Of course, the project's demise should not have surprised anyone. Back then, a manned expedition to Mars came with a price tag of of more than $400 billion, a sum that makes the cost of the Apollo Moon landings seem like small change. 
Why is going to Mars so expensive? Mainly it's the distance from Earth. At its closest point in orbit, Mars lies 35 million miles away from us, necessitating a journey of many months, whereas reaching the Moon requires just a few days' flight. On top of this, Mars has a surface gravity that, though only 38 percent of Earth's, is much greater than the Moon's. It takes a lot of fuel to blast off Mars and get back home. If the propellant has to be transported there from Earth, costs of a launching soar.
Without some radical improvements in technology, the prospects for sending astronauts on a round-trip to Mars any time soon are slim, whatever the presidential rhetoric. What's more, the president's suggestion of using the Moon as a base -- a place to assemble equipment and produce fuel for a Mars mission less expensively -- has the potential to turn into a costly sideshow. There is, however, an obvious way to slash the costs and bring Mars within reach of early manned exploration. The answer lies with a one-way mission.
Most people react with instinctive horror at the suggestion. I recall my own sense of discomfort when I met an aging American scientist who claimed to have trained for a one-way mission to the Moon in the pre-Apollo days. And in the case of the barren Moon, that reaction is largely justified. There is little on the Moon to sustain human life. Mars, however, is a different story. Because of the planet's relatively benign environment, it is theoretically able to support a permanent human presence. If provided with the right equipment, astronauts would have a chance of living there for years. A one-way trip to Mars need not mean a quick demise.
Every two years the orbit of Mars creates a window of opportunity to send fresh supplies at a reasonable cost. An initial colony of four astronauts, equipped with a small nuclear reactor and a couple of rover vehicles, could make their own oxygen, grow some food and even initiate building projects using local raw materials. Supplemented by food shipments, medical supplies and replacement gadgets from home, the colony could be sustained indefinitely. To be sure, the living conditions would be uncomfortable, but the colonists would have the opportunity to do ground-breaking scientific work and blaze a trail that would ensure them a permanent place in the annals of discovery.
Obviously this strategy carries significant risks in addition to those faced by a conventional Mars mission. Major equipment failure could leave the colony without enough power, oxygen or food. An accident might kill or disable an astronaut who provided some vital expertise. A supply drop might fail, condemning the colonists to starve in a very public way.
Even if nothing went wrong, the astronauts' lives would certainly be shortened by the harsh conditions. The lower gravity would create long-term medical problems and the cosmic radiation that penetrates the thin atmosphere is bound to increase the risk of cancer. Add in the debilitating effects of general privation, and the lack of sophisticated medical equipment, and the prospects for longevity look slim. 
Would it be right to ask people to accept such conditions for the sake of science, or even humanity? The answer has to be yes. We already expect certain people to take significant risks on our behalf, such as special forces operatives or test pilots. Some people gleefully dice with death in the name of sport or adventure. Dangerous occupations that reduce life expectancy through exposure to hazardous conditions or substances are commonplace.
A century ago, explorers set out to trek across Antarctica in the full knowledge that they could die in the process, and that even if they succeeded their health might be irreversibly harmed. Yet governments and scientific societies were willing sponsors of these enterprises. Why should it be different today?
Who would put their hand up for a one-way ticket to Mars? I work among people who study astrobiology and planetary science, and there is no lack of eager young scientists who would sign up right now, given half a chance. But it would make more sense to pick mature, older scientists with reduced life expectancy. Other considerations, like weight, emotional stability and scientific credentials, would of course have to be factored in.
The early outpost wouldn't be left to wither and die. Rather, it would form the basis for a much more ambitious colonization program. Over the years new equipment and additional astronauts would be sent to join the original crew. In time, the colony would grow to the point of being self-sustaining.
When this stage was reached, humanity would have a precious insurance policy against catastrophe at home. During the next millennium there is a significant chance that civilization on Earth will be destroyed by an asteroid, a killer plague or a global war. A Martian colony could keep the flame of civilization and culture alive until Earth could be reverse-colonized from Mars.
Would NASA entertain a one-way policy for human Mars exploration? Probably not. But other, more adventurous space agencies in Europe or Asia might. The next giant leap for mankind won't come without risk.

HEADLINE: BANKING GIANT: THE HOMETOWN; 
Chicago's Financial Center Could Lose Its Last Pillar

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
When J.P. Morgan Chase acquires Bank One, probably sometime later this year, the city of Chicago seems all but certain to lose its last major banking headquarters. Indeed, people here are already lamenting the deal as one more step toward the demise of Chicago as a major financial center.
 "Emotionally, it's upsetting," said Paul O'Connor, executive director of World Business Chicago, a nonprofit economic development corporation for the city. "In my line of work, headquarter pelts are prized, but the economic impact is the real question." 
 And that has some here worried. In recent years, this city -- built on steel, railroads, chewing gum, ad jingles and pork bellies -- has been steadily eclipsed as a financial and corporate center, experts say.
The Chicago Board of Trade, once the world's biggest futures exchange, is now ranked No.4 or No.5 depending on how you count, having lost ground to electronic trading, European futures exchanges like Eurex, and even its own next-door neighbor, the fast-growing Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
And a string of big companies, long identified with Chicago, have through merger or acquisition seen their independence, or their Chicago headquarters, disappear in recent years. The list includes the phone company Ameritech, now part of SBC Communications of San Antonio; the oil company Amoco, now part of BP of Britain; the department store doyenne Marshall Field's, subsumed into the Target Corporation of Minneapolis; the salt maker Morton International, which for the most part was folded into the Philadelphia-based Rohm & Haas Company; and the advertising agency Leo Burnett, creator of the Jolly Green Giant, now a unit of the Publicis Groupe of France.
Sears, United Airlines, McDonald's and Motorola are among the companies that still have headquarters in the region, but they all have had serious sales and profit woes in recent years. And while Chicago managed to lure Boeing in 2001, the company has only known bad news since then.
"Chicago sealed its fate 20 years ago," said Anil Kashyap, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. "The state had very restrictive banking laws. So, many banks moved to places like North Carolina. And that's proved to be irreversible. Chicago is no longer a major banking center."
Four big banks once graced the Lasalle Street area of downtown Chicago, their line of march bounding along both sides of the street toward the majestic Chicago Board of Trade building. Bank One is the last to stand on its own.
Continental Illinois Bank, once a national titan, collapsed in 1984, largely because of huge loans to the energy industry. After a government bailout, it re-emerged as part of Bank of America.
Harris Bank was acquired by the Bank of Montreal in 1984. Lasalle Bank, still a major force here, is now a subsidiary of ABN Amro Bank, which is based in the Netherlands.
First National became First Chicago and then, in 1998, merged with Bank One of Columbus, Ohio, which at the time was gobbling up regional banks on the way to becoming the nation's fourth-largest bank holding company. It moved its headquarters to Chicago, but kept its geography-free name.
Assuming that Bank One is absorbed into Wall Street's J.P. Morgan Chase, Northern Trust, which specializes in asset management, will be the only sizable bank with headquarters here.
Leo Melamed, chairman emeritus of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a pioneer of Chicago futures trading, insisted in a telephone interview on Wednesday that while Chicago may no longer be a banking center, it remains a force in the financial world, by virtue of its role in risk management.
"I'm still with the Merc, and all the major banks work with us," he said. "We don't care where they're located. We're still the capital of the futures market and risk management."

HEADLINE: Ex-General To Make Run For President Of Indonesia 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The former chief of the Indonesian military, who has been charged by the United Nations with crimes against humanity, presented himself here on Thursday as a candidate for his nation's first direct presidential elections, scheduled for July.
 General Wiranto, an amateur crooner with matinee idol good looks, told a luncheon of foreign correspondents and diplomats that he could provide leadership and security for Indonesia after what he called five years of "turbulence." 
 The general, who has been campaigning for months to win the nomination of Golkar, the second-largest party in the Indonesian Parliament and the former governing party under the authoritarian leadership of President Suharto, appears to be well-financed in his efforts. Many political analysts believe that General Wiranto would have the best chance of unseating the incumbent, Megawati Sukarnoputri, whose popularity has plummeted as economic conditions for ordinary Indonesians have deteriorated. 
The general showed considerable strength in polls of Golkar party members several months ago. His main rival within the party, the parliamentary speaker, Akbar Tanjung, has been convicted of corruption and is awaiting a ruling on his appeal. 
General Wiranto, 55, and six other military officials were charged in February 2003 by the East Timor Serious Crimes Unit of the United Nations with crimes against humanity in connection with violence surrounding the former province's 1999 independence referendum.
General Wiranto has not been called before an Indonesian court. American officials expressed disappointment that he was not among those charged by a special human rights court convened in 2002 and 2003 on East Timor, which tried the cases of 18 soldiers and militiamen. Fewer than half of them were convicted and sentenced. He appeared nearly two years ago as a witness in one of the trials, a time when he had just released a CD of love songs called "For You My Indonesia." 
As the politicking for the presidential election has intensified, American officials have made it known that the nomination of General Wiranto would not be helpful for Indonesia's relations with Washington. The general has made courtesy calls to explain his campaign platform to a number of European embassies as well as the Australian Embassy, but not to the United States Embassy. 
The conduct of the Indonesian elections is being watched with interest in Washington, and a considerable portion of the United States aid package to Indonesia is going this year to supporting the election process. Two dozen parties have been certified to take part, but in the end the battle will be between the two major secular parties: Golkar and Ms. Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle. 
Islamic religious parties, whose platforms call for Indonesia to become an Islamic state, are expected to win only about 10 to 15 percent of the vote, according to election experts. About 143 million voters are eligible to participate in the vote and the turnout could be as high as 80 percent, according to the National Democratic Institute, a Washington based group working here. 
Despite the interest abroad in the general's indictment by the United Nations over East Timor, Indonesians themselves have paid little attention to it. Many regard the loss of East Timor, now an independent country, as a dark chapter in the country's history. 
The general, who was forced out of his military position in 2000, defended his actions in East Timor. He said he had followed orders to help organize the referendumin East Timor and had prevented outright civil war at a very difficult period.
"It is very easy to say that there were gross violations of human rights when we know that is not the fact," he said. Moreover, he added, as defense minister he was a policy maker who could not be held responsible for every operation.

HEADLINE: Yo, Dodgers? No Way! Brooklyn Is Betting on the Nets for Revival 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The revival of Brooklyn has been painfully slow, an effort eked out neighborhood by neighborhood, with chic new restaurants in Fort Greene, artists' lofts in Williamsburg, new businesses in industrial Red Hook and the transformation of derelict factory buildings into million-dollar condominiums in an area with the unlikely name of Dumbo.
 But the prospect of a professional basketball team moving across two rivers to Brooklyn seemed, until recently, as remote as shipbuilding returning to the sprawling Brooklyn Navy Yard complex. Now, Bruce Ratner, the developer, is negotiating to buy the New Jersey Nets and install the team in a glamorous new home designed by a world-renowned architect at the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. 
 For many residents, politicians and economists, a move by the Nets to Brooklyn would crystallize the rejuvenation of the borough and repudiate a 50-year cycle of decline that saw the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1957, the closing of the Navy Yard, the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs and the riots during the blackout of 1977. 
"It would cap the rebirth of Brooklyn," said Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union who lives in Flatbush. "You'd heal some of the old wounds from the Dodgers having left, and people would discover all the other changes in Brooklyn."
The borough's resurgence will probably continue whether Mr. Ratner and his investors succeed in his effort to buy the Nets. Mr. Ratner, who has bid about $300 million, is vying with a New Jersey group headed by Charles Kushner, a developer, and Senator Jon Corzine that intends to keep the team at its current home in New Jersey. Mr. Kushner has offered $267.5 million for the team and suggested that he may yet raise his bid. 
"We're reviewing all the financial information and due diligence to see if an adjustment in price is warranted," Mr. Kushner said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem. "I can tell you that I believe it's not done."
Even if Mr. Ratner did win the auction and get the necessary approval of the National Basketball Association, he would still face some daunting challenges in trying to move the team to Brooklyn. He wants to move the Nets to a $435 million, 19,000-seat glass-walled arena over Long Island Rail Road yards. The arena would be the centerpiece of a $2.5 billion commercial and residential development that would stretch for three blocks along Atlantic Avenue, one ofthe borough's two main thoroughfares.
Mr. Ratner needs the state to condemn the properties not already owned by the railroad, as well as up to $150 million in government funds for streets and rail connections. The project faces stringent environmental reviews and local opposition, much of it from people who moved into what was a rough neighborhood 10 and 20 years ago and made it better.
"He is proposing to knock out a significant portion of Prospect Heights to create Ratnerville," said Patty Hagan, a leader of the Prospect Heights Action Coalition and a 25-year resident. "This neighborhood revived in a gradual, organic way, almost building by building. It's solid. The businesses that risked opening here have grown with the community."
But elsewhere the idea of a professional team moving into Brooklyn is dazzling. Max Stephenson, manager of the nearby Modells sports store at Flatbush and Atlantic, envisions the team in a great crosstown matchup against the Knicks.
"It would be great rivalry," Mr. Stephenson said. "We could have a subway basketball series."
The borough's resurgence mirrors the revival of other areas of the city like parts of the South Bronx and Harlem. But in Brooklyn that transformation seems more pronounced. College graduates now often steer toward Brooklyn instead of Manhattan; chefs at some of Manhattan's finer restaurants regularly open up restaurants across the river, and companies like the Bank of New York are moving large numbers of employees there, signaling the return of the borough as a commercial hub. 
"Over the last 20 years, Brooklyn has crawled along," said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership, who lives in Bay Ridge. "This would catapult us into being a destination location for business."
Many Brooklynites mark the beginning the borough's downward slide to 1957, when Walter O'Malley decided to move the Dodgers to Los Angeles. In the decades that followed, the Navy yard closed. Many of the borough's breweries and printers also shut down or moved. Between 1961 and 1976, 170 major manufacturers left Brooklyn.
Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope were among the first neighborhoods to turn around, benefiting from the resurgence of Lower Manhattan in the 1980's as young people, artists and Wall Street executives renovated brownstones.
The revival spread slowly to other neighborhoods. New businesses and small manufacturers moved into South Brooklyn. Mr. Ratner, who is also planning to build a new headquarters for The New York Times in Manhattan, is completing another big complex in Brooklyn, Metrotech, a seven-million square foot office development.
The Brooklyn Cyclones, a minor league team, recently took up residence at a new ballpark in Coney Island. Now even the Cunard Line wants to bring the Queen Mary II, the first trans-Atlantic liner built in 30 years, to a new passenger terminal at the foot of Atlantic Avenue.
Coincidentally, the Nets would be based at the same site that Walter O'Malley wanted as a new home for the Dodgers before moving the team to California.
"To have a team on the same corner where Walter O'Malley wanted to build a domed stadium would close the sorry chapter on the Dodgers leaving," said Michael Shapiro, author of "The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers and Their Last Pennant Race Together." "It would be enormous."
Over at Borough Hall, Brooklyn's most voluble cheerleader awaits word of a deal.
"I have my fingers cross and my legs crossed," said the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 17, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about reactions in Brooklyn to the possibility that the New Jersey Nets might relocate there misspelled the given name of a leader of the Prospect Heights Action Coalition, who was critical of the proposal to build an arena for the team. She is Patti Hagan, not Patty.

 BODY:
Europe Seeking Approval For Sanctions Against U.S.
The European Union asked the World Trade Organization for permission to impose sanctions on the United States for failing to change a law that the W.T.O. has already ruled an unfair subsidy for American corporations. That law allows American corporations to receive antidumping fines collected from foreign nations by the United States government.
 The Europeans said they would begin retaliating with new duties on United States goods as soon as the W.T.O. approves their petition, a move sure to further heighten trans-Atlantic trade tensions. Page C2. 

Bank of America Profits Increase
Strong mortgage lending and investment banking helped Bank of America increase profits by 4 percent in the fourth quarter. The bank's proposed merger partner, FleetBoston Financial, said its profit nearly tripled in the quarter. The chief financial officer of Bank of America said the bank had $274 million of exposure to Parmalat at the end of 2003. C3.

Manufacturers Are Optimistic
Manufacturing companies are more optimistic than they have been in four years, according to a report by the National Association of Manufacturers, but industry executives predicted that factories would add only a small number of jobs this year. C2.

I.R.S. Ruling Favors Harvard
Harvard University received a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that could make it more attractive for people to leave their money to the school. C2.

Stewart Trial Judge Bars Reporters
A federal judge barred reporters, courtroom artists and others from attending sessions at which prospective jurors would be questioned by lawyers in the trial of Martha Stewart and her former stockbroker. C8.

Profits at Samsung Increase 24%
Samsung Electronics reported that profits rose 24 percent in the fourth quarter as demand for its liquid crystal display screens and flash-memory chips used in digital cameras charged ahead. World Business, Section W.

Daimler Adding to Mitsubishi Stake
DaimlerChrysler will buy an additional 22 percent of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus from Mitsubishi Motors for about 52 billion yen ($489 million). The move will give Mitsubishi Motors, one of the most indebted carmakers in the industry, cash to develop new models. Rolf Eckrodt, left, the president of Mitsubishi Motors, said the decision would help the carmaker focus on its passenger car operations. World Business, Section W.

Dow and S.&P. Gain; Nasdaq Dips
Investors facing strong earnings but tepid revenue outlooks left stocks little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 15.48 points, to 10,553.85, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished up 1.53 points, at 1,132.05. The Nasdaq composite index, however, fell 2.05 points, to 2,109.08. C4.

Retail sales rose 0.5 percent in December, to $325 billion, the Commerce Department said. In another report, the Labor Department said consumer prices edged up 0.2 percent in December, capping a year in which costs, excluding food and energy, rose 1.1 percent, the smallest increase in 43 years.

HEADLINE: Manufacturers Are Optimistic, Though Not on Job Creation 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Manufacturing companies are more optimistic than they have been in four years, according to a report released on Thursday, but industry executives predicted that factories would add only a small number of jobs.
 In an otherwise buoyant report, the National Association of Manufacturers predicted that factories would add 250,000 jobs in the next 12 months -- less than 10 percent of the 2.8 million they cut in the last three years. 
 And even that outlook may be optimistic. Manufacturing companies added barely that many jobs during the previous two economic recoveries, and productivity increases have been so high over the last year that demand for workers could climb more slowly than in the past. 
"To be honest, I am less sure about the employment numbers than I am about anything else in this report," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the association, after releasing the forecast for this year.
Even if the association's outlook turns out to be correct, it would reinforce the view of many economists that unemployment will decline only modestly while the broad economy expands at a robust rate of 4 percent a year or more.
That could be bad news for President Bush. One of his greatest vulnerabilities in the November election campaign is the stubbornly high unemployment rate. 
Though the rate dropped slightly last month, to 5.7 percent, that was mainly because more than 300,000 people stopped looking for work.
Economists estimate that the nation needs to add about 250,000 jobs a month to achieve a significant drop in the unemployment rate. But while service industries like health care and banking have been expanding, that growth has been nowhere near enough to offset the jobs lost in factories. And manufacturers are still shedding jobs, though at a much slower pace than several months ago. 
Mr. Jasinowski predicted that industrial production would expand by 6 percent this year, faster than the economy as a whole, after having declined for more than three years. 
Exports will be propelling much of that growth, in part because the decline in the value of the dollar against the euro and other currencies makes American products cheaper in foreign markets.
Manufacturers are also getting a lift from new spending by businesses, which picked up last summer after being depressed for at least three years. 
Surveys released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve's district banks in New York and Philadelphia showed that various measures of industrial activity increased sharply in the last month. The New York Fed's index of manufacturing activity rose much more than economists had predicted, with companies reporting increases in orders and higher prices for their products. About two-thirds of companies in the New York survey said they expected business to improve in the next six months.
The Philadelphia Fed's index of manufacturing activity rose to its highest level in 10 years, an increase also much larger than economists expected. 
That said, industrial companies continue to be very cautious about hiring people, or even rehiring laid-off workers.
The Philadelphia Fed noted that its index of employment expectations dropped slightly in the last month, with 28 percent of companies in its region expecting to expand their work forces and 13 percent expecting to reduce them. 
Mr. Jasinowski said it was "unlikely" that factories would ever replace more than half of the jobs lost since 2001.
But it may be difficult to recover even that many. Manufacturers replaced about half their lost jobs after the previous two recessions, but the landscape has changed considerably since then.
Productivity has been increasing much faster than before, at an annual rate around 5 percent for the last two years and at a staggering pace of 9.4 percent in the third quarter of 2003. 
On top of that, manufacturers have stepped up their production in China or simply ceded ground to companies that import from Chinese suppliers.

HEADLINE: BANKING GIANT: CUSTOMERS; 
For Credit Card Holders, New Terms and New Complications

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
Another bank merger, another transfer of plastic in your wallet. 
 For many consumers who have witnessed one bank after the other combine, this era of merging and purging is familiar. Now, it is just a matter of time before credit card customers of J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One are sent new cards -- that is, after the companies do market research to determine which one has the stronger brand. 
 However the card is branded, it will most likely come with new terms. 
"Watch your mailbox," said Robert Hammer, a credit card industry consultant. "If you've never read a disclosure before, you'll want to read it now."
The combination of J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One would produce the country's largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, effectively giving 95 million cardholders a new card company and further consolidating consumers' debts among a few big players. 
Card customers of the banks may have to deal with the inconvenience of new account numbers, particularly since Bank One primarily issues Visa cards while J.P. Morgan Chase predominantly offers MasterCard. Under rules set a few years ago by the Justice Department, the combined bank will have to choose to concentrate on one brand or the other, analysts said.
Even so, customers with checking accounts should be able to look forward to a larger network of automated teller machines and a broader choice of other financial products.
In particular, J.P. Morgan Chase's customers in the Northeast will finally be able to find an A.T.M. in the Midwest, and Bank One's customers will have access to a leading mortgage lender. 
But consumer advocates argue that such large banks have the power to charge higher fees and a tendency to share their customers' information with too many affiliates. Merging banks also often seek to cut less profitable businesses, which typically mean branches in poor neighborhoods or services to customers with lower incomes, these advocates said. 
Furthermore, combinations usually bring about mergers among competitors, and consumer advocates say the cycle is gradually eliminating people's financial options.
Once J.P. Morgan Chase acquires Bank One, and once Bank of America completes its acquisition of Fleet Financial, more than 75 percent of the nation's credit card debts will be owed to 10 banks, according to The Nilson Report, a trade publication in Oxnard, Calif. 
"Where are people going to go to find competitive rates?" asked Linda Sherry, editorial director of Consumer Action, an advocacy group in San Francisco. "It's so homogenized that there's no choice out there for consumers. And that's an issue."
For the last six years, Ms. Sherry has directed Consumer Action's annual survey of credit card interest rates, late fees and other service terms. She says the offerings have become more alike as banks have consolidated. "You would think that these banks would want to set themselves apart from their competitors," she said. "But there's a kind of a follow-the-leader mentality." 
Late fees of $35 are a recent example, she said. 
At the same time, consumers are increasingly relying on credit and debit cards, with 2003 representing the first year cards were used more than cash and checks in stores, the American Bankers Association said last month. 
Together, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One will own about $125.1 billion in credit card balances, giving the combined company an 18.9 percent share of the market as of the third quarter of 2003, according to The Nilson Report. That compares with $114.1 billion in balances, or 17.2 percent of the market, owned by Citigroup. 
But those numbers do not include credit cards limited to certain retailers, like Sears or Home Depot. Counting such store cards, particularly its Sears cards, Citigroup would remain the largest card issuer, with $146 billion in balances. 
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, said in an interview, "We would not expect the new institution to lower their prices for consumers, because in many markets, their size will give them overwhelming market power."
After the merger, the combined bank will have 2,300 branches and 6,000 A.T.M.'s across 17 states. Speaking to analysts yesterday morning, William B. Harrison Jr., the chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase, said the combined company did not plan to close any branches unless required to do so by the government.
He also said that each company's history of mergers would virtually ensure a smooth transition. James L. Dimon, the chief executive of Bank One, "and I have been through as many of these as any combined two executives out there," he said. 
Mr. Dimon added that the banking industry's future belonged to large national banks. "The business has been consolidating," he said yesterday. "It will continue consolidating."
Brian W. Smith, a partner at the law firm Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw in Washington and a former general counsel at MasterCard, challenged the assertion that big banks meant worse deals for consumers. He said that new companies could enter various parts of the banking industry fairly easily, making it clear that the business was still competitive.
He gave credit cards as an example, saying that even if J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One will own a leading share of credit card debt, "that doesn't prevent others from issuing cards, nor does it prevent others from offering cards to those consumers." 
Mr. Smith predicted that J.P. Morgan Chase's customers would benefit from Bank One's focus on the retail banking business. "There will now be more emphasis placed through the Chase organization on consumer lending and products, and that will be a good thing," he said. "I think we're going to see a lot of these deals."
Mr. Hammer, chairman of R.K. Hammer Investment Bankers in Thousand Oaks, Calif., tracks the buying and selling of credit card businesses and said that companies had tended to segment the rates and fees of the cards they acquired into tiers. "I'd say the better risk customers -- with better credit scores -- will be well off," he said.
For those with higher-risk scores, he said, "you might see those fees rise."
But on average, according to research by the Federal Reserve and consumer groups like the United States Public Interest Research Group, fees of merged banks usually rise. "As in previous years, many of the fees charged by multistate banks were found to be significantly higher than those charged by single-state banks," according to a Federal Reserve report in June 2003 on banks' consumer fees. 
J.P. Morgan Chase said it was too early to tell how its current credit cards' terms would be affected but that they would certainly be competitive. Prospective customers, meanwhile, may receive less compelling offers, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report. "Right now, they're both offering low-rate offers. Both of them happen to be aggressive acquirers of new accounts," he said. "So there will be an absence of choice there. Having said that, the industry will still be very competitive."

HEADLINE: Masters Of Deception 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It was snowing and the temperature was headed toward single digits when I left the hotel on Park Avenue Wednesday night. A doorman flagged a cab and I climbed in. I'd just finished an interview with Al Gore and it was hard to shake the melancholy feeling that the man who should be president was spending a stormy night in Midtown Manhattan while the momentous world events he should be shaping were careering in all sorts of dangerous directions.
 The former vice president was in town to give a speech on the Bush administration's environmental policies, which he basically described as an exercise in wholesale environmental destruction. Instead of caving in to such special interests as the coal, oil and chemical industries (as the administration has done), Mr. Gore said that the U.S. should be leading the effort to rein in pollution and get control of the potentially devastating problem of global warming. 
 During the interview, he spoke passionately about the environment and opened his laptop computer to give what amounted to a spontaneous seminar on global warming. He noted that most of the glaciers in the world are melting at an alarming rate and added wryly, "Glaciers don't give a damn about politics. They just reflect reality."
The environmental speech, which he delivered at the Beacon Theater on the Upper West Side yesterday afternoon, is the latest in a series of formal critiques of the administration that Mr. Gore has delivered in recent months. Previous subjects have been national security, economic policy and civil liberties.
The theater, including the balcony, was packed. People had waited in a long line in the cold and snow to pass through metal detectors and be allowed in. The crowd, enthusiastic from the very beginning, included families with small children, elderly men and women and students. When Mr. Gore strode onto the stage he was greeted with a long standing ovation.
At one point, he told his audience: "In preparing this series of speeches, I have noticed a troubling pattern that characterizes the Bush-Cheney administration's approach to almost all issues. In almost every policy area, the administration's consistent goal has been to eliminate any constraints on their exercise of raw power, whether by law, regulation, alliance or treaty. And in the process, they have in each case caused America to be seen by the other nations of the world as showing disdain for the international community."
Amid cheers, he made it clear that the broad interests of the American public are consistently betrayed by the policies and practices of President Bush and his administration. "They devise their policies with as much secrecy as possible," he said, "and in close cooperation with the most powerful special interests that have a monetary stake in what happens. In each case, the public interest is not only ignored, but actively undermined. In each case, they devote considerable attention to a clever strategy of deception that appears designed to prevent the American people from discerning what it is they are actually doing.
"Indeed, they often use Orwellian language to disguise their true purposes. For example, a policy that opens national forests to destructive logging of old-growth trees is labeled Healthy Forest Initiative. A policy that vastly increases the amount of pollution that can be dumped into the air is called the Clear Skies Initiative."
Our history has shown that we can and should be better than this. Mr. Gore leaned forward during Wednesday night's interview and ticked off some of the nation's greatest successes -- the simultaneous victories in Europe and the Pacific during World War II, the Marshall Plan, the eradication of polio, the civil rights movement, the space program and the victory over Communism in the cold war. There is no reason to expect less, he said, as the country faces its biggest challenges today.
The fates dealt Mr. Gore and the United States a weird hand in 2000. He got the most votes but the other guy became president. And the country, its Treasury looted and its most pressing needs deliberately ignored, has been rolling backward ever since.
"This is insanity," said Mr. Gore, referring to the administration's handling of the environment. But his speech made it clear that he could just as easily have applied that sentiment to the full range of Bush-Cheney policies. History will not be kind to the chicanery that passes for governing in the Bush II administration.

HEADLINE: Better Times, Harder Politics 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
In theory, the worst kind of budgets for mayors are those with wrenching service cuts, big tax increases and a beggar's purse held open toward Albany and Washington. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has built his mayoralty around taking a tough fiscal stand, may find that better times translate into tougher politics, especially in the year before he begins his re-election bid. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg laid out in his preliminary budget address a plan free of substantial cuts to city services, modest in its request for federal and state aid and including a tax rebate for homeowners. There was even a provision that allows the city to pay upfront rather than borrow for some capital projects. 
 But while New Yorkers over the last two years have been forced to swallow budget cuts and gloomy fiscal talk, it is almost certain that Albany legislators, labor leaders, social policy advocates and others will now come swooping down on the west wing of City Hall, looking for some candy in the budget the mayor is proposing for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Their reasoning will be simple: if the city can afford tax cuts and is sparing almost all city agencies from draconian measures, then it can afford raises for city workers and increases in certain services. At the same time, lawmakers in Albany, who stood with the mayor against Gov. George E. Pataki last year in allowing the city to raise taxes, may well look askance at increasing aid for the city's schools or Medicaid.
 In choosing between a fiscal crisis and a surplus, "The first is harder, but the second is more painful," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. "It is harder to deal with a fiscal crisis; you want to spread the pain and protect the most vulnerable. But having to choose what you do with extra money -- that is more painful, because you end up with everyone who didn't get it hating you."
 Being hated is par for the course for any mayor. But Mr. Bloomberg is likely to face some additional pressure from those who will try to take his job in 2005. 
 It seemed almost impossible that just a year ago, he stood in the same spot in the Blue Room at City Hall at the tail end of a fiscal crisis, sharing details of a budget with substantial pain for all New Yorkers, including firehouse closings, and hinting at the need for more tax increases. 
 Yesterday, the mayor also moved miles from his first budget address, just months after the devastation of 9/11 and in the midst of a sinking economy, in which he said: "The budget that we're going to show you hurts everybody. It is a 'spread your pain, no sacred cow' kind of a solution to our problem."
 Besides a $400 tax rebate for typical homeowners, yesterday's budget identified plenty of the sacred cows disdained in his first two years in office. In an extraordinary move for a preliminary budget, there were very few cuts to cultural institutions, libraries or services for the elderly. 
 So notable was Mr. Bloomberg's failure to enumerate cuts that one television reporter begged -- some mayoral aides would argue badgered -- the mayor to lay them on the line. "We're not cutting services," Mr. Bloomberg said. "That's what I tried to show you here. We are arguably increasing services by $381 million."
 On one hand, the mayor and City Council have budgeted their way toward these better times over the last two years, and have been aided by rising tax revenues and a slight increase in employment in the region. But Mr. Bloomberg has also clearly decided that he would rather try to please as many constituents as possible than substantially restructure the city's budget for the long term or truly rein in spending. 
 But no sooner did the mayor end his hourlong budget address than the critics began to rally, looking for their own bit of good news in the status quo numbers the mayor laid out. Those representing all sorts of New Yorkers -- rent payers, straphangers, the homeless, students, children, the elderly and more -- immediately criticized the mayor's plan, especially the tax rebate.
 "It's wrong for Mayor Bloomberg to ask that city subway and bus riders pay the bill for balancing the city budget and providing a tax cut," said Gene Russianoff, the lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group, referring to the city's plan to get the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to take over private bus lines.
 Rose Anello, a spokeswoman for the Citizens' Committee for Children, said, "We're concerned that the tax rebate might have been premature." 
 Council members gathered before the mayor even gave his address, denouncing it. And afterward, Speaker Gifford Miller released a statement saying the budget ought to have some savings for renters, and not just for homeowners. 
 Although Mr. Bloomberg took a much more measured tone with labor leaders and offered a softened version of productivity requirements needed to gain raises in the current contract negotiations, his rosier budget picture did not go unnoticed by those leaders. "Today's New York City police officers have been the most productive in history," said Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. "We look forward to negotiating an equitable contract with a city that recognizes these facts and is willing to pay officers a professional salary more in line with what other police make everywhere else." 
The mayor may also antagonize legislators, whom he needs to approve his unusual tax rebate package, and from whom he seeks school aid, a takeover of certain Medicaid bills and pieces of legislation that would save the city more money.
Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that anyone who thinks the city has deep pockets now is mistaken, a notion echoed later by aides. "We need to restrain spending, or we are going to bring about the same problems that we have had in years past," said his press secretary, Edward Skyler. 
 Still, Mr. Skyler went on, "Budgeting is always a challenge and every year presents different challenges, but I don't think he would trade his hand this year for his hand from either of the last two years."

HEADLINE: Protesters Chant and Boo As Bush Honors Dr. King 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
President Bush made a swing through the South on Thursday with an appeal to black voters, but encountered emotional protests when he stopped here to lay a wreath at the grave of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 Mr. Bush was met by hundreds of demonstrators when he arrived at The King Center to mark the 75th anniversary of Dr. King's birth. He was shielded from their view by a row of transit-authority buses with police officers in riot gear atop them, according to the pool reporter who accompanied the president into the center. 
 But the chants and boos of the protesters were audible as Mr. Bush, accompanied by Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and his sister, Christine King Farris, approached the crypt, laid the wreath and paused briefly in prayer before leaving without making any public remarks.
Outside, the protesters chanted "Bush go home" and "Peace, not war." 
Before Mr. Bush's arrival for the 15-minute stop, some of the protesters broke through barriers around the center. Two arrests were made, the Atlanta police said, and the incident prompted the authorities to place the buses between the demonstrators and the president.
The White House had arranged for Mr. Bush to stop at Dr. King's grave on a day when the president was scheduled to be in Atlanta for a fund-raiser. Sheriee Bowman, a spokeswoman for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said the group respected the president's right to pay tribute to Dr. King. But she suggested that the civil rights organization saw Mr. Bush's presence as politically motivated.
"We question the integrity of the timing of the move because last year at this time he took a stand against affirmative action, the Michigan case, which is part of Dr. King's legacy," Ms. Bowman said, referring to the Supreme Court case that considered the use of race in college admissions.
Scott McClellan, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said before Mr. Bush's arrival here that the visit was intended as a tribute to Dr. King.
"Dr. King had a tremendously positive influence in shaping the world we live in today for the better, and this is a way to honor a lifetime dedicated to fighting for opportunity and equal justice for all people," Mr. McClellan said.
The protests came during a one-day trip by Mr. Bush to Louisiana and Georgia. He also made an appearance at a predominantly black church in New Orleans and held two fund-raisers, one in New Orleans and one in Atlanta, which brought in $2.3 million for his re-election campaign.
Mr. Bush's effort to reach out to black voters reflected a belief among his political advisers that his electoral standing in the Southwas so strong among his conservative base that he had an opportunity to broaden his support.
To highlight the inroads he has already made, he arranged to be introduced at his fund-raiser here on Thursday evening by Senator Zell Miller of Georgia, a Democrat who called Mr. Bush a president with "a good heart and a spine of steel." Also on hand to throw their support to the Bush-Cheney ticket were other prominent Georgia Democrats, including Griffin Bell, who was attorney general under President Jimmy Carter.
Black voters are among the Democratic Party's most loyal, and only about 8 percent of them voted for Mr. Bush in 2000. But Mr. Bush has made repeated efforts to build his support among African-Americans. Often, as he did at the Union Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in New Orleans on Thursday, he seeks to do so by appearing with black religious leaders and at black churches to promote his efforts to direct more federal money to religion-based social welfare programs.
"Dr. King understood that faith is power greater than all others," Mr. Bush said, noting that Dr. King had preached from the same pulpit in 1961.
Mr. Bush spoke about the power of faith to change lives in personal terms at the church. At a discussion with members of the church and community leaders, Mr. Bush recounted his decision to stop drinking. "I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't ask for Christ's help in my heart," he said.
Later, during his speech in the church, there were repeated murmurs and shouts of assent and approval from the largely black audience as Mr. Bush discussed harnessing the power of religion and the resources of churches, synagogues and mosques to help people in need.
"This country must not fear the influence of faith in the future of this country," Mr. Bush said. "We must welcome faith in order to make America a better place. "
But Mr. Bush clearly has an uphill battle to win broad support among minority voters, especially with the economy still slow to create jobs and unemployment rates among black workers remaining much higher than among whites.
"Bush was not invited," said Lance Grimes, 55, a black social worker who lives in Decatur, Ga., and was part of the demonstration at The King Center. "It is a desecration for him to lay a wreath at the tomb of Dr. King. He is diametrically opposed to everything Dr. King stood for. With all due respect, Coretta Scott King is making a tactical mistake."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Park Slope Walk-Up Revival May Signal New Rental Era

BYLINE:  By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
The four-story walk-up is a form of housing not often produced in New York City any longer. But two new side-by-side walk-ups in Park Slope, Brooklyn, may lead the way to resurrecting it for rental housing designed for moderate-income tenants throughout the city.
 The developer is CPC Resources, the development arm of the Community Preservation Corporation, a lending consortium of banks and insurance companies best known as the mortgage lender for rehabilitations of older apartments in upper Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. The Park Slope buildings, each with eight apartments, are nearing completion on 16th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. 
 "We're trying to see if it's possible to build small multifamily buildings on vacant lots around the city that are economical to build, efficient from a zoning point of view, and affordable to a moderate-income population," said Michael D. Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation and CPC Resources. 
 To do that in producing a prototype in Park Slope, CPC Resources set itself the task of holding construction costs to $100 a square foot, Mr. Lappin said. That goal would have been met, he said, except that during construction a decision was made to take advantage of market conditions and sell the apartments as condominiums. To meet expectations of condominium buyers, more money had to be spent on interior finishes than was originally anticipated.
 The 16 apartments, when theygo on the market through the Corcoran Group, are expected to sell for about $400 a square foot. That translates to $280,000 for a 700-square-foot one-bedroom condominium. Pure construction costs turned out to be about $118 a square foot.
 If sales go well, the project will have turned out to be highly profitable, despite the additional development costs involved, which include architectural, legal, marketing and other professional services; taxes; and interest on acquisition and construction loans.
 The architect who was given the task of designing a low-cost multifamily building was Carmi Bee, a partner in the firm of RKT&B Architects. The most distinctive characteristic is each building's glass-enclosed external scissors staircase in front, taking residents to landings on which two floor-through apartments are entered on each floor. There are duplex apartments at the top with sloped ceilings running to 18 feet in height, sometimes a feature of loft conversions but not usually seen in new walk-up housing. The absence of elevators or parking facilities on the property also contribute to the efficient use of floor area, holding down costs per square foot of usable, or salable, space.
 According to John West III, CPC Resources' senior vice president for design, future projects will be built without full cellars, which on 16th Street provide some common space for workout equipment or other recreational uses. Future projects will also have less-expensive roofing and a different arrangement of plumbing risers, which will lower costs.
 Three years ago CPC Resources formed a private equity fund for institutional investors to underwrite its ventures. The fund will be the financial beneficiary in the Park Slope project, and is expected to participate in future ventures in walk-up construction. "We could use this building model anywhere where the zoning permits," Mr. Lappin said, "but we won't do it in prime locations."
 Profits from the sale of the apartments will be applied to investment in later projects, geared for the low-income rental market. These projects will normally use the federal tax-credit program, which generates equity capital for lower-income rentals by providing tax advantages to investors.
 CPC Resources is already working with city housing officials and East Brooklyn Churches, a nonprofit housing developer for the moderate-income market, to develop its walk-up multifamily model on sites in East New York and Bedford-Stuyvesant, said Kathleen Dunn, executive vice president for development. "We could be doing about 200 units there," she said.
 In the Bronx the plan is to acquire sites and do much of the predevelopment work in-house, perhaps entering later into agreements with nonprofit producers and managers as well as private owner-builders, Ms. Dunn said.

HEADLINE: Hospital Under Strain Faces Doubts On Solvency 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
The wrongful death allegations made by a wealthy real estate family this week against Westchester Medical Center come as the hospital is reeling from a financial crisis that has raised questions about its long-term solvency.
 The hospital, the premier health-care provider in the Hudson Valley, has laid off hundreds of employees and struggled to address a ballooning deficit, now estimated at $100 million. Just this week, hospital administrators and state health officials met to discuss ways to avert fiscal disaster. 
 What the hospital, in Valhalla, N.Y., did not need at this moment, then, was news of a planned lawsuit by a high-profile family charging that the staff mishandled the pain medication and monitoring of a 12-year-old boy last January, resulting in his death. The boy, Michael T. Fisher, a seventh grader at Horace Mann School and a member of the Fisher Brothers real estate dynasty, died on the morning of Jan. 17. 
 But county officials said yesterday that while the development was tragic for the family and certainly unfortunate for the hospital, it would not affect the strategy to right its finances.
 "It doesn't come at a great time," said Michael B. Kaplowitz, chairman of the budget and appropriations committee of the Westchester County Board of Legislators. "But unfortunately over the course of a year there are going to be claims made against the hospital, given the size of the institution."
 He added that the publicity surrounding the case would not affect efforts to stabilize the medical center's finances. In 1998, the hospital spun off from the county government and became a public benefit corporation, but the county still guarantees a large amount of the hospital's debt.
 "For those of us who are policy makers, this does not take our eye off the ball," said Mr. Kaplowitz, "which is that we have to focus on the short- and long-term viability of the medical center."
 In a strange twist, the medical center argues that Michael Fisher's mother, Elissa Fisher, 40, of Armonk, who is a registered nurse, actually prevented the hospital staff from conducting routine tests and monitoring her son during his stay. The case is now under investigation by the New York State Department of Health.
 In a statement issued Wednesday night, a lawyer for the hospital, John J. Corgan, referred to "substantial, extraordinary parental interference that severely impeded the medical staff's ability to do their jobs."
 John Q. Kelly, a lawyer for the boy's estate, disputed that account, calling it "absolutely outrageous." He said a device that measures oxygen levels in the blood, called a pulse oximeter, was "never brought into the room" and that the boy was "never monitored."
 But yesterday, Mr. Corgan asserted that the oximeter "was in the room, it was fully functional and it was in use to the extent that the family would permit." 
 According to the New York State Department of Health, health-care providers are allowed to administer care to a minor without consent of a parent if the doctor determines that the condition is life threatening. 
 The hospital is no stranger to wrongful death charges. In 2000, a 6-year-old boy died after being hit in the head by an airborne metal oxygen tank during a magnetic resonance imaging test. But the hospital quickly admitted its error and was fined by the state. Last summer, an obese 27-year-old patient with multiple health problems died while waiting in the emergency room, and the state recently cited the hospital for several deficiencies in delaying his treatment.
 But until the accusation by the Fisher family on Wednesday, the hospital's public relations staff had been responding to a drumbeat of bleak financial data. Last week, two credit-rating agencies downgraded one of the medical center's two bond ratings, to a level just above junk. 
 For its part, the hospital says that its quality of care has actually improved over the years. In December, the medical center received a score of 94, its highest ever, from the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, which rates hospitals for overall quality of care and patient safety.
 "Undoubtedly these are serious issues," said a medical center spokeswoman, Carin Grossman, of the fiscal problems and malpractice charge, "but over the past decade we've established a reputation for high quality medical care in things like liver transplant and complex heart surgeries."
 She added that the medical center performed more kidney transplants than any other hospital in New York State and that it had one of the only burn centers between New York City and the Canadian border.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
For Belichick, An Economy Of Thought

BYLINE:  By PETE THAMEL; Judy Battista, in Foxboro, Mass., contributed to this article.

DATELINE: FOXBORO, Mass. 

 BODY:
Wesleyan University economics professor Richard Miller received a handwritten note a few years ago from one of his former students. 
 A shaggy-haired football player named Bill Belichick took classes with Miller in the early 1970's and kept in touch after he chose football coaching over the financial world. 
 In the note, Belichick, then head coach of the Cleveland Browns, said he used many of the economic principles he learned at Wesleyan to keep the Browns under the N.F.L.'s salary cap. 
"He used incremental analysis," Miller said of an approach that is taught in almost every economics course on the Middletown, Conn., campus. 
As Belichick's current team, the New England Patriots, stands one game from reaching its second Super Bowl in three years, his name and the words "coaching genius" increasingly appear together. 
There is more to Belichick, however, than his image as an X's and O's savant. 
He is, at heart, an academic. 
Raised in the shadows of the United States Naval Academy, where his father was a football coach, Belichick went on to attend Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., the prep school of President Bush and his father. 
He graduated from Wesleyan with an economics degree. That education, at two of the country's most elite schools, helped lay the foundation for Belichick's emergence today as one of the best theorists in the N.F.L.
"That was a common thread at Andover and Wesleyan, both those schools, they taught me how to think, how to solve problems," Belichick said. 
The football education began in his childhood home in Annapolis, Md., the home of his father, Steve Belichick, who played fullback for the Detroit Lions for one season and coached at Navy for 33 years. 
Game film flickered on walls as after-dinner entertainment, and the bookshelves overflowed with tomes on football theory and strategy. 
Bill Belichick virtually grew up at the Academy, idolizing Navy players like Roger Staubach and Joe Bellino, both of whom won the Heisman Trophy. 
He spent muggy summer nights on the porch listening to Steve Belichick talk about football with assistants and fall afternoons accompanying his father on scouting trips. 
"When the other coaches were around, he didn't ask a lot of questions," said Jeannette Belichick, Bill's mother. "They liked having him around because he wasn't a pest. He was very, very good at listening and learning and remembering." 
When it came time to choose a college after high school, Belichick remembered his father telling Navy football recruits that they would be better off with an additional year of prep school. Preparation is not just one of Belichick's football buzzwords; it is a family trait. 
So in 1970, Belichick attended Phillips Academy for one year, leaving his conservative surroundings in Annapolis for the liberal prep school in northeastern Massachusetts. 
He arrived with his hair long, the proud owner of nearly every Beatles album.
The campus during the 1970-71 school year provided a distinct change for Belichick. 
He entered a place where the Doors and Iron Butterfly blared out of dorm room windows, Vietnam protests sprang up, and many students smoked marijuana. 
"Bill was not rebellious; he was not a flower child," said Stratis Falangas, one of Belichick's classmates and teammates. "He was more diligent and very reflective."
Belichick, who scored more than 1,400 points on his Scholastic Aptitude Test, played center on the undefeated football team and attack on the 13-1 lacrosse team. 
His slight build earned him the nickname "Weak Link" on the offensive line, but he understood the blocking schemes so well that, after the huddle broke, players like Falangas would ask Belichick to remind them of their assignments. 
Looking back, Belichick said that prep school meant more than making friends and snapping for punts. 
"The appreciation I got is how talented people are in areas -- music, art, language -- that I never even gave a second thought to," Belichick said.
As a reserve defensive end at Wesleyan in the fall of 1974, Belichick never stopped asking questions like "What if the offense did that?" and "Whose responsibility is that?"
Undersized, shuffled from position to position and often injured, Belichick made curiosity his hallmark. 
"What I remember so vividly is how interested he was in the technical aspect of his position," said John Biddiscombe, then Belichick's position coach and now the university's athletic director.
Belichick long snapped and played offensive and defensive line, but his career was so anonymous that the school does not even have a picture of him on the field. 
He served as the lacrosse team co-captain his senior year, dabbled in squash and was president of his fraternity. But Belichick said Wesleyan's true value came through in the classroom. 
"You learn how to think and solve problems," Belichick said. "Here's the problem, you go figure it out."
That is exactly what Belichick did after college when he caught on as a volunteer assistant for the Baltimore Colts in 1975. Breaking down film and doing odd jobs, Belichick's salary jumped from no pay to $25 a week to $50 a week by the end of the season. 
"You could see immediately Billy was a hard-working kid," said Ted Marchibroda, then the Colts' coach.
"One of those guys that once you gave a job to do, you didn't see him until it was over."
Belichick moved on to assistant jobs in Detroit and Denver before landing with the Giants in 1979, where he stayed 12 years. After serving as defensive coordinator for two Super Bowl victories, Belichick won the head coaching job in Cleveland. He was fired in 1995 after four losing seasons in five years. 
The N.F.L. also fundamentally changed in 1993 with the introduction of the salary cap and free agency. Winning became as much about off-the-field strategy as on. When Belichick landed in New England in 1996 as defensive coordinator, he impressed the owner, Bob Kraft, with his understanding of that sea change. 
"He knew the players," Kraft said. "He would say, 'We should sign this guy,' players who are maybe in that mid range. It was clear to me that he had a system, an outlook that was different."
Richard Miller, the economics professor, still gets handwritten notes from Belichick, and when he watches games, he wears the Patriots hat that Belichick sent him. 
Twice last semester, Miller said he thought of Belichick and his Wesleyan background. The first moment came when Belichick cut the popular All-Pro safety Lawyer Milloy. 
The move shocked much of New England, but Miller understood. 
"It was simple cost-benefit analysis," Miller said. "He learned that in economics."
Soon after, Miller was lecturing 100 freshman in an Introductory Economics 101 class and mentioned how his former student, Belichick, used economics to stay under the salary cap. 
After class, a young Andover graduate approached Miller and introduced herself as Amanda. 
"Bill," she said, "is my dad."

HEADLINE: A Proposal for Few Cuts, No Layoffs and Even a Tax Rebate 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
For the first time since he was elected, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was able to propose a budget yesterday that called for few cuts, no layoffs, only a modest amount of aid from Albany and Washingtonand a property tax rebate for most homeowners. It was a far cry from the gloom and doom budgets he has proposed before. 
 The $2 billion gap that Mr. Bloomberg must close in the fiscal year that begins July 1 is only a fraction of the size of the deficits he has had to wrestle down since he took office, and he presented a plan to do so without any of the deeply unpopular measures, from firehouse closings to tax increases, that he has called for before. His plan does not include the kind of expensive, showcase programs that mayors sometimes propose to leave their mark on the city. While Mayor Bloomberg found money to put in the budget to hire a new class of police cadets, keep garbage pickup at its current level and restore planned cuts to cultural institutions, he warned that the rising cost of Medicaid, debt service and pensions would saddle the city with more deficits in 2006 and 2007. 
 "We're a little bit over the hump, but we're certainly not back to the kinds of boom times that would let us expand everything," Mr. Bloomberg said in his budget address at City Hall.
 Mayor Bloomberg, a Republican who angered many in his party and the city by raising the property tax, the sales tax and the income tax over the last two years, said he was optimistic enough about the city's fiscal future to plan to turn his proposal to give a $400 property tax rebate to most city homeowners into an annual event.
 Because of the cuts he made, the taxes he raised and the economic upturn, the mayor said the city was on course to end the current fiscal year with a $1.4 billion surplus. He said he planned to divide that in two to help plug gaps in this budget proposal and the one for the year after that.
 He acknowledged, however, that there were still risks to the city's fiscal health. 
 The city and state are battling in court over a plan in this year's budget to save the city $500 million a year in the final payments for its debt from the 1970's. The mayor included no money in this year's budget for raises for municipal unions, which are working without contracts; he said any increases would have to be offset by other savings. The state is facing a deficit that the governor's office said yesterday was still $5.1 billion. That could lead state lawmakers to cut, not raise, city aid.
 Union leaders complained that if there is enough money for surpluses and tax rebates, there should be enough money to give their members raises, but some did say they were pleased that the mayor was no longer counting on $600 million in savings from union concessions to balance the budget, as he asked for last year.
 "Once we couldn't reach a deal last May, I think everybody realized that there had to be a different strategy on all sides with respect to both bargaining and budgeting," said Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, which coordinates bargaining for municipal unions.
 The $45.7 billion spending plan that Mayor Bloomberg outlined yesterday seeks to balance the optimism born of the economic recovery and higher tax revenues with the caution that comes from the fact that the city still has a structural deficit, and expenses are still set to exceed revenues in the long term.
 It was a very different kind of budget from the bitter-medicine, bottom-line plans that the mayor put forward during his first two years in office, which left his popularity in tatters. The mayor, who faces re-election in 2005, spoke in a very different tone yesterday in presenting the budget. 
 "Budgets are not really, if you come down to it, about money," he said yesterday. "They are about people; they are about making choices; they are about sharing and sacrifice and being in this together and taking care of each other."
 Analysts said the plan showed just how far the city has come from what some were calling a crisis just two years ago, but they differed about the mayor's approach.
 "The city now has the types of gaps and budget problems that need to be dealt with, but which are manageable," said Jeffrey L. Sommer, the executive director of the New York State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city budget.
 Some analysts said it was premature to offer the tax rebate. The rebate will cost the city $250 million, a small portion of the property tax increase it passed in 2002, but the proposal is structured so that it will essentially eliminate the rate increase for homeowners while leaving it in place for landlords and the owners of commercial properties. 
 "This year's surplus is a far cry from last year's $6 billion gap, but all the risks out there make it premature to start doing tax rebates, as small as this one is," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed group.
 Others said that they would like to see more spending cuts. Edmund J. McMahon Jr., a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative organization, praised the mayor for cutting taxes for homeowners but said he would like to see more cuts. "He's kind of like someone who's gone halfway through the Atkins diet, and is now going onto maintenance because he's tired of eating so much bacon," he said. 
 Still others expressed concern that the plan still included cuts to children's services and other areas.
 Over all, Mr. Bloomberg's plan to close next year's gap calls for using $700 million of this year's surplus, seeking $700 million in aid from Albany and Washington, and using $526 million in additional tax revenues that it now expects to collect. 
 While the plan calls for saving $324 million in agency spending - by cutting some services, raising fees (like charging $2 for haircuts for prisoners), or finding alternate sources of money - it also calls for $381 million in new spending for 2005.
 Some of the new spending will be at the Department of Transportation, which is trying to improve Staten Island Ferry service after the crash that killed 11. The budget calls for stepping up random drug testing on the ferry, hiring more legal staff to assist with liability lawsuits, adding ferry security training, installing a public address system on some boats, and hiring a temporary replacement crew to fill in while some crew members are out on sick leave or called to make depositions. 
 Mayor Bloomberg, who is sometimes known for candor that is uncharacteristic in politicians, offered an unusual description of the city's fiscal obligations yesterday.
 "The law says you balance the budget with no shenanigans whatsoever, or at least, very few shenanigans," he said.

HEADLINE: Improving Economy Is Complicating City's Bid for Aid From the State 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The city's improving fiscal picture is already complicating Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's efforts to get millions of dollars in aid from Albany, where Gov. George E. Pataki and state lawmakers are trying to dig out of their own financial mess.
 State lawmakers said on Thursday that they were happy that the city was no longer facing cuts in services and higher taxes. But they said coming to them for help when the mayor was planning property tax rebates for homeowners was awkward. 
 "I think the problem the mayor is going to have is, you can't declare things to be rosy and everything is fine but say to the state, 'Give us another $400 million, whatever,' " said Senator Dale M. Volker, a Republican from western New York. "That is not going to be easy to sell."
Some in Albany said permission for the mayor's tax rebate plan would ultimately pass in Albany, where lawmakers from the city, who are facing re-election, also want some credit for cutting taxes -- especially after they permitted the city to raise some of them on city residents last year. The question is whether they can be as generous with other mayoral requests.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan who supports the rebate plan, has suggested that the mayor consider lowering tax rates locally or choosing for cuts other taxes raised last year, such as sales or income taxes.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, an upstate Republican, has also weighed in on what the city should do. In the context of a battle over how to fix the city's schools, he has questioned whether the city was contributing enough money to educate its own students. 
But even as he tried to paint a rosier outlook, giving cash to homeowners who shouldered much of the city's fiscal bailout in 2003, the mayor argued that the state should give the city budget relief and help pay for a new school program.
The mayor pointed out that the city had a higher local tax burden than the state average and that the city paid $2.6 billion a year more in state taxes than it got back in state spending on the city.
"We are not only paying our own way, we are paying expenses for many other programs that the state runs outside New York City," said William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director. He said the $250 million cost of the tax rebate would take no money from anyone outside the city.
Some in Albany said the mayor's Albany request, because it was so small, would not be a heavy lift. Consequently, Mr. Bloomberg may wind up getting much of his $400 million aid request. That is much less than the $2.7 billion he asked for last year. 
It also helps that, on Thursday, he gave Albany a menu of $937 million worth of options to choose from, including $495 million in Medicaid relief, a concept Governor Pataki generally supports.
The mayor was also pragmatic in not assuming any state aid for city schools' operating costs to satisfy a court order to provide New York City students a "sound basic education," especially after the governor and Mr. Bruno said more money was not the only solution. But he did ask Albany to float bonds to pay for $6.5 billion of his $13.1 billion schools capital construction plan to upgrade, build and maintain school buildings over the next five years.
By arguing that, "the needs of the city school system are so great, the city's fiscal capacity is limited and the state's building aid formula has historically shortchanged city schools," Mr. Bloomberg seemed to be increasing pressure on Albany. At the same time, he is trying to wrest Medicaid relief from the state and is fighting in court for a plan to have the state pay back the city's remaining debt from its 1970's fiscal crisis -- all big-ticket items that suburban and upstate legislators are not naturally inclined to support.
Mr. Bloomberg's timing, however, might be better this year than last: the governor is expected to report next week that the state's budget plight is not as bad as had been expected, because of rising revenues for the improving economy that is also boosting the city's budget.
Aides to the governor said on Thursday that the anticipated state budget shortfall for the fiscal year that starts on April 1 would be about $5.1 billion, about a billion less than they had originally anticipated, though still formidable.
In the end, Mr. Silver said: "Obviously when the mayor comes out with a statement that he is providing tax rebates, which I support fully, it makes our job more difficult to achieve that aid for the city of New York. I just hope the financial picture that he paints does not hinder us in advocating for the city."

"Abundance"
Dance Theater Workshop
219 West 19th Street, Chelsea
 Marty Pottenger probably didn't intend his one-act play to leave the impression that the rich are more interesting than you and me, but it does. 
 According to the program notes, Mr. Pottenger interviewed more than 30 minimum-wage American workers and 30 multimillionaires to guide him in this comment on economic inequity and its consequences. But it's only when his creation Laz (Joe Gioco), a 91-year-old near-billionaire businessman, rolls onto center stage in his wheelchair that the play crackles with energy.
"Got rid of the Impressionists years ago," Laz says as he shows off some of the art he's selling. "All those irritating dots and pastels." 
When Laz isn't around, "Abundance" takes the form of choreographed movement -- what seems to be group therapy meetings about money -- and "word arias," performed by five actors playing multiple roles, calling outfast facts about the economy or themselves.
The cast does fine, but the "word aria" form can be tiresome. Mr. Pottenger does make some excellent points. It's startling to hear how sharply American gas consumption would drop if the average fuel efficiency of S.U.V.'s increased by just three miles a gallon. It's important, but it's awfully dogmatic theater.
This play, directed by Mr. Pottenger and Steve Bailey, continues through next Saturday. ANITA GATES

Greeting Big Brother With Open Arms

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN

 BODY:
For 50 years, Big Brother was an unambiguous symbol of malignant state power, totalitarianism's all-seeing eye. Then Big Brother became a hip reality television show, in which 10 cohabiting strangers submitted to round-the-clock camera monitoring in return for the chance to compete for $500,000. 
 That transformation is telling, says Mark Andrejevic, a professor of communication studies at the University of Iowa at Iowa City. Today, more than twice as many young people apply to MTV's "Real World" show than to Harvard, he says. Clearly, to a post-cold-war generation of Americans, the prospect of living under surveillance is no longer scary but cool. 
 Media critics have frequently portrayed the reality show craze in unflattering terms, as a sign of base voyeurism (on the part of viewers) and an unseemly obsession with fame (on the part of participants). But Mr. Andrejevic's take, influenced by the theories of Theodor Adorno and Michel Foucault, is at once darker and more subtle.
Reality shows glamorize surveillance, he writes, presenting it "as one of the hip attributes of the contemporary world," "an entree into the world of wealth and celebrity" and even a moral good. His new book, "Reality TV: The Work of Being Watched" (Rowman & Littlefield), is peppered with quotes from veterans of "The Real World," "Road Rules" and "Temptation Island," rhapsodizing about on-air personal growth and the therapeutic value of being constantly watched. As Josh on "Big Brother" explains, "Everyone should have an audience." 
At the same time, Mr. Andrejevic (pronounced an-DRAY-uh-vitch) argues, the reality genre appears to fulfill the democratic promise of the emerging interactive economy, turning passive cultural consumers into active ones who can star on shows or vote on their outcomes. (The series "Extreme Makeover" takes this promise literally, he notes, "offering to rebuild 'real' people via plastic surgery so that they can physically close the gap between themselves and the contrived aesthetic of celebrity they have been taught to revere.") 
As seductive as this sounds, in Mr. Andrejevic's view reality television is essentially a scam: propaganda for a new business model that only pretends to give consumers more control while in fact subjecting them to increasingly sophisticated forms of monitoring and manipulation. 
As he put it in a telephone interview: "The promise out there is that everybody can have their own TV show. But of course, that ends up being a kind of Ponzi scheme. You can't have everybody watching everybody else's TV show. And since that's not possible, in economic terms, the way it's going to work is according to this model of a few people monitoring what the rest of us do." 
Think of TiVo or Replay, he said. These digital recorders allow people to watch the television shows they want when they want to. But in return, he points out, the recorders' manufacturers get a stream of valuable information about viewer preferences. The same principle, he argues, holds true for online shops that offer custom CD's in exchange for data on personal musical tastes. Or Web sites that use "cookies" to track users' movements on the Internet. 
Marketers aren't interested in exceptional behavior, he added. They want to know about the routine aspects of daily life, the same material that shows like "The Real World" and "Big Brother" -- in which banality passes as authenticity -- strive to capture on film. 
In short, Mr. Andrejevic said, reality television's true beneficiaries are not the shows' cast members (who can windup making little more than minimum wage for the hours -- or months -- they spend before the camera) or ordinary viewers (who don't really choose what happens on their television screens) but the marketers, advertisers and corporate executives who have a large stake in seeing surveillance portrayed as benign. 
Of course, he conceded, his students don't necessarily see it this way. Raised on Web logs, Google, cellphones and instant messaging, they "divulge much more information about themselves on a daily basis than previous generations," he said, and they don't associate the idea of surveillance with a totalitarian Big Brother. 
"The concern I have is that self-expression gets confused with the inducement to assist in marketing to yourself," Mr. Andrejevic said. "But my students say they've got nothing to hide. And until there are some consequences they perceive as detrimental, they're not going to be concerned." 
At least in one respect, he added, reality television does conform to real life. "It portrays the reality of contrivance, the way consumers are manipulated," he said. "I look at it with the fascination of somebody watching a car wreck."

HEADLINE: BELIEFS; 
Of Talmudic Texts and Tomato Plants

BYLINE:  By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
All this week, Aaron Levy, who hopes to be ordained an Orthodox rabbi this spring, has been poring over Talmudic texts when not fighting arctic winds and slushy intersections in Manhattan. Last week, he was toiling under a hot sun in El Salvador, tilling fields for tomato plants and clearing weeds around small papaya trees. 
 Mr. Levy was one of 26 rabbinical students who spent a week working and dining with Salvadoran campesinos in Ciudad Romero, a village founded by families that had been refugees in Panama in the years of struggles among El Salvador's government and army, left-wing rebels and right-wing death squads. 
 'As much as I've read about life in the developing world,' Mr. Levy said, 'it's different to see the scope of poverty firsthand but also to recognize the connectedness of all our lives through U.S. foreign policy, economics and trade policy.' 
 For Anne Brenner, who is studying for the rabbinate at the Reform movement's Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Los Angeles, the week in El Salvador was 'such an inspiring and amazing experience' an integration, she said, of spirituality, environmental concerns, learning through service and physical labor for others. 
 'It felt very seamless,' Ms. Brenner said, 'the prayer and the work.' She recalled the phrase that Rabbi Abraham Heschel used at the time of the civil rights march in Selma, Ala.: 'I felt my feet were praying.'
 The cultural encounters on this trip were not only between hard-pressed survivors of Central American war and poverty and young men and women studying to become Jewish leaders in the United States. The students came from all four branches of contemporary Judaism Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist branches that can sometimes seem as far apart as New York and Ciudad Romero.
 Because the Orthodox students observe traditional requirements of separating men and women during prayers, for example, and of saying a fuller set of traditionally prescribed prayers, they could not participate directly in the morning prayer services conducted by students from the other branches of Judaism.
 'I could pray nearby,' Mr. Levy noted, 'and observe and learn from them.' 
 On each day, a group from one seminary would conduct the prayers according to its own practice, and the others 'made their own decisions about what would fulfill their obligations,' said Stephanie Fingeroth, a student at the Conservative Judaism's Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, who organized the trip.
 On the Orthodox students' day, a 'mekhitzah' separated men and women, a symbolic barrier that also sharply divides Orthodox and many non-Orthodox Jews. In this case, most of the non-Orthodox students joined the service, willing to observe the male-female separation. 
 'It was not hard,' Ms. Brenner said, because of 'the generosity that the Orthodox young men had shown' toward the others' forms of Judaism. 
 The rabbinical students' trip to El Salvador was sponsored by the American Jewish World Service, an organization that provides money, technical assistance and volunteers for more than 175 grass-roots development projects in 40 countries. 
 As a staff member at the organization, Ms. Fingeroth had planned and overseen programs that sent Jewish young people to work during semester and summer breaks on projects in Africa and Latin America. 
 After applying to the seminary herself, she conceived of the trip for rabbinical students, she said, as a way of rooting such work more profoundly in Jewish texts and ultimately in the congregations these future rabbis may serve. 
 Besides field work, prayer and discussion of texts bearing on 'tikkun olam' the religious mandate of Jews to 'repair the world,' remedying evils and injustices the rabbinical students read materials and shared views on the history and politics of El Salvador and the United States' economic and military roles there, as well as on globalization and international trade policy. 
 Even before embarking on the trip, the delegation began planning ways to ensure that it would have a lasting impact on their thinking and work as Jewish leaders. They are keeping in touch by e-mail and have formed study teams to continue looking at religious, political and economic topics raised by the journey. 
 It is not uncommon to encounter questions about why religious groups should engage in secular activities. After all, there is no specifically Jewish way of clearing weeds around papaya trees, just as there is no specifically Roman Catholic way for Catholic hospitals to perform appendectomies and no specifically Episcopal or Presbyterian way for a church to operate a homeless shelter. 
 Of course, volunteers or professionals from any faith can pursue good works out of religious motivation. Even when working under nonreligious or government auspices, a Presbyterian agronomist or a Catholic nurse or a Jewish relief worker can, and many certainly do, consecrate and fortify their daily efforts with private prayer and reflection. So why have explicitly religious groups conduct such activities under their own auspices? 
 The rabbinical students' trip offers a kind of microcosmic answer to that question. The week provided a depth of collective prayer and reflection that would not have been readily available to scattered individuals, no matter how religious, working in secular settings. It was a visible statement of a Jewish understanding of moral duty and human solidarity. It promised an enrichment of the Jewish community. 
 Indeed, there are numerous secular relief and development organizations, said Ruth Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president who is president and executive director of the American Jewish World Service. But 'we found an important need for Jews to be seen around the world as a people committed to social justice,' Ms. Messinger said. 
 Projects serving non-Jewish communities, she said, helped American Jews interpret tikkun olam in terms of the biblical reminder that the Israelites were 'once strangers in the land of Egypt' and had a duty to other 'strangers.'
 In a pluralist society, most religious people, whether factory workers, teachers, entrepreneurs or government employees, will carry out their callings and fulfill their sense of religious duty within organizations that profess no religious identity. 
 Still, part of that pluralism should be the presence of groups like the American Jewish World Service. With projects like the students' trip, they illuminate the religious significance of what would be considered secular tasks and highlight the challenges those tasks pose both to believers and to their traditions.

HEADLINE: As Exchange Rates Swing, Carmakers Try to Duck 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: MUNICH, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
High up in the Four- Cylinder Building, as BMW's bulbous headquarters tower is informally known, an elite team of technicians is armed with computers, sophisticated financial software and a gut feeling for where the market is headed.
 Not the car market, which is the abiding obsession of everybody else here, but the currency market. 
 BMW's risk management department is responsible for protecting the company, which reaps one-quarter of its $53 billion in annual sales in the United States, from the vagaries of trans-Atlantic exchange rates. At a time when the dollar is plumbing record lows against the euro, that job has become almost as crucial to BMW's financial stability as the popularity of its cars.
 "Our owners and employees prefer to see smooth operating results," said Joachim Herr, the youthful head of the department. "It's our job to help the company deliver those results." 
 By using financial transactions known as hedges -- essentially bets on future moves in exchange rates -- Mr. Herr and his team move some of BMW's exposure to exchange rate swings onto banks and other parties, insulating the company from what can be a nasty roller coaster ride.
 Volkswagen, for example, attributed at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in losses last year to currency swings that it had not hedged against. PSA Peugeot Citroen of France said it might lose 600 million euros ($744 million) this year because of the strong euro.
 European carmakers have been hit especially hard by the rising euro, because they pay for parts and labor in euros to build cars they export to the United States, where customers pay in dollars. As the dollar weakens, manufacturers that have not hedged will get fewer and fewer euros' worth of revenue for each dollar sale. There are two ways they can respond: they can raise the dollar prices of their cars in the United States to compensate for the weaker exchange rate, or they can absorb the difference in the form of lower profits. Neither choice is attractive.
 Porsche tried the first approach in the early 1990's, the last time the dollar swooned. Customers fled, and Porsche nearly wiped out its American franchise.
 Today, Porsche has hedged all its exposure to the dollar through July 2007. That means it can keep its prices steady in the United States without absorbing a huge blow to its euro profits.
 Among German exporters, Porsche's strategy is by far the most conservative. BMW said it had hedged two-thirds of its exposure for this year and one-third for 2005. Volkswagen, after its heavy losses, stepped up its hedging last fall, to 70 percent of its exposure from 30 percent before.
 To execute its strategy, Porsche must buy options in the financial markets to protect itself from every conceivable swing. "How much it costs is one of our biggest secrets," said a spokesman for Porsche, Immo Dehnert. "You don't get it for free."
 For German auto executives, who prefer to talk about turbochargers and torque, currency hedging is something of a black art. They discuss it reluctantly, usually only to explain poor results. In times when the dollar is strong, they often bury currency gains in their operating profits.
 "German carmakers traditionally say, 'We're in the car business, not the currency business,"' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen.
 Mr. Dudenhoffer raised eyebrows here recently with a study meant to dramatize how exchange rates can shake up the global auto industry. He showed that the euro had risen so much against the dollar that it would be cheaper for Germans to buy high-priced German cars in the United States and pay import duties and other costs to have them shipped back to Germany than to buy them at home.
 One example used in the study was Porsche's new Carrera GT sports car, which costs $440,000 in the United States. Converting that into euros at $1.30 each yields a euro price of 338,462. Add 16 percent in taxes and that total rises to 392,615 euros. Getting the car back to Germany might add a few thousand euros.
 The Carrera GT, Porsche's most expensive model, sells for 452,690 euros in Germany. A German buyer could save enough in America to buy one of Porsche's new Cayenne sport utility vehicles as well.
 "Even for a Rolls-Royce owner, 65,000 euros is nice money," Mr. Dudenhoffer said. "You can do something with that."
 Officials of the German carmakers dismissed Mr. Dudenhoffer's study as something of a gimmick. Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz said they had seen no evidence that Germans were reimporting their cars. Porsche said it would build only 1,500 Carrera GTs, which means most buyers are likely to order a customized car, and perhaps even pick it up personally at the assembly plant in Leipzig.
 But while executives dispute Mr. Dudenhoffer's conclusions, they agree that he raises a valid point. The disparity in exchange rates can upset the economics ofthe industry, particularly for the global players.
 That is why auto executives talk a lot about "natural" hedging -- ways to offset the risks of an unfavorable exchange rate without resorting to exotic financial instruments. The simplest way is to build assembly plants in the United States, as BMW and Mercedes-Benz have done.
 BMW produces nearly 160,000 cars a year in Spartanburg, S.C., and 100,000 of them are exported, mostly to Europe. BMW pays dollars for the parts and labor that go into those cars, and sells them for euros or other currencies like British pounds or Swiss francs, so a weak dollar makes the vehicles much more profitable for the company.
 The remaining 60,000 cars from Spartanburg are sold in the United States. BMW's total sales volume in the United States is about 277,000 cars, which means that 217,000 are made in Europe and shipped to America; those cars become less profitable as the dollar weakens. Together, the gains and losses tend to smooth out BMW's overall results, however the exchange rate behaves. 
 DaimlerChrysler plans to expand production at its Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala., in part to take advantage of the weak dollar. Daimler as a whole is less vulnerable to exchange rates than other European manufacturers because of its Chrysler Group, which makes and sells most of its cars in the United States.
 Production decisions, of course, are driven by more than just exchange rates, so for German companies, currency trades are still the most common method of dealing with oscillating dollars and euros.
 The euro's recent surge has put risk managers in a tricky position. Mr. Herr of BMW believes that at $1.25, the euro is overvalued. Using computer models, he estimates the currency's correct long-term value at something closer to $1.10. Based on that estimate, BMW has opted not to hedge heavily in 2005.
 If the dollar stages a rebound, that bet will pay off. If the dollar remains weak until next year, however, BMW will have to take up short-term hedges at less favorable rates. Other carmakers are in similar straits.
 Next year "is looking very scary for all these companies," said Thomas Aney, an auto analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Frankfurt. "They're going into the year with a naked hedge."
 For Mr. Herr, the crucial factors are sound analysis and steady nerves. He said he ignores market rumors in favor of signs that institutions like the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank are shifting their thinking on the interest rates they set.
 "The market has been very sentiment-driven," Mr. Herr said. "But if you look at it, the fundamentals haven't changed."

HEADLINE: Report Shows Consumers Are Optimistic 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rose this month to the highest level in three years, bolstered by the stock market's first annual gains since 1999 and suggestions that the economy is gaining strength, a report released yesterday said.
 The University of Michigan's preliminary measure of consumer sentiment jumped to 103.2 from 92.6 in December. The increase was the largest since November 1992 and exceeded all 53 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. 
 In another report, the Federal Reserve said December factory production rose 0.3 percent, the fourth monthly gain, while total industrial production rose 0.1 percent.
 Rising consumer optimism may help sales, prompting companies to raise equipment spending. More factories said that production was improving than at any time since February 1997, the Fed said. The dollar had its biggest gain against the euro in 10 months after the Treasury Department said foreigners increased holdings of United States assets by $87.6 billion in November, a sign they may view the American economy as a better place to invest.
 "Consumers have a lot going for them right now," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. "The stock market and home prices are rising, interest rates are low, tax refunds are coming and there are signs that the job market is getting better. That's why consumers are confident and that's why consumer spending is probably going to hold up. To the extent that foreign investors are helping hold interest rates low and stock prices high, that's helping the consumer."
 The median forecast for the Michigan sentiment index was for a reading of 94. The current-conditions index, which reflects perceptions of consumers' financial situation and whether it is a good time to make major purchases, climbed from 97 last month to 108.9, the highest since 110.5 in December 2000.
 The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, rose to 99.5 from 89.8. The January reading was the highest since 101.6 in November 2000.
 Total industrial production rose 0.1 percent in December, less than expected. Production was restrained by a drop in utility output, the Fed report showed.
 The increase last month follows a revised 1 percent increase in production at factories, mines and utilities in November, the Fed saidin Washington. The November gain was the biggest since October 1999. The proportion of industrial capacity in use held at 75.8 percent in December.
 Inventories held at a record low relative to sales in November, the Commerce Department reported separately.
 Inventories rose 0.3 percent, while sales rose 0.5 percent. The inventory-to-sales ratio held at 1.35 months, the lowest on record.

HEADLINE: Does Trade Help Or Hurt Workers? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Jan. 14) argues that proponents of international labor rights are naive, because poor people in Cambodia and other developing countries prefer factory jobs to alternative work that is even more exploitative. 
 Mr. Kristof does not say that Cambodia is host to the most successful experiment in linking labor rights to trade agreements. 
Under a trade agreement between Cambodia and the United States, the International Labor Organization monitors Cambodian factories. In return for compliance on labor rights, the United States grants additional trade benefits. The program, which I helped design, is one reason that factory jobs are growing in Cambodia. There is no contradiction between supporting job creation and supporting practical programs to make those jobs less exploitative.

To the Editor:
 Re "Calling All Democrats," by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Jan. 14): 
 The key for equitable development is increasing labor productivity -- not just for a few lucky workers in a couple of enterprises, but for the economy as a whole. And in a country like Cambodia, with a huge rural labor force, that cannot happen without increasing labor productivity in the agricultural sector. No standards for factories imposed from the outside can achieve that.

At 1 Degree, a Metropolis Is Also Frozen in Time

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
Beginning around midnight and lasting for a few fleeting hours, the official temperature of Manhattan dropped to 1 degree. By 4 in the morning, the temperature had doubled -- to 2 -- but that brief 1-degree period granted curious distinction to the day: it tied the record for the coldest Jan. 16 in city history, a mark established in 1893.
 In one sense, this seems the slimmest of connections between days separated by 111 years. In another sense, though, there was odd comfort in knowing that this very cold was felt on this very day in this very city, at a time when a Tammany Hall lackey named Gilroy was mayor, and the economic calamity known as the Panic of 1893 was but months away. 
 This fleeting bond between two eras that bracket the 20th century was explored during a rough circumnavigation of the island of Manhattan in the morning hours when the temperature clung to 1. True, the experience was more often seen than felt, through the salt-encrusted windshield of a black sedan. But that sedan sometimes rocked to the rhythms of gusts, just one of the many ways that nature reiterated its timeless point: that even a great metropolis must give deference.
By 12:30 a.m., ice-sharp winds from the Northwest were dodging the edifices of Midtown to send streetlights swaying like buffeted pinatas, as if to suggest how easily nature can toy with us. It was as good a hint as any to stay indoors, and yet here came a deliveryman on a bicycle, wobbling down Lexington Avenue while on his handlebars he balanced a box containing someone else's pizza.
The gothic building that once housed the Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital loomed over the intersection of First Avenue and 30th Street; though ancient in appearance, it had yet to be built in 1893. A city shelter now, it was providing beds at this moment to several hundred men, a chilling thought made all the colder by the knowledge that behind the building were refrigerated trucks with the unidentified and unclaimed remains of World Trade Center dead.
On First Avenue near 56th Street, a steam pipe jutted like the Cat in the Hat's hat from the middle of the mostly deserted street; white plumes poured out, as though the only heat to be found at this hour was emanating from the earth's molten core. 
It was not a night to strike up casual conversation with the few spirits darting in and out of the elements. A worker at a Department of Sanitation depot on the Upper East Side gave little more than a grunt as he shoveled rock salt onto a glazed sidewalk. A deliveryman for Poland Spring quickly shared that some of the water in his truck's hold was indeed frozen solid, and then he rolled up his window as fast as he could. 
Occasionally, these breath puffs of human interaction reflected an unshakable trust in the urban machinery. Just north of a Harlem park named after Marcus Garvey, who turned 6 in 1893, a man stood rock-still in a bus shelter whose transparent shields shivered in the wind. "It's coming," he said of his bus. "I see it coming."
Exchanges like these were few, though, because it takes two to talk. Other than the dodges of taxicabs and the crawl of the occasional police car, the only movement came from the knotted, garbage-filled bags that scuttled across streets to the whims of the winds that had liberated them.
Along a deserted northern stretch of Riverside Drive, where the roadway rises to meet the western hillocks of Manhattan, the winds whistled across the Hudson River to rattle the chains that hung Marley-like from a West Side Highway billboard, and to cause an unsettling banging sound -- rope against flagpole? -- at ghostly Grant's Tomb. The tomb was under construction in 1893.
"It's 1 degree and clear in Midtown," a radio news broadcaster said, delivering an assessment that was truer than he might have realized. At 2:30, the gaudy video graffiti that moves across the buildings of Times Square -- the network plugs, the zipper news, the chewing gum come-ons -- played to an audience of none.
The black sedan grumbled south, past the ice-coated plastic flaps of greengrocers; past a single, underdressed woman hugging herself on a corner in the meatpacking district (what was she waiting for?); past ground zero, set aglow like New York's eternal flame.
At 3 in the morning, with the temperature at 1 and the wind-chill factor making it feel like minus 20, the bottom of this crowded, swarming island was as desolate as the surface of Mars. Two visitors violated the stillness by trying to walk to the Hudson River at Battery Park, but were given the bum's rush by the muscular wind. It pushed them back to that black car like a bouncer who would not take no for an answer.
The wind was not as forbidding near the ferry terminal, at Manhattan's southern tip. But the water was: a murky gray, it chopped about the harbor, taunting anyone who might wonder how it calls some to its icy embrace, and not others.
Above New York Harbor hung a crescent moon that dangled like the smile of the vanishing Cheshire cat. It was 3:30 and 1 degree out. Time for anyone still out there to come in from the cold.

HEADLINE: Pataki Proposes to Ease Local Pension Burdens With $800 Million Plan 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
With local officials growing increasingly angry over costly mandates from Albany, Gov. George E. Pataki on Friday announced plans to relieve some of the burden of their pension bills, administration officials said.
 Aides to the governor said a pension relief package, worth about $800 million in savings to counties, towns, cities and villages, would be a prime element of Mr. Pataki's budget presentation in Albany on Tuesday. The plan would also save the state $500 million in rising pension costs. 
 The plan does not address the rising costs of pensions in New York City, which has its own funds. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been asking lawmakers to allow the city to establish another tier in the pension fund, in which new employees would be paid a lower rate.
 The proposal -- coupled with the governor's effort to rein in the mounting costs of Medicaid and hold steady, at $792 million, the amount of unrestricted state aid to localities -- underlines Mr. Pataki's goal to make local property tax relief a top issue this legislative session, aides to the governor said.
 "It always has been," said Lisa Dewald Stoll, the governor's communications director, noting that his Star program, which helps pay the property tax bills school districts charge to homeowners, was enacted in 1997, in his first term.
 "It is certainly something that we believe is a priority this year," she said. "And, I think you are going to see him advance a budget that will help localities, and help the state as well, in particular the property tax burden on taxpayers across the state."
 A debate about property taxes has raged of late, ever since the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group backed primarily by businesses that seek ways to contain government costs and taxes in New York, released a report in November asserting that New Yorkers pay more of their income in local taxes than residents of any other state.
 Recently county officials in both parties have threatened to challenge some incumbents to protest a rise in Medicaid costs that they say has forced them to raise local taxes to cover the costs and impaired their ability to govern. The governor's recent proposals, however, have buoyed their hopes for reform and relief on several fronts.
 "Capping the local share of Medicaid has been our priority issue, but the second most important issue to counties and county taxpayers is pension reform," said Robert R. Gregory, the executive director of the New York State Association of Counties. "Counties across the state were facing a $350 million increase in employer pension contributions, from 2003 to 2004, so this sounds like a comprehensive proposal and we look forward to working with the governor as pension reform is negotiated with the Legislature."
 , The governor's plan would set the contribution rate that local governments and the state pay to the state's roughly $115 billion retirement fund at 6.5 percent of employee payroll. In order to ensure that there are sufficient revenues to pay workers' and retirees' pensions, now and in the future, the comptroller has set the current rate at 12 percent. In an effort to keep the pension fund healthy, the comptroller has set the current rate at 12 percent, officials said. 
 Cutting the contribution rate will provide short-term relief to localities and the state, which is facing a $5.1 billion budget shortfall. The goal is to provide predictable increases in the fund, in part by raising the rate gradually over time. Analysts believe that as the equities market improves, the value of the pension fund will grow, increasing earnings on those assets in the fund and lowering the costs for localities.
 The governor also wants to stretch out the costs of recent pension enhancements over 30 years, among other things. 
 Without changes, he said, the local governments would owe $1.14 billion more in pension costs in December. In a news release, Mr. Pataki referred to his plan as a sweeping reform. He proposed many of the same measures last year, but with the economy improving the plan holds greater promise to make the pension fund whole, pension analysts. Mr. Pataki stressed that the plan would, "ensure that the pension fund is sound and that benefits are protected," for nearly 1 million participants, including about 300,000 retirees.
 But E.J. McMahon, Jr., a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative organization, called it a short-term financial fix. "It may be airtight financially and it certainly would save money for the local governments, and the state, in the short term," he said. However, he said, it does not ensure that large government contributions to the fund will not be needed in the future. 
 Last year, legislators enacted pension reforms proposed by state Comptroller,Alan G. Hevesi, the fund's sole trustee, setting the contribution rate at 4.5 percent for the last fiscal year and saving local governments and the state $1.6 billion by delaying the imposition of higher costs.
 Legislators' reactions were mixed. "We like it," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican. Charles E. Carrier, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, stopped short of endorsing it.

HEADLINE: Heartless Marriage Plans 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's idea of spending $1.5 billion promoting marriage is one of those rather expensive but basically symbolic gestures that presidents like to make in election years. Mr. Bush's advisers may also hope that it will divert social conservatives from pressing for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriages. But as meaningless sops to powerful voting blocs go, this one is particularly cruel. 
 The whole idea of encouraging poor people to get married and stay married through classes and counseling sessions ignores the main reason that stable wedlock is rare in inner cities: the epidemics of joblessness and incarceration that have stripped those communities of what social scientists call "marriageable" men. Women in poor neighborhoods may find bitter amusement in the idea that they need the government's encouragement to search for a husband, or that conflict resolution courses are the way to shore up troubled unions between two poor people. 
 It is undeniably true that women tend to become poorer after divorce and that children from single-family homes are more likely to grow up in poverty. But the fiscal lift that occurs when middle-class couples marry and combine resources does not come about in neighborhoods where jobs have long since disappeared and men in particular tend to be unskilled and poorly educated.
By the late 1990's, the inner city had become the home of a needy "nonworking class," where single-parent families had become the norm. Poor women have the same dreams about marriage as their suburban counterparts. But they also know that men with jobs, skills and hope for the future have become scarce in their world, and that a marriage to a man without any of these things may prove more devastating to the children than no marriage at all.
The $1.5 billion earmarked for the dubious and untested marriage initiative would be better spent on intervention programs that keep troubled young people -- especially boys -- in school. It could be spent on pregnancy prevention, and on the health insurance and the job training that single mothers desperately need to move themselves out of poverty.
To pour the money into marriage and relationship counseling for people without economic hope is a very expensive version of spitting into the wind.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
Kraft Changes a Heavy Hand Into a Guiding Hand

BYLINE:  By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: FOXBORO, Mass., Jan. 15 

 BODY:
It is an image that makes a football purist queasy, an owner alighting from his limousine to scout a potential draft pick and later, after all but clicking the stopwatch himself, evaluating for reporters the player's ability as a cornerback. 
 That was the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, before the 1998 N.F.L. draft, a display calling to mind the Daniel Snyder follies in Washington, but one that is now quite dated. In an era when the high-profile owner is de rigueur and sometimes disastrous, Kraft, who will celebrate a decade of owning the Patriots next week, has turned his reputation for meddling on its ear, and emerged as an almost model owner. 
 In the process, he has reinvented a franchise that won 19 games in the five years before he bought it. The Patriots were in such bad shape that, according to the Dallas Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, the league considered buying the team several times. Now the Patriots are one game from playing for their second Super Bowl title in three years. 
"We had a lot of highs and lows," Kraft said in an interview this week. "We took some real beatings in the process. This is a very tough, tough business. It's unforgiving if you don't learn from your mistakes. Part of it is knowing how to be a good owner."
He was once tagged Amos Alonzo Kraft by Dan Shaughnessy, a Boston Globe columnist, for his involvement in football issues. Even his riding in a golf cart through the parking lot on game days, the better to shake hands with fans, was criticized. 
There was plenty of reason to be cynical. The Patriots were so woeful, their fans so unruly, that "Monday Night Football" stayed away for 13 years. Home games rarely sold out. From 1960 to 1993, the Patriots went to the playoffs five times. But past failures did not mean New England wanted an owner that reminded anyone of the hated George Steinbrenner, another name invoked in Kraft's early years. 
His well-publicized schism with his former coach Bill Parcells, and Parcells's adept spinning of the fallout, only added to the perception that Kraft was an owner running amok. 
It is difficult, though, to find fault with Kraft's work in the last four years. He hired Bill Belichick, perhaps the best coach in the game today; even members of Kraft's family questioned the wisdom of parting with a first-round draft pick to acquire a coach who had failed miserably in his first head coaching job in Cleveland. 
He built a new stadium without using public money. And if the Patriots beat the Colts in Sunday's A.F.C. Championship game, he will preside over a team that will go to the Super Bowl for the third time in the last eight seasons. 
"He's had a great run," said Robert Tisch, the co-owner of the Giants. "What he did for his team, it wasn't a laughingstock, but it was not a great team before he took over. And he got a stadium built at the same time."
Kraft, whose Gillette Stadium office features ceramic footballs and huge photos of his sons, has clearly found a comfort level with Belichick, who is also a de facto general manager. Kraft concedes that when he realized Parcells had no intention of staying with the franchise after the 1996 season, he diminished Parcells's personnel power.
Kraft was also thrust into the limelight during the 1996 draft when he famously sided with his personnel department against Parcells in selecting receiver Terry Glenn when Parcells wanted defensive help. It is difficult to imagine such a split happening now. When Belichick released safety Lawyer Milloy just before the start of the season, Kraft was mum. Belichick and the vice president of player personnel, Scott Pioli, confer regularly with Kraft, but it is they who make the personnel decisions. And Kraft marvels at how Belichick places economic value on midrange players, aiming for those who fit his system. 
"Part of it is learning the ropes," Kraft said. "There is nothing that can prepare you for ownership in the N.F.L. You have to go through it. You have to get beaten up. What I learned early on, winning doesn't put you on as high a plane as losing. Losing is much lower than winning is high. You've got to learn how to get in that zone so you're balanced."
Kraft is the rare N.F.L. owner who was able to buy a team that he had rooted for since its inception (he owned season tickets on the goal line in the old Foxboro Stadium), and he feels that that has informed his ownership. During a recent conversation, he returned repeatedly to the team's impact on the area, citing letters thanking him for putting the team on the map after the Patriots won the Super Bowl two years ago. 
Kraft is very keen on having players with high character. One of the seminal moments of his ownership came two days after the 1996 draft, when the Patriots renounced the rights to Christian Peter after Kraft learned the extent of his legal problems at Nebraska, including a no-contest plea for third-degree sexual assault. 
Kraft is still proud of the decision, and it nudged him toward taking a greater interest in setting standards for personnel. Just before Peter's release, Sports Illustrated reported at the time, the Kansas City Chiefs offered a seventh-round pick to acquire his rights. Kraft declined, because he did not want his team to profit from its mistake. 
"I think I know what a fan wants," Kraft said. "We got to view a lot of great players -- Mike Haynes, John Hannah, Steve Grogan. We had a few other folks floating around here that had a lot of off-the-field antics. It wasn't something we, as fans, could feel proud about. With us, reputation is important. You always run a business for the bad times. If you stress quality, your customer base will stay with you."
That adage held true even when he made his pursuit of Belichick to succeed Pete Carroll. The decision was blasted in New England, and the heat grew more intense when the Patriots went 5-11 in Belichick's first season. But Kraft had found a connection with Belichick that few others had; Kraft compared it to finding his wife, Myra. That connection overwhelmed any concerns about Belichick's unsuccessful years in Cleveland.
When things were at their worst, when the Patriots started 1-3 during 2001, Kraft would call Belichick to tell him he believed in him. Later that year, the Patriots won the franchise's first Super Bowl. 
Because of Belichick and Pioli's personnel acumen, the Patriots are situated for a long period of competitiveness. They have had excellent drafts. They have few salary-cap worries, in part because of the release of Milloy. They have 10 picks in this spring's draft, including two picks in each of the first two rounds. 
"Robert gave up a lot in terms of bringing me into the organization," Belichick said. "I lean on him quite a bit in terms of the big-picture decisions, and input on things like financial management and the direction of the team. He is the owner and he is the boss, but he is also a friend."
And while Kraft is still plenty visible -- players call him a "players' owner" -- the image is more benign. Gone is the talk about a cornerback's attributes. Now Kraft talks about creating a family legacy in New England. Despite the bumpy start, he is already creating a blueprint. 
Jones said: "When comparing it to other franchises that could be doing better, he's the perfect example of what you can accomplish. When we're evaluating in the future and we look at people joining the league, I want them to be Bob Kraft Jr."

HEADLINE: AARP, Its Eye on Drug Prices, Urges Change in New Law 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
AARP, the influential lobby for older Americans, said Friday that it would seek changes in the new Medicare law to allow the government to negotiate lower drug prices for beneficiaries if private insurers are unable to win big discounts.
 "We are beginning an all-out effort to lower the high cost of prescription drugs," said William D. Novelli, chief executive of AARP. 
 The law explicitly prohibits the government from interfering in negotiations between manufacturers and the private entities that will provide subsidized drug benefits to the elderly. Republicans and some Democrats insisted on that ban as a way to avoid any hint of federal price controls. They are counting on the private plans to negotiate discounts. 
AARP, which has more than 35 million members age 50 or older, was instrumental in winning passage of the legislation, drafted mostly by Republicans. But Mr. Novelli said Friday that the law did not go far enough. Congress, he said, should authorize the secretary of health and human services to "negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries in the event competitive purchasing doesn't work to lower prices."
When AARP endorsed the bill last year, it infuriated many Congressional Democrats and some of its own members, who asserted that the legislation would privatize Medicare. At least 45,000 members resigned in anger, Mr. Novelli said.
Mr. Novelli said he had no regrets about the endorsement. But he added that while "we had intended to keep after drug costs all along, the public clamor reinforces that." 
Representative Pete Stark of California, a Democratic spokesman on health policy, said leaders of AARP were busily making the rounds on Capitol Hill this week "in an attempt to rehabilitate themselves as advocates for America's seniors." He urged his colleagues to reject such overtures. "AARP -- what does it stand for?" Mr. Stark said in a letter to House Democrats. "Always Advocating for the Republican Party."
Drug companies want to negotiate with private insurers, not with federal Medicare officials.
"When the government negotiates, it's not a real negotiation," said Ian D. Spatz, vice president for public policy at Merck & Company. "Federal officials make you an offer you can't refuse, because they have all the power. The whole design of this Medicare law is to have competing private-sector entities negotiate the discounts."
Outlining its agenda for 2004, AARP said Congress should allow Americans to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. Mr. Novelli said Congress could impose "strict controls, to ensure that consumers are ordering only from reputable Canadian pharmacies." The Bush administration has said it has no plans to allow such imports.
Mr. Novelli also said drug manufacturers and distributors should "voluntarily limit price increases to no more than the rate of inflation" for goods and services in general.
AARP said it would lobby Congress to enrich the Medicare drug benefit and to reduce the amount that beneficiaries must pay. It proposed these changes:
*The government should help fill the gap in drug coverage, sometimes called a "doughnut hole." Under the standard benefit, Medicare will pay 75 percent of annual drug costs from $251 to $2,250, but coverage will then stop until the beneficiary has spent $3,600 out of pocket.
*The deductible and other costs to beneficiaries, which increase automatically with Medicare drug spending, should be linked instead to the Consumer Price Index, which typically rises at a much slower pace.
*The government should abolish the new law's limit on assets for low-income people seeking extra assistance with drug costs. This would help 1.5 million Medicare recipients.
AARP already offers a drug discount card, which, its executives said, members can use to obtain savings averaging 20 percent. Mr. Novelli said the group would seek a federal endorsement for its card under the new law, which provides for such discount cards until the Medicare drug benefit begins in 2006.
Under the law, Medicare drug plans can establish lists of preferred drugs, believed to offer the best value to patients. But Mr. Novelli said the plans should be required to tell beneficiaries, before they enroll, precisely which drugs are on the lists.
To inform such judgments, Mr. Novelli said, Congress should provide more money for research that systematically compares the effectiveness and cost of drugs prescribed for the same purpose, like lowering cholesterol or treating ulcers.
AARP also said the government should tighten regulation of drug advertising, so consumers can more easily understand the risks and benefits of products.

HEADLINE: Shinsei Bank Will Be Listed On Tokyo Stock Exchange 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Shinsei Bank, Japan's first foreign-owned lender, will list its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in mid-February, completing a tumultuous five-year turnaround.
 Shinsei's shareholders, which include the New York-based Ripplewood Holdings, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, will sell 440 million shares, or about one-third of the outstanding common stock. About 55 percent of the shares will be sold in Japan and the remainder overseas. The bank has an option to sell an additional 36.3 million shares if demand is strong. 
 The shares will be priced on Feb. 9 and listed on Feb. 19. Bloomberg News, quoting a banker, reported that the shares would be offered at 435 yen ($4.07) each. This would allow Shinsei's shareholders to raise 191.4 billion yen ($1.8 billion), a 58 percent premium on what they paid for their stake in 2000.
 The refloating of the bank, however, has been far from smooth. Shinsei was formed from the remains of the Long-Term Credit Bank, which collapsed under trillions of yen in nonperforming loans. Trying to stem a wider financial crisis, the government reluctantly nationalized thebank, one of the largest and most respected in Japan at the time.
 With no Japanese investors able or willing to take over the Long-Term Credit Bank, lawmakers were forced to sell it to a consortium led by Ripplewood, which then had little presence in Japan.
 Many policy makers opposed the sale, fearful that foreign investors would stop lending to weak, but politically influential, Japanese companies. The Western bankers who ultimately bought the bank were, for their part, suspicious of the official assessment of the bank's balance sheet, which turned out to be far worse than the government originally admitted. 
 To reach a deal, the government agreed to buy back loans to companies that were in far worse condition than initially agreed. Shinsei subsequently returned billions of yen in loans to the government, much to the consternation of local Japanese banks, which still had to grapple with their money-losing clients.
 Aiming to improve the health of its own balance sheet, Shinsei also cut off dead-beat lenders, including the Sogo department store chain, a retailer that collapsed soon after.
 The tough-love tactics worked, though. While Japanese banks struggled to remain solvent, Shinsei soon returned to health. Profits at the bank rose 28 percent, to 34 billion yen, in the half-year ended Sept. 30.
 By writing off trillions of yen in nonperforming loans, the bank has shrunk its balance sheet by two-thirds, but also improved the quality of the loans it still holds. Its capital adequacy ratio, a benchmark of the bank's ability to absorb losses, is nearly twice that of other large banks in Japan.
 Shinsei's new managers, including many recruited from Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and other Western banks, also narrowed the company's strategy. Outside of trying to provide all services to all customers, like most Japanese banks, Shinsei has focused on building retail and other fee-based businesses, including loan securitization. At the same time, the bank reduced its reliance on corporate lending.
 "Shinsei is a good role model for other traditional Japanese banks," Naoko Nemoto, an analyst at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo, said. "They have proven that banks can still make profits in Japan."
 Other banks, with varying success, have tried to follow Shinsei's strategy. Japanese lenders have extended service hours for retail clients and branched out into new and more specialized investment banking services.
 Since Shinsei's rebirth, other foreign investors have made inroads into Japan's banking industry, buying stakes in Aozora Bank, Tokyo Star Bank and others.
 Morgan Stanley, Nikko-Citigroup and Nomura Holdings are the underwriters for the share offering, the first by a Japanese bank in seven years.

HEADLINE: G.E. Earnings Up 47%, Aided by Insurance Unit and More Industrial Orders 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
General Electric said yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings rose 47 percent, helped by insurance income and increases in orders at industrial businesses like plastics and jet engines.
 Net income rose to $4.56 billion, or 45 cents a share, from $3.1 billion, or 31 cents, in the period a year earlier, which included 14 cents a share in reinsurance expenses. 
 Sales in the quarter rose about 4 percent, to $36.96 billion from $35.51 billion, the company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., said. 
 Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, has sought bigger returns in the medical and consumer finance units through acquisitions and divestitures and is now being helped by economic growth. Orders across the company rose 19 percent last quarter, indicating "strong momentum," Mr. Immelt said, and businesses like locomotives and jet engines will have their best gains this year since 2000.
 Michael Holton, an analyst at T. Rowe Price & Associates, which owns more than 36 million General Electric shares, said: "You got an as-expected quarter, which in and of itself is an accomplishment given 2002 and 2003 was full of surprises and reductions in earnings forecasts from G.E. The reiteration of the outlook for 2004 and 2005 with a chance for upside is a positive."
 Sales exceeded estimates of $36.3 billion, the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. The gains in the quarter were led by the company's specialty chemicals, locomotive, consumer finance and medical equipment businesses. 
 "Revenues beat expectations and this is very encouraging," said John Jacobs, who owns 200,000 General Electric shares among the $150 million he helps manage for Jacobs & Company.
 Shares of General Electric reached their highest level since August 2002. They closed up $1.35, to $33.35. 
Excluding the charges in the year-ago fourth quarter for reinsurance reserves and other costs, General Electric said profit in the most recent period still rose 11 percent. Excluding special items, profit declined in the four previous quarters.
 "This is the first in five quarters here where we've seen flat or up earnings (excluding costs), so the trend is moving in the right direction," said Jeff Graff, an analyst at Victory Capital Management, whose parent company KeyCorp owns about 31 million General Electric shares.
 The net income percentage increase is the largest quarterly rise in nine years.
 Since taking office in September 2001, Mr. Immelt has quit businesses with lower returns, like insurance, and added to those with higher growth rates, like media and health care, in an effort to return to the profit growth of 10 percent or more the company was used to before the slide began in 2001.
 "I think we have done the things we've said we're going to for investors," Mr. Immelt told investors on a conference call. General Electric makes jet engines, turbines for power plants, medical imaging equipment and locomotives. Other businesses include the NBC television network; consumer finance like credit cards; commercial financing for real estate and aircraft; plastics; and appliances.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE CONGRESSMAN; 
For Gephardt, Campaign Is Lonely, Unlike 1988

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: POCAHONTAS, Iowa, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
In 1988, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri filled a charter plane with a crowd of cheering colleagues from Congress who converged on the steps of the Iowa Capitol to rally behind his first bid for the presidency.
 This time around, Mr. Gephardt has struck a much more lonely figure on the campaign trail. Thirty-four members of the House of Representatives have endorsed his presidential campaign, down from 58 members 15 years ago. On Friday, Howard Dean, the self-proclaimed Washington outsider, surged ahead in the battle for Congressional endorsements, claiming 35 representatives and three senators. 
 The milestone passed without much fanfare here as the candidates focused on the battle for Iowa. But for some people, it was a painful reminder of Mr. Gephardt's waning influence in Congress, a stage he dominated for more than a decade. 
Mr. Gephardt served as the Democratic leader in the House for 13 years, leading some of the most important legislative battles over trade, Medicare and the economy, until he stepped down last year. He raised millions of dollars for his colleagues and fought hard to keep an often-fractious caucus united. 
But he also helped write the resolution that authorized the invasion of Iraq, which alienated some colleagues. And he was eclipsed in the minds of some members of Congress by Dr. Dean's fund-raising prowess, his opposition to the war and his fierce critique of President Bush. All these factors have helped to make Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, into the choice for much of the Democratic establishment, including former Vice President Al Gore, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. 
"It's got to be hard for Dick," said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, who supported Mr. Gephardt in 1988 and endorsed him again this time.
Mr. Hoyer was among the dozens of Democrats who rallied with Mr. Gephardt at the state Capitol in 1988. He was in Iowa campaigning for him on Friday along with several other members of Congress. 
"He is one of the most thoughtful, inclusive and substantive leaders with whom I've served," said Mr. Hoyer, reflecting on his colleagues' shift. "But their calculus is that you need someone new. Dean looks like a winner, and front-runners tend to garner people. I think it reflects the frustration and lack of faith in existing establishment figures." 
Mr. Gephardt made light of the change, saying it would make little difference in his campaign because voters, not endorsements, win elections. Never mind that Mr. Gephardt has provided some of the Democratic candidates' most caustic appraisals of Mr. Bush. His aides had still expected Dr. Dean to pick up more endorsements for weeks.
Mr. Gephardt said it would be harder now for Dr. Dean to invoke the anti-establishment label. "He's been endorsed by a whole bunch of Washington insiders," Mr. Gephardt joked earlier this week. "Maybe I'm the outsider now." 
In his 27 years in Congress, Mr. Gephardt spent innumerable weekends on the road for his colleagues, attending rallies and fund-raisers across the country. Hoping to regain control of the House, he raised $37 million for Democratic candidates before the elections of 2002.
"He's worked very hard; he's done a lot for the caucus," said Steve Elmendorf, Mr. Gephardt's chief of staff. "Some members have repaid the loyalty; others have not."
Representative Martin Frost of Texas stood with Gephardt at the Iowa Capitol in 1988, but decided to endorse Gen. Wesley K. Clark this time. Mr. Frost declined to comment on his decision, but other members of Congress were less reticent.
Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, one of the first members of Congress to endorse Dr. Dean, said she decided to after hearing him speak last spring and finding him to be inspirational. She did not endorse a candidate in 1988.
"There's no question he's a hard worker," Ms. Lofgren said of Mr. Gephardt. "But for eight years in a row he lost; he was the leader and he led us to eight years of losing. We want to win." 
Mr. Gephardt no longer wields the power he once did as Democratic leader and that made it easier for some members of Congress to go elsewhere. That may all change, of course, if he wins the nomination.
"I really have learned to let it roll off," said Mr. Gephardt, who does not plan to run for re-election to Congress. "All you can do is your best. You can't get everybody. You can't please everybody."

HEADLINE: Council Seeks To Best Mayor On Tax Relief 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
The City Council, seeking to one-up the mayor's plan to offer $400 annual rebates to home owners, is instead considering permanently rolling back a small percentage of the city's property tax rate for all who pay property tax, including apartment building owners and businesses, senior council officials said yesterday. 
 While counter-offers from the Council are a normal part of the annual budget dance, it is quite out of character for the predominantly Democratic body to tell the Republican mayor that he is not doing enough for businesses and apartment building owners. 
 "They are trying to dance to the left and we are trying to counter him," said one council member about Mr. Bloomberg. "As we are beginning to listen to business interests, we are hearing that this is bad for the economy because they continue to pay the real estate tax, which is passed on to tenants." 
 The Council's maneuvers come as the Bloomberg administration announced yesterday a bit of good news-bad news for city property owners. 
 Real estate values in New York jumped 17 percent in the last year, according to the Department of Finance annual assessment roll, the biggest one-year increase in at least a decade. The average single-family home in New York is now worth $410,875, up $71,630, according to the city's full market value estimates. That means a buyer should be able to profit more when selling a home.
 But that also means a higher tax bill, wiping out a chunk of whatever property-tax relief the mayor and City Council settle on.
 The property tax is a critical source of revenue for the city. Property taxes paid by the owners of the city's 950,000 parcels are expected to produce $11.8 billion in the coming fiscal year, the single biggest contribution from city taxpayers toward the $45.7 billion city budget. 
 In November 2002, Mayor Bloomberg and the City Council backed an 18.5 percent increase in the property tax rate, worth about $1.8 billion a year, to help bridge a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. This week, Mr. Bloomberg announced that with the improvement in the economy -- and rising property values -- he would like to give about $250 million worth of that increase back to owners of one-, two- and three-family homes, cooperative apartments and condominiums. In his budget report on Thursday, he said he would like to make the rebate, which will amount to $400, an annual occurrence. 
 City Council Speaker Gifford Miller hinted on Thursday that he thought the proposal did not do enough to help renters, who live in multifamily buildings that would not benefit from the annual rebate.
 The council alternative -- which is one of several it is considering -- would roll back the overall property tax rate perhaps one to three percent, also benefiting owners of office buildings and apartment complexes. 
 The downside would be that by spreading the tax cut more widely, the city would not be able to give as large a rebate to homeowners. But the Council idea has at least one advantage: it would not require approval by legislators in Albany. State laws passed in the early 1980's also require that property tax changes on all classes move in tandem, which might not be the case under the mayor's plan.
 Jordon Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said that the mayor intended to defend his proposal. "The mayor wants to help those who were hurt the most by the property tax increase," Mr. Barowitz said. "Which means home co-op and condo owners, not power companies and corporations."
 The mayor's rebate would also funnel tax relief disproportionately toward Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn, where larger percentages of the population are homeowners. Those boroughs are also, polls show, where the voters who have expressed the most anger over the city's tax increase reside. Council staff members have only begun to fully analyze the mayor's budget, and it is already clear that there will be friction not only on tax policy, but on the spending side as well. Despite an assertion by Mayor Bloomberg that his spending plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1 includes no major program cuts, City Council staff members have already identified $385 million in cuts they say they will press the mayor to restore.
 Many of these items are familiar targets for mayors. Mr. Bloomberg, like Rudolph W. Giuliani and other mayors before him, include these cuts as bargaining chips to provide leverage during budget negotiations. This year's list, according to the City Council, includes $10 million for summer jobs for youths, $36.1 million for parks, libraries and cultural programs, $11 million for programs for the elderly, $50 million for the school system, and $150 million to subsidize the city's privately operated bus lines, which Mr. Bloomberg wants the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to take over.
 For Mr. Miller, who is contemplating a run for mayor next year, the ideal political solution would be somehow figuring out a way to restore those cuts, bring some property tax relief to homeowners and offer a property tax cut to small-property owners and owners of rental apartment buildings, who could be important to his bid for higher office. Already, the Council's idea was being praised by an organization representing some of the biggest residential property owners.
 "If the concept is that those who shared the pain and had their property taxes increased should get them lowered," said Joe Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a group of apartment-building owners, "then to selectively give back to a portion of the population is unfair. A rollback should go for all classes."
 A preliminary report on market valuation, which is released each year at this time, shows that the average Class 1 property -- one, two and three-family homes -- rose in value by 22 percent. The value of office buildings, hotels and other commercial properties went up by 7.3 percent, and rental buildings and most cooperatives and condominiums went up by 21 percent. 
 A state law caps property tax increases in New York City, effectively keeping the increase for Class 1 properties to just 4 percent, even as their full market value is increasing in double digits. That means taxes on Class 1 properties would rise by an average of $93, if the tax rates remain the same.
 The higher property values would thus offset about a quarter of the $400 rebate check Mr. Bloomberg wants to send to homeowners. And if the Council pushes through a tax cut for all city properties, the average homeowner's check would be lower, adding up to a net gain worth little more than a dinner for two at a top New York City restaurant.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE RECONSTRUCTION; 
Russia Sees Iraqi Debt Relief As Link to Oil, U.S. Aides Say

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS; Erin E. Arvedlund contributed reporting from Moscow for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Russia is hoping to leverage its plans for debt relief for Iraq to win the revival of oil development projects signed under Saddam Hussein and suspended by the occupation authorities, Bush administration officials say.
 The administration, which is formally taking a hands-off approach that would leave decisions on contracts to a future Iraqi government, is giving tentative approval to Moscow's approach, which could mean billions for Russian companies. 
 Iraqi debt relief is likely to come up when Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visits Moscow later this month. A week later, Aleksei L. Kudrin, Russia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, is expected to share plans, at a preparatory meeting in Florida for the year's Group of 8 summit meeting, to write off up to two-thirds of its debt in return for favorable treatment for Russian companies. 
The discussions come as the administration is considering reversing its decision to bar Russia, France and Germany and other countries that opposed the war in Iraq from bidding on primary contracts.
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, declined to elaborate Friday. "Circumstances might change," he said. "As we look at what other countries are doing there, the contracting could change as well."
The jockeying highlights the tenuous position of companies from Russia, France and elsewhere that entered into contracts while Iraq was under United Nations sanctions, in the anticipation that they would eventually be lifted.
Now those contracts are in limbo. An analysis by Deutsche Bank last year said that while occupation authorities "would no doubt like to tear up" these contracts, that would invite legal challenges. The analysis suggested establishing partnerships with companies from coalition countries.
Russia's biggest stake is a $3.7 billion 1997 contract signed by Lukoil, Russia's second biggest oil company, as part of a consortium to develop the West Qurna-2 oil field. The Iraqi authorities have said that the government severed the production-sharing agreement in 2002, and occupation officials later declared all such contracts suspended. But Lukoil hopes to renegotiate access to the field, which has reserves estimated as high as 15 billion barrels, oil analysts say.
Leonid Fedun, vice president of Lukoil, said this week that a top manager of the company had met with Iraqi officials before the new year. "I can only say that the situation is evolving optimistically," he said.
Russian firms have also suffered from the end of the United Nations' oil-for-food program in November. The companies profited from irrigation and energy projects, and provided equipment and food in return for Iraqi oil. Under the program, Russian companies took in nearly $3 billion, including $1.7 billion in contracts negotiated in the months before the war that are still playing out, according to State Department figures.
Russian companies felt another blow when the Bush administration announced last month that only nations that supported the war would be able to bid on contracts in the $18.6 billion reconstruction, a decision that is being reconsidered.
In recent weeks, Russian officials and oil executives have met with members of the Iraqi Governing Council, the interim body of leaders picked by the American-led occupation, and have proposed forgiving a large portion of nearly $8 billion in Soviet-era debt. Iraq's overall debt is estimated at more than $116 billion.
"At least so far, they're taking a positive approach on the Iraqi debt," a senior State Department official said last week, "although they obviously have broader commercial interests that they will -- which they are articulating quite openly -- that they hope will be satisfied at the same time." 
President Vladimir V. Putin, who met at the Kremlin with Abdel Aziz al-Hakim of the Iraqi Governing Council, said Russian companies were prepared to invest $4 billion in Iraq. Moscow officials have declined to make donations to the rebuilding.
"Russian companies are ready to be active in Iraq," Mr. Putin said in remarks reported by the Interfax news agency. "We expect to have good relations with the new authorities of Iraq as well. We have always based our relations with Iraq on the idea that we are developing relations with the Iraqi people."
Mr. Hakim said last month that Mr. Putin had offered to erase several billion dollars in debt in return for favorable treatment for Russian companies.
A Russian Embassy official said diplomats from his country were in regular contact with American and Iraqi officials on the debt and investment issues, but denied there was a direct link between debt relief and Russian contracts.
"Debt relief in itself is in our economic interest," he said. "Certainly, we're interested in getting our companies back into Iraq," he added.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS; 
Dean and Gephardt Camps Turn Their Attacks to Kerry

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and TODD S. PURDUM; Todd S. Purdum reported from Washington and David M. Halbfinger from Guttenberg, Iowa.

DATELINE: GUTTENBERG, Iowa, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Howard Dean and Richard A. Gephardt on Friday withdrew harsh television advertisements attacking each other, switching instead to sharp but indirect new assaults accusing their Iowa caucus rival John Kerry of failing to support some federal subsidies for agriculture, Iowa's vital economic engine.
 The shift came as the Democratic contenders headed into the final weekend of campaigning before Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses on Monday. The caucuses are the first big test of whether Dr. Dean, who has dominated his rivals for months, can transform his formidable Internet-fueled campaign operation into electoral success. 
 Even as he and Dr. Dean declared a truce, Mr. Gephardt's campaign disclosed that it had sent mailings criticizing Mr. Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, for voting against a measure to require use of ethanol fuel, made from corn, in 1994.
And Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, campaigning with Dr. Dean, went after Mr. Kerry, without naming him, for proposing in 1996 to eliminate or greatly reduce the size of the Agriculture Department as a means of reducing bureaucratic waste. Dean aides later sought out reporters to make sure they knew that Mr. Harkin was referring to Mr. Kerry, whom they also faulted for voting with Republicans in favor of an amendment to the 1996 farm bill that would have phased out federal farm supports over seven years.
The major candidates' public messages on the stump, by contrast, were upbeat and optimistic, adhering to an Iowa tradition that rewards candidates who take the high road.
But in a contest that has long been as much about expectations as about actual results, the attacks on Mr. Kerry by the Dean and Gephardt campaigns were the surest sign yet that both now felt threatened by Mr. Kerry.
"There's no doubt about it, that they're trying to slow our momentum," said Mr. Kerry's spokeswoman, Stephanie Cutter. She said that "John Kerry was trying to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse at the Agriculture Department."
She said that Mr. Kerry had opposed requiring ethanol use in 1994, "when there wasn't enough ethanol produced to use," and that Mr. Kerry ultimately voted with most Democrats against the 1996 "Freedom to Farm" bill, which phased out subsidies. 
The fourth major candidate in the race, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who has waged a doggedly upbeat underdog campaign here, took credit for the decision by Mr. Gephardt and Dr. Dean to pull their negative advertisements, and called on them to halt the mailing of fliers Mr. Edwards has deemed negative as well.
"I have good news," Mr. Edwards said at the beginning of a speech in Council Bluffs. "You and I, we already are changing America."
Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, spent a second consecutive day campaigning in a soft crew-neck sweater, instead of his usual suit and tie, leading an unwieldy caravan of 13 vehicles, 55 reporters, a portable wireless Internet hub, assorted staff, political celebrities and enough food to feed them across 631 miles since Thursday.
At two morning events, he skipped much of his normal stump speech, spending just 10 or 15 minutes on his most direct appeal yet for support in Monday's caucuses, and taking no questions from voters.
"I'm not going to stand up for you if we don't all stand up for each other," he told about 150 students and teachers at William Penn University in Oskaloosa, many of them undecided. Speaking softly, he said, "There's a lot of different candidates you can vote for in order to change presidents. There's only one you can vote for in order to change Washington, and change America.
In a chat with reporters, Dr. Dean said he not taken questions only because of his tight schedule. He said he had decided to avoid attacking his opponents at least through Monday and that he believes the Iowa race is deadlocked. 
"We're going to just go with a positive message to get to the polls," he said. "And I think that's what people want at the end and that's what we're going to do."
Mr. Gephardt, a representative from Missouri, dashing across five cities in northern and central Iowa, sounded a similar note. "We're in the stretch run," he told a small crowd of volunteers in Fort Dodge. "This is when it all really counts. Now is the time to work harder than we've ever worked."
After Dr. Dean withdrew a television advertisement that branded Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards as "Washington Democrats" who voted for the Congressional resolution authorizing President Bush to use force in Iraq, Mr. Gephardt followed suit. He pulled an advertisement, which had started running Thursday, sharply attacking Dr. Dean's decade-old criticisms of the Medicare program. "Now that they've taken theirs down, we've taken ours down," Mr. Gephardt said.
For his part, Mr. Kerry, who has struggled for months as Dr. Dean and retired General Wesley K. Clark ran strongly against him here and in New Hampshire, was suddenly behaving like a man with the wind at his back.
Polls of caucusgoers here are notoriously unreliable, both because of difficulties in predicting who will show up, and how they might behave in caucuses where they are encouraged to change their minds.
But all week, public and private surveys have shown Mr. Kerry moving up, and he has drawn overflow crowds and sympathetic audiences of undecided voters as he spends 20 hours a day crisscrossing the state from the Mississippi to the Missouri. 
"It's focus time," Mr. Kerry said as his bus zoomed across northeastern Iowa, and he displayed a lucky four-leaf clover that a farmer had given him on Thursday. "I'm not second-thinking anything. I'm not evaluating or analyzing. I'm just going to keep talking about what's important to people here."
Like their stump speeches, most of the candidates' television advertisements, running one into another now on local stations, are relentlessly sunny, with Mr. Gephardt quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mr. Edwards promising "a new, positive, uplifting vision for America."
Mr. Kerry's latest advertisement here has the governor's wife, Christie Vilsack, saying she is supporting him because "he'll fight for us."
The last-minute tumult in Iowa left at least one Democratic campaign happy: that of General Clark, who is not competing in Iowa but spent the day in New Hampshire.
A tight race or close finishes in Iowa would make it less likely that any one candidate would come roaring into New Hampshire." From our perspective, if it comes out jumbled, great," said Chris Lehane, a senior communications strategist for the Clark campaign.

HEADLINE: The City Wades Out of Red Ink 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg began his attempt to journey back into the political good graces of New Yorkers this week by showing them how he had turned the city's multibillion-dollar budget gap into a $1.4 billion surplus -- and promising many of them a piece of it. His preliminary budget plan was an impressive starting point for keeping the city safe, clean and fiscally sound. But it went too far in trying to make people happy. 
 By promising most homeowners a $400 rebate on property taxes this year and beyond -- at an annual cost of $250 million -- the mayor is betting that everyone will want to help nurture the city's new fiscal breathing room. That's unlikely, because Albany and Washington have their own money problems. The state faces a budget shortfall of about $5 billion. That leaves little room for the kind of sympathy that spurred state lawmakers to break with Gov. George Pataki and help the city last year. Yet Mr. Bloomberg needs the state to approve the tax rebate and then agree to absorb more Medicaid costs and carry out a plan to take over $500 million in debt service from the 1970's. The mayor deserves the support on Medicaid and old debt, but the rebate guts his best argument for help. 
 Mr. Bloomberg sounded a note of caution on the budget, but we wish he had gone further and dropped the rebate plan until the city showed clearer signs of being out of the woods economically. Happily, the budget contains other solid signs of economic prudence. The mayor is counting only half of the surplus toward balancing the 2005 budget, and squirreling away the rest for 2006. He also wisely moved toward "pay as you go" on capital projects, a step that lightens future debt obligations.
Mr. Bloomberg avoided another open confrontation with union leaders by not setting down a specific marker on the cost of the coming contracts. But that leaves another question mark in the budget. Even keeping wages level with inflation could cost an additional $500 million.
The much-hailed surplus could easily fade away before anyone has a chance to spend it. But Mr. Bloomberg has been steady in making choices, however unpopular, to do right by the city. We are counting on him not to change course now.

HEADLINE: Bush Looking at a New Health Care Initiative, Advisers Say 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush is expected to propose a health care initiative in his State of the Union address to help the uninsured and the underinsured, White House advisers said on Friday.
 It was unclear how much the initiative, to be announced in the address on Tuesday, would cost at a time when Mr. Bush is under pressure because of a growing budget deficit. But White House officials have made clear that they do not want to cede the politically potent issue of health care to the Democratic presidential candidates, all of whom have made health care a centerpiece of their campaigns. 
 "One of the main drivers of a significant section of the uninsured in America is because of the rising costs of health care," a senior administration official said Friday in a briefing to reporters. "And those can be addressed from several different ways, which he'll talk about on Tuesday."
Mr. Bush has already proposed an $89 billion, 10-year package of tax credits for the uninsured, which is many times less than the health plans of the Democrats.
In a pre-emptive critique of Mr. Bush's speech, the two leading Democrats in Congress delivered their own assessment of the condition of the nation on Friday, including criticism of what one of them, Senator Tom Daschle, called a growing gap in health care.
"The American people have a right to ask, 'Mr. President, how do you intend to make health care more affordable, and more available?' " Mr. Daschle, of South Dakota, said in a speech at the National Press Club.
Another "pre-rebuttal" to the State of the Union address was given at the press club by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.
"Mr. President, America's families are hurting," Ms. Pelosi, of California, said. "But you are not helping. In fact, you are making it harder for American families to prosper. Yours is a government of the few, by the few, for the few."
The speeches drew immediate criticism from Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican leader, whose office issued a statement saying: "Sad as it is to say, Democrat leaders only agree on two things: they hate President Bush, and they want to raise your taxes. After three years of sitting on the sidelines and booing from the bleachers, this is all they can come up with? All they have to offer is a creepy, Orwellian mantra: Bush bad, taxes good."
Administration officials said Mr. Bush's address would also call for making billions of dollars in recently enacted tax cuts permanent over the next 10 years. In addition, the president will again push his longstanding plan to create personal investment accounts for Social Security, the advisers said. 
Mr. Bush will open his nationally televised prime-time address with an update on the administration's campaign against terrorism and on national security, his strongest issue against the Democrats. He will then move into domestic policy.
Last year Mr. Bush did the opposite -- he began with domestic policy and ended with foreign policy -- but that was because he used the speech to make the case for military action against Iraq, the official said. The balance was struck for dramatic purposes as much as anything, the official suggested.
"Try to imagine flipping it the other way in which you have that very somber address about a nation at war, and go, Now, let's turn to the economy," the offical said. "It's just, you almost -- you almost had to end on that point."
In her pre-rebuttal, Ms. Pelosi said that Mr. Bush had alienated important allies and that Americans were suffering "the dangerous consequences of the president's distorted priorities" overseas. 
"In the State of the Union, President Bush must explain how he plans to restore America's standing in the eyes of the world," Ms. Pelosi said.
She said Mr. Bush's policy toward Iraq had been "marked by confusion and uncertainty," and called the president's antiterrorism campaign "strategically unfocused."
"Never before has a president done so much, so fast, to undermine our relations with other nations," Ms. Pelosi said, adding, "As a nation, we must do more than show our strength. We must showour greatness."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE STUMP SPEECH/Representative Richard A. Gephardt; 
A Washington Resume, With a Heartland Call to Arms

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WATERLOO, Iowa, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
The crowd was cheering and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri was working the microphone with his finger jabbing and his fist pounding. For months now, he has crisscrossed this state, promoting his experience as a leader in Congress, his promise to provide universal health insurance and his long commitment to fair trade and working families.
 But as the Iowa caucuses near, Mr. Gephardt has turned up the fire on a stump speech that once conveyed more plain-spoken sincerity than flash or flair. Locked in a four-way battle for Iowa caucus voters, Mr. Gephardt is working hard to engage his audience. 
 Recently he has incorporated the stories of struggling couples into his speech, introducing, for example, Mary and Gene Schrandt of Waverly, Iowa, who smiled shyly from the audience as he described how his health care plan would benefit them. 
Instead of simply arguing that it would be better to repeal President Bush's tax cuts to finance his universal health insurance plan, he has started polling Democratic voters at some of his meetings.
"Raise your hand if you really love the Bush tax cuts," he asked voters recently at a high school gymnasium here. Not a single hand.
"O.K., raise your hand if you'd like to have health care," he said, "that could never be taken away." 
A flurry of hands shot up. "I rest my case," he said triumphantly. 
He has also tried to add zest to his events, traveling to some campaign stops with a band, the Creek Dippers, that croons folk tunes, and arriving in Mason City at a union rally on Thursday in a caravan of 18-wheeler rigs with horns blaring. 
The shifts are notable for Mr. Gephardt, who usually sticks so doggedly to his campaign message that he still peppers his speeches with phrases he used the day he announced his candidacy in February.
He still focuses on health care and trade as he did during his first presidential bid in 1988, promising to defend Medicare and Social Security and to renegotiate trade deals with Mexico and China that have been blamed for severe job losses.
He still accuses President Bush of catering to the wealthy while disregarding the needs of working families and failing to provide health insurance, adequate financing for education and a thriving economy. "This guy is a job killer," he told supporters in Seattle this week. 
And his speech always emphasizes his experience, focusing on his 27 years in Congress and his role as Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. He speaks of his travels to Mexico and China, meetings with presidents and parliamentarians and his contribution to President Bill Clinton's economic plan.
Unlike his challengers, he often says, he won't need "training wheels" in the Oval Office.
"When Clinton was president, we created 22 million new jobs in this country," Mr. Gephardt says. "I led the fight in the House to get it done.
"I don't have to come here this morning and say, 'Gee, I think I know how to do this,' " he says. "We did it. We passed an economic program that was good for people."
He is tightening his speech, though, and sharpening his words as he works to counter his image as a Washington insider more fluent in the language of Congressional appropriations than in campaign rallies. 
The Republicans, he thunders, "will cut or privatize Social Security and Medicare over my dead body!"
He has also been hammering at Howard Dean, saying at nearly every stop that Dr. Dean, as governor of Vermont, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement -- Nafta -- and Republican efforts to slow the growth of Medicare. He often reminds voters they will never have to worry about him keeping his word, a not-so veiled reference to Dr. Dean, who he says has shifted stances on several issues.
When he was House majority leader, Mr. Gephardt says, he led the fight against Nafta and refused to back down, even though President Clinton pressed him to support it. 
"I will never let you down on trade!" Mr. Gephardt told a cheering crowd recently. "I will never be a president who will put up with the kind of stupid, bad trade deals that we've put up with that sell American jobs down the drain. It is time for a president who will lead not only America, but the whole world for a trade policy that is good for every human being! 
"You've got to be tough," he said. "We've got to get some leadership going here, not only here but across the world. I will be that leader. If you work anywhere in this world, you've got to make a living wage." 
It is a populist call that seems to resonate among the union members and older voters who typically nod and applaud as Mr. Gephardt works a room, shaking hands and cheerfully posing for photographs with his smiling supporters.
He talks about his ideas, such as increasing the minimum wage, subsidizing the training of teachers and to reduce American reliance on Middle Eastern oil by promoting renewable energy sources like wind power, ethanol and solar energy.
But Mr. Gephardt also emphasizes his personal experiences, discussing his humble origins and his religious values as a way to connect with voters on an emotional level.
He tells voters that his pledge to provide health insurance to all Americans was inspired by his son, Matt, who would have died from cancer as an infant had the family not had health insurance to cover the experimental treatments.
His promise to subsidize the college costs of those studying to become teachers was inspired by his daughter, Kate, whose first job as a teacher paid so little that she could not afford to pay her student loans. He and his wife, Jane, he says, are still paying those loans. 
And he describes the struggles of his father, a milk-truck driver, and his mother, a secretary. 
"I grew up poor," Mr. Gephardt says. "Neither of my parents got through high school. My dad's best job was a Teamster truck driver; he lost it after 10 years and he never again made that much money.
"I am one of you," he tells his supporters. "I've never forgotten where I came from."
What he doesn't say is almost as notable as what he does. These days, Mr. Gephardt generally does not discuss his support for the war in Iraq, gambling that people care more about pocketbook issues and a campaign that he says has three goals: "jobs, jobs and jobs." 
"Only the Democrats know how to make the economy work for everybody," says Mr. Gephardt, building to a standard laugh line. "You know what I tell my Republican friends? If you want to live like a Republican, you better vote for the Democrats!"
This article is the third in a series looking at the basic campaign speeches of the presidential candidates.

HEADLINE: My Crossover Vote 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BROOKS; E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Conservatives like me don't get a vote in Democratic primaries, but we do have an interest. Even we frothing right-wingers know that the country needs a serious and responsible Democratic Party to counter the Republicans when they need countering, and beat them when they need beating. 
 So with the first actual votes about to be cast, I've been figuring out whom to root for. I've graded the candidates in three categories. 
 INTEGRITY/LEADERSHIP -- By this stage in the 1992 race, Bill Clinton's character flaws were already evident. None of this year's candidates seem to have any of those sorts of problems. But are they true to their convictions? Would they improve the tone in Washington? 
Gephardt, A -- He's a man of integrity, who, putting his career at risk, has stuck tenaciously to his positions on the war, trade and the working class. Also, he's an experienced and fair-minded legislator. 
Lieberman, A- -- Nobody has faced more hostile crowds. Nobody has more experience building bipartisan coalitions. He has problems looking presidential.
Edwards, A- -- Much more substantive than he seems at first. He is offended by cultural elitism, the besetting sin of national Democrats. 
Kerry, B- -- Turned fuzzy when challenged. Personally aloof, he may have trouble building coalitions.
Clark, C -- Two years ago, he lauded Bush and his "great team." Now he savages them with loopy conspiracy theories. Who is this guy and why aren't more of his military colleagues enthusiastic supporters?
Dean, F -- He's vague about what he's for, but he's venomous toward anyone who disagrees with him. If elected, political discourse would sink to new lows.
DOMESTIC POLICY -- Democratic proposals have grown more ambitious and expensive as the revenue to pay for them has grown scarce. Most of these plans, especially middle-class tax increases, would have no chance in a Republican or closely divided Congress. We'd be left with modest, overlapping proposals. High marks here go for any hint of creativity. 
Lieberman, A -- One of the last free-trading Democrats, he would carry on where Clinton left off, with tax credits for high-tech innovation and the like.
Kerry, A- -- His bold plans for energy independence and national service should inspire the next president, whoever he is.
Edwards, A- -- Has the most detailed proposals. He focuses his attention on lower-skilled workers, who have seen their incomes stagnate.
Clark, B -- Has embraced generic but responsible Democratic ideas. Little that is daring or dangerous.
Dean, C -- On the stump, he rejects Clintonite centrism; in Vermont he exemplified it. If he won, who would serve: Governor Dean or Candidate Dean? 
Gephardt, F -- Would capitalize on rising protectionist sentiment in the G.O.P. to erect trade barriers, setting off ferocious conflicts with the rest of the world and impoverishing workers here and abroad.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS -- The foreign policy debate has been absurdly backward-looking: how many angels can dance on the head of an Iraq resolution? High grades here go to those who are not merely reacting against Bush, but have their own view of the threats and opportunities we face. 
Gephardt, A -- Deeply affected by 9/11. He believes in aggressive action to prevent further attacks.
Lieberman, A -- No other candidate has thought so much about Islamic fascism, and how to counter it. 
Clark, B -- Of all the candidates, he's the most wedded to multilateral institutions. One may disagree, but it's hard not to be impressed by the sophistication of his thinking. 
Edwards, B- -- He voted for the war but then, in the face of political pressure, against the $87 billion required to continue it.
Kerry, B- -- His instincts are slightly hawkish. The question is whether he would be able to make a tough decision, then stick to it.
Dean, C -- His advisers and speeches are on the dovish side, but he claims that his instincts, despite his Iraq war stand, are hawkish. Screaming to a crowd, he's Kucinich; talking to a small group, he's Kerry.
My Democratic friends complain, but this is a pretty strong field of candidates. I fear Dean's temperament and Gephardt's trade policy. But if any of the other guys were elected, the country would be fine, and we right-wingers would still find plenty to fume about.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Files Suit Opposing Effort By U.S.to Limit Bank Oversight 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. MCKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, filed a lawsuit Friday on behalf of an aggrieved bank customer in a direct challenge to the Bush administration's position that federally chartered banks cannot be touched under state consumer protection laws.
 Mr. Spitzer said he hoped that the lawsuit would test banking regulations published last week, rules that have been criticized by many of the attorneys general in the country as well as many Democratic members of Congress and consumer groups. 
 Mr. Spitzer, who has differed with the federal government over whether he has the jurisdiction to go after Wall Street abuses and polluters in other states, said he saw the new banking regulations as part of a larger pattern intended to relieve pressure on business. 
 "This is a continuation on the part of the Bush administration to pre-empt state enforcement in areas that are critical to ensuring civil rights and consumer rights," he said. "Things from predatory lending to spam to the quality of the air are implicated."
 The new regulations were issued on Jan. 7 by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the Treasury Department, which oversees national banks. In essence, the regulations sum up what several courts have held over the years: only the federal government has the authority to regulate national banks, and federal banking laws override state statutes. 
 That means states cannot enforce their consumer protection laws against national banks or their subsidiaries, among them the Bank of America Corporation, Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia, Bank One and Citicorp.
 Robert M. Garsson, a spokesman for the comptroller of the currency, said the rules, which take effect in 30 days, mirror what courts have ruled going back to the creation of the national bank system under President Lincoln. "It's not something someone just dreamed up yesterday," he said. "The states don't have the power to curtail federally authorized activity."
 The major banks supported the regulatory changes, mostly because dealing with a patchwork of banking laws across the country makes it harder for them to do business. Edward Yingling, the executive vice president of the American Bankers Association, predicted Mr. Spitzer would lose if the case ever came before a federal court. "He's flying in the face of 130 years of court decisions, including numerous Supreme Court decisions," he said.
 In a letter opposing the regulations, the attorneys general, however, said the states have historically shared jurisdiction with the federal regulators over national banks when it comes to consumer protection laws and have enforced those laws without objections from the Treasury Department. 
 Diana L. Taylor, New York's superintendent of banks, has also been critical of the federal comptroller, John D. Hawke Jr., for pushing through the regulations. Mr. Hawke has shielded every nationally chartered bank from any obligations to follow state lending laws, she has said.
 The issue has come to the fore in recent years as more states have adopted laws to stop so-called predatory lending practices, like hidden fees, excessive interest rates and high-cost credit insurance. At the same time, federal courts have recently overturned attempts by San Francisco and Santa Monica, Calif., to limit fees at automated teller machines and a California law that requires greater disclosures of credit card issuers.
 The test case that Mr. Spitzer brought comes from a 1974 mortgage issued by Mechanics Exchange Savings Bank to Robert H. Hall of East Greenbush, N.Y., near Albany. The $27,000 home loan was to be paid off over 25 years, and Mr. Hall arranged for an automated payment each month of $201. 
 According to the complaint, the loan was sold several times and ended up at First Horizon Home Loan Corporation in Irving, Tex., a subsidiary of a national bank, First Tennessee. Mr. Hall forgot the terms of the loan, and the bank continued to collect the payments long after his paperwork shows the loan to have been paid, collecting an extra $9,461 before Mr. Hall objected. 
 Then the bank said that the original lender had made a mistake and that Mr. Hall should have been paying $16 more a month. The bank then unilaterally extended the mortgage an extra 11 years. Mr. Hall refused to pay. The bank threatened to foreclose on the property, according to the complaint. 
 Hours after Mr. Spitzer filed his suit in State Supreme Court in Albany accusing First Horizon of deceptive business practices and unlawful collection methods, the bank dropped its threat to foreclose on the property, though it did not promise to return the $9,461 in extra payments, Mr. Spitzer's aides said. The bank's action came shortly after federal regulators, informed of the case by a reporter, contacted its managers. 
 "This case demonstrates perfectly why our role is critical and that the banks are already using the office of the currency comptroller as a shield," Mr. Spitzer said.
 But Mr. Garsson said that Mr. Hall had never asked the federal regulators to intervene. "This is why we would like for these cases to be brought to our attention, because this is the kind of thing we can fix in an hour," he said.
 Mr. Spitzer and many other state attorneys general from both parties disagree, asserting that the administration wants to protect the large banks from state efforts to rein in unfair banking practices. "The effort to shield nationally chartered banks from our capacity to enforce predatory lending and other consumer protection statutes against them will leave New York State consumers naked to rank abuses," Mr. Spitzer said.

 THE MAN IN MY BASEMENT
By Walter Mosley.
249 pp. New York:
Little, Brown & Company. $22.95.
 WALTER MOSLEY is best known for his Easy Rawlins books, a series of drawly gumshoe noirs, set in postwar Los Angeles, that bucked the trend for drunk, womanizing white detectives (Chandler's Marlowe, Hammett's Sam Spade) by starring an intermittently sober, married African-American detective. The edges of these novels frayed into something far more interesting than the mystery genre normally permits, and they rightly won Mosley critical and popular admiration, along with the ambiguous accolade of being one of Bill Clinton's favorite novelists.
Despite the success of the Rawlins series, it is obvious that over the last decade Mosley has felt increasingly fidgety in terms of genre. He has objected several times to being pigeonholed as a mystery writer, and he has published two nonfiction polemics, two spooky-kooky works of science fiction and "RL's Dream," a novel about an imaginary bluesman named Soupspoon Wise. Now we have "The Man in My Basement," a book that clearly aspires to be both literary fiction and a state-of-the-nation address. Trying too hard be both, however, it succeeds in being neither.
The novel's narrator, Charles Blakey, lives alone in his family's old and sprawling house in "a secluded colored neighborhood way back from the highway." His life, like that of so many of Mosley's principal characters, is on the skids. Fecklessness and anomie have rotted him away into an "unemployed, drunk loudmouth" with a serious debt problem. Charles is down to pretty much his last bottle of whiskey when a "small white man" named Anniston Bennet shows up on his doorstep and asks if he can move into his "stand-up basement" for the summer. Bennet proposes to pay Charles nearly $50,000 for 65 days' accommodation; Charles's only duties will be to feed him and to keep the basement clean.
Shortly before Bennet is due to begin his stay, several large boxes are delivered, the contents of which Charles assembles in his basement according to precise instructions. The result is a nine-foot by nine-foot iron cage, with an elaborate system of locks and hasps. Bennet arrives as arranged on July 1, and moves into the cage. He brings with him a formidable library, including works by Lawrence Durrell and T. S. Eliot, "Moby-Dick" and "a book called 'Vineland.' " There are also, Charles notes, "two sets of powder-blue pajamas decorated by red dashes at all angles to one another. All in all it was like a summer camp for a cracked adult." 
With its grille-like walls, the cell unmistakably resembles a confessional box, and so it proves to be. The remainder of the novel recounts the two months Charles and Bennet spend together, and the bizarre, sadomasochistic dance of dialogue they perform. Bennet has come, he tells Charles, for "a punishment . . . not a vacation," in secular atonement for crimes so chilling that he at first refuses to name them outright. This apparently unremarkable man has, he tells Charles flatly, "broken every commandment" on almost every continent.
It turns out that Bennet has had a career in what he calls "reclamations." A reclaimer is someone who will, for the right price, fetch anything for anyone -- he is the ultimate Jeeves. Thus Bennet once "gave a 9-month-old infant as a present to a man's dog," because the man "wanted to see if the myth of wolves raising men could be true." He has procured gemstones, human organs and human beings, and trafficked them throughout the world, beyond the reach or even the knowledge of the security services. "People like me move around, but no one knows our names," he tells Charles. As the novel progresses, and Charles is brought to meditate more and more explicitly on the subject of evil, it becomes apparent that Mosley has designed Bennet as a symbol rather than as a believable character. He is the agglutination of all that America would like to forget about, a demon summoned into being by the rapacities of global capitalism. 
Mosley has always had a strong sense of himself as a spokesman for a collective: the diagnostician of group pathologies and the prescriber of group cures (see, for instance, his recent book "What Next: A Memoir Toward World Peace"). "The Man in My Basement," with its heavily allegorized characters, is obviously intended as a stylized commentary on the ethics of contemporary America. The first half of the novel, which Mosley spends getting Bennet into his cell in Charles's basement, feels like a fairly flimsy pretense for the ensuing dialogues on evil. The result is a book that could, without much wastage, easily be turned into a one-act play of pseudophilosophy -- the curtain rising on a white man in a cell being overemblematically catechized on the nature of evil by his African-American warder.
There are numerous minor problems with the novel, including Charles's voice, which veers implausibly between the barfly ("Life meant nothing, but I was having a good time") and the lyricist (a woman's skin is described as being like "a parchment, incredibly old and almost erased by age and rain, the slight gradation of color coming from sepia glyphs whose secrets were now gone"). The book's major undoing, however, is that neither Bennet nor Charles has anything insightful to say on the subject of evil. Here, for instance, is Charles on American guilt: "I guess we all have some blood on our hands. If America does something, then the people do it too. That's why they call us Americans." On Iraq: "We just fought a war against a supposedly evil man, but then if you ask what evil is, everybody has a different answer." And here is Bennet on American myopia: "You think that you can have the easy life of TV and gasoline without someone suffering and dying somewhere?" These, dismayingly enough, are the intellectual diamonds of the debate.
It would cheat Mosley out of what little suspense his novel possesses to reveal the ending; it is enough to say that it neither revokes nor redeems the triviality of what has gone before. This is a book that masquerades as a literary thriller and as a philosophical fable, but is not concentratedly strange enough to provoke tension or intelligent enough to provoke reflection. Read Hannah Arendt, read Dietrich Bonhoeffer, read St. Augustine; these writers, none of whom is alive, have far more to say about contemporary iniquity than Walter Mosley does in "The Man in My Basement." Mosley's book, intended as an exposure of the banality of evil, suffers instead from the evil of banality.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE PREP; 
The SAT III?

BYLINE:  By Cecilia Capuzzi Simon; Cecilia Capuzzi Simon, former managing editor of Teacher magazine, write's regularly about psychology

 BODY:
As any parent will attest, predicting the behavior of an evolving, Impressionable 17-year-old is a crapshoot. Will he show up at an 8 a.m. class, or party too much? Will he stay in college in the face of personal or financial challenges, or even persevere through a difficult course?
 "To stick with college shows remarkable resilience and initiative," says Wayne Camara, vice president of research at the College Board, which administers the SAT. "They are different skills than cognitive abilities." The SAT, the admissions exam used by 80 percent of American colleges, addresses only a student's cognitive abilities, or academic aptitude. It does not tell the whole story. 
 Colleges roll the dice every year around this time, as applications flood admissions offices. Small elite colleges can delve the inner soul with essays, interviews and intuition, but most large universities must rely on cold hard numbers: grade point average and admissions test scores. 
To better predict college readiness, Dr. Camara says, "we need to look at noncognitive factors -- personality, temperament, flexibility, proclivity to learn, ability to adjust, to get along with a roommate, to make appropriate decisions about studying."
To the tune of almost $2 million so far, the organization is backing two outside research projects to identify and quantify such traits, much as employers do in personnel testing and hiring, and develop a standardized test that might supplement the SAT. Two prominent psychologists head the projects: Neal Schmitt, chairman of the department of psychology at Michigan State University, and Robert J. Sternberg, a professor at Yale whose term just ended as president of the American Psychological Association (where Dr. Camara headed testing before joining the College Board in 1994). Both projects have recently completed initial phases with promising results, but the tests would be at least six years off, and how they would be used has not been determined. While cautious about the noncognitive future, Gaston Caperton, the College Board president, says the board is "serious about this."
"We know the value of a test of analytic ability," Mr. Caperton says. "But we also recognize that there are other kinds of intelligence, and that schools would want to know more about them because they are important to students' performance, and to their careers."
Dr. Schmitt, an expert in personnel selection, borrowed concepts from conventional employment tests that present situations and ask test takers to choose a reaction. Dr. Sternberg's test has similar elements but includes a more controversial component: cartoon captioning and short-story writing to quantify creativity. 
Dr. Sternberg says the goal of his research, which he calls the Rainbow Project, is twofold: to increase a college's chance of identifying students who will profit from its environment and to counteract the pronounced gap on SAT scores of white and non-Asian minority applicants. His test challenges traditional ideas about intelligence. In his view, there are three separate intelligences: analytic, creative and practical. Analytic intelligence -- what the SAT measures -- lends itself to memorization and analyzing information; people express creative intelligence by applying knowledge in a novel way; practical intelligence reveals itself in everyday situations. Dr. Sternberg says that analytic intelligence may not be enough to excel in college or in life. A person who is strong in creative or practical skills may thrive in an academic setting even if he doesn't excel in the analytic skills tested by the SAT. That student, however, is derailed by the test. 
Perhaps the most elusive aspect of Dr. Sternberg's test is his effort to measure creativity. In Phase 1, students were asked to write short stories based on a title -- say, "The Octopus's Sneakers." Others dictated stories into tape recorders based on a page of loosely linked drawings. Students also wrote captions for old New Yorker cartoons.
The test was given to 973 students at 13 colleges and graded by trained readers. Dr. Sternberg says the test is twice as likely as SAT scores to predict students' first-year grades. It also narrowed the gap between minority and white scores. In Phase 2's longitudinal study, more than 5,000 students will be followed through four years of college. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Indiana at Bloomington and Yale have committed to participate.
For his study, Dr. Schmitt searched the mission statements of 35 four-year colleges looking for keywords and goals describing ideals and personality traits the colleges valued. He boiled them down to 12 "dimensions." Among them: motivation to continue learning beyond the classroom, an appreciation of art and music, multicultural tolerance, ability to communicate effectively and get along with others, leadership, social responsibility, perseverance, ethics and adaptability. From those, he developed situational questions. For example: What would you do if you discovered that your roommate was writing essays for other students for a fee? There is even a question about the "freshman 15": What if you're already overweight and add 15 pounds? Another part of the test asks biographical questions to tease out leadership traits, community mindedness and desire to learn beyond the classroom.
The test was given to 654 freshmen at Michigan State. Dr. Schmitt found that his test, when combined with ACT and SAT scores, improved the chances of predicting freshman grades by 6 percentage points. The test outperformed the SAT and ACT in predicting absenteeism, and outperformed peer ratings and self-ratings in the 12 dimensions. Dr. Schmitt expects to administer a revised version at about a dozen campuses.
A spokesman for ACT Inc. says it is not developing a similar test and would not comment about the College Board's efforts. But Dr. Schmitt and Dr. Sternberg are not the only educators studying noncognitive measures to gauge college readiness.
William E. Sedlacek, professor of education at the University of Maryland, uses dimensions similar to Dr. Schmitt's but also measures factors like self-image, family support and how a student copes with racism. 
A consortium of universities -- North Carolina State University, Appalachian State University, North Carolina A&T State University, University of North Carolina-Pembroke and the University of Maryland -- has applied for a $400,000 federal grant to help create a test based on Dr. Sedlacek's research that would "more accurately assess university applicants" than admission exams can do alone, says Raymond Ting, associate professor of counselor education at North Carolina State. Dr. Ting, who coordinated the grant application, says efforts to standardize psychological and personal measures are the new wave, especially as higher education's minority population grows. "Students have to be considered more fully as individuals, not just test scores," he adds.
Dr. Sedlacek finds it pointless to revisit traditional tests of academic readiness. "We focus too much on how to improve what we already have, like the SAT," he says. "But that's the wrong question. We don't know how to do the verbal or quantitative testing any better than we do." 
Oregon State University is using Dr. Sedlacek's measures to assess applicants' potential, to provide direction once the student is on campus, and in making financial aid decisions. The measures are also used by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering to select students for scholarships. Dundee Holt, the council's vice president for development and communications, says the council finds such measures a better "indicator of success than the SAT for minority students" and doesn't consider entrance exam scores. "We've had enough students who've earned their doctorate with 900's on their SAT's to know that there are other things going on," Mr. Holt says.
SO which student will make it through four years of college? According to a study by the Department of Education, the most significant precollege factor in whether a student graduates is the intensity of high school curriculum. Curriculum "reflects 41 percent of the academic resources students bring to higher education," the report states. Class rank and grade point average -- less reliable benchmarks because of disparities in school quality and standards nationwide -- reflect 29 percent and test scores just 30 percent.
With the SAT under fire from several quarters, including a handful of elite colleges that have recently made scores optional, it's not surprising that the College Board wants to increase its ability to assess students. Complaints about the exam are well documented: It favors whites and males, and an overemphasis on scores has turned the admissions process into the "educational equivalent of a nuclear arms race," as Richard Atkinson, former president of the University of California, once put it. Dr. Atkinson's threat to drop the SAT as an application requirement jarred the College Board into revamping the exam to better reflect high school curriculum. The changes are due in 2005.
In addition, the Supreme Court ruling last June in a University of Michigan case -- which upheld a university's right to consider race in admissions but outlawed quotas -- has admissions officials scrambling for ways to identify promising minority students.
Educators have a new buzzword to describe the admissions process: "holistic." 
Jerome Lucido, vice provost for enrollment and management at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says his first thought when hearing a presentation on Dr. Sternberg's test was: "That's exactly the information we're trying to extrapolate when we read an applicant's portfolio."
At competitive schools, academic achievement is a given in any application, making entrance exam scores almost beside the point in admissions decisions. "This generation of students is so good we don't have to worry about academic performance," Dr. Lucido says. "What we need to look at is whether they are good citizens; will they challenge the faculty, will they engage in research?"
MOST large public universities don't have the resources to review portfolios. Penn State, for example, received just over 51,000 applications for its freshman class of 2003. "We're not 'reading' every application," says Randall Deike, its director of research for enrollment management and administration. For such universities, which rely on test scores and grade point average, a test that measures motivation, leadership and good judgment would seem just the ticket. 
But the tests face hurdles not only in design but also in institutional and public acceptance. "I'm a great admirer of their goals," says Paul Sackett, professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota and a member of the College Board research advisory committee. "The real question is: Will they be able to develop a test that holds up under scrutiny?" Foremost, as Dr. Sackett points out, is controlling for fakery. You can't bluff a math problem. But looking at sample questions, it's not hard to figure out socially acceptable responses. While fabricators may be flagged by tricks embedded in the tests -- asking follow-up questions or multiple questions designed to illicit the same response -- such tests are not prep-proof. Coaching can teach how to write a creative caption or answer questions in a way that reflects desirable qualities. 
Educators say they are intrigued by the research but have reservations about using such measures competitively. Dr. Lucido expresses concern about test questions that could eliminate students "because of some disability that's mental in nature." Patte Barth, senior associate with the Education Trust, an advocacy group for poor schoolchildren, calls the whole thing "squirrelly." Even in the SAT reasoning test, Ms. Barth says, there is room for interpretation. "You take something even more difficult to measure, and I don't think they could hone this accurately for any meaning."
Robert Schaeffer, public education director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a watchdog group that advocates for testing reform, says efforts to move the SAT beyond academics "is like painting lipstick on a pig."
"FairTest agrees with Sternberg's underlying thesis that college readiness is far broader than what the SAT measures," Mr. Schaeffer says, "but no test -- neither the SAT, a tweaked SAT or an alternative -- is necessary in the college admissions process."
Both Dr. Schmitt and Dr. Sternberg have presented their findings to college officials nationwide, Dr. Sternberg says, to ultimately interest them in using such a test to assess applicants. Convincing colleges (not to mention parents and students) of the need for another test could be a challenge.
"I think for most colleges, what they already have seems to be working fine," says Robert L. Linn, co-director of the Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing at the University of Colorado, in defense of the SAT. "There's been a lot of research over the years that's been barren in turning up anything better."
But, in fact, Dr. Camara cites something that predicts success better than entrance exams or high school curriculum. The No. 1 predictor of whether a student graduates, he says, is which college a student attends. Ninety-eight percent of Harvard's 1996-97 freshman class, for example, graduated within six years; Chapel Hill and Penn State had 80 percent rates; less competitive public institutions had rates no higher than the mid-50's.
William G. Bowen and Derek Bok's "Shape of the River," in which the authors followed minority students with moderate SAT scores through four years of Ivy League college and beyond, also suggests that campus environment is crucial. Such students, they found, were more likely to succeed at an elite university than at a community college. That begs a question, Mr. Schaeffer of FairTest says: Does the SAT measure talent or does it simply provide entree into the colleges more likely to nurture and sustain their students?
"It's a difficult puzzle," he says.
That, in essence, is what Dr. Sternberg and Dr. Schmitt are trying to piece together. How do you understand the mind and motivations of an adolescent whose world is about to open up before him? Why do some succeed and others, even the academically gifted, struggle?
Sometimes, explains Dr. Linn, it's as simple, and inexplicable, as stumbling on an activity or subject that grabs the imagination. "I've seen students who were floundering, then all of a sudden something sparked their interest and they became very good students," Dr. Linn says. "Until that time, they were not."
Dr. Camara does not doubt the complexities of the task undertaken. "We're trying to predict human behavior," he says. "We're not predicting the economy or the price of gold in six months."

HEADLINE: MOVIES: CRITIC'S CHOICE 

BYLINE:  By Anita Gates

 BODY:
NEAR the end of THE HOURS (2002), Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) recalls a joyous moment. "I remember thinking, this is the beginning of happiness," she says. "It wasn't the beginning. It was happiness. It was the moment. Right then." There are lots of such moments in Stephen Daldry's intoxicating film interpretation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is writing "Mrs. Dalloway" in the 1920's, an anguished California housewife (Julianne Moore) is reading it in the 1950's, and Clarissa is living it in the 21st century (right down to the suicide by defenestration). Ms. Kidman won the best actress Oscar, but her performance is far from the only outstanding one here -- Sunday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 4 p.m. on Showtime. 
 If film schools ever need a test to separate the serious future filmmakers from the dilettantes, they could just show them Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe's LOST IN LA MANCHA (2002). It's a painfully observant documentary about Terry Gilliam's ill-fated attempt to make a film inspired by "Man of La Mancha," starring Jean Rochefort and Johnny Depp, and it does not make movie production look like fun. Virtually everything that can go wrong does, from Mr. Rochefort's health to monsoon rains -- Thursday at 8 p.m. and Friday at 8 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on IFC. 
 Screenplays don't get much witchier than THE LITTLE FOXES (1941). Lillian Hellman wrote it, based on her stage play, and Dorothy Parker, Alan Campbell (Parker's husband at the time) and Arthur Kober are credited with extra scenes and dialogue. And they've got Bette Davis to deliver it. This was one of Davis's great roles, as Regina Giddens, a Southern banker's wife who could sit quietly and watch her terminally ill husband try to climb the stairs on his hands and knees to reach his medicine. Just because he wouldn't participate in a financial scheme. Or maybe just because Regina is hateful. William Wyler directed an amazing cast, which also includes Teresa Wright (her screen debut), Herbert Marshall and Dan Duryea -- Thursday at midnight on TCM.
 The only time Pixar's animated hit A BUG'S LIFE (1998) is successful at humor for grown-ups is when its ant hero, Flik (the voice of Dave Foley), finds himself in the insect equivalent of Times Square. But for children, the film has a lot to offer: color, action, cuteness and lessons about teamwork and persistence. The ant colony where Flik lives is being harassed by a menacing gang of grasshoppers. Flik is sent to the big city to find some tough-guy insects who can scare the grasshoppers away, permanently. But he mistakes an unemployed troupe of flea-circus performers for warriors and the performers decide not to point out the truth -- Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 7.
 The Wild West heroes of "Shanghai Noon" are back in a sequel, David Dobkin's SHANGHAI KNIGHTS (2003). Chon Wang (Jackie Chan, undisputed king of martial arts comedy) is in London to avenge his father's murder. Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) has come along to help and to lust after Wang's sister, Chon Lin (Fann Wong). "You've got a great body," Roy tells her, then adds, "You must work out." No, the film, set in Victorian England, doesn't bother with period language or attitudes, and the music is decidedly late 20th century. In their adventures, the characters encounter the Queen, Jack the Ripper and Stonehenge -- Saturday at 9 p.m. on Starz. Anita Gates
