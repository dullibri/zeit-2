HEADLINE: U.S. Is Planning A Move to Seize Pol Pot for Trial

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
President Clinton has ordered the Departments of Defense, State and Justice to devise plans for the arrest and trial of Pol Pot, the shadowy Khmer Rouge leader responsible for the death of perhaps a million Cambodians in the 1970's.
Clinton Administration officials and Western diplomats said that the Khmer Rouge appeared to be near collapse as a result of mass defections and internal fighting. Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders are said to be in hiding in the Cambodian jungle only a few miles across the border with Thailand. 
 The Thai Government, diplomats said, has suggested it would be willing to take Pol Pot into custody as long as the United States agreed to spirit him out of Thailand within hours of his capture.
Senior American military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that intelligence reports from Southeast Asia showed that the Thai military had actually taken Pol Pot into custody late last week but then freed him.
The Thai military, the officials said, may have feared that his capture would antagonize China, long an ally of the Khmer Rouge, and would complicate the foreign policy of Thailand's recently installed Government, which is already struggling with an economic crisis.
Spokesmen at the Thai Embassy in Washington had no comment. Other American officials described the intelligence reports as sketchy and said it would be unfair to criticize the Thai military on the basis of such fragmentary evidence.
While Administration officials cautioned that there was no guarantee that the ailing Khmer Rouge leader would be apprehended, they said that recent developments along the border were so significant that President Clinton issued a written order Monday to organize logistics for Pol Pot's capture and trial.
Under one plan being discussed within the Administration, an American military plane would take Pol Pot from Thailand to a third country, possibly the Netherlands, where international tribunals are prosecuting war crimes carried out in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
A military official said the Pentagon had drawn up a list of interim sites where Pol Pot might be held until a location for the trial was selected. These include the Northern Marianas Islands and Wake Island -- both American territories in the Pacific -- or the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
"We've had many false alarms before with the Khmer Rouge, but this may be our best chance to get Pol Pot," said a Clinton Administration official who is involved in the planning. "We're not going to be caught unprepared if he's made available to us."
Another American official said that "if we don't get Pol Pot this time, he may die before we ever have the chance to bring him to justice."
The official said that despite the reports of Pol Pot's capture and release by Thai soldiers last week, the Thai Government "is being cooperative, and their cooperation will be essential if we're to pull this off."
Under President Clinton's order, officials said, the State Department has been directed to oversee negotiations with Thailand, the Netherlands and other nations that might be involved in the apprehension and trial. The Justice Department has been asked to review the legal authority that would be needed under international law for the United States to become involved in the detention of Pol Pot.
Western diplomats said prosecutors at the international tribunals in The Hague had already tentatively agreed to organize a trial for Pol Pot for crimes against humanity, as long as the United Nations Security Council empowers them to oversee the prosecution. The diplomats said the United States, France and other nations had already begun drafting a Security Council resolution to deal with such a trial.
From 1975 to 1979, Pol Pot, who is now in his 70's and in poor health, turned Cambodia into a vast labor camp. Millions of Cambodians, especially city-dwellers, were driven from their homes and forced to work in the fields under primitive conditions. Pol Pot labeled anyone with money or education an enemy of the revolution, and much of the middle class was killed during his four-year reign of terror or starved to death.
The Khmer Rouge were toppled by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979. They resumed their guerrilla struggle in the jungle, where they have remained for two decades. They have armed and fed themselves with the proceeds of the sale of gems and timber harvested in areas of Cambodia under their control.
The movement began to fall apart last year, when the followers of Pol Pot turned against him, apparently over his decision to order the assassination of the Khmer Rouge defense chief, Son Sen, and 14 relatives, including his grandchildren.
After the killings, Pol Pot's former comrades tried him and sentenced him to house arrest. He is reported to be under the control of his former top military commander, Ta Mok.
In interviews last year with an American reporter who observed portions of the trial, Pol Pot said that "My conscience is clear."
"I came to carry out the struggle, not to kill people" he explained. He insisted that estimates that millions had died during the Khmer Rouge reign were overstated. "To say that millions died is too much," he said.

Clinton Orders Operation To Arrest and Try Pol Pot
President Clinton has ordered the Departments of Defense, State and Justice to devise plans for the arrest and trial of Pol Pot, the shadowy Khmer Rouge leader responsible for the death of at least a million Cambodians in the 1970's. A1 

Secretary General Kofi Annan said the United Nations would go back to monitor the next, more problematic, vote in Cambodia. The vote, scheduled for July, comes five years after the United Nations ran the most democratic election in Cambodia's history. But Mr. Annan warned the Government last week that the election this summer was in danger of being neither fair nor credible. A9

The body of Muhyiaddin al-Sharif, the bomb-maker, was found at the scene of an explosion in the West Bank last month. Hamas blamed Israel for the death, but an investigation by the Palestinian Authority found that it was the result of a power struggle within the militant organization. (AP)
 
French Expulsion Policy
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, under attack from some of his own allies, defended his Government's policy of denying residency rights in France to thousands of illegal immigrants and sending many home. Mr. Jospin told the National Assembly that the expulsions were a result of case-by-case studies based on legislation passed by Parliament. He said they would be applied humanely but firmly.

HEADLINE: Indians Striving to Save Their Languages

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: HOOPA, Calif.

 BODY:
At the age of 88 and blind in one eye, James Jackson Jr. keeps a crystal clear memory of a tiny linguistic skirmish in a continental campaign that has brought most of North America's Indian languages to the brink of extinction.
"The teacher at the Indian school grabbed my friend by the arm and said, "You're speaking your language -- I'm going to wash your mouth out with soap," Mr. Jackson recalled. "That's where we lost it." 
 Eight decades later, Mr. Jackson told his story, in English, to a small circle of Hupa language students at the Hoopa Community Center. Although the tribe has about 2,000 members, the room contained the four people who make up about half of the world's fluent Hupa speakers: Mr. Jackson, his younger sister, Minnie, and two elderly friends. Two others died in February.
Despite five centuries of population decline, assimilation and linguistic oppression, most of North America's Indian languages have survived to the end of the 20th century. Of the approximately 300 Indian languages that existed when Europeans first arrived in what is now the United States and Canada, 211 are still spoken today.
But with the impact of television and radio and increased mobility among Indians, North America's native languages are suffering their sharpest free fall in recorded history.
Of the 175 Indian languages still spoken in the United States, only 20 are still spoken by mothers to babies, said Michael Krauss, a linguist at the University of Alaska who surveys native languages. In contrast, 70 languages are spoken only by grandparents, and 55 more are spoken by 10 tribal members or fewer.
"This is a major American tragedy that people are generally in a state of denial about," Dr. Krauss said.
Noting that the Federal Government spends only $2 million a year to save endangered Indian languages, he said that under the Endangered Species Act, "we are spending $1 million a year per Florida panther to save the species."
Belonging to 62 language families, American Indian languages are as dramatically different as German, Chinese and Turkish.
With the rise of a global economy and increased communications, about half of the world's 6,000 languages are expected to disappear over the next century. Among American Indians, that process is unfolding today.
"We just gave a grant to study Klamath," said Douglas H. Whalen, a Yale University linguist who directs a new nonprofit group, the Endangered Language Fund. "When the proposal was made, Klamath had two speakers. Now, it is down to one."
Rapid erosion is also affecting the largest tribes.
In Arizona among the Navajo, the most populous tribe in the United States, the portion of native speakers among first graders has dropped to 30 percent today from 90 percent in 1968.
In Montana, the 9,300 enrolled Crow members display a classic Indian linguistic profile: 77 percent of Crow Indians over 66 years of age speak the language, while only 13 percent of preschoolers do.
On paper, California has the most linguistic diversity in the nation: 50 Indian languages are still spoken there, down from 80 before Europeans arrived.
"But not a single one of those languages is now being spoken natively by children," said Leanne Hinton, a linguistics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. "We are heading toward a state where we will have no native speakers of any of the California languages in 10 or 20 years. We are entering an age when speakers of the California languages will be learning in school, or as adults, rather than at home."
As the language circle at the Hoopa Community Center suggests, however, there is a belated movement among American Indians to rescue their languages from extinction.
"It's part of our culture," said Daniel Ammon, a Hupa high school teacher who is one of several dozen adults studying the tribe's complex language. "It contains how a Hupa person views the world. To lose the language would be to lose our identity. I will talk to my kids all the time in Hupa."
At the regional high school in Hoopa, a town of 1,000 people on a bend of the Trinity River in northwestern California, classes started last fall in the three languages of Indians in the area: Hupa, Karuk and Yurok.
"I want to know Karuk because it is my language, because I want to teach it to my children," Nisha Supahan, 15, said after class as her twin sister, Elaina, giggled in assent.
Their 27-year-old Karuk teacher, Susan Smith, contrasted their attitude with her detribalized upbringing.
"I never heard my language as a child," Ms. Smith said. "I didn't even know how to pronounce my tribal name."
Mr. Ammon and Ms. Smith learned their native language through an innovative effort to stave off linguistic extinction. Since 1992, the Native California Network, a nonprofit group in Visalia, in the state's south-central region, has sponsored 50 "apprentices" to undergo intensive language immersions, sometimes for up to 500 hours, with "masters," tribal elders who speak the language.
The language revival effort is taking many forms. Last year the Crow Tribal Council adopted resolutions declaring Crow the official language of the reservation, honoring fluent speakers as "tribal treasures" and encouraging all tribal members to speak the language.
Elsewhere in Montana, the Northern Cheyenne are offering tribal children a summer language camp, taught by the five elders who still speak Cheyenne fluently. In Missoula, summer language classes are offered in Blackfeet. Across Montana, a recent state decision to ease the certification of Indian language instructors has led to a surge in language instruction.
Idaho State University now offers Shoshoni for foreign language credit.
"At least one quarter of the 30 tribal colleges now require language study," David Cournoyer, a director of the American Indian College Fund, said in Denver. "Today, 25 different languages are taught, plus Plains Indian sign language."
In Connecticut, the Mohegan and Pequot are studying written records in their languages in an effort to revive languages that have not been spoken since the early 1900's. Thanks to the work of missionaries and anthropologists, virtually all of the Indian languages in North America have dictionaries and written texts.
While official language extermination policies have stopped, the main threat today, said Dr. Krauss, the University of Alaska linguist, is "the cultural nerve gas of television."
Putting electronic communications to work, the Hopi of Arizona have expanded Hopi language radio broadcasting, the Choctaw of Oklahoma have produced native language video dramas, the Sioux of South Dakota maintain a Lakota language Internet chat room, and the Skomish of Washington have produced a Twana language CD-ROM.
"There has been an almost total inversion in attitudes toward the native language," said Victor Golla, a linguistics professor at nearby Humboldt State University, who started visiting here 30 years ago. "Before, people were unconcerned about their native language. Now there is a very strong feeling among almost all the people that the loss of their language would be a tragic and very damaging thing."
Indians interested in reviving traditional ways say they cannot pray to their ancestors in English.
"A number of people have learned how to pray in their language," said Ms. Hinton, the Berkeley linguistics professor, who runs a summer program for Indians in California seeking to revive their languages from recorded field notes and tapes. "They are starting to reinvent their languages so they can pray at ceremonies and funerals."
Linguists caution that the language revival movement may only delay inevitable extinctions. But here in Hoopa, a change can already be felt.
"Before, on the bus, I used to say to my sister in Karuk, 'Look at that guy's shirt,' and nobody knew what we were talking about," Nisha Supahan said. "Now that's not true anymore."

HEADLINE: Nurses Put on Fast Forward In Rush for Cost Efficiency

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
Click, click, click, click. Heidi Jowett, R.N., snapped her fingers in describing the speed with which she and the nurses she supervises in the new 21-bed short-stay unit of the Kaiser Permanente hospital here perform their tasks. They are what Kaiser, the nation's biggest health maintenance organization, calls accelerated-care nurses: they move patients from suture to discharge in under 48 hours.
When Miss Jowett was a hospital nurse, there was a specialist to draw blood. "In the short-stay unit now, I do it," she said. "I never knew how to do an EKG; now I do it. Pharmacists taught patients about medication; now I do it. It's faster. It's faster when you can do it all. For me, it's almost more fulfilling." 
 Almost. Like many nurses who have been swept into the nation's rush to cost-efficient managed care, Ms. Jowett, 37, has mixed feelings now that the essence of the work that nurses love -- the nurturing of nursing -- is vanishing. A registered nurse for 16 years who wears a button that says "Quality begins with me" and a brooch that says "Nurses have heart," she relishes the challenge of accelerated care but misses giving patients baths and back rubs.
"I was always a nurse who loved to sit at the bedside and ask how they were," she said. "My passion was getting to know my patients, their identity, their hearts, their souls. I would rather know a few patients well than fragments of many."
But in the crucible of managed care, the Florence Nightingale school of nursing is giving way to team systems that get the work done faster and cheaper -- and, managed care organizations maintain, better. The nurse is still accountable for the care of the patients on a hospital floor, but she is now a team leader and coach. Aides give baths. The back rubs have stopped.
"This is happening all over the country," said Delores Jones, Kaiser's director of nursing for California, "and it's extremely difficult for nurses to deal with."
At Kaiser and in many other hospital systems, nurses with advanced degrees and training often welcome the new management responsibilities, the opportunity to assume more of the role of doctors and the higher pay that often goes along with that. But many traditional nurses say they are appalled by having more patients to watch, relying on aides to take up the slack.
They worry that managed care, without restraints, leads to what they call hit-and-run nursing and to mistakes, abuses and oversights. Patients are discharged sooner, and so they need more vigilance, not less, said Kit Costello, president of the California Nurses Association in Sacramento. "Does it make sense to go to less skilled care when patients are sicker?" she asked.
In California, nurses' frustration over managed care's new ways came to a boil over the last year, when six strikes of one and two days were called by the 7,500 members of the California Nurses Association who work in Kaiser's Northern California region.
In March, hours before the start of a seventh strike, Kaiser reached an unusual agreement with its nurses. Kaiser agreed to let the union select 18 members to serve as "quality liaisons," authorized to investigate accusations of poor care and to force a management response.
"They're going to be an unmuzzled voice," said James Letchworth, 47, a Kaiser cardiac rehabilitation nurse in San Francisco. "One of the big frustrations with nursing," he said, "is we see problems, and when we point them out, they say, 'Well, we can't do it today.' "
For all the fury of the dispute, Kaiser Permanente, one of the few nonprofit health maintenance organizations in the United States, regularly ranks near the top of the more than 1,000 H.M.O.'s in the country, both in the satisfaction of its nearly 9 million subscribers and in the quality of its care as measured by the National Committee on Quality Assurance, the leading monitor of health organization quality.
Kaiser has also broken with most of the industry by supporting White House proposals to institute more patient protection laws.
But like any H.M.O., Kaiser operates under extreme pressure from its subscribers' employers to keep costs down, and from stiff competition among health organizations for more subscribers. In the process, Kaiser lost $270 million last year, its first loss in its 53 years.
While both the nurses and the Kaiser management say they are dedicated to the pursuit of quality care, their perspectives often differ. Dr. David M. Lawrence, a former Peace Corps doctor who is Kaiser's chairman and chief executive, wants more computerization of patient records. He also wants knowledge of the best treatments and procedures shared more widely.
Repairing errors, Dr. Lawrence said, costs more than treating patients appropriately in the first place. "Superior quality means lower cost, almost always," he said. "We're trying to move away from a religion, to something that has some scientific base in terms of what we're trying to do for people."
To track down poor and ineffective care, Dr. Lawrence needs advanced computer systems to monitor patients. But that can intrude on a conviction by nurses that quality care requires the intuition and expertise they bring to the bedside.
Asked how her work has changed over a long career, Cecelia Baker, 58, another nurse in the short-stay unit, replied in one word, "Time." She is always rushed. "I have great faith in Kaiser," she said, "but I think the people making the decisions sometimes are accountants."
The accusation of hit-and-run nursing arises from the shift among health maintenance organizations from relying for most care on registered nurses, who have completed two to four years of college, to using what the organizations call team nursing, with nurses supervising workers with less expertise.
Trande Phillips, a Kaiser hospital nurse, said that a unit with 12 patients once would have been assigned three registered nurses, based on the severity of the patients' conditions. Now, she said, that unit has a team of one R.N, a licensed vocational nurse and a nurse's aide. The saving for Kaiser is substantial: Three nurses cost $30 an hour each, or $90, while the team costs about $60 an hour.
"But no matter how many aides I have working with me," Ms. Phillips said, "I have to do everything that's strictly R.N. work -- patients vomiting, patients with severe pain, patients needing changes in their IV medication. So one patient is going to get treatment immediately. The others are going to wait their turn."
And delegating work like baths to aides deprives nurses of an opportunity to detect changes in their patients' condition, nurses say.
"When they're buck naked, it's a bonding, teaching experience, a time to teach as well as to physically assess the patient," said Barbara Lambarida, a union officer and weekend nurse in the intensive care unit at the Summit Medical Center's hospital, a Kaiser rival in Oakland.
"In bathing you detect limits in the range of motion, muscle weakness, muscle tetany, where muscle freezes up," Ms. Lambarida said. "I'm looking at his skin to see if there's any breakdown. When I'm taking care of a patient who has fouled himself, I'm using my nose, I'm smelling that stool. There is a byproduct of bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract -- melanin -- that has a very distinct odor, so even if you can't see blood, you can smell it."
In many respects, however, the interests of nurses and Kaiser in the quality of care converge. Four years ago, Kaiser's ambulatory care clinic in the Western Addition neighborhood of San Francisco opened a cardiac rehabilitation office. Mr. Letchworth has been the nurse operating it for two years.
He monitors 100 to 120 patients who have had heart attacks, bypass surgery or angioplasty, calling them at home periodically to ask about their diets, exercise and success in stopping smoking. Once each week, he reviews the cases with a doctor.
"I'm doing secondary prevention, keeping them from having another event," Mr. Letchworth said. "The computer tells me what I have to talk to them about."
He said only one patient had died while he has managed the program. "The economics are very favorable," he said. "If we prevent one bypass surgery, that's my salary."
And, he said, "I love my job."
The economics of managed care can also expand opportunities for registered nurses. For 20 years, Ethel Nakamura, 58, managed the sigmoidoscopy room at Kaiser's San Francisco clinic, scheduling appointments and maintaining the two-foot-long snakelike scope that doctors use to detect colon cancer.
"Then they decided to train me to do it," Ms. Nakamura said. Last year she began performing the exams herself, and two medical assistants took over management of the sigmoidoscopy room.
"We're called 'R.N.'s in expanded roles,' " she said. "I get to do a lot more. We used to do what doctors told us to do. Today we have our own agenda. We do our own thinking."

HEADLINE: A Revered Relic Stolen From France Is Going Home

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 8

 BODY:
For more than 1,200 years the story of young Maxellendis, a seventh-century Frankish noblewoman who preferred the pious life of a Roman Catholic nun to an arranged marriage to a pagan prince, has been part of the local lore in a string of small agricultural towns in northeastern France.
According to the legend, the jilted prince killed Maxellendis for her impertinence and was instantly struck blind. His sight returned three years later after he begged forgiveness at her grave. That miracle spurred her early beatification, and parts of her body -- a bone fragment, a piece of skin -- became venerated relics. 
 Since its founding in 1635, the Church of St. Martin at Le Cateau, a town of 8,000 in the province of Nord, has cherished a tiny bone fragment from St. Maxellendis. But on Dec. 9, 1996, the ornate 19th-century monstrance, which held the bone pillowed on a red satin liner and set off by a bejeweled brooch, was stolen along with two other gilded monstrances from a glass case suspended six feet above the church floor.
Today in a Newark courtroom, obscure medieval hagiography and the modern market in stolen religious objects came together as a Pennsylvania man pled guilty to smuggling the three objects, valued at $130,000, into the United States.
"The people of the town are shocked and troubled by this affair and they want to know who committed this theft," Maj. Jean-Marie Jumez of the Le Cateau Police Department said in a telephone interview tonight. "You'd have to be very agile and athletic to get at them. We suspected that young boys did it."
Standing before Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise of Federal District Court, the smuggler, Sebastian Zegrean, 23, pled guilty to one count of making false statements to Customs officials when he attempted in December 1996 to send the three objects to his Reading, Pa., home by Federal Express after, he said, they were stolen by others.
The United States Attorney for New Jersey, Faith S. Hochberg, said that Mr. Zegrean, a Romanian citizen who is a legal immigrant living in the United States, had cooperated with investigators after being arrested more than a year ago. As a result, the French police today arrested one of his alleged accomplices -- a Romanian national living in France -- who they said they believe stole the objects from St. Martin Church.
"We believe he was going to attempt to sell them here in the U.S.," said Mrs. Hochberg, when asked why Mr. Zegrean acquired the sacred objects. "There was an agreement to remit funds to the thieves once the objects arrived in the U.S. for sale. Mr. Zegrean was a link in a fairly short chain."
Joel Perrine, an official of the French Directorate of National Heritage, said that such thefts had become more frequent in recent years at small rural churches, such as St. Martin's, where there was no security or guards. In the last seven years, the United States Customs Service has seized more than $30 million in stolen religious objects that were being smuggled into the country in violation of the Cultural Properties Act of 1990, said John C. Varrone, special agent in charge of the service's New York office. Prior to the act, in the 1980's, he said, the estimated value of all seized stolen art was $10.1 million.
"It is one of our fastest-growing categories of crimes," Mr. Varrone said, "and with the disintegration of Eastern Europe we have seen more and more of these objects and religious icons coming in."
Experts said that the market for such items was among auction houses that attracted private collectors as well as museums.
Customs officials said that Mr. Zegrean, a security guard, described the contents of a 18-by-24-by-14-inch box as "a picture frame, candlesticks and Christmas gifts valued at $275" when he shipped them by Federal Express from Lille, just north of Le Cateau, to his home in Reading on Dec. 17, 1996.
When Customs inspectors here X-rayed the box, they became suspicious because it appeared to contain something other than the items Mr. Zegrean had described and because the contents were wrapped in aluminum foil -- a common maneuver by those trying to thwart X-ray detection.
Armed with a description of the items sent out by French authorities, investigators opened the package, seized the contents and focused their attention on Mr. Zegrean.
American officials are working with French diplomats in the United States on plans for "repatriating" the artifacts, but it could not be too soon for Major Jumez and others in Le Cateau.
"The relics belong to the people of Le Cateau and there is a strong religious sentiment here," he said. "The general sentiment is to get them back as soon as possible. We want to know how and when the objects will be brought back."
The story of St. Maxellendis, said Anne-Marie Bouche, an assistant professor of medieval history at Princeton University, is a classic of medieval syncretism, when the Roman Catholic Church was trying to bridge the chasm between pagan beliefs and Christian theology. Those stories were to the common people's devotional life what the illuminated scriptures were to the Scholastics, who labored over translations in hundreds of monasteries.
"It's your basic Merovingian era woman's story," said Ms. Bouche, suggesting that it was the folkloric equivalent of today's romance novels. "There weren't many scripts for women's lives for that day. Marriages were arranged and there weren't many alternatives but to run away and become a nun."
These stories are more "pious fictions" than actual truths, most experts said, but they nevertheless spawned local cults whose adherents venerated the saints as a way of impressing outsiders with the power of the protective spirits that watched over them. It was likely, Ms. Bouche said, that saints like Maxellendis were viewed as a talisman to ward of attacks by roving bands.
Jerrilynn Dodds, an art historian and medievalist who teaches at the City College School of Architecture, said that the monstrance containing the tiny bone fragment from Maxellendis was the key to this protection. Having a "really hot relic," she said, was also an economic benefit because it attracted pilgrims. "It was like having the Super Bowl or the Olympics in your town," she said.
The other two stolen items are formal monstrances, said Msgr. Richard Groncki, rector of the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark, and date to the late 17th and early 18th centuries. They are used with their hinged glass display doors to show the host, or the wafers representing the body of Christ to be venerated in church services. One monstrance had a gilt bronze and enameled facade featuring the four evangelists and the four rivers of paradise, and a filigree base of four cherubs clutching lapis lazuli globes.
Major Jumez said that beyond the spiritual significance of the monstrances, no one in the town overlooked their artistic value. "These things are objects of art -- treasures," he said, sounding eager for their return.

HEADLINE: California Voters Face New Canvas for Electoral Politics

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 8

 BODY:
In just two months, California voters will begin sifting a pile of options to choose a new governor for the most populous state, decide on whether to retain Senator Barbara Boxer and set statewide law and policy on issues like bilingual education and the use of union dues in political campaigns.
The process will start in the highly unpredictable new arena of the state's first "blanket" primary election, on June 2, in which the names of all candidates for each office will be on the same ballot and voters will be able to select from among all the choices without regard to party. In Los Angeles County, nearly 800 candidates have qualified for various offices, posing a huge challenge to the fortitude of the voters and the capacity of the voting machines. 
 "It's changed the picture," said Bill Carrick, a veteran California political consultant who is advising the Democratic campaign for governor by Representative Jane Harman, who represents beach communities on the south side of Los Angeles. "Instead of operating in a climate that just includes registered Democrats, you have to operate in a climate that includes everybody."
The stakes are high. At the top is replacing Gov. Pete Wilson as head of the world's seventh-largest economy. Mr. Wilson, a two-term Republican, is barred from seeking a third term. The battlefield is giant. When Senator Boxer announced her re-election campaign, she did so by visiting 13 California cities.
And the cost is astronomical. One Democratic contender for governor, Alfred A. Checchi, the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, has already spent some $20 million in the effort, more than double the old statewide record for a primary.
The governor's race is the most closely watched and probably the most important single race in the nation this year. For the Democrats, it is a chance to reclaim the office for the first time since Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. left it in 1982, and to elect only the state's fourth Democratic governor this century. For the Republicans, it is a chance to continue their recent dominance through the Congressional redistricting of 2000 by electing Attorney General Dan Lungren, a former Congressman who faces only token opposition for his party's nomination for governor.
So the attention is on the hotly contested primary between Mr. Checchi, Ms. Harman and Gray Davis, the Lieutenant Governor and a Democrat. Mr. Davis, a 20-year veteran of state politics, was Mr. Brown's chief of staff in Sacramento but has seen his long-cherished plan to run for governor challenged by a pair of rich political newcomers. Buffeted by intense television advertising from Mr. Checchi and Ms. Harman -- which Mr. Davis cannot yet afford -- Mr. Davis, 55, has slipped from first to dead last in the Democratic field in statewide polls.
Ms. Harman, 52, a lawyer and an aide in the Carter White House, entered the race in February only after Senator Dianne Feinstein, who for a year had flirted with running, decided not to. California Democrats have nominated women for governor and United States senator in every election since 1990, and in just three weeks of campaigning through televised advertisements, Ms. Harman edged ahead of Mr. Checchi in at least one statewide poll.
"It's going to be a competitive race all the way till the end," said Robert Shrum, the longtime Washington Democratic media consultant who is advising Mr. Checchi.
Mr. Checchi, 49, whose holdings in Northwest Airlines and other investments make him worth more than $700 million, has been traveling around the state for a year in pursuit of the statehouse. He has lately been running about $1.5 million worth of advertisements a week promoting his plans for a cut in automobile insurance rates and improvements in education, among other issues, said aides for rival campaigns.
But in a sign that he feels threatened by Ms. Harman's candidacy, and despite an earlier pledge not to run negative advertisements, Mr. Checchi has also begun broadcasting commercials attacking the Congresswoman, accusing her of such things as voting to raise Social Security taxes. In fact, Ms. Harman voted to raise taxes on only the wealthiest Social Security recipients as part of President Clinton's 1993 budget plan, a major test of party loyalty that passed with no Republican support.
Ms. Harman, who was elected in 1992, has responded with an advertisement in which she says, "Mr. Checchi can waste his money attacking me," and adds: "Leadership is about attacking real problems, not each other."
The new primary system was passed as a ballot initiative two years ago in an effort that its sponsors said would open up the electoral process and make it fairer. But most party professionals worry that it will cause mostly headaches and perhaps be subject to mischief-making.
Given the realities of the new system -- and of the state's preference for Republican governors even though 1.5 million more voters are registered as Democrats -- Ms Harman and Mr. Checchi are emphasizing their centrist appeal. Mr. Checchi never identifies himself in television commercials as a Democrat, and Ms. Harman, who represents a heavily Republican district, once boasted that she was "the best Republican in the Democratic Party."
Ms. Harman, whose husband, Sidney, is the founder and chief executive of Harman International, the stereo and audio equipment manufacturer, has so far spent $5 million of her family's personal wealth on the race. Local political experts predict that she and Mr. Checchi will together shatter all state spending records, and probably national ones, too. Ms. Harman has also won the endorsement of national women's fund-raising groups like Emily's List and the support of much of Ms. Feinstein's state political network, which could help in getting out the vote.
For his part, Mr. Davis has been hard pressed to get any traction since his rivals' spending war began, and he is saving his own $5 million war chest for an advertising blitz just before the primary.
On the Republican side, Mr. Lungren, a staunch abortion opponent whose father was a personal physician to Richard M. Nixon, has largely held his fire. As a result, some Democratic strategists say, Mr. Lungren risks losing voters to Mr. Checchi or Ms. Harman in the June primary who may never return to the Republican ranks in the fall.
Mr. Lungren also unsettled some Republicans with a recent speech laced with religious references, including the assertion that "we have to be a religious people," that some strategists say will not play well in live-and-let-live California.
In the Senate race, Ms. Boxer, 57, who won office six years ago with 48 percent of the vote, had once been thought vulnerable. But her Republican opposition is shaping up as fractured and unsensational. State Treasurer Matt Fong and Representative Frank Riggs are competing against Darrell Issa, a millionaire car-alarm maker who has already spent more than $6 million of his fortune, most of it on television advertisements.
Mr. Issa, 44, has a personal wealth estimated at $200 million, but he, too, is a political novice who has been dismissed by Mr. Riggs as a "glib, fast-talking Ross Perot eccentric." Mr. Issa has committed a novice's share of groaners, saying this week that his wife had described President Clinton as a slut and adding, "I will not disagree with my wife in public."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Investors Snap Up Korea Bonds in a Big Vote of Confidence

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
South Korea, financially destitute just four months ago, won an enormous vote of confidence from investors around the world yesterday with the successful sale of $4 billion in Government bonds.
It was the first time South Korea had attempted to sell i.o.u.'s to foreign investors since the worst of its economic crisis in December, when the Government's largest state-owned bank had to scrap a bond sale because of investor resistance. 
 By contrast, the huge demand yesterday represented a bet that South Korea, which has taken important steps to strengthen its economy and ease a severe debt problem over the last four months, will surge back to prosperity in the next few years.
A welcome reaction to the bond sale was evident this morning in South Korea, where the stock market jumped 3.69 percent. The Seoul Government also was pleased with the outcome and announced today that it would sell a further $1 billion in bonds next month.
To some extent, the successful bond sale also showed investors are increasingly confident that Asia's economic malaise has eased, diminishing the risk of a contagion that has troubled global financial markets since last summer, when the unraveling economies of Thailand and Indonesia touched off the Asian crisis.
"One of the concerns was whether or not what was going on in Asia would cascade into other countries and damage their ability to finance themselves," in regions like Eastern Europe and Latin America, said Joyce Chang, an emerging-markets debt strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "But a real liquidity crisis has not happened."
Viewing South Korea's bond offering as a lucrative opportunity, investors snapped up the $1 billion in five-year notes and $3 billion in 10-year bonds. They are wagering that South Korea's credit rating, which had been severely downgraded to below investment-grade status as its financial health deteriorated last year, will improve as its economy strengthens. An investment-grade rating would make the bonds far more valuable.
Investment bankers at Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Smith Barney, which managed the bond sale as advisers to South Korea's Government, had spent the last two weeks talking to more than 500 investors in 15 cities around the world about the deal. They were ebullient yesterday because customer orders totaled $12 billion.
"In 20 years in the business, this is the largest book for a subinvestment grade or sovereign credit I have ever seen," said Carlos Cordeiro, a managing director and head of Asian debt capital markets at Goldman, Sachs. "People are convinced that Korea is coming back."
Crippled by a plunging currency and tens of billions of dollars in short-term debt, South Korea teetered on default in December, when the International Monetary Fund provided a record $57 billion emergency assistance package.
Since then Seoul has made several significant changes demanded by the I.M.F., including the closing of money losing banks, less Government control over business and fewer restrictions on foreign ownership of South Korean companies. More than $20 billion in short-term bank loans owed to foreign banks have been repackaged into longer-term debt, further easing the pressure.
"South Korea has made substantive progress in reforming its economy, particularly in the financial sector," said Sem Karacadag, a sovereign debt analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In recognition of the improvement, Standard & Poor's upgraded its credit rating to BB+ Feb. 18, up from B+.
That is still below investment grade and well below the double-A rating South Korea enjoyed before the Asia crisis, when yields on South Korea bonds were only about one percentage point higher than yields on comparable United States Treasury bonds.
By contrast, the yields on the securities priced yesterday are consistent with the higher risks associated with bonds sold recently by other emerging-market nations.
The five-year securities were priced to yield 8.953 percent, or 3.45 percentage points over the prevailing yield on comparable five-year United States Treasury securities. The 10-year notes were priced to yield 9.084 percent, 3.55 percentage points over the prevailing yield on comparable 10-year Treasuries.
About two-thirds of the bonds were sold to investors in the United States, Mr. Cordeiro said. The remainder was split between European and Asian investors.
Demand for the bonds remained strong after the sale, and prices moved higher.
By late yesterday, the five-year notes were quoted at a spread of 3.35 percentage points over five-year Treasury securities; the 10-year notes were quoted at a spread of 3.45 percentage points over Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
The enthusiastic reception for the new South Korea debt partly reflects eased investor anxiety about debt issued by all emerging-market countries. That stands in sharp contrast to the anemic appetite for these securities in December, when worries about the cascading effect of the Asian crisis were at their peak. At that time, only $1 billion in new emerging-market bonds were priced, Ms. Chang said. That figure crept up to $3 billion in February.
Since early March, nearly $18 billion in new deals from countries like the Philippines and Brazil have been offered, including yesterday's sale by South Korea. Another $10 billion worth of securities from emerging markets are in the pipeline, she added.
Proceeds from yesterday's bond offering will become reserves of the South Korean Government, Mr. Cordeiro said.
Despite the improved outlook, it remains instructive to see how far South Korea has fallen in the last year. There is also some risk that South Korea could falter again.
Last summer, before the crisis hit, the country's investment-grade debt was trading at 85 basis points over Treasury securities of comparable maturity. In the last two months of 1997, its credit ratings dropped as much as nine notches.
A record 17,000 South Korean companies went bankrupt last year; corporations there have yet to renegotiate what could be $300 billion in domestic and foreign debt, and Japan's apparent inability or unwillingness to invigorate its own economy could hurt its Asian neighbors.
"The South Koreans admitted there is still a good deal to do, and were willing to admit their problems," said Phil Bennett, a managing director and head of international capital markets at Salomon Smith Barney. "Early on in the process, investors were skeptical, and needed to be persuaded. But the South Koreans did a terrific job in that regard."

Treasuries Weaken
 Prices of United States Government securities sagged yesterday, hurt by a weaker dollar and lower-than-expected demand at the Treasury's first auction of 30-year inflation indexed bonds.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 23/32, to a price of 103 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.89 percent, from 5.84 percent Tuesday.
Heading into the Treasury's $8 billion auction of inflation-indexed bonds, traders considered the issue attractive. But the dollar's decline in currency dealings made investments in United States securities less attractive to foreign investors. Demand for new, high-yielding South Korea debt may also have diminished demand for United States bonds.
The inflation-pegged securities were introduced in 1997 with the sale of five-year and 10-year maturities. They are designed to protect investors from inflation by paying a predetermined yield plus the rate of inflation. Following are results of the auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 97.937
High Yield . . . 3.740%
Low Yield . . . 3.600%

HEADLINE: Morocco Finds Fundamentalism Benign but Scary

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: CASABLANCA, Morocco

 BODY:
A group of students at the University of Casablanca were comparing notes about how they were being courted by militants of an Islamist movement.
One month the recruiters offered cultural visits to Marrakesh. Another time they volunteered to distribute free photocopies of text books, which are expensive and scarce. Last year, another student recalled, the recruiters offered karate lessons and special coaching for exams. 
 "They all pretend that they just want to help us," said Amina Maadi, a second-year economics student. "They really want us to get involved in their causes."
Militant Islamic groups have been mobilizing and expanding in Morocco, as they have in other Muslim nations. By assisting the sick, the widowed and the unemployed, they have gained followers in the shantytowns in Tangier, Rabat and Casablanca. Their charities run blood banks and help people organize funerals. On feast days they offer lamb or mutton to the poor.
The groups have been steadily reaching into the educational system, enlisting high school teachers and university students, both men and women. Until a recent crackdown, most student leaders of the country's 14 universities belonged to Justice and Charity, the larger and more radical of Morocco's two main Islamic movements.
The Islamists have made inroads at schools because they seize on the frustrations of the students with the lack of job opportunities and the shortage of classrooms. But estimates about Muslim militants who are hostile to the Government are imprecise.
"It is very difficult to measure the impact of these organizations," said Mohammed Tozy, a political scientist who has written extensively on religion and Islamic politics in Morocco. "There are many claims, going from 50,000 to 500,000 members. They are a minority, but they are very motivated, very determined.
"As in much of the Arab world, they grow because of the great malaise, the social injustice, the harsh life in the cities, the generation gap."
In practice, most Moroccan youths are not anti-Western. But many who do not belong to the ranks of the rich resent the lack of jobs and a culture of corruption.
A recent opinion poll that startled the Establishment said almost 90 percent of Moroccans between the ages of 20 and 29 want to leave the country. Among university graduates, 70 percent want to settle abroad. The poll did not say so but for most young people, "abroad" means Western Europe or the United States.
By the standards of Algeria across the border, where Islamists are fighting to overthrow the Government, the Moroccans are low key and moderate and have avoided any suggestion of violence.
But the example of Algeria, with its continuing blood baths and massacres of civilians, has shaken many Moroccans. People here insist that such havoc cannot happen in this stable nation, where for 37 years King Hassan II has demonstrated his considerable political skills. Moreover, the argument goes, Morocco is already an Islamic state with a King who is both the political and the spiritual leader and claims to be a descendant of Mohammed.
But the Justice and Charity movement refuses to recognize the King as the religious leader, which is tantamount to blasphemy here. Abdessalam Yassine, the movement's founder, once mocked Hassan, calling him "my dear nephew of the Prophet." The movement maintains that Islam and its rites have been eroded and corrupted and must be returned to a purer state.
In interviews, the King and palace officials dismiss the importance of fundamentalism, but its rise keeps prompting the question: Does militant Islam pose a threat to Morocco?
"Morocco is basically conservative and pacifist," said a Middle Eastern diplomat with long experience here. "Militant Islamists are not now threatening the stability of the country, but they are clearly preparing for the future."
The clearest signal that the militants are taken seriously among the 28 million Moroccans is the Government's response: Justice and Charity wants to be recognized as a political party and to take part in elections, but the palace has refused. Mr. Yassine, who is close to 70 and has been in and out of jail, is under house arrest and barred from making public statements. The Ministry of Religious Affairs and the ubiquitous police closely watch members and clerics, even inside the mosques.
At the same time the Government has urged another, more moderate Islamic group -- Reform and Renewal -- to join a small political party that won nine parliamentary seats in December. Some people see this as a deft move to divide the Islamists, who have already begun to criticize one another.
There have been tensions at the universities, above all in Casablanca, a gritty industrial city. With 34,000 students, Casablanca's university is Morocco's largest and serves as a political barometer. It used to be a center of Marxist activism until the Muslim militants took over the student organizations.
At the large campus on the edge of town, there are no posters or banners, and students in jeans and sweaters mingle easily with those in long Arab robes and head scarves. In interviews, though, students and teachers said that while a few years ago students had practically stopped covering their heads, there had been a noticeable rise in the use of scarves, which can be either a religious symbol or a political banner.
Ms. Maadi and her friends, nibbling a lunch of dates and almond pies, said many students are frustrated. "I feel I'm living in the middle of a traffic jam and I cannot get out," said one young man.
As a result, students have held strikes and demonstrations organized by the Islamists at several universities. The Government blamed Islamic activists for the unrest but also said that the university authorities were too passive. Rectors have been replaced at eight universities, as have dozens of faculty members.
Among the replacements is El-Bachir Kouhlani, dean of the faculty of law and economics here. In a recent interview in his office, he explained that he had begun to organize sports events, excursions and cultural activities, and had set up an office to help students in need. His program resembles the agenda of the Islamist student groups but "we are creating a very different atmosphere," he said.
Out on the lawn, students on their lunch break had a different explanation for the new calm: the number of police plainclothesmen on campus has more than doubled, they said. The policemen are meant to keep out of sight, but the students see them as lumbering spy planes and "we call them Awacs," one said.

HEADLINE: One in Every 8 Plant Species Is Imperiled, a Survey Finds

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
At least 1 of every 8 plant species in the world -- and nearly 1 of 3 in the United States -- is under threat of extinction, according to the first comprehensive worldwide assessment of plant endangerment.
The assessment, which required more than 20 years of work by botanists and conservationists around the globe, added nearly 34,000 plant species to the World Conservation Union's growing Red List of imperiled organisms. 
 The survey, made public yesterday in Washington, found that among the plants most at risk were 14 percent of rose species, 32 percent of lilies, 32 percent of irises, 14 percent of cherry species and 29 percent of palms. Many species of coniferous trees, and many plant species found in island nations, were also judged especially vulnerable.
While endangered mammals and birds have commanded more public attention, it is plants, scientists say, that are more fundamental to nature's functioning. They undergird most of the rest of life, including human life, by converting sunlight into food. They provide the raw material for many medicines and the genetic stock from which agricultural strains of plants are developed. And they constitute the very warp and woof of the natural landscape, the framework within which everything else happens.
The census of imperiled plants should be taken not as an exact measure of the situation, leaders of the survey said, but rather as a first, rough approximation.
And some acknowledged that the majority of species were "secure and widespread," in the words of Dr. Bruce Stein, a botanist who is a senior scientist with the Nature Conservancy, one of nine scientific and conservation organizations that participated in drawing up the list. Furthermore, Dr. Stein said, some plants were placed on the list simply because they are rare, not because their numbers are declining or their habitat is threatened.
Nevertheless, of the world's 270,000 known species of plants, the 12.5 percent found to be at risk is a huge proportion, said David Brackett of Ottawa, chairman of the World Conservation Union's Species Survival Commission. Moreover, he said, the figure is probably an underestimate, since data from most places in the world -- including some species-rich tropical nations where the countryside is being rapidly cleared -- are fragmentary.
The list of imperiled plants fills more than 750 pages of a large red-bound book. Nine of every 10 plants on the list are native to only one country, making them especially vulnerable to national or local economic and social conditions. Many species are found only on a few islands, and countries like Mauritius, the Seychelles and Jamaica consequently have disproportionately high numbers of threatened plants.
Scientists generally cite two main reasons plants become endangered: destruction of large swaths of wild countryside by agriculture, logging or development, and invasions of plants from one part of the world that run riot and crowd out native species in another part.
The new listing of threatened plants is one more piece of evidence that "a whole chunk of creation is at risk," said Dr. Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee, who was not involved in producing the report.
While 1 plant in 8 may not seem like much, Dr. Pimm said, "that's what's threatened now, as a consequence of what we've done so far; but all the evidence is that the destruction is continuing at an accelerating pace."
With 4,669 of its species judged to be threatened to one degree or another, the United States ranked first, by far, among all nations in total number of plants at risk. That is 29 percent of the country's 16,108 plant species.
But Dr. Stein said the United States' situation looked comparatively grim only because plants were probably better surveyed here than elsewhere.
"I don't believe the U.S. is worse off than other countries," he said. "If anything, I think the U.S. has taken a more active interest in plant conservation."
Dr. Stein's group, the Nature Conservancy, maintains what is widely regarded as one of North America's most comprehensive databases on endangered plants. Other major American participants in drawing up the Red List were the New York Botanical Garden and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.
The conservation union, also called the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, is based in Gland, Switzerland. Many governments and scientific organizations are among its members. Since 1960, it has been maintaining and adding to its Red List of threatened species. The list has no official effect but is widely regarded as an influential guide for conservation policy makers.
Two years ago, the union placed nearly a quarter of all known mammal species and 11 percent of birds on the list. It also added a number of marine species for the first time.
The Red List establishes five categories of organisms: species not seen in the wild in 50 years and presumed extinct; species suspected of having recently become extinct; endangered species, those likely to become extinct if the causes of endangerment continue; vulnerable species, those likely to become endangered if the causes of vulnerability continue, and rare species, those with small worldwide populations not yet endangered or vulnerable. Of the total number of plants on the Red List, 43 percent are classified as rare, 24 percent as vulnerable and 20 percent as endangered.

The World Car Wears New Faces

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
IN the early years of this century, Henry Ford had a notion that he could sell the same car everywhere in the world, and he was right: Some 15 million Model T's -- built at plants in North and South America, Europe and Japan -- were sold worldwide during that seminal model's 20-year run.
But Ford's concept of a simple, low-cost, unchanging car for the masses was relegated to the scrap heap as a wider variety of models emerged from various countries. The one-world, one-car formula no longer worked.
 
 Recently, though, the idea for a world car has resurfaced as a way for manufacturers to achieve vast economies of scale. Successes have been few so far, although Toyota has hit a home run with its Corolla, which is sold worldwide in various body styles built on a common platform -- the basic architecture of a vehicle, primarily the chassis. The Corolla now ranks as the best-selling car of all time. (The Ford Motor Company's F-Series pickups are the world's best-selling vehicles over all, and their platforms also serve as the basis for the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator sport utilities.)
Now Ford, the pioneer of the original world car concept, is searching for the right new formula with some intriguing experiments. Rather than offer one car like the Model T for all nations, Ford's approach this time is to use one basic platform to create a variety of vehicles that can be tailored to individual markets, including low-volume niche models that can be built in a cost-effective way.
 Among Ford's first efforts toward a modern world-car strategy was the Ford Mondeo, developed in Europe and sold in the United States as the Contour and Mercury Mystique sedans. A $6 billion undertaking, which included the development of a platform as well as engines and transmissions, the Mondeo program had mixed results.
Although the compact car sold well in Europe, Americans considered its counterparts too small and, initially, too expensive, The company was forced to reprice the cars and reposition them in the United States.
Ford has taken the Mondeo platform out for another spin, using it as the basis for a new, sporty Mercury Cougar coupe, which goes on sale this spring in the United States and Europe. The 1999 Cougar will be on display at the New York International Auto Show, which opens to the public tomorrow and runs through April 19 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.
The Cougar's styling is an example of New Edge, a type of design developed within Ford's American operations, in which sharp creases add definition to an otherwise softly sculptured body. But the car's firm ride and responsive handling characteristics are thoroughly European. The Cougar will be built at Ford's joint-venture plant with Mazda in Flat Rock, Mich., south of Detroit.
But Ford's world car planning is not confined to just one platform. It is using another chassis, one currently used mainly in Europe and Brazil, to create a host of unusual and varied small cars. Already in production are three small, successful and critically acclaimed front-drive vehicles -- the Fiesta subcompact, the innovative Ka city car and the sporty Puma coupe -- as well as a small Brazilian pickup truck, the Courier.
The latest variation on this platform is the Libre, a concept car that is also on display at the New York auto show. The Libre (pronounced LEE-bray) is an innovative four-passenger convertible that could be marketed to couples who would like to own, say, a Mazda Miata, but need more than two seats. The Libre has four doors, but they are configured like those on some new four-door pickups: the back doors are hinged at the rear and latch into the front doors. To unlatch a rear door, the front door must be opened first.
Despite the common genes of these small Fords, the design concepts behind each -- none of them are sold in the United States -- are completely different. The Ka (pronounced cah), a tiny, high-mileage city car, was among Ford's first products to wear New Edge lines. The swoopy, sporty curves of the Puma coupe, which is also a New Edge design, are quite different from the Ka. In contrast, the Libre has soft and flowing lines.
 Although Ford has not made the Libre available for test drives, its driving characteristics are likely to be similar to those of the agile Puma, with which it shares most of its components, save for engines. (The Libre's 1.25-liter, four-cylinder engine is considerably smaller than the Puma's 1.7-liter four-cylinder power plant.)
Ford will not confirm whether it is seriously considering offering any version of its small platform, including the Libre, in the United States. But J. Mays, Ford's vice president for design, said a strong business case could be made at least for the Libre, since the shared platform would go a long way toward making such a niche vehicle cost-effective.
If successful, Ford's modern-day approach could offer the best of both worlds: proving the worth of Henry Ford's notion that low-cost cars could be built around the world, and offering consumers in various countries the models that appeal to local tastes and demands.

HEADLINE: A Feisty Cat For Europe

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
ONE of the most interesting and entertaining cars I have driven lately is one you cannot buy in the United States: the Ford Puma.
Ford began selling the small and very sporty coupe in Europe a year ago. At a price of just over $18,000, the German-made car is aimed at European auto enthusiasts on a modest budget. 
 The Puma's appeal, and its fun, begin with its styling. A prime example of Ford's New Edge design, the Puma has pronounced lines and a short back end that gives the car a swoopy, speedy look.
Inside, the large gauges have black numbers on white dials. Brushed aluminum is used as accents -- on the shift knob, on the door, around the gauges and across the center of the instrument panel.
In a weeklong test drive in Michigan, the Puma grabbed attention everywhere it went, prompting questions from the teller at my bank's drive-through window, getting stares from hairdressers through the win dows of the beauty shop, and inspiring a couple of 20-something guys in a pickup to pull alongside, signal me to roll down the window and ask about the car.
The Puma's performance neatly meshes with its fun appearance. Its very direct steering responds immediately to the slightest movement of the wheel, reminding me of a go-cart I drove as a child. The Puma is not simply agile, it moves with razor-sharp precision, tempting an ordinarily reticent driver to dart in and out of traffic. Its five-speed shifter has extremely short throws between gears for quick shifting. The Puma zips away from stoplights thanks to its lightweight 1.7-liter, four-cylinder engine, and the brakes are decisive.
The comfortable, body-hugging seats held me in place through quick maneuvers. I found the firm ride comfortable, although I suspect it is too stiff for most Americans.
The Puma shares its front-drive architecture with the Ford Fiesta and Ka, both of which are also sold only in Europe. Sharing a platform makes it easier and more cost-effective for Ford to create fun niche models like the Puma. Still, the economies of scale may not be enough to prompt Ford to import the Puma to the United States. The American market for sporty coupes has collapsed, and the car would have to be reworked to meet safety and emissions standards. That's too bad, for this is one enjoyable car. MICHELLE KREBS

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
When a Lone Voice Can Fill a Stage

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS

 BODY:
Brian Cox and Danny Hoch. The names almost sound as if they were designed to mesh, in a Cole Porter lyric, perhaps. And yet one would be hard-pressed to find two performers of more divergent style and pedigree: Mr. Cox, the redoubtable Scottish actor, an accomplished interpreter of Shaw and Shakespeare; Mr. Hoch, the hip-hop chameleon from Queens, inspired as much by the scrawls on subway walls as by anything on paper.
It's hard to imagine the excuse that would land them in front of an audience together. But in their separate spheres, each alone on a bare stage, they create the same magic. Not so much in terms of diction or mannerisms, nor in the messages they impart. They share what one might call leadership ability, that reservoir of self-belief and innate fortitude from which certain gifted souls draw powers of persuasion and turn the rest of us into willing followers. Each is currently the captain of his own one-man show in Manhattan, Mr. Cox in "St. Nicholas," a shaggy-dog monodrama by Conor McPherson about a boozing theater critic, and Mr. Hoch in "Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop," an evening of bristlingly funny sketches of his own devising. 
 Never mind the low overhead and lonely-looking curtain calls; they're among the sharpest, most theatrical and, yes, character-rich productions in town. Content is of course a key; both performers have ripping yarns to tell. But solo shows are peculiarly personality-driven, and it's the force of personality that draws us into "St. Nicholas" and "Jails," no matter what other dazzlements these works may provide.
Mr. Cox and Mr. Hoch are leaders in another respect. They are offering new creative rationale for the one-person show, a format so frequently rolled out in playhouses these days that the New York stage sometimes seems an imitation Speakers' Corner.
Who would have thought that some of the most compelling theater of the season, works of some of the most expressive language and subtle construction, would have emanated from stages practically empty of scenery, by actors standing up there, talking directly to us?
From a hypnotist, Paul McKenna, at the Roundabout, to a mind-reader, Marc Salem, at the Westside Theater; from Tyne Daly, playing five different women in "Mystery School," to John Cameron Mitchell, as a surgically engineered one in "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," theaters all over town are filled with entertainers flying solo. Sandra Bernhard's superb, acerbic hit, "I'm Still Here . . . Damn It!," has come and recently gone. Along with John Leguizamo, who continues to play to sold-out houses on Broadway with his autobiographical "Freak," and Eddie Izzard, who has arrived from London with a new stand-up show, "Dress to Kill," in the West Village, many of these performers are proving that in noisy times a lone voice still has the texture and the power to open up worlds, even without a chorus to back it up.
Only it has to be the right voice. Let's face it: The only thing more unbearable than a large cast muddling through a boring play is the sound of one man droning. Reflect for a moment on that college lecturer who made the battles of the Civil War sound about as exciting as the items on a grocery list, or that after-dinner speaker who induced narcolepsy with a discussion of the intrigues on the House subcommittee on intercoastal waterways, and you have a good idea of the squirm fest that awaits you at the Wrong One-Man Show.
There are way too many of these in New York. Impersonations of marginal historical figures who are obscure for good reason; witnessings of triumphs over distasteful medical conditions that should only be discussed long before a meal; colorful travelogues about parts of the country you would never want to visit: this is the stuff of bad monodrama, the sort at which the ushers would be kinder to pass out pillows than programs. In a profession with rampant unemployment, it's no wonder that actors develop their own material as a means of filling the gaps between jobs. But the pieces so often seem to be little more than time-killers.
Of course, the theater of the sole practitioner has numerous success stories. The genre breaks down broadly into two categories, one-person plays and personal monologues. From "Krapp's Last Tape" to "Full Gallop," there is a history of rewarding theater written for one person (and in the radical case of Samuel Beckett's "Not I," for one mouth) and a trove of great performances to go with them. Fiona Shaw's amazing translation of Eliot's "Waste Land" into a theater piece was a high point last season; yet to come this season is Edward Petherbridge's eagerly awaited rendition of "Krapp's Last Tape" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
The field of first-person monologuist is generally more crowded, and more heavily abused. In this compulsively tell-all era, everyone, for better or worse, wants 15 minutes at center stage. Still, out of the mouths of veterans like Spalding Gray and Lily Tomlin and newer entrants like Claudia Shear and Dael Orlander smith, the monologue can be given a shape and meaning beyond the purely personal. With artistry it can be made to transcend the exclusive "me."
In all its forms, the one-person show continues to proliferate. Here's a fly-by of the most memorable of the talking heads now playing in New York City, the Big Soapbox:
Plays with large casts have the luxury of providing villains. But short of "An Evening With Benito Mussolini," the one-person show almost always involves a character with whom you're meant to empathize. In this regard, first impressions are crucial, and at "JAILS, HOSPITALS AND HIP-HOP" the affection you'll feel for Mr. Hoch will be instantaneous. Forget the dreary title: the 90 minutes spent with this perceptive performer and his seemingly inexhaustible wit will erase any memory of the drabness of your day.
Mr. Hoch, a 27-year-old New York product who spent some court-ordered time on Riker's Island, carries on the tradition of such solo-show veterans as Whoopi Goldberg and Mr. Leguizamo. He shifts in and out of characters with astonishing precision. Among the best of his thoroughly original creations are a break dancer in Cuba trying to impress an American visitor and a young man showing the brain-damaging effects of a mother who took cocaine during her pregnancy. Not a moment passes at Performance Space 122 when Mr. Hoch doesn't come across as potent and authentic; he has put together one of the most dynamic solo shows since Claudia Shear's "Blown Sideways Through Life."
Mr. Hoch's theatrical peer, the far better known Mr. Leguizamo, has an even more exhilarating hold on an audience in "FREAK," his coming-of-age tour de force at the Cort Theater. The show, which has just been extended through July 4, is an exuberant blend of impressions and confession; whether or not some of his tales are exaggerations, Mr. Leguizamo's dead-on impersonations and powers of observation convey with a welcome bite a childlike grown-up's view of a turbulent immigrant family.
Verbally adroit ("We were trying to recreate the inside of a papaya," he says of his mother's style of interior decorating for their Jackson Heights apartment) and physically virtuosic (how does he, in milliseconds, so perfectly capture the body language of an Irish street tough?), Mr. Leguizamo takes the sounds and scenes of his youth and in a miraculous feat for a one-man band, plays them back in a veritable symphony.
In contrast to the dysfunctional family circus of "Freak," Mr. Cox performs subtler stunts in "ST. NICHOLAS," at Primary Stages through April 25. While Mr. Leguizamo takes us boisterously up on the high wire, Mr. Cox works closer to the ground, taking us quietly into his confidence. It's a more concentrated kind of performance, requiring a conservation rather than explosion of energy. By evening's end, you've learned precious little about the actor, and only slightly more than that about the man he plays. The effort here is almost exclusively in the casting of a spell.
Mr. Cox's voice is as elastic as Mr. Leguizamo's body, an invaluable asset in a 90-minute play that celebrates the ancient art of narration. In Mr. McPherson's piece, Mr. Cox, as an embittered hack who spent years as a Dublin drama critic, spins a mordantly funny tale about a drunken night in which he fell in with a houseful of vampires.
Only an actor with a highly developed sense of irony could pull off this material, and in Mr. Cox the playwright has an ideal interpreter. He seems to inhabit the body and soul of a storyteller tired of everything in life except the sound of his own story.
In "MYSTERY SCHOOL," at the Angel Orensanz Foundation on the Lower East Side, Ms. Daly is doing the storytelling in five distinct movements. She plays an array of characters in Paul Selig's collection of monologues about women and the manifestations of faith, and while her work is proficient, the overall effect is rarely more than mechanical.
At the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Izzard plays only himself in "DRESS TO KILL" at the Westbeth Theater Center, and the results are a lot more satisfying. Unlike the writers of the other pieces, Mr. Izzard, a cross-dressing comic who sends up such lampoonable staples as television commercials and movie stars, makes no attempt to impose much structure on his musings. The delight here is in contrasts. He is a walking, talking paradox, a heterosexual decked out as outlandishly as Boy George but whose ordinary-guy insights are closer to the sensibility of Bob Newhart.
Mr. Izzard is so successful because he was born for stand-up: he and his material are one. No one gets more of a wicked charge out of his observations than he does, and that's O.K. It all goes back to that ineffable skill, to stand before a crowd and demand that it see the world as you do.
In the category of nervy star turns, however, Mr. Mitchell, of "HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH" at the Jane Street Theater, is in an elite class all his own. Though technically not a one-person show -- in addition to a band, Cheater, a supporting player, virtually mute, shares the stage with him -- "Hedwig" is essentially a monologue with music, the story, narrated and sung by Mr. Mitchell, of a transsexual rock singer divided against himself.
Perched tenuously between manhood and womanhood, Hedwig is a soul of outward confusion seeking inner peace, and Mr. Mitchell delivers a spectacularly visceral portrait of an identity in tatters. His work here sums up the appeal of the best in solo performances. It's the naked ego on display, in all its rawness, humanity and frailty.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Linking a President's Personality and His Policies

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

FLAWED GIANT
Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973
By Robert Dallek
Illustrated. 754 pages. Oxford University Press. $35.
 In light of the current White House sex scandals, renewed attention is being paid to the character question. Just what bearing does the character of a President have on his ability to govern? Can personality be separated from policy; morality and temperament from governance? 
 In the case of Lyndon Baines Johnson, the scholar Robert Dallek argues, the private and the political were inextricably intertwined.
In "Flawed Giant," the second and concluding volume of his monumental life of Johnson, Mr. Dallek suggests that the 36th President's outsize, conflicted personality -- at once grandiose and insecure, idealistic and self-serving, visionary and petty -- played a major, perhaps even pivotal, role in shaping both his achievements and failures in office.
Mr. Dallek, professor of history at Boston University, suggests that Johnson's ambitious Great Society programs and commitment to civil rights were firmly rooted in his own sense of self as an underdog, a "poor boy from Texas struggling to emerge from the shadows and win universal approval." "As with all the major reforms he backed throughout his political career, he was most ardent and effective when he could see a public problem as an enlargement of a personal concern," Mr. Dallek writes.
He continues: "A war on poverty, Government programs to eliminate individual and family need, resonated with his own memories and enduring feelings of deprivation; equal rights and opportunities for minorities were an indirect assault on prejudice against a Lyndon Johnson, the Southerner or Southwesterner from rural Texas whose regional identity partly kept him from a Presidential nomination in 1960; Federal aid to education meant increased opportunity for the schooling Lyndon had used to pull himself up the economic and social ladders."
Yet if Johnson's domestic reforms owed a debt to his own identification with the disenfranchised, Mr. Dallek also suggests that his tragic mishandling of Vietnam stemmed from his need to see the war as a personal test of his judgment. Even as Johnson's "lifelong compulsion to be the best, to dominate and win" made him reluctant to become "the first American President to lose a war," his deep-seated insecurities (combined with his competitive mistrust of Robert F. Kennedy) compelled him to demonize critics of his Vietnam policy and cut off reasoned debate.
"Though no one can say with certainty what Johnson's fundamental motives were, including Johnson himself," Mr. Dallek writes, "it is not too much of a stretch to conclude that the Johnson personality was inhibiting him from a more realistic and sensible resolution of a war policy that seemed certain to lead to more losses, more domestic divisions and greater limitations on his capacity to lead at home and abroad."
Drawing upon hours of newly released White House tapes and dozens of interviews with people close to Johnson, Mr. Dallek has created, in this volume, a minutely detailed portrait of Johnson as a contradictory and larger-than-life figure, a Shakespearean character: needy, driven, devious, magnanimous and explosive. There is little about this portrait that is really new; in the last six months alone, Michael R. Beschloss's "Taking Charge" (an annotated collection of Johnson's White House tape transcripts) and Jeff Shesol's "Mutual Contempt" (an analysis of his rivalry with Robert F. Kennedy) have given us similar portraits of Johnson. But Mr. Dallek most persuasively shows how Johnson's personality informed his policy making and day-by-day decisions.
His book may not be as fluently written, or dramatically engaging, as Robert A. Caro's continuing biography of Johnson ("The Path to Power" and "Means of Ascent"), but it's considerably more evenhanded. We are left with a picture of a man who is less evil than fatally flawed, and less hateful than erratic, self-deluding and troubled.
Because Johnson, his Presidency and his prosecution of the Vietnam war have been dissected so frequently, much of "Flawed Giant" is devoted to retracing familiar ground. Once again, we are treated to discussions of Johnson's efforts to establish his Administration in the shadow of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Once again, we are treated to a chronicle of Johnson's legislative prowess in getting his Great Society bills passed. Once again, we are treated to an extended account of his escalation of the war in Vietnam and the growing protest against his Administration.
In Mr. Dallek's opinion, Johnson could not have walked away from Vietnam in 1963-64, given existing assumptions about the cold war and his own unproven record as an unelected President. He also argues that Johnson made two crucial mistakes in his later handling of the war. By failing to discuss his policy of escalation openly, Mr. Dallek contends, Johnson failed to "build the necessary consensus for the fighting"; and by late 1967, when he could have used antiwar sentiment at home and political developments in Vietnam to cut his losses and get out, he instead "stayed the course," having become blinded by his own rhetoric and wishful thinking about the progress of the war.
There are tidbits of news scattered throughout "Flawed Giant." Mr. Dallek contends that Johnson seriously considered getting back in the Presidential race in 1968, after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy; that he was reluctant to support his vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey, against Richard M. Nixon because of Humphrey's doubts about the war, and that he declined to damage the Nixon-Agnew campaign with accusations about their campaign financing because he wanted to have some political ammunition in the bank for possible future use against Nixon.
In the end, Mr. Dallek's most serious charge against Johnson is that his paranoic tendencies raised "questions about his judgment and capacity to make rational life and death decisions."
"Who then is to say when a President has passed the bounds of rational good sense?" he writes. "Certainly in Johnson's case, for all the cranky nonsense he espoused about his enemies, he remained largely in control of his faculties and more than capable of functioning as President. Still, no one should make light of how much his suspicions and anger toward his domestic critics distorted his judgments in dealing with Vietnam. It may be that he would have pursued the war as avidly even without his personal antagonisms. But it is clear that his personal quirks in dealing with war opponents contributed nothing constructive to the national dialogue on a failing war."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Missile Business

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
"I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, find that the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons ('weapons of mass destruction') and of the means of delivering such weapons, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States, and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."
Mr. Clinton's order outlined the diplomatic, economic and export penalties that could be used by the U.S. against proliferation.
 
 That was on Feb. 12, 1994. Almost ever since, a handful of reporters on a handful of newspapers have exposed cases of the U.S. ignoring or rationalizing sales of missile technology -- "the means" of delivery -- or getting into the business itself.
 The public and most of the press pay almost no attention. American business is annoyed when anybody makes a fuss about such matters.
Two recent cases:
On April 4, 1998, The New York Times reported that a Federal grand jury was investigating whether two U.S. companies, Loral Space and Electronic and Hughes Electronic, illegally gave space expertise to China that significantly advanced Beijing's ballistic-missile programs.
But the reporters, Jeff Gerth and Raymond Bonner, wrote that while the inquiry was under way Mr. Clinton dealt it a serious blow by quietly approving export to China of similar technology by one of the companies under investigation -- Loral.
On March 18, Bill Gertz of The Washington Times reported that the Administration would offer China access to missile technology barred under human right sanctions.
The sales, made and planned, permit China to lengthen the range of its missiles and sharpen their accuracy. The Gertz article says the U.S. will ask China not to sell the technology to countries like Iran and Pakistan that are developing nuclear weapons. U.S. intelligence says Beijing has made that promise before and broken it.
And the Administration offers no explanation why it is in American security interests to help China build missiles that will fly farther and hit more accurately. After all, a top Chinese general already has boasted they could pulverize Los Angeles.
In other cases, Mr. Clinton has not used his powers to punish China's sales of chemicals to Iran or Russia's transfer of complete intermediate-range missiles to Iran. The Administration permitted U.S. export to Russia of U.S. supercomputers that can be used to simulate nuclear explosions and are 10 times faster than the Russians made.
Some members of Congress pay attention. The majority members of the Senate Subcommittee on International Security and Proliferation issued an even-tempered but deeply critical report on Administration policy. The report said that about two dozen countries had or were working to develop long-range ballistic missiles, and added:
"It is time for the Administration to announce that America will no longer be endangered by ballistic-missile-delivered destruction from rogue states. The time for debating whether to deploy a national missile defense is over."
But on proliferation or missile defense nothing much happens. Congress calls for more reports or adds to the 60-odd government offices that deal with proliferation.
Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, writes in The National Interest that when you tell Washington insiders that your work focuses on preventing the spread of strategic weapons, they figure you can't hold down a real job. He says business generally views such work as being as bad as promoting human rights. U.S. diplomacy "engages" proliferating nations with "handouts or bribes" to such as China, Russia and North Korea.
All right. American business made foreign trade its ideology, overriding human rights -- not even a contest. The public did not mind. Making trade his own guiding star, Mr. Clinton broke his promises to fight for the victims of China's police-terror. The public didn't mind.
But I did think Americans would mind when Washington began absolving proliferators and getting into the business itself. But, who knows, maybe one day they will awake. If they do it will be because a handful of reporters won't fall asleep.

HEADLINE: Polaroid Posts Bigger Loss Than Expected

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Polaroid Corporation, saying it was hurt by the strong dollar, a weak Asian economy and much lower orders in the United States, reported a far bigger loss for the first quarter yesterday than analysts had expected.
Polaroid lost $17.4 million, or 39 cents a share, as sales were down 15 percent, to $390.6 million. A year earlier, it earned $15.8 million, or 35 cents a share. 
 Though analysts had expected a loss of only 5 to 10 cents a share, investors apparently were not disheartened. Polaroid shares slipped a couple of dollars in light trading after its announcement, but it quickly recovered, and then some. The stock closed at $42.875, up 93.75 cents.
"Wall Street is viewing this as a one-quarter problem," said Charles Hill, research director of First Call, which tracks analysts' earnings estimates.
Apparently, investors see Polaroid as a temporary victim of a push by retailers to slash inventories. Polaroid said that Wal-Mart, for example, had decreased its inventory of Polaroid products by 20 percent from the corresponding quarter last year, but that its sales of the products were 10 percent above last year's rate.
"What's important is what moves out their front door, not what moves out our back door," said Robert L. Guenther, a Polaroid vice president.
Moreover, last year Easter, a popular picture-taking time, fell on April 3, so retailers stocked up on film in March. This year, some Easter-related sales have moved into April because the holiday does not occur until April 12.
"The retailers will have to start restocking soon," predicted Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman & Reid.
In talks with analysts and reporters yesterday, Polaroid executives tried to sweeten the quarter's bitter news. Mr. Guenther said that retailers were "very enthusiastic" about Polaroid's new films and cameras.
Polaroid is also on a cost-cutting binge. It has promised to eliminate about 1,800 jobs before the year 2000. It has already sold some land and some underused plants.
"We've been planning for a good year, and we are not changing those plans," Mr. Guenther said.
But while most analysts are giving Polaroid the benefit of the doubt, some worry that its weakness could persist. They are concerned, for example, that retailers, armed with electronic systems for micromanaging inventories, will never again order huge amounts of film or cameras at a time. Others worry that Polaroid's new products may fail in the marketplace.
"I buy their story to some extent, but they'll really need some phenomenal improvement in earnings to meet their own numbers for the year," said Peter J. Enderlin of the First Albany Corporation.

HEADLINE: Observer;
A Poverty of Stardom

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
We of the Media are desperate for stars. That's why the nation and President Clinton can expect no relief from you know what. Boy, don't we all know what!
If we abandon the story, dear mass audience, what have we left to serve you? In all the Congress there is not a single star, not one person whose name is known to any but game-show contestants boning up for appearances on "Jeopardy." 
 Among the Capitol unknown, I include Speaker Newt Gingrich. A year or two ago he approached Mr. Clinton in star magnitude. Today, like Bernarr Macfadden and Jack LaLanne, he is grist for those where-are-they-now pieces in which newspapers remind us who's dead and who's not.
As for the Cabinet, it has been so bereft of stars for so long that no one would know it existed but for occasional news of some wretched cabinet secretary hounded by another special prosecutor for being all too human.
Washington once abounded in what the press calls "colorful characters." There was the great gushing Senate star, Everett Dirksen, "the wizard of ooze," as Time magazine called him.
The Senate also had three Kennedys, Hubert Humphrey, Gene McCarthy and, for color, Olin (Olin the Solon) Johnson, William (Wild Bill) Langer constantly chewing on cellophane-wrapped cigars, and Harry Byrd the Elder clad always in suits as white as vanilla ice cream. The Senate glittered with star power.
Look at Congress now: hordes seemingly groomed, clipped, dressed and color-coordinated by the same television makeup cosmetician, and not a star on the landscape.
Washington is filled with serious people engaged in serious business, some of it alarmingly serious. Right now, while the media fret about the President's character, Senate and President are quietly colluding in a dangerous and costly expansion of NATO, and nobody gives a hoot.
Probably more Americans know who Linda Tripp is than which three countries will extend NATO up to the borders of Russia. Except for a few newspapers, the media don't dare bore us with stories like that.
TV can't risk it. (Death to the ratings.) The tabloids couldn't care less. ("Where's the sex angle?") To put it another way, it's competition that keeps us dumb, that very competition that is said to underpin our greatness.
Competition means there isn't time to introduce minor characters unless they garnish tales of the star's latest adventure. Competition means pursuing the biggest possible audience, which means catering to the lowest common denominator.
The mass audience doesn't readily suffer long-winded dawdling over NATO or stories about who's sabotaging the latest health-care plan. We want stars, not details. This probably explains why the television networks' Washington coverage concentrates so intensely on the White House.
The Presidency offers a rich variety of TV entertainment themes: the family sitcom, soap opera, eye-popping spectacle, tales of intrigue and foul play, and lots more. Government, which is a nuts-and-bolts kind of business, goes unreported because it is not entertainment.
In the early days of television, producers used to respond to criticism of cheesy programming by saying they were "just giving the slobs what they want." From this came the current belief that television is powerless to affect audience tastes and shouldn't try to.
The printing press, desperate to hold its share of the mass market, is under economic pressure to go with the garish flow. Hence this endless Presidential-gossip story.
"It goes like this, Jack: The star has got himself into a titillating sexual pickle. Heavy-breathing enemies are out to ruin him. His wife and pals declare 'war.' There is enough dirty pool all around to compete with a mini-series about the Borgias."
And the beauty part? The beauty part is that a story this entertaining generates a raft of new stars: dedicated Inspector Starr, ladies of various ages with juicy stories to tell, cunning lawyers -- "the full catastrophe," to quote Zorba the Greek.
Meanwhile, who cares what's happening about taxes, all those corporate mergers, Social Security reform, health care, monopolies, the asphalting of America? When the entertainment is this rich, who can be bothered with such drearinesses? We'll scream later.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
The Bronx Is Up but He Parties Downtown

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
JIMMY RODRIGUEZ, who started out selling fish in the street and now owns Jimmy's Bronx Cafe, the hottest joint in the Bronx, has been running with a new crowd lately.
Last week, accompanied by his ever-present right-hand man, Richard Turley, who used to work with Andy Warhol, he attended the New York magazine party, the Armani show and a book party at the Mercer Hotel in SoHo whose hosts were Anna Wintour and Tina Brown. 
 On Saturday night, Sandy Hill, the socialite and adventurer, is having her birthday party at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.
"You should also get into the story that Jimmy is sticking his toe even further into East Side society, serving as chairman of the entertainment committee for the May 14 benefit party at the Hispanic Society Museum," Mr. Turley says calling in, sounding suspiciously as if he is reading a news release. "All the other committee members, most of whom work at Sotheby's or Christie's, were amazed Jimmy managed to get friend Tito Puente to perform."
"That's true," continues Mr. Turley, now seeming to depart from the script. "You will get Robert Isabell somehow in the story? He introduced Jimmy to Sandy Hill and Barbara Howard. He's a longtime Latinophile. He loves Latins."
You don't know Jimmy's Bronx Cafe? It's off the Major Deegan, at the foot of Fordham Road: a white building with architectural echoes of a car dealership, which it used to be.
Inside, past the framed silver satin tuxedo of Tito Puente, the legendary band leader whom Jimmy Rodriguez calls the king, and ballplayers' jerseys, there's a Caribbean-style seafood restaurant, a sports bar and a nightclub. You might see the Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, or a major leaguer.
You will also certainly come across 35-year-old Jimmy Rodriguez, six foot three inches of charm, which is a whole lot of charm.
When Jimmy (everybody calls him Jimmy) went to Cuba and met Fidel (another first-name kind of guy) and asked Fidel for a shirt for his uniform collection, Fidel gave Jimmy the whole khaki suit.
"I was so happy! Oh, my God! I couldn't believe it," says Jimmy, in the whispery, singsong voice he does when he's thrilled and delighted, which is almost always. "The whole uniform. I'm thinking, 'How am I gonna get this into the United States?' "
When Jimmy makes the rounds of his club with his rum and Coke, making sure everyone's having a good time, the men light up and the women follow like honeybees.
"The Latin Toots Shor," the newspapers call Jimmy. His story is journalistically irresistible. Jimmy dropped out of high school, sold lobsters under the Bronx River Parkway and expanded into his first restaurant, Mariscos del Caribe.
FIVE years ago, he opened Jimmy's Bronx Cafe. It's a success, everyone agrees, because of Jimmy. He walks the club and when he sees a man or a woman alone he introduces them and next thing they're dancing and Jimmy is chuckling like a proud papa. He sponsors 40 Little League teams and allows a church to meet in the restaurant on Sundays.
Now, under the aegis of Mr. Turley, Jimmy is expanding south, to Park Avenue and SoHo. He's been to Paris and to the Delano Hotel. ("The chic-est hotel in Miami Beach," Mr. Turley says. "He'll learn a lot.")
Jimmy also attended the Duke of Windsor auction at Sotheby's in February, paying $22,000 for three outfits, including lederhosen the Duke wore in Austria in 1937.
Why would Jimmy want something owned by an unemployed Englishman who was thought to be soft on the Nazis?
"I'm gonna frame it and put it downstairs next to Tito Puente," Jimmy says. "It's like the king next to another king. The king of Latin, the King of Windsor. He's got everything and he gives up the throne for a woman. To be as simple as he was. Tito Puente, he's the king of Latin and he's always amongst us."
"I just had to have something of his on the wall," he said, referring to the Duke. "He's such a sharp dresser. It's history."
Mr. Turley puts in quickly, "A lot of historians feel it was not clear the Duke was a Nazi sympathizer."
"It was like Lotto," Jimmy says. "This woman has the King. He just gave up everything. The power of a woman is an amazing thing."
Jimmy's Bronx Cafe grosses $5 million a year, Jimmy says. The subject doesn't interest Jimmy. Money is just a tool, he says. What he wants to do with that tool is to make people happy, let everyone know the Bronx is back.
"I had to put the name Bronx in," he says of his cafe. "It could have been Jimmy's. You have to be proud of the Bronx, proud of the change."
So given that, what does Jimmy need with all those East Side society people, the Armani fashion shows?
"Knowledge," Jimmy says. "Friends. Knowledge. The space talks to you, the way the furniture is laid out."
Jimmy does the low whispery thing: "It's amazing, it's amazing. How they spent two or three million dollars for a 25-minute show. I walk into an Armani fashion show, I can't wait for that to happen in the Bronx."

HEADLINE: Clinton, Visiting Tobacco Country, Tries to Win Over Farmers on Legislation

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: CARROLLTON, Ky., April 9

 BODY:
President Clinton vowed today that he would continue to fight for tobacco legislation despite the intransigence of the cigarette manufacturers, and he promised the residents of this tobacco-growing community that their livelihoods would not be threatened by the bill.
"We don't have to wreck the fabric of life in your community," he declared in a speech in the Carroll County High School gymnasium. "But even in tobacco country, we can't deny what the scientists have told us or what has been done to market tobacco to children." 
 Mr. Clinton's visit here, a rural area about an hour southwest of Cincinnati, was scheduled long before the leading American cigarette manufacturers announced on Wednesday that they had cut off discussions with the White House and Congress about legislation to regulate tobacco because they could see that the direction the political process was heading was unfavorable to the industry.
The President seemed undaunted today by the companies' announcement. "I am going to do my dead-level best to get legislation passed this year," he said.
One reason for Mr. Clinton's visit, aides said, is to exploit a widening rift between tobacco growers and cigarette manufacturers and to convince the farmers that the companies' legislative interests were not theirs. The settlement the tobacco companies reached last June with state attorneys general did not address what would happen to tobacco farmers and their communities if fewer people smoked and the demand for tobacco dropped.
Mr. Clinton, however, has made this a priority from the beginning. With his support, the bill approved last week by the Senate Commerce Committee would set aside money and have other protections for farmers and their communities. To the displeasure of the manufacturers, bill includes provisions to keep the price of tobacco high.
Part of Mr. Clinton's route to the high school was lined with protesters carrying signs like "Tobacco pays my bills." Many, if not most, of them said they had been organized and bused here by the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, which is based in Louisville and makes Lucky Strike and Kool, among other brands of cigarettes. Before the speech, the President had a give-and-take with farmers and others at a warehouse where nearly $1 million worth of tobacco was sold on Wednesday.
Bill Sprague, president of the Kentucky Farm Bureau, the largest organization of farmers in the state, said the 60,000 tobacco farmers in Kentucky earned about $1 billion a year, an important element in the state's economy. Tobacco is, by far, the most profitable crop per acre that can be grown here.
"We can't afford to completely dismantle our tobacco industry," Mr. Sprague said.
The most striking remarks came from Mattie Mack, a farmer from Brandenburg, near Louisville.
"My four children did not smoke," Mrs. Mack told the President. "I don't smoke. My husband doesn't smoke. And we are against children smoking, Mr. President, but we shouldn't be penalized on account of children smoking."
She went on: "Tobacco has been good. We paid for our farm off the tobacco. We educated our kids off of tobacco. We paved our old driveway with blacktop on tobacco. We pay our property taxes. We pay the preacher on Sunday morning. We pay for our fertilizer. We overhaul our tractors and our wagons, and we buy tires. We pay our insurance. And we pay the man to help us on the farm. And we pay his Social Security, and we pay his Medicare. And we just try to live right and do right on tobacco."
Despite such emotions, Mr. Clinton was in the kind of setting where he thrives. He looked the skeptics in the eye and seemed to have won many of them over when he offered one of his favorite lines: "We have no interest whatever in putting the tobacco companies out of business. I just want to get them out of the business of selling tobacco to children."
A section of the Commerce Committee bill written by Senator Wendell H. Ford, a Kentucky Democrat who joined Mr. Clinton, would allow the Government to buy out tobacco farmers who wanted to leave the business. Financial aid would be given to those who stayed on the farm and to communities suffering because of a drop in tobacco sales.
The measure would leave in place the Government's tobacco program, which is a target for elimination by many Republicans, including Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who heads the Agriculture Committee.
The program costs the Government nothing, but by regulating tobacco production, it keeps the price artificially high. That, of course, is good for the farmers. But the program is also favored by the public health authorities. Higher tobacco prices mean more expensive cigarettes, and that in turn, the authorities believe, discourages smoking.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Bonds Turn Downward as Dollar Continues to Weaken

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bonds closed mostly lower yesterday, hurt by further weakness in the dollar and suggestions that the Federal Reserve may be less concerned than previously believed about the impact of Asia's problems on the domestic economy.
The Treasury's 30-year issue ended slightly higher in a trading session shortened by the Easter holiday. Shorter-term maturities ended slightly lower in price. 
 Today the financial markets will be closed for Good Friday and on Monday the European markets will be closed.
Traders said a major force in the market yesterday was the dollar, which had risen to a six-and-a-half-year high against the yen last week but has fallen for four straight days. It was driven down sharply yesterday after the Bank of Japan sold dollars for yen to defend the Japanese currency's value.
Weakness in the dollar tends to dampen the foreign demand for United States Treasury securities.
Additional pressure on the bond market came from remarks by Susan Phillips, a Federal Reserve governor, who was quoted by the Market News service as saying the Fed is less concerned that Asia's weakness will slow the economy, and more focused on the tight labor market, strong growth and risk of rising inflation.
The 30-year Treasury rose 7/32, to a price of 103 15/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, declined to 5.88 percent, from 5.89 percent Wednesday.
The bond market's weakness came despite new evidence that inflation remains benign. Yesterday the Labor Department released its Producer Price Index report on prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers, which showed the index down three-tenths of a percent in March, the fifth consecutive monthly decline. Excluding volatile food and energy, the index was unchanged.
"Inflation performance continues to astound and amaze market observers," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
But Mr. Fine said the market was more focused on the sentiments expressed by Fed governor Phillips, which suggested the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which determines interest-rate policy, has grown more vigilant about inflation risks.
Traders said the market will likely focus next week on the retail sales and Consumer Price Index reports, to be released Tuesday, for further clues of possibly higher inflation. But both reports are expected to show a continuation of the same moderate economic growth that has kept inflation low.

HEADLINE: Air Jamaica's American Problem;
A Small Airline Holds Its Own Against a Much Bigger Rival

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica

 BODY:
In 1993, American Airlines gave Gordon Stewart, owner of 10 Caribbean resorts and this island's most celebrated entrepreneur, an award for his contribution to developing tourism in the region.
Three years later, after Mr. Stewart took control of Air Jamaica, the troubled state-owned airline, and began adding routes and improving service, the folks at American gave him something else to remember them by: They slashed fares by 50 percent, driving an already shaky Air Jamaica to the brink of collapse. 
 And that wasn't all. A short time later, Mr. Stewart recalled in an interview at his office here, a spokesman for American implied on a local radio show that Air Jamaica's planes were unsafe. "It was ruthless," he said. "Airline competition is kill and destroy. It is worse than any industry I have ever seen." (American said it was unaware of the incident.)
As it turned out, Mr. Stewart gave as good as he got. Since that near-death experience, he has grabbed market share away from American -- Air Jamaica says it now carries nearly half the air passengers who arrive on the island, more than double the total of three years ago -- and increased revenues to $225 million last year, from $128 million in 1994. He has increased Air Jamaica's reliability and reach, and won over customers with touches like free champagne. And he has survived a drawn-out battle with regulators in the United States and the abrupt departures in the last two years of three senior executives.
For all his doggedness, the airline is still bleeding red ink, losing $145 million in the last two years. But Mr. Stewart, who goes by the nickname Butch and wears his button-down shirts open at the collar, predicts Air Jamaica will soon turn the corner into profitability. And it continues to expand. On Monday, it began an alliance with Delta Air Lines, drawing passengers from that carrier's vast network. Certainly, American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, now regards Mr. Stewart with heightened respect.
"One thing you have to give Butch Stewart, he is going to try everything to make the company work," said Peter J. Dolara, American's senior vice president for Miami, the Caribbean and Latin America, who has known him for years. "The man is a ferocious competitor."
But then, so were a lot of other entrepreneurs who started airlines in the United States and elsewhere and got beaten down by the giants, from Freddy Laker, whose discount Laker Airways collapsed in 1982, to the founders of Valujet Inc., which nearly collapsed after the crash of one of its planes in the Florida Everglades in 1996. Only a handful of such pioneers have survived the punishment that the dominant players have doled out. The most famous of them is probably Richard Branson, an Englishman who founded Virgin Atlantic Airways in London in 1984. Mr. Branson weathered an early dirty-tricks campaign by British Airways, and through penny-pinching, smart marketing and a knack for turning setbacks to his advantage, went on to build an empire of more than 200 companies with $2.5 billion in annual revenue.
Mr. Stewart is commonly referred to as Jamaica's Branson, and in his bid to live up to that title, he enjoys advantages that go beyond the sheer grit that Mr. Dolara talks about. His corporate empire -- which includes trading and manufacturing businesses as well as resorts -- has made him a budding billionaire, giving him vast resources to fall back on in hard times. The hotels and resorts, of course, can only gain from the extra tourists his airline hauls to the Caribbean, as his critics are fond of pointing out.
He also exerts huge political influence in Jamaica, where he is considered by some to be more powerful than the Prime Minister. In any case, the Government is unlikely to let Air Jamaica -- with all its jobs -- fail. It is still a shareholder and has already agreed to extend a $110 million loan guarantee to the airline -- as compensation for its regulatory problems with Washington -- that will enable it to keep more spare parts on the island, decreasing costly delays.
American remains the airline to beat. Over the last 20 years, the competition for the Caribbean market has diminished as Eastern, Braniff, Pan Am and others that offered regular service went under. Today, American flies about 63 percent of the available seats in the region, most of them through its hubs in Miami and Puerto Rico.
Mr. Stewart had a powerful motive to challenge American. Without a thriving national airline, Jamaica, with its tourism-based economy, could be held hostage to the whims of foreign carriers. The islands of Antigua, St. Lucia and Grenada found out last month how serious that risk is; they agreed to pay American $3 million a year to continue jet service after it announced plans to divert the planes to more profitable routes.
Still, Mr. Stewart did not jump at the chance to buy Air Jamaica when the Government put the airline up for sale in the early 1990's. It was only after two other deals fell apart, with no other buyers on the horizon, that he put together an investment group in 1994 that paid $37.5 million for 70 percent of the carrier. His 46 percent stake is the single largest; the Government holds 25 percent and employees 5 percent.
The move was the kind of grand public gesture Mr. Stewart has become famous for. In 1992, when the Jamaican dollar was under pressure, he vowed to spend $1 million to support it, raising confidence in the currency. In 1995, he founded a daily newspaper that forced the venerable Jamaica Daily Gleaner to buy color presses and improve its coverage.
"I never thought I would get rich out of it," he said of the Air Jamaica investment, "but I thought Jamaica and all of us would be poor without it."
Born in Jamaica, Mr. Stewart, 56, never attended college and began his career selling air-conditioners in 1968. His various companies now sell water pumps, electrical generators, cars and auto parts.
In 1981, he founded Sandals Resorts, which offers holiday packages to couples. The company counts 10 resorts on six islands, and plans to open two more, geared toward families, this year. ATL Group, Mr. Stewart's holding company, is the island's biggest private enterprise, its largest earner of foreign currency and one of its biggest employers.
After taking control of Air Jamaica, he set out to improve the airline's notoriously unreliable service. He leased new Airbus wide-body jets and painted them bright yellow, orange, blue and magenta. He gave the flight attendants new uniforms and more training, and he offered coach passengers a choice of hot meals and free champagne, rum punch and beer. He won back many ethnic Jamaicans in the United States and elsewhere who had abandoned the airline with marketing that appealed to their national pride. And last summer, he opened a hub in Montego Bay, expanding the airline's service to other Caribbean islands.
As a result of his innovations, Air Jamaica says that it has increased its share of passengers flown to the island to 46 percent, from 22 percent three years ago. And Air Jamaica says it now carries two passengers for every one on American on Caribbean routes where they compete directly.
There have been setbacks, of course, and the biggest was beyond Mr. Stewart's control. In 1995, in a move to pressure foreign governments to improve their civil aviation bureaucracies, the Federal Aviation Administration restricted the activities in the United States of several foreign airlines, including Air Jamaica.
The action meant that Air Jamaica could not use its new Airbus jets on routes to the United States, and had to lease other planes at high rates instead. Compounding its financial pain, a consortium of banks backed out of a loan agreement, forcing the airline to borrow at much higher interest rates.
Before the restrictions were lifted last fall, they had cost Air Jamaica an estimated $165 million. By that time, though, the carrier had already begun operations at its new hub at Montego Bay. Planes now leave early in the morning from Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and other cities for Montego Bay, fly on to five other islands as well as Cuba and return in the afternoon to take passengers back to the United States.
Robert Booth, an aviation consultant who specializes in Latin America and the Caribbean, said that the hub was a good idea but that it was too small. "A hub works when you have 15 flights coming from 15 different points connecting and going on to other points," he said. Indeed, last month, Air Jamaica announced that it was cutting service to two islands because of a lack of passengers.
Nevertheless, Mr. Stewart insisted that the hub was working better than expected. "It is a building process," he said.
The new alliance with Delta should help. The agreement, under which Delta will sell seats on Air Jamaica flights from New York, Atlanta and Miami, gives Air Jamaica access to 23 million members of Delta's frequent-flier program, who can now use their miles to fly to Jamaica for the first time.
While Air Jamaica's prospects are looking brighter, the pressure of the last two years has taken its toll. Three top executives have left the airline since mid-1996, including two chief executives. In March, Christopher Zacca, 38, a veteran of several of Mr. Stewart's other businesses and acting chief executive of Air Jamaica since January, was named the airline's top manager. Mr. Zacca is in charge of carrying out the "Way Forward" plan to make Air Jamaica profitable by 2000. Mr. Stewart, ever optimistic, called the plan conservative and said the airline could actually go into the black as early as this year.
Just as important, he believes he has finally won admission into the club of established industry players. He recalls how he stopped talking to Mr. Dolara, the American Airlines senior vice president, for six months after the bigger company put Air Jamaica in its cross hairs. Tensions have since eased, and American now seems resigned to letting Air Jamaica have its share of the market. "I like Dolara a lot and respect his talents," Mr. Stewart said, "but I think Dolara likes me a lot more now because he has felt my talents."

HEADLINE: Officials Say Lower Interest Rates Have Cut Cost of Lilco Deal

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, N.Y., April 9

 BODY:
The Long Island Power Authority, which has been pushing to take over the Long Island Lighting Company's electricity service, announced today that the cost of financing a takeover had dropped by about one-third -- nearly $5 billion -- because of lower interest rates.
The projected savings were announced by Gov. George E. Pataki's appointees on the Power Authority. They also unanimously adopted electricity rates that would go into effect after a takeover. The new rates would cut customer bills an average of 20 percent, up from the previously announced 19.4 percent. 
 "It's the largest single across-the-board rate reduction in the history of America," the authority's chairman, Richard M. Kessel, said at the agency's meeting here. Long Islanders now pay the highest electricity charges in North America.
Despite the announcement, opponents seeking to block the plan made new attacks on the credibility of the projected savings.
Although the takeover has cleared several major regulatory hurdles, it is not final. The next battleground may be a meeting on Wednesday of the State Public Authorities Control Board, where Governor Pataki is pressing for approval of the bonds to finance the takeover.
In preparation, the critics are focusing their efforts on Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the State Assembly, who controls a pivotal vote on the control board. The bonds cannot be issued without the board's unanimous approval. The board's other two votes are controlled by the Governor and his ally, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno.
Mr. Silver gave preliminary approval to the takeover last year. But he attached several conditions, and now his representatives are scrutinizing the power authority for its compliance. The Speaker's representatives have asked the power authority to guarantee its promised rate cuts in the bond resolution or bond covenants. So far, the power authority has refused.
Mr. Kessel, in a letter to Speaker Silver's advisers, said that the authority's experts believed that "incorporating this guarantee into the bond resolution would negatively impact the credit evaluation and marketability of L.I.P.A.'s bonds, thus increasing costs for ratepayers."
Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, which has filed a court challenge to the proposed takeover, said, "The rate cut guarantee means nothing if it's not in the bond covenants."
Pat Lynch, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, said yesterday: "I see no change in our overall position." She declined to elaborate.
Mr. Shapiro also called the projected savings "phony."
Mr. Kessel disputed the criticism. "There was no deception here," he said. "Those are updates on numbers that help the consumer."
He said that when the plan was drafted a year ago, interest rates were projected at 6.8 percent, with a cost of $17.5 billion in interest and principal for the takeover.
Now interest rates are down about 1 percentage point. That savings, plus a new pledge today to pay off the $4.5 billion debt for Lilco's never-opened nuclear plant at Shoreham in 17 years instead of 33 years, would bring the total savings to nearly $5 billion. After Shoreham is paid off, he said, the power authority should be able to reduce electricity rates another 10 percent.
Critics contend that the takeover would not deliver the promised savings and would enrich Lilco stockholders.

HEADLINE: Detroit Council Approves Plan For 3 Casinos

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 9

 BODY:
The City Council today approved a $1.8 billion plan to make Detroit the largest city in the country with casino gambling, despite complaints that blacks were shut out of the project and concerns about its location.
The plan to build three casinos in a warehouse district east of downtown on the Detroit River now goes to the Michigan Gaming Control Board. 
 "We're obviously very happy and very pleased," said Herb Strather, chairman of Atwater group that includes Circus Circus, which won one of the three casino franchises. The other two went to the MGM Grand and the Greektown/Chippewa Indians.
Mayor Dennis Archer pushed the project as a way to revitalize the city's slumping economy, but was criticized after none of the three franchises were awarded to blacks in a city that is 80 percent black.
But Mr. Archer said that blacks had stakes in all three casino groups and would benefit from the creation of 11,000 permanent full-time jobs and the infusion of $180 million in taxes a year that will go to fighting crime and supporting schools.
Casinos will "bring jobs, business opportunities, a new stream of tax revenue and a first-class tourist attraction to the city of Detroit," Mr. Archer said at a news conference, standing in front of the council members who approved the plan.
Don Barden, a black businessman whose casino proposal was rejected by Mr. Archer, emphasized that the state must still approve the plan.
"This is just a first phase," Mr. Barden said. "We could be back to square one in a number of months."
The state gaming board could act within four to six months, paving the way for temporary casinos to open by the end of the year or the beginning of 1999, Mr. Archer said. Permanent casinos would follow two to three years later.
The council approved the Greektown/Chippewa Indians and Circus Circus proposals each by votes of 6 to 3. The MGM Grand proposal passed 5 to 4, after Councilman Kenneth Cockrel switched his vote.
Mr. Cockrel said he voted against MGM because it has approximately 3 percent black ownership, the lowest of the three winning bids.
Mr. Archer also came under fire for moving the proposed casino site from the central business district to the area along the river a few miles away.
Councilman Nicholas Hood 3d voted against the casinos because of their location.
"It doesn't have any economic spinoff for the downtown," Mr. Hood said of the riverfront site.
Some residents disagreed.
"It truly is the right thing for the city," said Brian McDonald, manager of the Soup Kitchen Saloon in the riverfront district. "It will bring a lot of revenue and physical improvements."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Declined for Fifth Month in a Row in March

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Producer prices fell for the fifth month in a row in March, the Government said today, showing that inflation remains calm amid healthy growth in the eighth year of the economy's expansion.
The Labor Department's Producer Price Index fell three-tenths of 1 percent, a bigger drop than economists had expected. 
 Even when food and energy costs, which fluctuate widely, were excluded, prices were unchanged. In February, the overall index fell by one-tenth of 1 percent, while the core index, which excludes food and energy, rose by that amount.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of unemployed Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week by 2,000. Initial state jobless claims declined to 308,000, from 310,000 in the week ended on March 28.
The low level of claims reinforced perceptions that the labor market remained strong despite last week's surprising report that payrolls fell by 36,000 jobs in March. Many economists have dismissed that number as a fluke caused by seasonal variations.
"Despite the moderate tone of last month's employment report, these claims numbers don't tell us that the labor market is necessarily getting weaker," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
With the unemployment rate at a low 4.7 percent, many economists have been worried that inflationary pressures might begin to build, particularly in the labor-intensive service sector because of a bidding up of wages, possibly prompting the Federal Reserve to lift short-term interest rates.
So far, that has not happened.
In the goods sector, in fact, prices have been falling, not rising, in a trend many analysts have linked to the economic problems in Asia, which have depressed worldwide demand for commodities like oil.
Economists have repeatedly expressed surprise at the benign inflation data during the current economic expansion. As of February, the Consumer Price Index indicated inflation was running at an annual rate of only 1.4 percent.
In the 12 months ended March 31, the Producer Price Index declined by 1.8 percent.
"The data fit perfectly with the story that Asia's crisis is causing prices to decline," said Chris Rupkey, economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York, who noted that the series of consecutive monthly declines in that index that began in November tracked the acceleration of the Asian financial crisis.
The March decline in producer prices was led by energy prices, which tumbled 1.9 percent and have declined a hefty 10.4 percent over the last year. Last month, food prices slid four-tenths of a percent, while passenger car costs edged up one-tenth of a percent.
The producer index for crude goods, or raw materials, like petroleum and wheat fell 1.6 percent in March. The index for prices of intermediate goods, or items in the middle stages of production, declined five-tenths of a percent.
Many economists warned that the energy and commodity price declines that have helped push the index lower might not continue in the months ahead.
"Oil made its big plunge in mid-February to mid-March and then rebounded," said Joe Ladoga, financial economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
"We are seeing the bottoming out of commodities prices, and they have the base to move higher," he said.

HEADLINE: Kennel Club Recalls Its Dog Bible After Outcry on Profiles

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Serious dog owners tend to share some characteristics of the pets they love: Sensitive. Loyal. Protective.
So it should perhaps have come as no surprise to the American Kennel Club that the latest edition of "The Complete Dog Book," its canine bible, might stir howls of protest. 
 The American Kennel Club has decided to recall the book after complaints that it unfairly maligned the reputation of such popular breeds as dachshunds, Dalmatians and Scottish terriers. Dog fanciers objected to the book's description of dozens of dog breeds as unsuitable for families with children.
The tempest in a dog dish was unleashed by the book's 19th edition, a revision of previous volumes of the 69-year-old classic. The new version describes as "not good" for children some 40 breeds, including toy poodles, Maltese terriers, borzois, Chihuahuas and whippets.
At the same time, the 19th edition pronounces as child-safe some breeds whose popular reputation is more fearsome, including Doberman pinschers and bull terriers.
The book has sold two million copies since 1929, and is a resource for the owners of the nation's 145 registered pure dog breeds. The 19th edition, $32.95 and 756 pages, calls itself the "one reference book for the sport of purebred dogs" in its book jacket copy. The Kennel Club said it would replace the book without charge after issuing a revised edition in June.
The troublesome descriptions are in new "breed profiles" that list dogs' characteristics. For example, the entry for German shorthaired pointer says, "Relationship with children -- not good."
Some 30,000 copies of the book were printed in December, and 10,000 have been removed from distribution. The recall started in January, but the Kennel Club did not publicly respond to the controversy until Wednesday.
In a Jan. 28 letter sent to 500 member clubs and 4,000 affiliates, the Kennel Club said many of the "breed profiles" had been "inadvertently published with incorrect and controversial information."
Yesterday, a Kennel Club spokeswoman, Valerie Geiss, said, "The book does have errors."
In a statement, the Kennel Club, based in Manhattan, said it "sincerely regrets the distress caused to dog owners and breeders." It said the edition's format had been "changed for the first time in recent memory without the proper vetting."
"This has been an expensive and embarrassing lesson for the A.K.C.," it added. "Procedures have been put in place to prevent a recurrence."
While popular wisdom often ascribes varying predispositions to different breeds -- high-strung poodles, temperamental Chihuahuas, valiant collies -- many dog breeders become apoplectic about such stereotypes. For example, owners of Staffordshire terriers, commonly called pit bulls, have long contended that their pets have been unfairly maligned.
It is not clear how the characterizations in the Kennel Club book were arrived at, or to what degree the outcry among dog owners influenced the decision to revise the book. But critics challenged the organization's whole world view.
"The Kennel Club's pronouncements are ridiculous," said Rob Abner, publisher of D.G.N.Y., a magazine for New York City dog owners. "It's a very outdated way of thinking about dogs."
Mr. Abner denied that certain breeds had a genetic predisposition to viciousness, saying: "And even if they did, you can't consider a dog without its environment. It's the nature-nurture question. There is no breed of dog that is more or less compatible with children."
Canine clubs also growled back at the Kennel Club.
"You just can't make such a blanket statement about dachshunds," said Carl Holder, secretary of the Dachshund Club of America. "I've never had any of my dachshunds bite any children. They're very friendly with kids."
Mr. Holder, who lives in Lumberton, Tex., and has seven dachshunds, added: "Dogs are not vehicles stamped out of an assembly line. Each one is an individual."
Sandra Whittle, president of the Chihuahua Club of America in Chesterfield, Va., said: "There is a stereotype of Chihuahuas that they are mean and temperamental. But that is completely wrong."
Ms. Whittle, who has five Chihuahuas, added: "Chihuahuas can be wonderful with children if they are introduced to them in the right way. They should learn to play and trust each other in short sessions under the close supervision of adults."
The Kennel Club would not say how much the recall would cost.
But Albert N. Greco, an associate professor at the Fordham University graduate business school, said, "The organization will take a big financial and public-relations hit."
Professor Greco, an expert on printing economics, said the total loss to the Kennel Club could reach $800,000, considering the cost of the initial and replacement editions, including transportation and warehouse costs.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Investors Shrug Off Forecasts of Lower Earnings

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Investors remain nonchalant about the corporate earnings season, which begins in earnest next week, although stock analysts now expect little or no growth in overall profits.
The stock market has already risen much faster than was expected at the beginning of the year, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 103 points yesterday, bringing its increase to 13.7 percent so far in 1998. 
 The reason for the nonchalance may be that relatively few companies are expected to be poor performers in the first quarter, and they are concentrated in two sectors -- technology and energy. So as long as the overall economic outlook is still strong, investors reason, the broad stock market can continue to rise, too.
"The optimists might say it is better to have the revisions concentrated in a few sectors so the rest of the stocks could do better," said Melissa Brown, the director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities.
Thomas Doerflinger, an investment strategist at Paine Webber, said investors had probably discounted a profit drop at oil companies. A plunge in oil prices caused by overproduction and a drop in demand from Asia is hurting those companies, but it "is not symptomatic of a general weakness in the U.S. economy," he said.
I.B.E.S. International Inc., which collects corporate earnings estimates of analysts, is now forecasting a decline of four-tenths of a percent in the operating earnings for the 500 companies in the closely watched Standard & Poor's stock index in the first quarter, compared with the first quarter of 1997. Just three months ago, I.B.E.S. projected a 9.6 percent increase for the period. The First Call Corporation, another earnings analysis firm, is predicting a scant increase of five-tenths of a percent, down from its 10.4 percent estimate at the beginning of the year.
The collapse in the I.B.E.S. estimates has been concentrated among nine companies in the S.& P 500. Compaq Computer, Intel, I.B.M., Amoco, Chevron, Texaco, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield and Union Pacific account for one-third of the downward revision. And the entire technology and energy sectors account for just over half of the revision.
First Call's list is slightly different because of the analysts included and some other technical factors. But by its count, 25 companies represent half of the downward revision. Among those not in the select I.B.E.S. group are Exxon, Motorola, Boeing, DuPont, General Motors, Silicon Graphics and Amerada Hess.
The big role of technology and oil companies in the revisions is an initial indication of the impact of the financial turmoil in Asia. Mr. Doerflinger said that he had expected the Asian slowdown to be felt most immediately and most strongly by commodity-based companies, which include oil companies and technology companies that sell commodities like semiconductors and disk drives.
Sluggish performance this quarter from these groups could still be troubling, because many investors base their expectations for overall profits on the performance of technology companies like Intel and Microsoft. (Microsoft, it should be noted, was responsible for the biggest upward revision in earnings estimates for the first quarter in the I.B.E.S. data.)
This was clear earlier this week. After closing above 9,000 for the first time ever on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply for two days. Motorola's announcement of lower growth estimates for computer chip sales this year contributed to the slide Tuesday.
But yesterday, investors looked on the bright side, encouraged by stronger-than-expected earnings from Yahoo Inc. and the Chrysler Corporation. The Dow jumped 103.38 points, or 1.2 percent, to 8,994.86, and reached a high of 9,062.12 during the day. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index climbed 9.02 points, to 1,110.67, while the Nasdaq index jumped 13.23 points, to 1,820.24.
The pessimism of stock analysts that shows up in the earnings estimates is surprising to some economists, in part because the economy has been more robust so far this year than many forecasters thought.
"Yes, Asia is negative and yes, the dollar is strong," said William C. Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, referring to two factors that will depress earnings.
"But the economy grew at 4 percent in the first quarter, so why should profits have collapsed? It doesn't add up to me."
To others, a decline in earnings is not a concern just for the near term. James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that the real assessment would be made when it was clear what caused the earnings decline. The earnings downdraft could be a result of nothing more than oil price declines and the sharp price cutting in the computer industry, he said.
Or it could turn out that more Americans are buying cheaper products made abroad and that American exports are falling very sharply, a hint of which appeared in the January trade data. If that is the case, the outlook could be worse for growth here and for future earnings prospects.
Retail sales could be great, he said, but they could be all Asian products. "This would mean that U.S. companies are not doing that well."
So far, earnings estimates for the last three quarters of this year are relatively strong, despite the first-quarter drop-off. "Either the analysts are suggesting that the rest of the year is going to be extremely good," Ms. Brown said, "or they are going to have to bring their estimates down."

Estimates of operating earnings for the S.&P. 500 have fallen drastically. Analysts now predict earnings will fall 0.4 percent in the first quarter, though they predicted a gain of 9.6 percent at the end of last year. Here are the companies with the biggest revisions and their contribution to that 10 percentage-point decline. (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: Flush but Crime-Wary Cities Bid Up Pay for Police Chiefs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
When the District of Columbia considered hiring the New Orleans Police Superintendent, Richard Pennington, as the capital's police chief, city officials in New Orleans did everything they could to keep him happy where he was.
That included the offer of a four-year contract with a raise of 50 percent, to $150,000, making Superintendent Pennington New Orleans's highest-paid city employee. Washington, meanwhile, turned to Charles H. Ramsey, second-in-command of the Chicago Police Department, offering him $150,000, which is $60,000 more than Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. is paid and $40,000 more than Mr. Ramsey made in Chicago. 
 "I was really flattered," Mr. Pennington said of the competition for him. "I didn't want to start a bidding war. But when my Mayor said he would match whatever Washington was offering, that made me feel very comfortable."
With crime rates falling dramatically in many places around the country and a strong economy bolstering efforts by local governments to improve services, candidates for police chief with a proven record of success have become municipal superstars. Like free agents in baseball and highly skilled corporate executives, they are intensely recruited and highly paid -- whether by the cities that lure them away or the cities that keep them in place.
Police chiefs are benefiting from the plummeting crime rates, though the reasons for it are the subject of debate. Some experts have cited other factors -- including an aging criminal population and the weakening of the crack cocaine epidemic -- as having had more impact on crime statistics than police work has had.
Nonetheless, a recent survey by the Police Executive Research Forum in Washington, which helps local governments find candidates for police chief, found that 25 percent of chiefs in cities with at least 50,000 people earned annual salaries of more than $100,000. One of the highest-paid chiefs, Bernard C. Parks, who replaced Willie L. Williams last year in Los Angeles, is paid more than $200,000.
Mr. Pennington said he was the first New Orleans police superintendent to be given a contract.
The competition for talented municipal executives is not limited to police chiefs. With the Federal Government shifting more responsibility, and money, to the states to run programs and states giving local governments more leeway in administering them, skilled executives recruited to lead welfare, public works and other municipal agencies are hot properties.
Officials in San Jose, Calif., searched two years for a director of information technology, offering an annual salary of $105,000, but they could not find a suitable candidate for that salary. They finally filled the position in February, hiring Ken Phillips, a computer company executive from Oregon, for about $140,000 a year.
"I've never seen anything like this," Norman Roberts, president of a Los Angeles company that helps local governments identify qualified candidates for senior positions, said of the salaries that leading candidates are winning. "In the last six months, at least 15 to 20 percent of all our recommended candidates have gotten offers, then counter offers." In general, recruiters said, the demand for highly qualified department heads stemmed from the recession of the early 1990's, when many local governments were forced to pare their employment rolls to avoid budget deficits. That often meant saving money by eliminating middle managers.
But those cuts had a longer range impact, depleting future candidate pools in police departments and other government agencies for higher positions. Now, with the economy flush again and local governments eager to restore cannibalized departments, superior candidates for senior positions are widely sought.
Perhaps no candidates find themselves more coveted than a police chief or a second-in-command who can claim that his strategies of community policing helped drive down crime rates. In the early 1990's, when homicide and crack cocaine seemed unbeatable, many big cities fought their way through with strategies devised by their police chiefs.
Now, with murder rates dropping by as much as a third in some cities, like New York and Minneapolis -- although for reasons that remain the subject of heated debate -- police chiefs like Mr. Pennington have become heroes in their cities with popularity ratings as high as any in the local government. In New Orleans, the murder rate has fallen by 40 percent over the last three years.
One of the biggest stars, William J. Bratton, the former New York City Police Commissioner and a former Boston police commander, has written a book, "Turnaround: How America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic." Some of his senior disciples have been heavily recruited elsewhere, including John F. Timoney, who was recently named Police Commissioner in Philadelphia for $113,000 a year.
In most places, safe streets and neighborhoods contribute to a strong local tax base and civic pride, but only recently are police chiefs being recognized for the crucial role their programs play in the economic stability of a city or county.
"They have a huge impact on property values, the commercial viability of the community and the eagerness of people to enjoy themselves in public places," said Thomas C. Frazier, the Police Commissioner in Baltimore, where crime has fallen during his four years in charge.
Police officials generally agree that police departments that are running smoothly promote from within when the job of chief becomes vacant. Outside candidates, like Mr. Ramsey in Washington, are usually sought when past policies have failed, or corruption in the department demands that city leaders look elsewhere. The District's previous chief, Larry D. Soulsby, resigned last November amid ethical questions.
The Police Executive Research Forum survey, which polled 358 chiefs in cities with populations of 50,000 or more last September, found that 56.7 percent of them had been promoted from within and 42.2 percent came from outside, a breakdown that has remained relatively constant, said Chuck Wexler, the forum's executive director.
In either case, police chief is no longer the job it once was, simply marshaling forces to respond to one 911 call after another. Policing has changed dramatically recently, from reacting to crime to preventing it through community policing.
For the chief, that means developing programs that involve the department with citizens and community groups to help identify problems, devise solutions tailored to the neighborhood and evaluate results.
Even smaller communities now demand that their chief be well-schooled in community policing. "That was a big thing to us," said Kurt Kimball, city manager of Grand Rapids, Mich., who led a search that ended last month with the hiring of Harry Dolan, the police chief of Lumberton, N.C.
"The more he talked the talk, the more we realized he had walked the walk, albeit in a town one-10th the size of ours," Mr. Kimball said of Mr. Dolan.
Grand Rapids agreed to pay Mr. Dolan an annual salary of $80,000, a 53 percent increase over the $52,000 he was paid in Lumberton.
The higher salaries for chiefs also reflect a wider range of responsibilities. In addition to implementing new policing ideas, many chiefs, particularly those hired to lead departments in mid-size and large cities, are involved more than ever with managerial issues, like budgets, union contracts, grievances, arbitration hearings and computer technology.
"It's a much different emphasis from years ago," said Dan Rosenblatt, executive director of the International Association of Police Chiefs in Washington, noting the shift from the image of chief as crime fighter. "These people are now like C.E.O.'s of major corporations."
With the expanding demands on a chief's time, many highly recruited candidates are far more educated than their predecessors of decades ago. Lee Brown, the Mayor of Houston who was New York City's police commissioner from 1990 to 1992 and Houston's police chief before that, said the first chief he worked under, in San Jose, had only a high school education. Houston's current chief, Clarence O. Bradford, has a law degree from the University of Houston.
The survey conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum found that more than half the chiefs who responded had a master's, doctoral or law degree.
"We always hear the same thing," said Mr. Wexler, the forum's executive director. "Cities want a strong leader, who is a visionary, a good manager, one with impeccable integrity and character and someone willing to move the department ahead. The competition to find them is fierce, and cities that have one want to hold on to him."
But just as the occasional free agent bats only .200 for his new team, some heavily recruited chiefs fail at their mission or do not survive the politics of the city. In New York, Mr. Bratton resigned in 1996 after crime had dropped significantly on his watch but amid tense relations with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani over who was responsible for it.
Some Bratton supporters have said the reason for the tension was the former commissioner's popularity, which rivaled that of his boss.
Mr. Williams, who built a strong reputation as Philadelphia's police chief before he was hired in Los Angeles to soothe the civic wounds of the Rodney King beating, was dismissed last year after his five-year contract expired.
The city's police commissioner acknowledged Mr. Williams's "ability to communicate with and reassure the community" but said he had been "unable or unwilling to consistently translate his words into action."
Mr. Frazier, the Baltimore police commissioner, said: "For the city that needs a new chief, there's a huge risk. A police chief is probably the most important appointment a mayor or city manager could make. When there's an opening, 100 people come in and say they can do it, but only five really can. It's like turning around a big ship. You want to turn it as fast as you can but you can't tip it over. That's an art, not a science."

HEADLINE: A Crowd on the Campaign Trail;
159 Days to Senate Primary, 3 Democratic Rivals Hit Hustings

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
With the expanse of Morningside Park at her back, Geraldine A. Ferraro yesterday offered her view of the state of New York's economy -- troubled -- along with some ideas on how to cure it. Ms. Ferraro had barely gathered her papers before Mark Green rose in another corner of Harlem to offer his "Agenda for Children in the 21st Century." By then, the third candidate for the Senate, Charles E. Schumer, had finished outlining his property tax cut plan at a news conference on Long Island.
There may be just 159 days before Primary Day, but the three Democrats seeking their party's nomination to challenge Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato took to the hustings yesterday as if it were the day after Labor Day. In the course of three hours, the Democrats unveiled, among them, 30 pages thick with policy proposals, including hiring more teachers to reduce class size and forcing the members of NATO to pay their fair share of the alliance dues. 
 This vigorous display of politicking -- reporters arriving at Ms. Ferraro's speech at Columbia University were met by a Schumer aide handing out copies of the speech that the Brooklyn Representative was giving in Mineola, L.I. -- is unusual this early: phone and E-mail systems are still being installed at the three campaign headquarters. But the confluence of events -- major policy speeches by both Mr. Green and Ms. Ferraro, along with a substantial proposal by Mr. Schumer, directed at suburban voters -- suggests just how intensely this contest will be fought.
In the course of the day, the three candidates clearly looked for ways to distinguish themselves without resorting to the intraparty attacks that proved so damaging to the party in 1992. And although there were many similarities in what the candidates offered to voters in different parts of the state -- all three Democrats are clearly in favor of spending more money -- there were differences as well, which suggested the way the campaign will develop in the months ahead.
Even so, Ms. Ferraro and Mr. Green invoked the same solution in suggesting how to pay for their programs: cutting defense, a proposal that might have particular resonance among the historically liberal Democratic primary electorate.
"We are now spending money we don't have on weapons that don't always work, against enemies that no longer exist," Mr. Green said, speaking at Bank Street College of Education in Harlem. "The enemy of ignorance is a far greater threat to our families and children than any foreign enemy today."
Ms. Ferraro, speaking at a Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce luncheon at Columbia University, offered a similar observation: "The cold war is over," she said. "In a post-cold-war world, we can afford to cut more from the $265 billion we now spend on defense."
This was Ms. Ferraro's first major policy address, and in it, she tried to finesse what has been a difficult task for all recent Democratic challengers: asserting that the economy is not as good as it appears, though not blaming President Clinton for any possible shortcomings.
"The headlines suggest that things have never been better, and in some ways that's true," she said. In truth, she added, wealthy New Yorkers are doing well at the expense of middle class and poor ones.
"It's great to see what's happening on Wall Street," she said. "But it's only fair to ask: When is it going to make it to 125th Street?"
Ms. Ferraro called for lower class size by hiring more teachers, improving teacher training, increasing the use of tax incentives to encourage business development, and forging some portion of student loans for people who become public school teachers. She did not offer an estimate on the cost of her ideas, other than to promise that it would be relatively small.
Mr. Green, who is New York City's Public Advocate, called for universal health care for children, expanded child care programs and hiring more teachers to reduce class size.
"Sixty years ago, this country rightly decided to create a safety net for the elderly who were in trouble," he said. "If we created a system of Social Security to help the neglected elderly 60 years ago, now we have to create a system of social security for our neglected children in the 1990's."
Mr. Green said his "Social Security system for kids," as he termed it, would cost $67.4 billion over five years.
Mr. Schumer offered a single proposal, rather than broad thematic speeches: He said he would introduce legislation in Congress that would mandate that a portion of New York State's share of any tobacco settlement go to reducing property taxes and, in New York City, cutting the state utility tax.
Mr. Schumer said the measure was intended to redress the fact that New York requires local governments to pay half the cost of Medicaid. Reducing property taxes, he said, would effectively reimburse property owners for Medicaid costs incurred because of tobacco-related disabilities.
As it happens, such a proposal would be of particular benefit to suburban counties, where Mr. Schumer is not particularly well known and must do well in order to defeat Mr. D'Amato. Mr. Schumer offered his proposal in Nassau County, and said that one-third of the $2.7 billion tax cut would go to Long Island homeowners, were it to be passed.
One explanation for this unusually early exercise in campaigning is the belief among many Democrats that Mr. D'Amato is vulnerable this year. He is seeking a fourth term, and early polls suggest that New Yorkers are growing weary of the junior senator.
In addition, all three candidates have -- for as much as a decade -- aspired to Mr. D'Amato's position and have given much thought about how to attain it.
The candidates are clearly intent on stoking interest in the race and keeping it going. Mr. Schumer's money, Ms. Ferraro's celebrity and Mr. D'Amato's perceived weakness may suggest that they may have some success in keeping the pace going as briskly as was evidenced yesterday.
Still, the occurrence of the three campaigns competing for attention seemed not an entirely welcome event yesterday, and a few campaign officials seemed irritated at the suggestions that some of the candidates might be looking to steal attention from a rival.
"I told you for a week that we were doing this, right?" said Josh Isay, who is Mr. Schumer's campaign manager.
"This was on Mark's schedule for at least four weeks," said Joe DePlasco, Mr. Green's spokesman.
Ms. Ferraro's campaign manager, David Eichenbaum, in a reference to her high standings in the polls and attention paid to her campaign, just laughed at the question. He said, "Why would we do that?"

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Play Ball! Now Where Are All the Teams?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn.

 BODY:
Signs in store windows here say that people in this economically troubled old city are "Hooked on the Bluefish," a new minor league baseball franchise. Bluefish hats and T-shirts -- the logo features a tough-looking fish with a bat -- are for sale downtown. A new $15 million stadium, paid for by the city and the state, is under construction on Main Street, which has been rerouted to make the ball park an urban centerpiece.
One little problem, though: The Bluefish do not exist -- nor do the five other teams they are supposed to play against when the season starts on May 21. 
 "A baseball park for a team that is yet to be defined, with a league that is yet to be established -- in some respects, your neck is out to here a little bit on it," said Bridgeport's Mayor, Joseph P. Ganim.
Ganim's neck is not the only one. The Atlantic League, an upstart independent professional association outside Major League Baseball's traditional farm system, has persuaded five of the six cities on its roster to build new 5,000- to 6,000-seat ball parks almost entirely at public expense. A total of $110 million in public financing has been committed altogether -- for teams that, with only weeks to go before opening day, still exist for the most part on paper.
Atlantic City is building a $14 million stadium for its proto-team, the Surf, using redevelopment money from its gambling casinos. Newark has authorized $22 million to build a downtown park for the Newark Bears, who will play in Bridgeport for their first season and do not even have an office yet in Newark. The other franchises are Somerset, N.J., which will play entirely on the road this season; Lehigh Valley, from Pennsylvania, which will play for a year in Newburgh, N.Y.; and Nashua, N.H.
The new league's birth, along with its high stakes -- unheard of in the world of independent franchises, where shoestring budgets, old parks and bankruptcies are more the rule -- has created in its initial cities or locales an interlocking system of hopes, fears and ambitions. Baseball experts say that in a market where there is so much major and minor league baseball already, the Atlantic League's ambitions are testing the limit of baseball both as a recreational drawing card and a spur for economic revitalization.
Within the new league, there are also many different agendas and goals. Everybody's got an angle.
Poor cities like Bridgeport, surrounded by rich suburbs, are hoping for economic development.
Club officials and owners say a period of upheaval and experimentation has begun in the minor leagues as major league owners try to cut costs. The Atlantic League is hoping that the major league clubs will find it a convenient and cost-efficient place to send some of their players under contracts for training and development.
The handful of players signed so far are, for the most part, older veterans of the minor and major leagues, looking either for a comeback or a way to prolong their life in baseball. They are hoping to get noticed, and they are being told by club managers and league officials that major league scouts will certainly be watching them.
Fans are just hoping for some baseball.
"Minor league baseball is great -- it's a cheap date, you bring the kids, people don't get drunk or use foul language," said John Holland, a psychiatric social worker who works in Bridgeport for the Connecticut Department of Mental Health. "It's a nice thing, and not a lot of nice things happen in this town."
So is this a tale of exploited hopes and troubled cities grasping at straws, a practical calculation about how to really make minor league baseball work, or something in between? The new league's chairman, Frank Boulton, a former Wall Street bond trader from Long Island, admitted that it was no coincidence most of the franchises in his league were in cities that had faced hard times and were looking, perhaps even in some desperation, for just the kind of thing he came to sell.
Boulton said his primary vision was that clean new ball parks -- especially the intimate downtown parks that have been hugely successful in places like Baltimore and Cleveland -- are increasingly the key to success in baseball. He said he sought out cities that could not get an affiliated farm team from the National Association of Baseball Leagues because of their location -- too close to a major league club, which could veto any expansion into its territory. Finally, he looked for cities that had access to public money for economic development and stadium construction.
"It was easier to get money to build something in Bridgeport, and it's easier going into a Newark," he said.
He also enlisted some famous names: Bud Harrelson, the former Mets shortstop, is the league's president. Rick Cerone, the former Yankees catcher, is president of the Newark Bears. And Sparky Lyle, the former Yankees pitcher, is field manager of the Somerset Patriots. The Atlantic League is full of major league baseball experience -- and names that could open doors in star-struck city halls.
"I think it was brilliant on Frank's part to go to these places and say, 'Look, territorially you can't have a National Association team, and based on people's perceptions you can't do very much right -- build us a stadium and we'll bring you baseball,' " said Charles J. Dowd Jr., the general manager and part owner of the Bluefish. "And it's worked -- people committed to those stadiums because they wanted some glimmer of hope."
Minor league clubs that are affiliated with major league teams often do well financially. Three of them now play within a few hours' drive of Manhattan: The Trenton Thunder, an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox; the New Jersey Cardinals in Augusta (St. Louis Cardinals), and the Hudson Valley Renegades in Fishkill, N.Y. (Tampa Bay Devils Rays). Independent minor league baseball -- in which the teams have no support from a major league big brother to pay for player salaries and development -- is much different. As a rule, it has lived on hope and little else.
As recently as 1995, for example, there were 11 independent leagues around the nation. This season, including the new Atlantic League, there are seven, said Miles Wolff, the president of the five-year-old Northern League and of Baseball America, a publication that covers the major and minor leagues. One league lasted 10 games, Wolff said. Another went two weeks, until its first payroll came due. One neglected to pay the electric bill and had the lights turned off by the city during a night game.
In the Atlantic League, the pockets are considerably deeper. The mostly local owners -- in Bridgeport's case, the founder of a health maintenance organization and the former chief executive of the local water company and his wife -- will have spent more than $2.6 million by the time the first season starts, including the purchase of the franchise from Boulton, a one-time fee that people close to the league say runs about $500,000.
The Newark Bears will play in Bridgeport this season on dates that the Bluefish do not, while the Newark park is being built. Lehigh Valley will play in an old park in Newburgh. The sixth team, the Nashua Pride, will play in a renovated stadium.
But there are still, in the weeks left before the 70-game season starts, a dizzying assortment of things that will have to come together. The teams are to be formed at a league-wide draft early next month in Florida, and city officials in Bridgeport and Atlantic City say their ball parks will not be completed until probably the week before the season opens, assuming the weather holds.
And while the team and league officials predict that the level of play will be roughly equivalent to perhaps a Class AA minor league level, no one is really sure what to expect. And some people think the very independence of the league -- outside the traditional farm team system, with its rosters of young hotshots dreaming of the big leagues -- will create and convey a different kind of emotion as well.
"I don't mean this in a negative way, but there's a certain wistful quality to this enterprise," said Louis Toscano, a senior policy adviser to Mayor James Whelan in Atlantic City. "It sort of gets you back to baseball's roots, the way it began 150 years ago or whatever."
Players like Al Sontag, a pitcher signed by the Bluefish in March, are humble -- a startling thing in itself in professional sports. At 34, after 14 years in minor leagues, he said he had come to terms with the fact that he almost certainly would not make it to the majors. He hopes to use the Atlantic League as a springboard to playing perhaps in Japan for a final year or two.
"This is probably my last stop," he said. "Guys I've run into over the years always say, 'Whatever happened to you? How come you're not in the big leagues? How come you're not up here with us?' And it's frustrating sometimes, but what are you going to do -- sit back and cry? You just keep plugging away, you keep going on and you hope something good happens."
But you also do not look back. Sontag pitched last year in an independent league, for a team in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. That league quietly folded this spring.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE PROPOSE A $75 BILLION PLAN TO SPUR ECONOMY

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, April 10

 BODY:
Under pressure from foreign leaders, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Thursday proposed Japan's largest package yet of tax cuts and new spending in an effort to reverse an economic decline that could have ripple effects on other economies around the world.
But the financial markets were not impressed. Even as Mr. Hashimoto was promising to bring about a recovery, the yen slid sharply on Thursday and the Japanese central bank had to intervene in the currency market to stabilize its value. The yen recovered today, but the stock market was down about 1.2 percent late this afternoon. 
 The economic package described by the Prime Minister is large, worth about $75 billion in new fiscal stimulants, or about 2 percent of the total annual economic output, roughly what the United States has urged for the last month. The markets' negative response, however, may have been set off by Mr. Hashimoto's vagueness about how, when and where the money will be spent.
Japan has faced growing criticism from President Clinton and other political leaders about its once-mighty economy, which has been stalled for much of the last seven years. The nation now faces rising bankruptcies, more unemployment and falling export prices. On Wednesday, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group of 29 industrial nations, warned that the Japanese economy was on the "edge of recession" and could stagnate for years.
The risk to Japan's trading partners in Asia and to the United States is that this country might try to rescue itself by vastly increasing its exports and reducing imports. That would come at the worst time for the troubled economies of Asia that depend on Japan as a major source of investment and a market for goods. It would also anger the United States, which has pushed Japan to absorb more foreign goods and get consumers to spend more and save less.
Mr. Hashimoto acknowledged in a grim speech carried live on television that the economy was in a "severe situation."
But some private economists worried that the new proposals, while helpful, might not be sufficient to keep the Japanese economy from sliding further. "It's not enough," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. "The risk of a deflationary spiral remains."
The main significance of Mr. Hashimoto's action Thursday was perhaps that he took it at all. He had been reluctant to cut taxes because he vowed to pursue austerity to contain a growing budget deficit. While American officials have been urging that he abandon that policy for the moment, Thursday was the first time he publicly suggested he was making the break.
The yen, a sensitive barometer of Japan's economic might, tumbled 1 percent just as the Prime Minister was speaking and languished until Japan purchased yen with dollars to increase the currency's value.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Robert E. Rubin, issued a statement expressing concern about recent weakness in the yen. "In that context we welcome the action undertaken by Japanese authorities in the exchange market to support the value of the yen," Mr. Rubin said.
In afternoon trading here, the yen strengthened to 130.05 to the dollar, compared with 131.19 in New York late Thursday.
The intervention in the currency market appears to have exceeded $1 billion worth of yen purchases, market participants said. Japan's central bank said it sold dollars and bought yen through its accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The Clinton Administration, as such, did not join in the defense of the yen, which it could have done by spending some of the money in a special Treasury fund used to intervene in the currency markets. Senior Treasury officials insisted that American foreign exchange policy had not changed. Despite Mr. Rubin's concern repeated Thursday that the yen is weak, they said he was not backing away from support of a strong dollar.
In addition to the $75 billion program, Japan is making funds available for loans and land purchases, which do not directly contribute to economic output, as part of an overall package of $121 billion of stimulants. Economists agreed that the measures would give some kick to the economy and constituted a step in the right direction.
Thomas S. Foley, the United States Ambassador and former House Speaker, told an audience on Thursday night that the new measures constituted "bold action."
American officials have repeatedly called upon Japan to cut taxes as a way of stimulating broad-based domestic demand. In an effort to get the Japanese people to spend, Mr. Hashimoto said he would put the equivalent of $30 billion into their pockets through tax cuts in equal amounts this year and next -- equivalent to roughly $370 a year for the average household. Some of Mr. Hashimoto's critics had sought more.
Naoto Kan, chairman of the Democratic Party, the largest opposition party, a day earlier had called for $45 billion worth of tax cuts.
In December, the Prime Minister announced a $15 billion tax cut, and part of that has been carried out, though so far with negligible effects.
This proposed tax cut would be a little bit less than the American net tax cut in last year's balanced-budget agreement, which amounted to an average of $20 billion a year over five years in an economy almost 40 percent larger than Japan's.
Part of the problem, though, is that Japan is a nation of savers. So when people receive a tax cut, they may not spend the money.
The last few months of financial and economic uncertainty have only made the Japanese more focused on saving. The savings rate for 1997 jumped as much as three percentage points, according to Tetsufumi Yamakawa, chief economist for Goldman, Sachs here.
"That's never, ever happened in Japan," he said. "So I really do not think that this income-tax cut is going to have a major impact."
In a sign of the enthusiasm for saving, one of the hottest items these days is a home safe, viewed by many as preferable to depositing money in weak banks offering interest rates of perhaps two-tenths of 1 percent.
With ordinary Japanese unlikely to spend all the proceeds of their tax break, many economists are focusing on the direct Government spending in the economic package -- and they do expect that will give a lift to the economy. Mr. Hashimoto said on Thursday that the Government would spend an extra $45 billion, or 1.2 percent of economic output, on public works projects.
But the Prime Minister gave few details, and critics have warned that past public works projects have already equipped Japan with far more remote bridges and dams than the country needs. Perhaps because of such complaints, he suggested that there would be substantial spending in different areas like environmental protection, nursing, care for the aged, science and technology, and fiber optic cables for public schools..
In any case, because of the multiplier effect as the money trickles through the economy, such Government spending could ultimately mean a payback to the economy of as much as 1.5 times the amount pumped in by the Government.
While some economists are more pessimistic, others say that the spending and tax-cut package could reverse the downturn.
Mr. Yamakawa of Goldman, Sachs, for instance, said that because of the package, economic growth in Japan could reach nine-tenths of 1 percent in the current fiscal year.
But economists say long-term recovery is elusive without deregulation and tax reform.
Mr. Hashimoto said on Thursday that the Government would try to lower the corporate tax rate to restore business vitality, hoping to match the rates of other countries in the next three years. More broadly, he called for a profound revision of the nation's tax structure, which currently imposes a top rate of 65 percent on the rich and a 50 percent income tax on corporations.
In an address that seemed to appeal as much to the United States as to his own compatriots, Mr. Hashimoto suggested that he might shift his position on fiscal austerity, which would require amending a law passed last fall to shrink budget deficits. But he was vague on this point, too, and instead emphasized the health of the economy, suggesting that there might not be a sense among top leaders that the economy was indeed in a crisis.
"I would like to stress that Japan's economy is one of the most powerful economies in the world," he said. "There are some people who insist that the Japanese economy has already lost its power to grow. I do not stand for such pessimism."
The nation's economy shrank slightly in the last quarter of 1997, and economists say they expect it to contract again in the first three months of this year, putting the country technically in a recession.
But more worrisome to economists has been the dip in prices, real wages and corporate profits.
"The spiral's gathering momentum; it's beginning," said Russell Jones, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Japan. A buoyant recovery, he added, seems far away.

Gateway to Open Office in Manhattan

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Gateway 2000, the mail-order personal computer company in North Sioux City, S.D., announced yesterday that it would open its new Web development headquarters in Manhattan.
The office will open within the next few months, and company officials will be scouting locations for the headquarters next week, said Paul G. Roston, Gateway's vice president for global human resources. 
 About 40 jobs will move to New York with the opening of the office. All except for two senior-level managerial positions will be new hires.
Mr. Roston said the company -- known for packaging its computers in boxes that are spotted black and white, like cows -- needed to expand its Internet capabilities. It currently uses its own staff and consultants in South Dakota to run its Web site. Gateway sells about $3 million worth of computers each day from the site.
"We wanted the best talent, and we believe that the bulk of that talent is in San Francisco and New York City, and the best is in New York," Mr. Roston said. "We wanted to attract them without pulling them out of the life style and environment that they are in."
Gateway 2000, a Fortune 500 company, has manufacturing plants in the United States, Ireland and Malaysia and employs more than 13,000 people worldwide.
Russell A. Harding, executive vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said, "Gateway's decision to open its Web development headquarters here once again shows that New York City, under Mayor Giuliani, has become the global leader of Internet content and technology."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, April 5) tries to resurrect class conflict in a prosperous era, pretending to understand the resentment of those in the back of the plane. Most people are pleased to have low unemployment and well-paying jobs. I don't think limousine drivers pine for the factory floor. Most people prefer the convenience of automated teller machines. I think airplane passengers appreciate the opportunity to fly inexpensively, even if the legroom is tight and the cheap fare is subsidized by the business travelers up front. Mr. Reich should stop the forced efforts at appearing compassionate. More affluence and increasing levels of service are good.

HEADLINE: Addiction Can Be a Disease and a Behavior;
Tempting the Alcoholic

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Don't Forget the Addict's Role in Addiction" (Op-Ed, April 4), Sally L. Satel notes that researchers have found a link between the amount of alcohol consumed by alcoholics and the cost of it and the effort required to obtain it. She concludes that "alcoholics respond to rewards and consequences, not just to physiology."
The next questions should be: Why is fortified alcohol so inexpensive, and whose economic interests are being served by the low price? 
 What are the conditions in society that might lead someone to use alcohol to numb his pain?

HEADLINE: A Star Inspires Young Singers

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
The Young People's Chorus of New York, an acclaimed performance-based choral program that draws some 150 children aged 8 to 18 from all areas, economic groups and ethnic cultures of the city, has sung for some illustrious guests, including the pop singer Celine Dion, the composer Marvin Hamlisch and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
But the chorus's artistic director, Francisco J. Nunez, said few guest listeners had inspired the choristers as much as the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves, who heard an informal performance by the Concert Choir, the 40 members in the senior division (aged 14 to 18), on Wednesday night in the low-ceilinged, concrete-walled recital room at Maximiliaan's House of Grand pianos on Lexington Avenue. 
 The performance space was bare, but the excitement over Ms. Graves's visit was palpable. The radiant Metropolitan Opera star "really connected with our singers," 32-year-old Mr. Nunez said. Many of them are afraid of the musical world, which can seem rarefied and out of reach, he said. But Ms. Graves, who grew up poor in a tough neighborhood in southwest Washington, is clearly a role model to the young choristers, many of whom also come from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Ms. Graves knows the value of choral groups. During her childhood, it was singing in her Baptist church choir that got her excited about music. On Wednesday night, as the Young People's Chorus sang selections, including a Czech folk song, a selection from Bernstein's Mass and a gospel-inflected piece, "Heaven Bound Train," by the Canadian composer Stephen Hatfield, Ms. Graves sat front-row center, listening intently, swaying to the music and clearly moved.
When Mr. Nunez turned to her for comments, she said little. "I just wanted to be here and see the gifts you have to offer," she said. "You are clearly an exceptional group of singers. Everybody was jazzed and really excited. I really have little to say except, sing some more."
The next selection, however, did provoke some detailed coaching from Ms. Graves. Adrienne Nyamsi, a 16-year-old chorister, sang a solo, the wistful signature song of Billie Holiday, "God Bless the Child," with Mr. Nunez at the piano.
Ms. Nyamsi's performance was lovely but tentative, and Ms. Graves clearly identified with the shy, polite adolescent. "Your voice is gorgeous," Ms. Graves told her. "But I know it can be better. Now what does the song mean to you? Those first lines: 'Them that's got shall get, them that's not will lose.' What does it say to you?"
"Well," Ms. Nyamsi answered, "it seems to be saying that the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the Bible tells us it has always been this way and always will be." So, she added, "God bless the child that's got his own." Then she looked expectantly at Ms. Graves.
"There is no right or wrong answer," Ms. Graves said. "There is only what you believe. But look how much more animated your body became when you explained the song to me in words. You must have a reason to make this music happen." Then, she said, to much laughter, "Do you understand where I'm going, or do I just sound like a crazy lady?" When Ms. Nyamsi tried the song again, her singing was noticeably more open and personal.
Mr. Nunez founded the chorus in 1990 under the auspices of the Children's Aid Society of New York. But he wanted the group to reach the outer boroughs, and to "shoot more toward high standards of artistry," he said, "and the kids agreed." So the ensemble became independent. It is now in residence at the 92d Street Y, which provides rehearsal and office space. Its annual budget is over $200,000, and fund-raising is a constant concern.
The chorus performs some 40 concerts a year. Scheduled events include an appearance on April 30 at St. Bartholomew's Church and a "Voices of the World" concert on May 20 at the 92d Street Y.
On Wednesday, after some more music-making, the choristers chatted with Ms. Graves about her own life over cookies and punch. Ms. Nyamsi summed up the mood of everyone when she said: "This whole thing, this whole thing. Wow!"

HEADLINE: How the Antitrust Wars Wax and Wane

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Is the price of airline seats a product of the free market or the result of underhanded business tactics?
This week, when the Clinton Administration accused the major airlines of acting like predators and squeezing their smaller competitors out of business, it entered a century-old intellectual debate on antitrust law and the free market. How these ideas play out could end up influencing how much Americans pay for everything from airline tickets to computer software, from beer to cellophane tape. 
 On one side is the so-called Chicago school, scholars like Robert Bork and Richard Posner who argue that predatory pricing rarely if ever exists and that in the long run, the market will adjust and let in competition. On the other is a group of young lawyers and economists referred to -- not surprisingly -- as the post-Chicago school, who have challenged their predecessors and are providing the intellectual muscle for the Clinton Administration's antitrust assault.
Using game theory and other new approaches to economic analysis, they argue that successful predatory pricing strategies are not as rare and irrational as the Chicago school thought, especially when they are combined with a variety of exclusive deals and other tactics that don't involve price.
Ever since the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890, rigorous enforcement has ebbed and flowed, an indication of both the ill-defined nature of antitrust law and the ambivalent feelings judges, politicians and the public have had toward big business over the years.
But few Americans would question the existence of predatory pricing. The image of the rapacious monopolist who ruined his competitors or weakened and then swallowed them by using his deep pockets to cut prices below cost has been deeply ingrained in the public mind since the Gilded Age.
The man who helped establish the stereotype was John D. Rockefeller. His Standard Oil Company allegedly employed a grab bag of nefarious practices, including predatory pricing, frivolous lawsuits and bribery, to take over more than 100 companies and amass control over 85 percent of the country's oil refining capacity. The company was broken up in 1911 in one of the first high-profile antitrust cases.
But predatory pricing, much like Justice Potter Stewart's famous observation about pornography, is a lot easier to decry than to define. When the Supreme Court held that Standard Oil had indeed violated the Sherman Act, it neglected to say exactly how. Decades later, John S. McGee, an economist at the University of Chicago, went back and carefully reviewed the case. His landmark article in 1958 concluded that there was no evidence that Standard Oil used predatory pricing to gain its monopoly.
The study had enormous impact on what became the Chicago school, which applied neo-classical economic theory to antitrust cases. What the scholars concluded was that predatory pricing was extremely rare because after driving a competitor out of business and then raising prices, the would-be monopolist would simply attract new competitors into the market. These new theories attacked the conventional wisdom that reigned from the 1930's through the 1960's, often referred to as the Harvard school, that predatory pricing was a common and rational practice.
"The courts had terrible views of economics," says Robert H. Bork, the former Solicitor General and Federal Appeals Court judge, who is a leading exponent of the Chicago school. "It was folk economics. They sort of took antitrust at face value and never took into account the doctrines that were in play, many of which were wrong."
Mr. Bork's 1978 book, "The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War With Itself," is considered one of the most eloquent expressions of the Chicago school approach. In it, he wrote, "Unsophisticated theories of predation abound, leading to drastic overestimations of its likelihood."
Since the goal of antitrust law is to protect consumers against unfairly high prices, the courts have long held that anyone claiming to be the victim of predatory pricing must not only prove that the alleged predator is charging prices below cost, he must also prove that the predator can make back the money lost as well as additional profits.
 
The Chicago School Wins One Round
In the view of the Chicago school, this rarely if ever happens. Instead of protecting competition, the Chicago scholars concluded, the courts were depriving consumers of the benefits of lower prices.
"The confusion between a price cut and a predatory cut led to a lot of bad results," Mr. Bork said.
The Supreme Court has agreed. In a 1993 decision successfully argued by Mr. Bork, the court confirmed that a jury was mistaken when it found the cigarette maker Brown & Williamson guilty of predatory pricing and awarded rival Liggett $148.8 million in damages. Even if Brown & Williamson sold below cost, the court held, Liggett couldn't prove that Brown & Williamson would have been able to recoup on that investment.
The Bush and Reagan Administrations were also influenced by the Chicago school and rarely invoked the antitrust laws.
In the most recent swing of the pendulum, the Clinton Administration has stepped up antitrust enforcement. Post-Chicago thinking forms the intellectual foundation behind its decisions to block several mergers as well as some of its most controversial investigations, including that of the Microsoft Corporation. Many of the shapers of post-Chicago thought have held or currently hold key positions at both the Justice Department's antitrust division and the Federal Trade Commission, which share Federal antitrust enforcement. Others, such as Joel I. Klein, the head of the antitrust division, have heartily embraced post-Chicago thinking.
"We regard a predatory strategy as a real possibility," said Robert Pitofsky, the F.T.C. chairman, who describes himself as a member of the post-Chicago camp.
The post-Chicago approach does not reject the Chicago school in the same way Chicago thinkers like Mr. Bork and Mr. Posner attacked the Harvard school. Indeed, some post-Chicago scholars even cite Mr. Bork for inspiring some of their theories. Like their predecessors, the post-Chicago thinkers are firm believers in market forces, but they say the market doesn't always come to the rescue and therefore government intervention may be needed.
"As the economic models have advanced, we have gotten a better understanding of strategic behavior, and that reopens the question of predation," said Steven Salop, a professor of economics and law at the Georgetown University Law Center who has written several articles credited with advancing post-Chicago thought.
In the case of the airlines, for example, the Clinton Administration has said that the major carriers not only cut their prices when they were challenged by small competitors charging lower prices on certain routes; they also wooed away most of the passengers by flooding the routes with cheap flights leaving at more convenient times. When the smaller competitor gives up, the major airline cuts service and raises prices again.
Mr. Bork and the Chicago school argue that this strategy makes no sense because planes can quickly be redeployed into the market once prices rise. Therefore, the major airline could never recover the money it lost by lowering its prices.
But the post-Chicago school counters that the ability of the major airlines to drive out one or two challengers on a few routes has the added value of scaring off new challengers who would expect to get the same treatment. This demonstration effect makes the likelihood of recouping the major carrier's original investment a lot higher. It was cited in a speech last year by Roger W. Fones, the prosecutor leading the Justice Department's antitrust investigation of the airlines.
"There are things that are rational in a game theory model that look irrational from a straightforward neoclassical view," said Garth Saloner, Magowan professor of economics and strategic management at Stanford University's business school and a leading member of the post-Chicago camp.
The post-Chicago school has also examined the predatory nature of a host of exclusive deals in which dominant companies use their power not simply to cut their prices but to raise the cost of doing business for their smaller rivals. For example, the F.T.C. is investigating charges that spice maker McCormick & Company may have gone too far in its efforts to pay supermarkets to give its products prominent shelf space. The Justice Department is investigating Anheuser-Busch for signing exclusive agreements with beer distributors and paying them extra fees if they don't distribute rival brands.
Another theory involves a company using its dominance of one market to force its way into another. That is what the Justice Department claims Microsoft was doing when it forced computer makers who wanted to buy its Windows operating system to load its Web browsing software also. And it is also related to charges that 3M forces distributors eager to get its popular self-stick notes to also buy its less popular cellophane tape.
 
Post-Chicago Group Foresees a Lag
Whether the post-Chicago theories end up having influence as far-reaching as the Chicago school's will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. The record so far has been mixed. The court appeared to subscribe to some post-Chicago theories in a 1992 decision involving the Eastman Kodak Company, but the next year it gave a ringing endorsement of the Chicago approach in the Brown & Williamson case. In addition, at least two of the nine justices, Stephen G. Breyer and Antonin Scalia, are known as strong followers of the Chicago school.
But the post-Chicagoans are optimistic that their time may be coming. "The P word is still a dirty word in some antitrust circles," Mr. Saloner said, speaking of predation. "But there is always a lag between the theory and the legal system."

HEADLINE: Photography Sales Set Records at Four Houses

BYLINE: By MARGARETT LOKE 

 BODY:
Manhattan's annual spring week of major photography auctions has concluded with record sales at every participating house and record prices for work by several artists.
Each of the four houses included seldom-seen, pristine vintage prints from major photographers, and collectors said they were impressed by the unusual offerings and buoyed by the strong economy. 
 Swann Galleries, which is better known for its antiquarian book sales, set a world auction record on Monday for a work by Imogene Cunningham when the photographer's transcendent "Magnolia Blossom" sold for $211,500 (the price includes a 15 percent buyer's premium). Around 1929, the print was bought from the artist for $5, about $236 in today's dollars.
At Phillips's single-owner sale of photographs taken in Paris during the 1920's and 30's, an arresting Constructivist photograph by Lee Miller sold on Monday for $145,500, a record for the artist. Phillips has re-entered the photography market in New York after an absence of about a decade.
On Tuesday at Sotheby's, a rare Edward Weston 1924 print showing the abstract lines of the inside of a circus tent sold for $266,500, also a record for the artist. On Wednesday, Christie's set auction records for a photograph by the painter Thomas Eakins ($178,500) and for Pierre Dubreuil ($134,500) and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy ($123,500). With a final tally of nearly $4.6 million, Christie's also set a world record for a photographic auction. Total sales were at all-time highs for the other auction houses, and the aggregate sales for all four houses totaled about $10.25 million.
With many photographs selling at almost giddily high prices, it would seem that two recent scandals roiling the photography market were firmly out of sight and out of mind. One was the revelation that scores of vintage Man Rays made available to collectors in the early 1980's and 90's were skillfully doctored recent prints. The other was the revelation that the provenance of the hitherto unknown, fabulous "Helene Anderson collection," offered by unidentified consignors and sold at Sotheby's in London last May, had been misrepresented. The collection was assembled around 1930 for a German industrialist, Kurt Kirchbach. There were also doubts that the Swiss consignors had clear title.
This week at Sotheby's in New York, a 1922 Man Ray album given by Lee Miller to her brother Erik and containing 12 photographs of the artist's rayographs was bought by the Howard Greenberg Gallery in SoHo for a private client. The price: $244,500. The priciest print at the Phillips sale was also a Man Ray: his famous "Solarized Nude" sold for $156,500.
For weeks before the Phillips auction, there were suggestions that its Maurice Verneuil collection of unknown vintage photographs might be from a missing part of the Kirchbach collection. Notified about collectors' concerns by Nancy Lieberman, the photography specialist at Phillips, the hitherto anonymous Swiss consignor, Gaspard de Marval, a school administrator in Lausanne, revealed his identity and produced two documents establishing that Mr. Verneuil had been in touch with certain photographers represented in the collection.
What the Phillips sale had going for it, said Manfred Heiting, who owns one of the world's premier photographic collections, is that its pictures were "fresh, new and different," a pleasant change from the images appearing again and again at the big auction houses.
Photographs are also appealing when times are flush, he said.
Mr. Heiting cited Cunningham's "Magnolia Blossom" at Swann's as a "unique object." It is, he explained, one of the top five Cunningham images. It is in perfect condition, on perfect matte-finish paper, and has an exhibition label on the back indicating it is one of the earliest prints of this 1920's image.
Rarity is "the overwhelming factor" driving buyers, said Rick Wester, head of Christie's photographs department. A panoramic view of San Francisco circa 1851, composed of five half-plate daguerreotypes, sold for $134,500. The middle half-plate was tarnished, Mr. Wester said, but it didn't matter. "The panoramas that have survived are very rare."
But not everything sold or sold well. A Brancusi photograph sold below estimate at Swann's and another Brancusi did not sell at Sotheby's.
For Denise B. Bethel, director of Sotheby's photographs department, the biggest disappointment was not seeing "Banalite" sell. This 1930 volume of Surrealist poetry and prose illustrated with photos by Roger Parry is, she said, "extremely rare." For his part, Mr. Wester could not explain why Weston's portrait of Diego Rivera or two images from the late 1920's by Hiromu Kira did not sell.

HEADLINE: Feminists Nurture a More Tolerant Christianity

BYLINE: By MICHAEL NORMAN; Michael Norman teaches journalism at New York University.

 BODY:
Mother Church, indeed.
This year marks three decades since Christian women, hundreds of thousands of laywomen as well as theologians and clerics, brought modern feminism into chapels, basilicas and cathedrals and challenged the men running them to rethink the basics of religious practice: their interpretations of the Bible, their liturgical language and symbols, their reluctance to let women join them in the pulpit. 
 That challenge, now commonly referred to as "feminist theology," has matured into a powerful movement. Its leaders have been widely published, and its most formative ideas have helped reshape the curriculums at most major seminaries.
And the reforms that churchwomen have been advocating for three decades -- among them, gender-neutral language in prayer books, a more androgynous view of God and Jesus, special liturgies that address women's experiences, like childbirth and abortion -- have, depending on the denomination, become a major part of Church practice.
Now feminist theologians are asking themselves what's next, and their answers often seem to have little to do with faith, belief, salvation and sin.
These days, for example, when asked what's new, the movement's leaders and scholars are quick to use the word "globalization," a kind of catchall phrase that refers to the way someone's sex and social identity influence worship.
M. Shawn Copeland, a professor of theology at Marquette University and a contributor to the "Dictionary of Feminist Theologies" (Westminster John Knox, 1996) writes that feminists in religion are now focusing on a woman's "social location," or the "acknowledgment of the effect of gender, race, cultural-ethnic background and social-class status on theological practice."
Ms. Copeland and others argue that black women, Hispanic women, Asian women and others all see religion through the lens of their own discrete experience. They may agree on the basic foundations of the faith -- God's grace or holy baptism, for example -- but those ideas and rituals take on different meanings as they are invoked by different kinds of people.
Delores Williams, the Paul Tillich Professor of Feminist Theology at Union Theological Seminary in New York, calls herself a "womanist" theologian. (The term "womanist" was coined by the writer Alice Walker to describe "black feminism." )
To Ms. Williams, womanist theology is concerned with the place and practice of religion in the lives of African-American women. If religion, as Ms. Williams maintains, should embrace matters of "race, gender and class," then in the African-American community religion must deal with the ubiquitous "issue of violence," and that includes the "violence in the crucifixion of Jesus."
To Christians, the murder of Jesus represents the first step in salvation, God's deliverance from sin and victory over evil, but to Ms. Williams and her ideological kin, it is also a sobering echo of the frequent murder in the streets and abuse of children, particularly in homes distressed by poverty.
"How do you teach these children that a loving father sent his son to be murdered?" she asks. "How do you teach them that this amounts to love? We do not need theories of atonement that focus on the blood and murder of Jesus."
Ms. Williams does not want to excise the crucifixion from religious practice. She simply wants it reinterpreted. "I want to give it a meaning less consistent with and supportive of the violence that is so endemic to our society," she says. What this means in practice is a shift from emphasizing the cross as the symbol of salvation to emphasizing Jesus's life as the vehicle for Christian deliverance.
"The ministry of Jesus is what brought salvation to humankind," she said. "The cross represents only the results of that."
Women, of course, have been confronting the church for centuries, but in America, women's organized opposition to ecclesiastical leadership and practice dates from the 19th century, when social critics like Elizabeth Cady Stanton began to challenge the status quo with the publication of "The Woman's Bible," in 1895, a text attacking the scriptural suggestion that sin and death were introduced into the world by a woman.
The most recent surge in feminist theology grew out of the social upheaval of the 1960's. A radical Roman Catholic theologian named Mary Daly built on Stanton's work with two books, "The Church and the Second Sex," 1968, and "Beyond God the Father," 1973. Daly soon left the church and seemed to retreat from the fray as well, but her ideas and arguments, and those of two other important writers, Rosemary Radford Ruether and Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza, helped inspire a series of reforms in most major Christian denominations, including Catholicism.
Daly provoked the religious establishment and rallied the feminists in American religion by insisting on a simple subjunctive: "If God is male, then male is God." In other words, gender, as it is represented in religious metaphors, symbols, art and iconography, is critical to a reading of scripture, an understanding of Gospel and the practice of the liturgy. To put it more dramatically, Daly was suggesting that if God is a man, then God is a lie, and the church, the patriarchal church, is philosophically, morally and socially bankrupt.
The effect of all this across the last three decades has reshaped much of the religious landscape in mainstream Protestant religions, and to lesser degrees in the Catholic Church and in liberal synagogues and the worship groups of other religions.
Religious texts, hymnals and prayer books are increasingly gender-neutral or gender-free. More women are in the pulpit than ever before and enrollments at five of the largest divinity schools now approach 22 percent women, according to the Association of Theological Schools. In some denominations, women are moving into leadership posts. The Episcopal Church reports that 20 percent of its bishops, priests and deacons are women. Meanwhile, feminist scriptural scholars say they have uncovered evidence in ancient Gnostic and Coptic texts suggesting that women were, in effect, ordained in the early church, and that the texts include women in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity and suggest an equality between Adam and Eve in the Creation story.
The work of scriptural scholarship continues, as does the effort to make sure the language and structure of the church include women. But now a second generation of feminist theologians have expanded the movement's agenda, in large part by adopting some concerns of liberation theology: economic disparity, the "economic colonialism" of large nations and corporations, and environmental and health concerns, particularly AIDS, birth control and abortion.
"This idea of interpreting the culture in terms of feminist theology is as important as interpreting the Bible," says Letty M. Russell, a professor of theology at the Yale Divinity School. As an example, Ms. Russell cites the biblical example of Ruth's devotion to her mother-in-law, Naomi.
"Reading the story of Ruth and Naomi is quite different in Korea, for instance, where women have problems with mothers-in-law," she says. "To Korean women, therefore, they are not sure it's a liberating text," while "in America a lot of lesbians are interested in Ruth and Naomi because they are so close in terms of their survival."
Thus, feminism and theology have many meanings and many applications. What is more, women in each religion and in each culture have different priorities. Catholic women, for instance, still face the formidable challenge of breaking male hegemony in the priesthood, an issue less important to Methodist women.
In religion, then, feminism has come to be a call for tolerance. "Feminists have helped people become more comfortable with a variety of answers to basic religious questions," said Mary E. Hunt of the Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual in Silver Springs, Md., an organization that works on feminist issues in religion.
"I like to call this getting people involved in the theological chorus," she said.
And yet this concept of "inclusion," as diversity is sometimes called, still does not, for all its inherent democracy, include all points of view, particularly conservative ones. "We still have work to do," says Elizabeth Bounds, associate professor of Christian theology at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta.
Ms. Bounds believes that feminists should engage and think more about "the evangelical and fundamentalist forms of Christianity and their reaffirmation of the more traditional roles of women." She argues that feminist theologians cannot afford to "write off" as fundamentalist backlash those women who talk about "family values."
With so many cultural concerns and social agendas in play, it would seem that feminist theology is less concerned with theology than with feminism, more political than spiritual. But almost everyone, especially the movement's founders, insist that is not the case.
"Feminist theology as theology speaks from within a religious community but not just about a religious community," said Ms. Schussler Fiorenza, the Krister Stendahl Professor of Scripture and Interpretation at Harvard Divinity School and one of most respected voices in the field.
"For me," she says, "it would not be such a sharp distinction between social concerns and religious concerns. If you understand religion as more part and parcel of social life, then the cultural and social issues that feminists raise are always religious issues. Elizabeth Cady Stanton argued that religion, like education and the law, is an area of society, and you either reform all areas of society or you will not be able to reform any of them."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Little Border War Over Mexican-U.S. Phone Traffic

BYLINE: By DEBRA BEACHY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
In the long-distance telephone wars, Maria Trejo is a prime target.
She has called home every week without fail ever since arriving here for a vacation four years ago from Queretaro, Mexico. Mrs. Trejo, facing dire job prospects in Mexico's recession-battered economy, decided to extend her visit to see seven brothers who already lived here. She found a job, and, later, married. 
 For Mrs. Trejo, who works at the counter of a McDonald's, bridging the distance to her parents and the younger brother and sister she left behind is almost as important as eating or sleeping. Every month, Mrs. Trejo said, she spends about $25 on phone calls she makes to Mexico, and to pay for the occasional collect calls her parents make to her.
"I call them to make sure they are all right and let them know I'm O.K.," Mrs. Trejo said.
The calls that Mrs. Trejo makes, multiplied by those placed by millions of other Mexican immigrants, add up to a rich and rapidly growing market. For long-distance telephone companies, her allegiance has become a coveted prize.
The struggle for customers is growing fierce, with the mega-carriers of the United States industry, AT&T and MCI Communications, trying to block the entry of a new competitor, Mexico's telephone company, Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, into the lucrative business here.
By the reckoning of Telmex and AT&T, Hispanic people make $2 billion worth of international phone calls a year to friends and family back home. That adds up to 5 percent of the $40 billion United States residential long-distance market.
According to the Yankee Group of Boston, a market research company, Mexico dwarfed other countries as the favored consumer destination for calls, netting 970 million minutes. Brazil placed second, with 152 million minutes, followed by Colombia, with 143 million minutes.
"It's a lot of money," said Fred Voit, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group. The Hispanic market "is the fastest-growing consumer segment in the United States," he added, "and everyone wants to be the provider of choice."
In the latest legal skirmish, AT&T and MCI are appealing to the Federal Communications Commission to overturn its approval of long-distance service in the United States by a joint venture between Telmex and Sprint. An F.C.C. spokeswoman said it was impossible to say when a ruling would be issued. MCI has also asked the United States trade representative to carry its complaints about Telmex before the World Trade Organization.
As they battle Telmex north of the border, AT&T and MCI are also engaging in a fierce struggle with the company in Mexico. The United States companies say Telmex wants to charge them too much to complete southbound calls from the United States. Last year, the fee was 39.5 cents a minute, the same Telmex paid to complete a much lower volume of northbound calls. Telmex wants the fee lowered gradually to 37.5 cents a minute this year and, by the year 2000, to 19 cents, the benchmark rate set by the F.C.C. AT&T and MCI want Telmex's fees cut to 25 cents a minute in 1998, and 10 cents a minute in 1999.
Telmex, a former government monopoly, was privatized in 1990, and foreign companies were permitted by the Government of Mexico to operate there in 1996. Facing the huge costs of building infrastructure, foreign companies have used Telmex facilities.
Meanwhile, United States long-distance carriers have unleashed direct mail campaigns to Hispanic households, and are becoming frequent advertisers in the Spanish-language newspapers of major cities.
"The Hispanic market is very important for all competitors," said Kevin Leslie, director of consumer marketing for AT&T. The Yankee Group estimates that AT&T holds 62 percent of the Hispanic market; Sprint ranks second, with 9.2 percent, followed by GTE, with 5.6 percent, and MCI, with 4.2 percent.
Telmex cannot offer long-distance service in the United States while legal action is pending, but the company is plotting its marketing strategy in the interim, said the president of Telmex Spring Communications, Luis Lopez Rojo. It is using focus groups to analyze and tailor its marketing to its United States target: Mexican immigrants who have settled in the Southwest.
AT&T is also researching migratory patterns from Mexico for its marketing efforts through collaboration with Greyhound Lines Inc., Mr. Leslie said. That enables AT&T to spot new migration trends, such as new migration to North Carolina and to the Midwest, and to design new calling packages. In addition, AT&T sponsors soccer events in the United States and Mexico, he said.
MCI has formed a joint venture with Telefonica de Espana, Spain's leading phone company, which will sell to Hispanic customers around the world, said an MCI spokesman, Manuel Wernicky. To bolster its presence, MCI also sponsors scholarships for United States Hispanic students, he said.
Mr. Voit of Yankee Group said the marketing efforts by long-distance carriers to Hispanic consumers had focused mainly on brand name recognition rather than price.
That is one reason why competition from Telmex is seen as a threat. It is recognized by virtually everyone from Mexico, he said.
Mrs. Trejo said she was hoping Telmex would win approval to offer service because it might bring down the price of calling home.
"I would try Telmex," she said, "if they gave me a better price."

HEADLINE: Dollar Falls Against Yen as Bank of Japan Acts

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the yen in Asian trading yesterday as the Bank of Japan sold dollars for a second consecutive day to prop up the Japanese currency.
The two-day bout of selling by the central bank, which shaved as much as 6 yen off the dollar's value, began as traders and investors criticized as insufficient the latest tax cut and spending plan from the Japanese Government. 
 "Someone as big and predatory as the Bank of Japan can really move the dollar -- not a problem," said John Nelson, manager of trading at ABN-Amro Bank in Chicago. "They're trying to say they're unhappy with the level of the yen."
After falling as low as 127.50 yen, the dollar was quoted in New York trading at 128.69 yen, down from 131.19 yen late Thursday.
But the drop against the yen was exaggerated by thin trading volume yesterday. Much of the day's activity came during Asian trading hours, with most European financial markets closed in observance of Good Friday. Trading was also very light in the United States, where financial markets were closed, although most banks were open.
It is not difficult to "manipulate price action without any competition" in the market, Mr. Nelson noted.
Japan wants to bolster the yen, which fell to its lowest level in six and a half years last week on concern that the Government was not acting aggressively enough to pull the economy out of a seven-year slump.
The yen's weakness "cannot be justified, given Japan's potential economic strength," Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said on Thursday.
Traders said that Japan's central bank sold several billions of dollars yesterday, after selling more than $1 billion on Thursday.
A Japanese Finance Ministry official declined to comment on the reports of yesterday's selling. The ministry confirmed on Thursday that the central bank had sold dollars, though it declined to say how much.
Against other major currencies, the dollar was little changed yesterday. The dollar traded at 1.8229 marks, up from 1.8224 marks on Thursday. The British pound was quoted at $1.6734, up from $1.6700.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says North Korea Helped Develop New Pakistani Missile

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
Pakistan's test of a new missile with a range exceeding 900 miles, a weapon able to strike Bombay or New Delhi with a nuclear warhead, was based on technology smuggled from North Korea, United States Government officials and private analysts said today.
The new liquid-fueled missile, called the Ghauri, is an enhanced version of the North Korean Rodong missile, which is itself a fancy version of the Scud missile developed in Moscow in the 1960's, they said. 
 "The Pakistani missile is based on North Korean technology," said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control and an analyst of the spread of weapons. "It was a cloak-and-dagger operation by Pakistan, which concealed the transaction." Government officials confirmed that account.
The United States knew before the test, on Monday, that North Korea had smuggled the missile technology into Pakistan, the officials said. Washington tried to persuade the Pakistanis not to test the missile, saying it would increase tensions and step up the arms race between Pakistan and its regional rival, India. India has tested a medium-range missile, called the Prithvi, capable of striking anywhere in Pakistan.
Official comment on the Ghauri missile test came today from Malik Zahoor Ahmed, a spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy here, who denied that North Korea had helped his country.
"This is indigenous technology," he said, "though technology of course does not have to come from one source."
He added: "The threat we are facing from India is factual. It is also a historical fact that Ghauri defeated Prithvi." Ghauri, a 12th-century Muslim emperor, attacked India and defeated Prithvi, the Hindu ruler of New Delhi.
In an effort to persuade Pakistan to forgo testing the new missile, the United States offered to help resolve a dispute over $650 million that Pakistan has paid for 28 F-16 fighter planes it ordered. The planes are parked in Arizona, their delivery stalled by a 1990 Congressional act suspending military aid to Pakistan. The act was passed after President George Bush said he was not able to certify that Pakistan was not developing nuclear weapons.
Pakistan wants the planes or its money back. "We said there was an understanding that the Pakistanis would maintain the status quo on missile tests in return for our help on the F-16 question, either getting the planes delivered or getting their money back," Mr. Milhollin said. "But they went ahead and tested it anyway."
India and Pakistan have gone to war three times since 1947. Both are capable of producing nuclear weapons, and their development of more sophisticated longer-range missiles is both a heated war of words and a regional arms race that the United States finds increasingly worrisome.
Neither nation has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. India's new coalition Government, led by Hindu nationalists, has announced that it is reviewing whether to introduce nuclear weapons into its arsenal.
North Korea has also supplied its liquid-fueled missile technology to Iran, Syria and Egypt, Mr. Milhollin said.
Such sales represent one of the few lucrative exports from North Korea, one of the world's last Communist nations, whose economy is in very poor shape and whose people are widely thought to be near starvation.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Urges Policy Change In Cyberspace

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Marking a profound shift in the way the Government views cyberspace, the Federal Communications Commission said yesterday that at least some companies that provide telephone service over the Internet should be regulated in some of the same ways that traditional phone companies like AT&T are regulated.
The recommendation could signal the end of the Internet as a wide-open, overwhelmingly unregulated frontier. It is the first time the F.C.C. has proposed that some Internet companies pay the same charges as long-distance phone carriers, and it puts the commission at odds with the Clinton Administration's "hands-off" policy toward cyberspace. 
 The fees proposed yesterday would not apply to all Internet service providers and would not raise the bills of everyday Web surfers. Instead, they would apply to the small group of companies that are infiltrating the highly competitive world of long-distance calling by routing conversations over the Internet.
This new generation of Internet long-distance companies provides service between normal telephones but at prices far below those of mainstream carriers like MCI Communications or Sprint. They have been undercutting the long-distance giants because they do not have to pay myriad charges that Federal regulators levy on traditional carriers.
That could now begin to change. And Internet advocates fear that the proposal was only the first glance from a Government that is turning its regulatory magnifying glass on the digital world.
"To begin regulating any portion of this industry is to me a very bad signal," said Barbara A. Dooley, executive director of the Commercial Internet Exchange, a group based in Herndon, Va., that represents about 130 Internet service providers. "This sets a path down a very bad trail toward regulating an industry that we've grown very quickly and that is critical to the future of our economy."
To the commission, however, yesterday's decision was a matter of simple fairness. The recommendation came in a report on the universal service program, which helps subsidize telephone service in rural and poor areas and which helps pay for computer systems for schools and libraries.
The basic question before the commission was whether Internet phone companies, like most other sorts of phone companies, should have to contribute to the universal service pool. Almost every phone company in the nation must contribute about 4 percent of the revenue it gets from its customers to the fund. In addition, long-distance phone companies must pay per-minute "access fees" to local phone companies for originating and terminating long-distance calls.
Currently, providers of an "information service," like Internet providers, are exempt from most of those charges, while providers of "telecommunications service" must pay them.
When Internet telephony meant talking into a computer equipped with a microphone, it could still be considered an information service, people close to the commission said yesterday. But once entrepreneurs starting using the Internet to connect long-distance calls between two standard telephones, the case for a regulatory exemption weakened, they said.
Using the abbreviation for Internet Protocol, the computer technology at the heart of cyberspace, William E. Kennard, the commission's chairman, said: "If you look at the characteristics of I. P. telephony and compare them to the characteristics of a traditional long-distance telephone call, functionally they are the same. What this report does is state that very obvious fact, and certain things flow from that."
Mr. Kennard said the specific implications of yesterday's decision would not become clear until the F.C.C. held additional hearings. He added that the commission would consider imposing charges on a specific Internet phone company only after receiving a specific complaint against it.
But officials close to the commission said it was clear that the F.C.C. would be in favor of imposing the 4 percent universal service contribution and per-minute access fees on some companies that use the Internet to provide phone-to-phone long-distance calls.
Yesterday's report put the commission, which consists of three Democrats and two Republicans, at odds with the Clinton Administration. Last year a White House commission led by a Presidential adviser, Ira C. Magaziner, recommended that the Government shy away from regulating cyberspace.
The Administration repeated that stance on Thursday in a letter to Mr. Kennard from Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for communications and information. "Any proposal to regulate Internet telephony as a 'telecommunication service' would raise contentious issues, resolution of which would have international, as well as domestic, repercussions," Mr. Irving wrote. "Thus, the Administration urges the commission not to change its current approach."
Mr. Kennard was unfazed yesterday by the prospect of contradicting the White House.
"Once this decision is fully understood, it will be understood that this is not a fundamental threat to the Internet," he said. "We were looking at a very narrow class of services that resemble telecommunications services."
The big winners in yesterday's announcement were the traditional long-distance giants. Most analysts estimate that only about $30 million will be spent on Internet phone service this year -- a minuscule amount of the $80 billion overall long-distance market. But Internet phone carriers like the IDT Corporation, based in Hackensack, N.J., have won the confidence of Wall Street and have raised the hackles of the long-distance traditionalists.
In a statement yesterday, AT&T, the No. 1 long-distance company, said: "The success of universal service requires competitive neutrality and a broad contribution base. To that end, the commission must insure that Internet service providers and other carriers who are using new technologies contribute to the universal service fund based on their telecommunications revenues and pay cost-based access charges as well."
That made sense to Eli M. Noam, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University and director of the university's Institute for Tele-Information.
"You want neutrality," he said. "You don't want anyone getting a competitive advantage or disadvantage based on the regulatory treatment of the technology they are employing.
"The Internet industry would shrink in horror from the idea of industrial policy. But that is exactly what they are advocating. They say they are young, they are new, so treat us preferentially."

HEADLINE: Casino in Atlantic City Loses Gehry as Principal Architect

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
Frank O. Gehry, one of the nation's leading architects and celebrated most recently for his design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, says he will not be the principal architect of a $2 billion hotel and casino project in Atlantic City planned by Mirage Resorts.
"Well, it just sort of didn't fit me very well," Mr. Gehry said in a telephone interview yesterday from his studio in Santa Monica, Calif. Not that he had any qualms, moral or otherwise, about designing a gambling house, he said. 
 "No, no, no. When I was a kid, my father had slot machines," said Mr. Gehry, 68, referring to his father's operation of a string of one-armed bandits in his hometown of Timmins, Ontario, where slots were legal at the time. "I was excited about it."
Mr. Gehry said he had come up with a preliminary concept for the Mirage project, a complex with 4,000 hotel rooms and a single casino on a large parcel near the Boardwalk. "I had gathered the hotels into a kind of circle, you know, like circling the wagons, but at different levels," he said. "Some of it was 30 stories high, some of it was 15, and it formed a kind of a cauldron in the middle, which was the casino portion."
But, he added, "It was not their kind of thing."
Mirage's kind of thing, however that ends up, will probably be less costly, Mr. Gehry said.
Another architect of comparable stature, Philip Johnson, who is in his 90's, will continue to work with Mirage's own architects.
A spokesman for Mirage, Alan Feldman, said that Mr. Gehry's departure was not a major problem. "I wouldn't even call this a hurdle," Mr. Feldman said. "I would call it a step in the process."
In an interview from Mirage's headquarters in Las Vegas, Nev., Mr. Feldman declined to discuss any differences that company officials had with Mr. Gehry. "It would have been great to have worked with him, and we're hopeful we still will," he said. "But we're certainly left in superb hands with Mr. Johnson."
Mr. Gehry said he remained an admirer of Mirage Resorts' chairman, Stephen A. Wynn, and promised to "do a cameo" for the project, like designing a restaurant.
But the loss of Mr. Gehry as the chief architect is an undeniable blow to Mr. Wynn, who has had to overcome legal and political battles with local residents, state politicians and a rival casino operator, Donald J. Trump, before groundbreaking on the Mirage project could be scheduled. It is now scheduled for this fall.
Total revenues of $4.2 billion for Atlantic City's gambling industry were stagnant in 1997 when measured against inflation, as competition intensified from Indian-owned casinos and Delaware racetracks now equipped with slot machines. Atlantic City's most profitable casino last year, Bally's Park Place, attributed its success, in part, to the opening of its Wild Wild West expansion, the city's first theme casino. And some analysts say that the city's future may depend on its ability to remake itself into a destination resort, an effort that could only have been helped by a hotel and casino complex designed by Mr. Gehry.

Bank of Japan Continues Rescue Effort for the Yen
The dollar tumbled against the yen in Asian trading as the Bank of Japan sold dollars for a second day. Traders estimated that the central bank sold several billions of dollars yesterday, after selling more than $1 billion on Thursday. 
 Japan wants to bolster the currency, which fell to its lowest level in six and a half years last week on concern that the Government was not acting aggressively enough to pull the economy out of its long slump. Page D4.
 
A Border War Over Phone Traffic
Hispanic immigrants make $2 billion worth of international long-distance phone calls a year to friends and family back home. As the struggle for customers grows fierce in this rapidly growing market, the mega-carriers AT&T and MCI are trying to block the entry of a new competitor, Mexico's Telmex. D3.
 
MCI restated fourth-quarter results to move $147 million in charges to the first half of 1998, after the S.E.C. questioned the timing. D4.
 
Reading the Tobacco Leaves
The negotiations on the tobacco bill are partly a tale of the Clinton Administration's -- and the Republicans' -- recalculations of the industry's political power. But they are a story of the industry's calculations as well, in this case faulty ones of its own clout and whom it needed to appease. A1.
 
Weill Has His Work Cut Out for Him
Sanford I. Weill, the Brooklyn-born son of Polish immigrants, struggled to get his first job on Wall Street as a messenger, went on to build a giant brokerage firm, lost it, then started all over again at 52. The new firm he built, now known as Travelers Group, became so successful that Citicorp was eager to merge with it. Now, Mr. Weill will have to prove that he has more than drive, that he has the personality and skills to make a success of this seemingly unwieldy combination. A1.
 
Doctors Complain of Aetna Delays
The New York State Society of Medical Oncologists and Hemotologists asked state officials to investigate complaints by doctors who said they were encountering long delays in payments by Aetna U.S. Healthcare. D2.
 
Another Bank Merger Set in Motion
Capping a week that began with the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Inc., two other financial services companies announced a merger. Star Banc agreed to acquire Trans Financial for $696 million in stock. D4.
 
Defending an Aerospace Merger
Contrary to a Justice Department lawsuit, Lockheed and Northrop say their proposed $8.3 billion merger would improve competition, save taxpayers "hundreds of millions" of dollars a year and make the military industry more efficient. D4.
 
Antitrust and the Ivory Tower
When the Clinton Administration accused the airlines of acting like predators and squeezing smaller competitors out of business, it entered a century-old intellectual debate on antitrust law and the free market. How these ideas play out could end up influencing how much Americans pay for everything from airline tickets to computer software, from beer to cellophane tape. B7.

Wineries in Italy, France and Spain, increasingly challenged by new competitors in Australia, Chile and South Africa, are investing heavily to cut costs and increase production. Now Marchesi Antinori, one of Italy's oldest wineries, has issued bonds and warrants for a vintage Tuscan red wine. The bonds sold out in a single morning. D3.

HEADLINE: Casinos Bring Detroit Hope and Division

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 10

 BODY:
The view from Mayor Dennis W. Archer's 11th-floor office in City Hall is apparently all he needed to convince himself that bringing casino gambling to Detroit's riverfront would be well worth the emotion and divisiveness that have clutched this city so tightly in recent days.
There, across the murky waters of the Detroit River, in Windsor, Ontario, sit two shimmering casinos operated by the Canadian Government, drawing thousands of Michigan gamblers each day through the bridge and tunnel that connect these international neighbors. 
 "They have a corner on the market because there's nothing nearby to challenge them," Mr. Archer said, in an interview this week. "To the extent that there's any burden with casinos, we have it already with the Windsor casino, and we have none of the benefits."
Betting on hope and luck to restore a city built with the steel and bolts of the auto industry, the City Council approved a plan on Thursday to make Detroit the largest city in the United States with casinos. If the state's casino control commission approves, three casinos will be built on 57 acres next to the world headquarters of the General Motors Corporation. A decision is expected in six months.
Michigan voters had already approved land-based casinos for Detroit, but Thursday's vote in favor of specific plans for a $1.8 billion complex of three hotels and casinos was pivotal. Mr. Archer's decision last fall not to award any of the city's gambling licenses to a black-owned developer created dissension in a city with a 76 percent black population, a black Mayor and a predominantly black City Council.
A grass-roots effort to overrule the mayor's decision had been expected to gain momentum if the Council had rejected his plan. Also hoping for a defeat were anti-gambling organizations, which had begun campaigning for a ballot initiative to overturn the city's right to license casinos.
Mr. Archer, who won his second term with 80 percent of the vote last November and has had strong support from local businesses, has not only been vilified by some blacks as a "miseducated Negro," but has also angered many white business owners for breaking a promise not to place the casinos along the waterfront, in what the city calls its renaissance riverside district.
"I have taken a lot of heat," Mr. Archer said after the vote. "I learned who my friends are."
One person probably not included among those friends is Don H. Barden, a local black businessman who made millions as a cable television operator and owns a riverboat casino in Indiana. Mr. Barden, whose bid for a casino license was deemed inferior by the Mayor last fall, has vowed to continue fighting.
"This is not over yet," Mr. Barden promised on Thursday. "This is a matter of principle in a city with this kind of population base. When blacks are in control of the political process and they find that there are qualified blacks, then they should be duty bound to make the decision on behalf of their own."
A group organized on Mr. Barden's behalf is placing a question on the August primary ballot that would require that one of the casinos be controlled by blacks. A group supporting Mr. Archer, who has insisted that he chose the three proposals that were best for the city, is sponsoring a ballot measure that would affirm his decision.
But the Mayor, voicing a widely held view, said that "with the City Council voting yes, I believe that we will be able to diffuse any enthusiasm" for repealing the licenses or changing the criteria.
Mr. Barden's plan to build a $500 million project lacked sufficient equity, Mr. Archer said. By placing the casinos together on the waterfront, he noted, the annual revenue projected by industry analysts grew to $1.5 billion a year from $1.2 billion.
"My fiduciary responsibility called for me in a competitive situation to do what was best for the city," the Mayor said. "I could not lead with my heart. I had to lead with my head."
The casinos are projected to create 11,000 permanent jobs, which would make the gambling industry the city's sixth-largest employer, rivaling G.M.'s entire Detroit-based work force. The projected annual tax revenue is $130 million for the city and $100 million for the state.
Two of the three development partnerships are headed by companies based in Las Vegas, Nev.: MGM Grand and Circus Circus Enterprises. The third development group is Greektown Casino, a partnership of local businessmen named after the Detroit neighborhood. More than 100 blacks have bought equity in the three partnerships. All three have named blacks to their boards.
Temporary casinos could open by late this year, and permanent ones as early as 1999. In addition to the opportunities for local builders and engineers, other local businesses will compete for an estimated $300 million a year in continuing contracts.
"This will create a minimum of 50 real, solid black millionaires," predicted Herb Strather, a black real estate developer and president of Atwater Entertainment, a local group of investors that has a 55 percent equity stake in the Circus Circus project, though Circus Circus will maintain management control.
"There has never been an issue like this in our city's history," said Mr. Strather, a Detroit native who grew up poor but now owns apartment and office buildings. "But this has split the community so bad, we need some peace and healing."
That split was vividly illustrated in City Hall, as the Council voted. Like minimoguls in the making, supporters of the plan paced importantly through the corridor leading into the Council's meeting room, with ultra-compact cellular telephones stuck to their ears. Down the hallway, where an overflow crowd watched the proceedings on a television monitor, Mr. Barden's supporters, dressed in African robes and hats, loudly voiced their displeasure.
"The ones who voted against us in the community are definitely traitors," said Helen Moore, a member of Community Coalition, the grass-roots group seeking to change the licensing criteria.
In a city that was widely viewed as a post-industrial wasteland, there have been encouraging signs in recent years. Politicians proudly point out that Greektown, a neon-lighted neighborhood of restaurants and jazz bars, is thriving, that ground was broken recently for new stadiums for baseball and football, and that increasing numbers of middle-class workers are living in the city.
But given the many vacant buildings that cover the landscape, there is no way to hide the reality that much work remains to be done.
As in so many other places in the United States that have turned to casino gambling to energize economic development, in Detroit people have grand visions of gambling's potential as a catalyst for growth. Though Wall Street analysts view the city as only a regional gaming market, Mr. Archer and others contend that the casinos will help turn the city into a tourist destination.
"We're trying to bring people from all over the world," Mr. Archer said on a radio show this week.
But what casino operators want for now is to bring in many of the 20,000 people who visit the Windsor casinos each day, as well as many of the 9.3 million people who live within 150 miles of Detroit. City officials estimate that more than 75 percent of the visitors to the Windsor casinos come from Detroit and the region and that $400 million in gambling money crosses the river annually from Michigan alone.
People in Michigan have indeed proved their willingness to wager. State residents support a lottery, as well as 13 Native American casinos in the Upper Peninsula and in western Michigan. And in Detroit, illegal numbers and backroom dice games once flourished among the blue-collar work force.
The new casinos are expected to bring the total gambling space in the region to about 500,000 square feet, more than the amount on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
Despite all their boosterism, city officials have been careful to heed the cautionary tales of cities like New Orleans, where wildly exaggerated expectations and poor planning have led to the failure of an attempt to open a land-based casino, and Atlantic City, where urban blight has remained in the shadow of the boardwalk casinos. A mayoral task force sent around the country to study gambling jurisdictions "saw what can happen if you aren't analytical," said Karen D. O'Donoghue, a task force member.
If the casino plan receives approval from state regulators, and the developers begin building this year, it will mark the realization of a dream first pursued more than 20 years ago by Mayor Coleman A. Young. Mr. Young will not see casinos finally come to Detroit; he died last year. But another Detroit legend, Martha Jean Steinberg, was at City Hall as the votes were tallied.
Ms. Steinberg, a 35-year veteran of Detroit radio and a recent inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame who is known as The Queen, served on a commission to study casinos under Mr. Young and is one of 10 local investors in the MGM Grand casino. The company would not say what percentage of its equity was held by the local investors.
Ms. Steinberg -- a minister who recounts for her listeners her conversations with God -- explained why she believed that casinos were the city's saving grace.
"I prayed on this," she said. "He spoke to me and said my name.
"Detroit is a woman," she continued. "She opens her arms to immigrants and to migrants. She brought them here. The woman has been beaten down and talked about by everyone in the world, and now the Lord has lifted her up and anointed her with a new opportunity. We're going to heal our wounds."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Internet Wars

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Three years ago I visited Microsoft to ask its top managers these basic questions: How does Microsoft measure power, and which countries have it and which ones don't? They answered that Microsoft measured power by one ratio: personal computers per household. And on Microsoft's power map South Korea ranked highest in the world, with the U.S. and Japan also near the top; Europe was all on the rise, except for France; but the Middle East, save for Israel, was a black hole.
Well, last week I went to Silicon Valley to ask the same questions to the cutting-edge technology companies there, and I got a very different answer from three years ago. Silicon Valley measures power today not in PC's per household, but in networks per capita. That is, how broadly and deeply has a country taken its PC's and linked them together into networks within companies, schools and entertainment sources, and then tied them into the Internet and the World Wide Web? And how broad is its bandwidth, which is the capacity of cable, telephone lines and fiber optics to carry digital communications from point to point in networks? "Bandwidth" and "degree of connectivity" -- those are the new measures of power in the Silicon Universe. 
 "What people have not grasped is that the Internet will change everything," says John Chambers, the dynamic president of Cisco Systems -- the most important American company that no one has ever heard of. It makes the black boxes that connect the Internet around the world. "The Internet will change how people live, work, play and learn. The Industrial Revolution brought together people with machines in factories, and the Internet revolution will bring together people with knowledge and information in virtual companies. And it will have every bit as much impact on society as the Industrial Revolution. It will promote globalization at an incredible pace. But instead of happening over 100 years, like the Industrial Revolution, it will happen over 7 years."
A few caveats: Mr. Chambers has an obvious self-interest in promoting this world view. The Internet revolution will take more than seven years. And bandwidth is a huge problem, because until the digital pipes get bigger and more organized, networking will be constrained. All that aside, Mr. Chambers is still right: Jobs and economic power will gravitate to those societies with the most networks and bandwidth, because those countries will find it easiest to gather, tap and deploy knowledge in order to design, invent, manufacture, communicate, educate and entertain.
Beyond bandwidth and connectivity, three other factors will distinguish companies and countries. One is whether you have a business culture where your people are comfortable exploiting networks and sharing their knowledge. I know a management consultant who likes to say about the German electronics giant Siemens: "If Siemens only knew what Siemens knows it would be a rich company." The second is whether you have a competitive culture in which big companies have to either constantly reinvent themselves or be overtaken by start-up companies, which is the essence of Silicon Valley. And the third factor is whether your company is good at creating strategic partnerships. You cannot compete today on a large scale without going global, and you can't go global without partners -- the markets are simply too big and complex, and the level of investment too great.
"No one can do it by themselves anymore," argues Mr. Chambers. "The companies who do not understand how to truly partner will get left behind."
So who's hot and who's not in today's world? Taiwan is feared in Silicon Valley for its innovative prowess, connectivity and dynamic capitalist business culture that exploits all this technology. The U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and parts of Israel and India also fall into this category, with China rising. Scandinavia, particularly Finland, scores very high on total networking, but lacks the entrepreneurial culture to fully exploit it. Japan and Korea are falling behind in network investments. Germany is catching up and France has just woken up.
"Companies and countries who will thrive in this Internet economy are those who change before the rest of the world realizes that they have to change," argues Mr. Chambers. If you do that faster than your competitors, he adds, there's only one thing you'll have to say to them: "Game over."

HEADLINE: Cooperation and Miscalculations On Shaping Tobacco Legislation

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
It started with an angry confrontation on a television news show.
The date was Jan. 15, and another batch of tobacco industry documents had just been made public. One R. J. Reynolds memorandum, from 1974, described teen-agers as young as 14 as "tomorrow's cigarette business." 
 That evening, Bruce Reed, President Clinton's domestic policy adviser, appeared along with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, on "The News Hour With Jim Lehrer" to discuss youth smoking.
When Mr. McCain criticized the Clinton Administration for playing politics and dragging its feet on a tough cigarette bill, Mr. Reed angrily parried those charges. But he called the Senator the next day to offer the Administration's help in writing legislation.
"That was a watershed," Mr. McCain recalled last week, "when the White House really shifted into gear."
Mr. Reed's call marked the beginning of months of wary but widening cooperation between the Administration and leading Senate Republicans. And the terms of cooperation were soon set: the White House, preoccupied by accusations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Clinton and recalling its disastrous first-term experience trying to pass national health legislation, would not take the lead by proposing a tobacco bill, but would back Senator McCain's efforts.
For the tobacco industry, Mr. Reed's call amounted to the final break in what had been a worsening relationship with the White House. In negotiations that led to an agreement last June, the tobacco industry had included the Administration. But shortly after the deal was announced the White House had moved to distance itself from it.
Now the Administration was going further, agreeing to work with Republicans -- and, as it turned out, without the industry -- on a tougher bill. The Administration had calculated that public opinion and the political pendulum had moved still further against the cigarette makers.
Indeed, the negotiations on tobacco since Jan. 15 are partly a tale of the Administration's -- and the Republicans' -- recalculations of the industry's political power. But they are a story of the cigarette makers' calculations as well, in this case faulty ones of their own power and whom they needed to appease.
"They dramatically overestimated their ability to get their phone calls returned," Mr. Reed said.
The rapprochement between Mr. Reed and Senator McCain began a marathon series of meetings and negotiations involving lawmakers, the White House, public health officials, state attorneys general and trial lawyers that led to the Senate Commerce Committee's passage of a bipartisan bill on April 1.
While few people doubt that the legislation is only one step in a process that has an uncertain ending, the bill is now framing the escalating debate over the nation's tobacco policy, and has become the target of the tobacco industry's anger.
 
Companies Back Out,And Face Big Risks
The nation's five largest cigarette makers announced on Wednesday that they would no longer work for comprehensive legislation to regulate tobacco, and would vigorously fight the Senate bill.
"We signed on last year for a rational process that would make the tobacco industry smaller but acceptable," said Laurence A. Tisch, chairman of the Loews Corporation, the parent company of Lorillard, maker of Kent and Newport cigarettes. "But the industry has been demonized now and the process has been totally politicized. That's what the Senate bill reflects."
The industry also made tactical mistakes. While it included the White House in last year's negotiations, it excluded Congressional leaders. The industry assumed it had to work hardest to appease the White House, a potentially fierce antagonist. A Republican-controlled Congress, the industry assumed, could be counted on to support it.
That assumption proved to be wrong. "There was clearly a need to engage the leadership in Congress much earlier in the process," said J. Philip Carlton, the industry's chief lobbyist. "Part of our problem was that we had no one in Congress who felt any ownership stake in the June agreement."
Politically, the McCain bill -- approved by the Commerce Committee on a 19-to-1 vote -- demonstrates that tobacco is now seen as an issue on which tough action could pay off for both the President and Congress. And a major tobacco bill, if passed, could pay off financially by helping the Government balance its budget.
The bill has a price tag of $516 billion over 25 years, increases penalties if teen-age smoking does not drop, and leaves tobacco producers without some of the lawsuit protections promised in the June accord.
Without the industry's cooperation, advertising and marketing restrictions in the proposed bill might have to be dropped. Still, the big tobacco companies face daunting risks if they walk away from Congress.
The biggest risk is of a series of huge court judgments that could cripple the five cigarette manufacturers -- the Philip Morris Companies, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, B.A.T. Industries, Loews and UST Inc., the parent company of U.S. Tobacco.
It was the industry's anxiety over the prospect of a rising wave of court judgments that prompted the companies to seek an accord with the state attorneys general last year. Within months, however, it was clear that the June agreement had been all but scuttled.
After a delay, Mr. Clinton refused to endorse the proposed settlement, choosing instead to sketch out his tobacco policy as a set of broad principles rather than offering a concrete alternative.
By the end of last year, dozens of tobacco bills had been introduced in Congress. Though some lawmakers like Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, made runs to grab the leadership on the issue, other Republicans backed off, seeing tobacco legislation as a potential political cudgel that the White House and Democrats could use against them.
It soon emerged that the Senate Commerce Committee, headed by Mr. McCain, had the best chance to build bipartisan legislation, since it had jurisdiction over a broad range of issues, like marketing, labeling and liability.
Senator McCain, who has built coalitions on thorny issues, including campaign financing, seemed well-suited to the task. And as a man with Presidential ambitions, he was eager for the opportunity and the headlines that would result from shepherding a bill that could affect the welfare of millions of Americans.
 
Putting the Emphasis On the June Accord
By last fall, anti-smoking advocates like David A. Kessler, the former Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, had seized the public stage. As the Congressional debate began, the two continued to lobby behind the scenes with White House officials and lawmakers for tough legislation.
The industry's response was akin to paralysis. Despite decades of campaign contributions and highly paid lobbyists, few lawmakers saw any benefit in defending cigarette makers. And with industry lobbyists like Mr. Carlton insisting in Congressional hearings on the terms of the June accord, even independent figures associated with that deal began to lose their luster.
One apparent casualty was Michael A. Moore, the Mississippi Attorney General, who was a chief craftsman of the June agreement and clung stubbornly to it.
"The June-20-or-bust line wasn't helpful," said Mr. Reed, the Clinton adviser. "It was mistake for Mike Moore to hold to that line for so long."
For tobacco producers, one senior company executive said, the quandary was that the five companies involved in the June agreement had different financial conditions and views on tobacco regulation. As a result, despite repeated efforts to negotiate among themselves more attractive alternatives to the June accord, the companies could not reach a consensus.
By March, Mr. McCain had been endorsed as the point man on tobacco legislation by the Senate leadership. Until then, the Senator had been holding hearings on tobacco. But once in charge, he sharply accelerated the pace and began bargaining for a bill in earnest.
Mr. McCain and his staff met regularly with White House policy advisers, and sent the Administration list after list of questions.
Dr. Kessler came to Washington three times to advise Mr. McCain, who also met with Dr. Koop. State attorneys general, Wall Street industry analysts, trial lawyers, Treasury Department officials and Senate members from anti-smoking liberals to tobacco-state conservatives were all invited to talk.
Senator McCain reached out to just about everyone except the tobacco industry, reflecting the political reality that any bill that was viewed as being endorsed by the industry would be defeated.
 
Seeking Consensus On Sensitive Issues
The Senator moved ahead step by step to build a consensus for the bill. Enlisting the Administration's assistance was essential.
The economic impact on the industry, for example, was a concern. So Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, estimated at a Commerce Committee hearing on March 24 that the bill's impact would be to cut industry profits by 23 percent, a significant but not catastrophic decline. The industry disputes the Treasury projections.
The bill's proposal to give the Food and Drug Administration sweeping new powers to regulate tobacco products was a politically sensitive issue. Mr. McCain delegated another Republican on the Commerce Committee, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a heart surgeon, to write the F.D.A. provisions with Administration officials.
To get his bill out of the 20-member committee, Mr. McCain had to include provisions to make it palatable to senators of various stripes.
For example, Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, demanded that the people who worked the thousands of tobacco farms in his state be protected. "If my farmers aren't taken care of," Mr. Ford told the committee, "this carpet's going to run red." So a fund of $28 billion is earmarked in the bill to aid tobacco farmers.
To be sure, the McCain bill is merely the new focus for debate on tobacco. The proposed legislation left many of the toughest issues for the next round before the full Senate. But with the bill, the debate about tobacco policy in America has entered a new stage -- one that few would have anticipated until recently, and one whose outcome is uncertain.
"There is no going back from this bill," said Matt Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a coalition of public health advocacy groups that helped negotiate last year's agreement. "This is a play whose ending isn't yet even remotely written."

New York Action Threatened
 ALBANY, April 10 (AP) -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said today that he would try to use the power of the state pension system's stock holdings to prevent tobacco companies from abandoning settlement talks with Congress.
New York's pension fund, which has reached nearly $100 billion, owns more than $450 million worth of stock in tobacco companies.
Mr. McCall called on other institutional investors to pledge not to support the directors of tobacco companies that fail to return to negotiations.

Samsung to Guarantee More Debt for U.S. Units

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Samsung Electronics Company said yesterday that it would increase debt guarantees for two United States affiliates by $365 million, raising concern that the Korean semiconductor maker could pay a heavy price to sustain its overseas investments. The company said it would guarantee the debts of Samsung Electronics America Inc. and Samsung Austin Semiconductor Inc. to help them buy production plants. 
 The move is the latest sign that Korea's biggest companies are having financing problems at their overseas subsidiaries because of the financial crisis at home. Samsung's total debt guarantees to the two companies will rise to $2.2 billion as they continue to struggle to raise money on their own.

ERRATA
 An Examined Life.
 By George Steiner.
 206 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $25. 
 George Steiner is a literary critic who can turn to almost any subject, and has. Readers of his many reviews in The New Yorker, The Times Literary Supplement and countless other journals -- not to mention his many books, from novellas to a primer on Heidegger -- will know him for a polyglot polymath. He has studied and taught in many universities in Europe and America, most recently at Oxford. Yet he feels himself to be an outcast who has rarely received his due.
"Errata" recounts the outlines of his itinerant life, beginning in Paris, then in Manhattan at the French Lycee, at the University of Chicago, in London, Geneva and elsewhere. But it does not do so in the manner of a conventional autobiography. The book is primarily a tour of ideas, not of places or people. Steiner's family, teachers and heroes appear only as fleeting shadows. The details of his life have been, one feels, inserted hurriedly, and largely in order to provide occasions for reflection on the intellectual world and his position in it.
Though he has plenty of admirers, Steiner has been attacked on many fronts: for parading his learning too ostentatiously, for dropping phone books of names on the slightest pretext, for occasional sloppiness, for allowing his enthusiasm to outstrip his understanding. Read some of his early, seminal works -- such as the masterly and elegantly written "Death of Tragedy," published in 1961 -- and you will take a kinder view of him. Share one of his obsessions -- Shakespeare, Goethe, the Holocaust or the nature of translation, for example -- and you are bound to warm to him at least sometimes. Read this intellectual autobiography, however, and you will see that even his harshest critics also have a point.
First there is its bloated and awkward language. Steiner's prose is packed with verbless sentences and tangled in a spaghetti of irrelevant cross-references and philological trivia. "The roots of words go to the heart of things," he tells us. He is also addicted to pointless prefixes and suffixes, rare variants and tangential allusions -- indeed, he often seems to want to distract his readers from the heart of things. But most of all he likes to use scare quotes. Steiner is forever employing this device to "distance" himself from the "words" he employs. This is a "pain in the neck."
He is scathingly skeptical about computer translation: it will never, he thinks, be able to emulate our linguistic gifts. To see how bad these programs really are, I fed some of Steiner's sentences into an English-German translation program, then fed them back into a German-English one. The results were not impressive: "After the axiomatic moment ontological of the confidence, attack comes," was one. On the other hand, since Steiner's original was, "After the axiomatic moment of ontological trust, comes aggression," I'm not sure it's entirely the machine's fault.
Steiner likes to drag in vocabulary from his reading in science, mathematics and philosophy. But that's usually all it is: vocabulary. Describing the oddity of Judaism, for example, he tells us that "its parameters are those of 'strangeness,' another key-notion in current theoretical physics and cosmology." Hmm. One property of quarks was whimsically called "strangeness" by its discoverers, but this does not mean that they are strange in the sense Steiner intends. Quark properties are also jokily known as flavors. Is Steiner now going to tell us that ice cream is like quarks? In another chapter, he draws an analogy between human experience and some "charged particles" that he says are streaming "unperceived" through our planet. He means neutrinos, which are in fact not charged. His uses of "irrational number," "incommensurable," "truth-functional" and many other smart-sounding terms betray at best an indifference to what they actually mean.
Steiner worships smartness: the recent solution of Fermat's last theorem is, to him, "a point of light in the tawdriness of the closing century." What he seems to hate most about our present culture is the cheapening, dumbing-down media, particularly television. Yet a book about the solution of Fermat's theorem has recently become a best seller in Britain -- thanks to a television program. One cannot argue with Steiner's charge that our century has at times sunk to new depths of depravity and barbarity. But when he rants about the despoliation of "this scarred, crowded earth" or the uncontrolled "spiral of graphic brutality" on the Internet, his rhetoric is commonplace and tired and can in many places be questioned.
Among his other dislikes are literary theorists. He thinks that the concept of theory is largely spurious when applied to the humanities because he takes the unusually narrow and scientistic view that all types of theories require rigorous experimental support, which the humanities do not seek to offer. His hostility seems mainly directed against those who have tried to develop theories of translation. This is odd because he is often credited (not least by himself) with having invented this apparently impossible discipline in his 1975 book, "After Babel." On this matter, as elsewhere, Steiner seems motivated more by rancor than by logic.
Apart from his likes and dislikes, and a mere smattering of the sort of personal history, reminiscences and portraits of friends that usually make up an autobiography, the main focus of "Errata" is confessional. Steiner voices his regrets and admits many failings. He has "scattered and, thus, wasted" his strengths, he writes. He has lacked patience and tenacity. He has been careless. It may seem unkind to be hard on someone who is so hard on himself, but Steiner has an extraordinary ability to turn even his apologies into boasts. ("Despite antennae exceedingly alert to the changing 'spirit of the age,' I apprehended too late certain key shifts.") He rues the fact that he has spread himself too thin, then regrets that he did not use his artistic gifts to illustrate books as well as write them. He castigates his own dilettantism, but also tells us that his fiction is so successful that he could have made that his main business.
He could, in short, have been a contender. In this book, a passionate student of tragedy has revealed to all -- though not, it seems, to himself -- his hubris.

STRANGERS AMONG US
 How Latino Immigration
 Is Transforming America.
 By Roberto Suro.
 349 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. 
 In the midst of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, a Latino heaved a Molotov cocktail and cried, "This is for Latasha," referring to the black girl killed by a Korean grocer at the time of the Rodney King beating. That spectral image of immigrants joining the rainbow coalition of the aggrieved represents the darker side of "Strangers Among Us," Roberto Suro's quietly urgent journey through the Latino United States. Suro worries that millions of Latinos will be trapped in poverty, although the fate of the nation is entangled in their presence. We depend on them to tend our gardens and children, to sweat and smile for us, to pick fruit and hand over Big Macs. And to do this cheerily on the cheap, in jobs we don't want. But our dependency is deeper still: how we treat these strangers is a test of who we are as a people and a nation.
Latinos are the largest segment of the rushing stream of new immigrants who are reconfiguring American politics and culture, not just in California, Texas, Florida and New York. Soon after the year 2000, they will outnumber African-Americans. To many they remain among us but not of us -- mysterious phantoms, like the deaf Mexican trinket vendors in the subway, or icons of menace, like the Los Angeles gang members who shot up an Anglo family who happened to make a wrong turn.
Suro, a former correspondent for The New York Times who now writes for The Washington Post, is the son of a Puerto Rican father and an Ecuadorean mother who instructed him as a child never to yield up "Roberto" to the chummy Americanism of "Bob." He dispels the alien aura that surrounds Latino immigrants with crisp, unadorned prose.
It's hard to lump Latinos together, he reminds us, since the different nationalities vary. The Puerto Ricans teetered on the edge of success in the 1950's, only to implode into poverty as factory jobs disappeared. Miami Cubans, haunted by their obsession with Castro, have built a vibrant enclave out of dense ethnic connections. The rich civic life of New York's Dominicans, played out in bodega chatter and hometown soccer leagues, struggles against the crack economy.
Suro's ambitions, however, are greater than just evoking Latin humanity. He knows his social science and deploys it surely. If the book slows at times, it is because he aims to give us not just a good read but a good analysis of the larger forces that shape the intimate portraits. Suro's triumph here is to satisfy these contrary impulses while documenting one of the monumental dramas of our time, how Latinos have become central to America's struggle with poverty and race.
The Latinos, more than other immigrants, are frequent border crossers. Mexican-Americans dart back to Mexico for first communions; Guatemalans head up and down the Central American highway. The real highways, though, are the channels formed by nodes of human connection, through which movement and memory, rumor and remittance, drugs and shortstops flow north and back again. All kinds of choices are shaped by a transnational reality of jet planes, wire transfers and fax machines. The result is a jumbled world, where the lines of nation give way to something more fluid, like politicians from Santo Domingo campaigning on upper Broadway in New York City. The word "border," then, suggests too much fixity to capture this simultaneous dwelling in two worlds. The Chicana poet Gloria Anzaldua speaks of the "borderland," and Latinos remain in-between people.
The borderland of identity is no less dangerous for being less tangible than a physical border. Migration makes you vulnerable. You and your children may become unrecognizable -- even to yourself. Resentful Imelda, a 15-year-old "dime-store Madonna" who is unmarried and pregnant, tells Suro: "We'd get into a lot of yelling and stuff at home because my parents, they'd say: 'You're Mexican. Speak Spanish. Act like a Mexican girl,' and I'd say, 'I'm here now and I'm going to be like the other kids.' " This is not what her parents had in mind. They thought you could pick and choose, American dollars but not its corrosive culture.
But if immigration has long meant loss and yielding, it also remains a story of opening up and self-making. This is why those who fumed at the Mexican flags waved by teen-agers protesting California's Proposition 187 (which restricted benefits to illegal immigrants) got it wrong. Far from wanting to " 'remember the Alamo' in reverse," Suro shrewdly observes, they were attesting to their Americanism in the very act of claiming a place for Latino Los Angeles. This exuberant process of cultural creation is embodied for Suro in banda music: "the sound of immigrants who skip across national borders, picking up music -- corridos, hip-hop, rock-and-roll -- wherever they go."
Sometimes the Latinos of the day clash with the Latinos of the night. One early riser says, "There is always work here, at least for those who have come to improve themselves." But a nearby street tough dismisses the day people as mojados (wetbacks) and retorts that work "don't interest me much."
More than a righteous struggle between character and its absence, such clashes are rooted in the economic fates of different portions of the Latino community. True, there has been much progress; but it seems the second generation is faltering. Suro invokes a law of perpetual motion: Keep moving, or slip into decline, into an underclass of sullen alienation. Ironically, the risks of failure mount the more migrants embrace American culture, its streets and television. Mexicanness gives immunity, which is why some Mexican parents worry that their kids are becoming Chicanos. The Rev. Virgil Elizondo, the rector of San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio, elegiacally defines this slippage for Suro: "I can tell by looking in their eyes how long they've been here. They come sparkling with hope, and the first generation finds that hope rewarded. Their children's eyes no longer sparkle."
The tensions of class and identity collide in another borderland, of race. Latinos are neither black nor white, although some are always sliding into one or the other. Thus they challenge cherished dichotomies. In south Texas, Chicano politics has followed the race-based civil rights model, but Latinos lack the moral stature of victims claimed by American blacks, while the specificity of being Mexican or Salvadoran, say, beguiles many more than does a pan-Latino vision of La Raza.
Some of the most poignant moments of "Strangers Among Us" recount the painful abrasions between "black" and "brown" peoples. To many American employers (and to immigrant Korean greengrocers as well), Latinos are what poor blacks are not: willing workers. A Guatemalan, Juan, tells how he and his Mayan coterie supplanted blacks at a Houston supermarket after a fight involving black workers: "We do not argue with people, we do not fight even among ourselves and we do not make demands. It was the only thing we had to offer." (This preference for nonblacks, it should be noted, is not exactly a racial preference; in Brooklyn, employers have flipped entire factories from African-American to West Indian, darkening the complexion of the work force.)
Latinos dwell in one final borderland, in the American imagination, between repulsion and attraction. They thus have the power to expose what is repulsive and attractive in us. No sentimentalist, Suro argues that if we don't control the flood of illegals, it will touch off a nativist recoil and hurt everybody. While the nation has absorbed a huge migration with a fair degree of grace, tolerance has its limits. Proposition 187, Suro says, unearthed a nasty streak, among blacks, whites and even Mexican-American citizens, that would trim both rights and respect.
In a world in which exchanges of capital and culture are global, much has changed. But much has not. This is why Suro's opening quotation from Leviticus is more than a piety: "And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him." That puts it too simply, as if the demons all lie beyond the self: the wanderer, after all, may vex himself with his own yearning. But the rest of the passage quoted by Suro -- "But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt" -- puts the host on notice: if foreign hordes can make us feel like strangers in our land, we can make ourselves strangers, with hard hearts and failed memory that estrange us from the meaning of our ancestors' sacrifices and the best of our democratic impulses.

HEADLINE: POP/JAZZ;
Up From Materialism to Matters of the Spirit

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica

 BODY:
EVERY musical style to emerge from Jamaica over the last 35 years has eventually achieved international popularity. Reggae is part of the vocabulary of every working pop musician. The disk jockeys known as toasters are now acknowledged as the earliest progenitors of rap, and ska has lately become the favorite of skateboarders and punk bands the world over.
But the story has been different with the homegrown style called dancehall. While dominating Jamaican popular music for most of the last decade, dancehall has remained on the fringes of pop consciousness, even though its driving electronic beat and sex- and violence-soaked lyrics would seem to make it a prime candidate for crossover in an era in which the lowest common denominator reigns supreme. 
 Now, however, an emerging generation of young Jamaican artists is subverting the dancehall scene and improving its prospects for international acceptance by taking the music back to its roots in reggae and Rastafarian utopianism. Instead of celebrating girls and guns, the new breed, led by singers and songwriters like Luciano, Anthony B., Sizzla, Beenie Man and Tony Rebel, urge Jamaicans to sav their country and their souls.
The proper function of the Jamaican artist is to be "missionary, visionary and messenger," said Luciano, the sweet-voiced, intensely spiritual vocalist whose stirring songs of redemption and uplift have become virtual anthems here in recent years. "Yes, there are still people around who are singing slack lyrics about the silly things in life, like what they going to do to their woman. But the pendulum is swinging back the other way."
If so, worsening political and economic conditions in Jamaica may be hastening the shift. Growth has ground to a halt, and in 1997 more than 1,000 people were killed here, a murder rate more than three times that of New York City. In such an environment, Jamaicans seem more inclined to reflect than to party, and musicians willing to assume the prophetic role once played by Bob Marley have enhanced their credibility and popularity.
"We Jamaicans see ourselves as a powerful world cultural force, and we can't understand why as a people we can't get the economics right, why the social and political conditions can't be better," explained Carl Bradshaw, the veteran actor and screenwriter who is now director of operations for Island Entertainment Jamaica, the country's leading record label for the last 40 years. "That's why you're seeing this switch back to protest music."
Tony Rebel and Garnet Silk, who died in a fire in 1994, were among the first on the dancehall scene to lead the way back toward the Rastafarian tradition, with its emphasis on social criticism in biblical language. But a major turning point was the success of Anthony B.'s "Fire 'Pon Rome," an incendiary attack on wealth and political privilege released in 1996. Quickly banned from the airwaves not because of lewdness but because it was deemed seditious and libelous, the song found a home in the dance halls, pushing aside more frivolous fare and making hits of both "So Many Things," the 22-year-old singer's debut album, and "Universal Struggle," his recent follow-up.
"Even before the song came out, we all knew it was going to be banned, because we named specific people" as responsible for the nation's problems, Anthony B., whose real name is Keith Anthony Blair, said in an interview here. "But an artist's role should be to take leadership for his people, to be at the front of his generation and his race, even if authority and the people promoting the music don't think so."
Sizzla, an even more recent and increasingly influential arrival, has tried to take a middle position, striking a balance between Luciano's spirituality and Anthony B.'s rebelliousness. Beenie Man, who started as rapid-fire and lewd as any rapper and still likes to sing in a heavy patois so as to maintain his roots credentials, specializes in humorous, cutting social commentary.
As a result of the change in mood here, the twin pillars of dancehall music -- Yellowman, who led the initial shift to lascivious lyrics, and Shabba Ranks, who became the movement's boastful hypermacho ambassador thanks to songs like "Wicked Inna Bed" -- are now clearly in eclipse. Other dancehall stars, like Buju Banton, whose anti-homosexual rant "Boom Bye Bye" became the genre's signature tune, have undergone a change of heart and style and are now embracing Rastafarian principles that regard dancehall's emphasis on sex and materialism as part of the "Babylon system."
To Dermot Hussey, one of Jamaica's most respected musicologists, dancehall has always been an aberration, a manifestation of yuppie self-indulgence akin to the disco craze in the United States. "The thing has its own esthetic, its own body language and dress, but it has not been creative," he said. "It's like a theater of the absurd, with a lot of fat women in expensive costumes baring all that skin, like Madame Pompadour."
The peculiar flavor of the dancehall scene was captured in "Dancehall Queen," a feature film about a humble Kingston street vendor who, like Cinderella, becomes the mysterious queen of the ball. The movie, recently released direct to video in the United States, is now the biggest box office attraction in Jamaican history. But a strong selling point for the film has been performance scenes featuring Anthony B. and Beenie Man, who have criticized dancehall's excesses and superficiality.
THE effort to transform and reinvigorate dancehall, however, focuses as much on melody and harmony as on lyrics and fashion. Musicians and listeners alike appear to have grown tired of the genre's increasingly stripped-down and minimalist sound, a product of dancehall's fascination with American hip-hop, which itself derives from the Jamaican tradition of disk jockeys declaiming over instrumental "dub" tracks.
"I was listening to something the other day, and I only heard a drum machine and a voice, so I said to myself, What is happening here?" complained Ernest Ranglin, the guitarist and arranger who is the founding father of modern Jamaican music. "It's a good beat, but that's all there is to it. It's like the dancehall artists don't want to make changes in the tune. It's all one chord, because they have cut out the piano and everything else."
The new breed, on the other hand, seeks a richer, fuller sound and is openly contemptuous of the limitations that commercial dancehall music imposes. Though just as fascinated with rhythm, they prefer the purer, more African sound of traditional Rastafarian nyabinghi drumming to the monotonous beat of drum machines, and they are not averse to adding orchestral ornamentation to a strong rhythmic foundation.
"Drums and bass are really only for dancing, for just playing with surface feelings and emotions," explained Anthony B. "I want to take you deeper into the music than just dancing, and I can only get at those deeper feelings through horns and strings and keyboards."
Lowell (Sly) Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, the drummer and bass player who have been Jamaica's premier rhythm section over the last 25 years, argue that the sparseness of the dancehall sound may ultimately prove its salvation and the only way to attract the American and British audiences that have embraced other types of Jamaican music. At the Mixing Lab, the studio that serves as their home base here, Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Shakespeare have lately been augmenting dancehall tracks with salsa touches; their latest record, "Friends," even includes a Latin-tinged dancehall interpretation of the Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction" with their old buddy Keith Richards on guitar .
"There's no set pattern to dancehall, except for the drum, and because it is so free-form, that allows you to go places," Mr. Dunbar said during a break from a studio session here. "This is a new music that just needs to develop, and as soon as a few more colors come in, there will be a new surge to the next stage."
By then, of course, dancehall may have a new name to go with the new image and social consciousness that the new wave seeks to cultivate. Just as mento gave way to ska, which evolved into rock steady, which became reggae, which gave birth to dancehall, there is a sense in Jamaica that something fresh and vital is once again taking root. That is the case even though American record companies have been slower to exploit the new sound than they were with reggae.
"Jamaican music is like a tree, and some branches are more fruitful than others," Luciano said. "Dancehall has to clean up and become more positive if we are going to be able to inspire and ignite people again and recapture that Bob Marley vibe. The sheep must return to the fold."

HEADLINE: Washington's Stake in the Arts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRENSON; Michael Brenson, a freelance art critic and curator, is preparing a study of the visual-artists' fellowships awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts.

 BODY:
THE National Endowment for the Arts has been described as embattled for so long that it now probably assumes this word is part of its name. Since 1989, when it financed exhibitions that included the infamous photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano defying conventional religious beliefs and sexual behavior, this agency has been hammered by politicians and pundits eager for a soapbox from which they can bemoan declining national values and inappropriate uses of Government money.
The N.E.A. has been relentlessly attacked by conservative critics who believe that financing a broad spectrum of American artistic activities, including crafts and art made within communities that do not feel welcome in art museums, is emblematic of the erosion of quality and ambition in an increasingly multicultural, relativistic America. If only the N.E.A. would disappear, many opponents believe, the free-market system would do its thing, the cream would rise to the top, and art would once again look like the paintings of Richard Diebenkorn and Claude Monet. 
 As Bill Ivey, nominated by the White House to be the next chairman of the N.E.A., awaits confirmation hearings, what the endowment has been and can be are once again urgent issues.
If the N.E.A. disappears, the pressure on the art world to see itself as part of a larger American picture will be sharply diminished, and the entire fabric of American art will be weakened.
The endowment is the only agency in the United States whose mandate is to build and maintain an arts infrastructure and to secure the place of the artist in society -- a society that before the agency was founded in 1965 was reluctant even to acknowledge that artists were real Americans. It is the only agency that has been concerned with the totality of American art, including difficult and experimental work that challenges mainstream thinking. In an American art world still largely identified with big institutions that can effortlessly slide into insularity and rampant self-interest, the endowment is the only agency whose existence argues for the importance of art to the creativity and dynamism of the nation.
Anyone who believes the endowment can be excised from the art world without seriously damaging American art should consider the repercussions of the radical changes within the agency in January 1996. After the Christian Right campaigned against the endowment and members of Congress promised to vote it out of existence, appropriations were cut from $162 million in 1995 to $99 million in 1996. Laying off roughly 45 percent of the staff meant that the endowment could no longer deal with the number of applications it had been receiving each year in disciplines like painting, sculpture, media arts and photography.
Individual artists' grants, which had been the source of much of the punitive wrath that threatened the agency's existence, were eliminated. The endowment now awards grants in only four general categories: heritage and preservation, creation and presentation, education and access, planning and stabilization.
THIS restructuring has had far-reaching ramifications. Once the endowment stopped giving grants to individuals, many small and large arts institutions stopped exhibiting any living artists who might make someone, somewhere, angry, and who were not widely acclaimed and collected.
After the endowment was publicly excoriated for having the temerity to award some of its money to art that addressed changing views of gender and race, many institutions lost the will to show any art that was rambunctious or edgy. When the agency was deprived of its ability to accumulate comprehensive information about entire disciplines -- for example, 5,000 applications in painting alone were received each year -- arts professionals became less willing to take responsibility for art as a field. The will to think big, to ask uncomfortable questions and to test informed and strongly held convictions is now largely absent.
The mission of the endowment was conveyed through the medium of public financing of the arts, with which the endowment remains largely synonymous. To what and whom it awarded grants, and the political reception of these grants, inevitably influenced how state agencies used their money and how these agencies were treated by local politicians. (As of January, 40 percent of the endowment's funds go to the states in block grants, as opposed to 20 percent between 1975 and 1990.)
Not only does the endowment now have much less money to give, but the very idea of public financing of the arts is now tainted by the microscopic scrutiny by Congress and the news media and by the specter of right-wing intimidation. When arts professionals who came of age after 1989 think of public support for the arts, they do not think of the endowment's 1965 mandate to "help create and sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination and inquiry, but also the material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent." For an entire generation, private sponsorship is the only option.
Private support cannot meet this mandate. The difference between private and public support was succinctly defined in a 1995 report to the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities by Alberta Arthurs, then director of the arts and humanities division of the Rockefeller Foundation. "Private foundations, corporate and family foundations," she wrote, "do their funding by guidelines and goals which are special to their interests and institutional purposes; they fund to advance their corporate ideas."
In contrast, Ms. Arthurs continued, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities (a more scholarly, academically oriented agency, also founded in 1965) "must support the whole, the diversity and debate of sectors, of ideas and talents, across the democracy. . . . They reach across disciplines; they mobilize and leverage other resources."
In "The Illusion of Private Giving," in The Washington Post last summer, Robert Storr, a widely respected curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, expressed his alarm at the current imbalance. "My work," he wrote, "has taught me to have no illusions about how inadequate private giving -- however generous and at whatever level -- is to the great demands confronting cultural institutions." After writing about the ferocious competition for funds in art museums and the increasing difficulty small and midsize institutions have raising private money, he concluded: "There are no substitutes for Government's contribution to cultural affairs . . . . The coalition of support that has helped the arts to thrive in America is dangerously out of kilter."
It is important to keep in mind that there is no model for private support in the United States that indicates that it, by itself, could meet the demands of this or any future artistic moment. Before the 1960's, when private patrons felt little or no pressure to consider the impact on art of public money, art was a significant but peripheral activity in the United States, and American art was almost entirely unknown abroad. The market system ignored exceptional artists earlier in the century, including many African- Americans, and it still gives little support to many exceptional artists, particularly those who prefer to work outside galleries and museums.
Furthermore, private support is unreliable. Corporate giving, which has been so crucial to the development of art institutions and blockbuster exhibitions, decreased between 1984 and 1994; its willingness to support difficult contemporary art can never be counted on.
To get a sense of the dangers of the current imbalance between public and private support, look at what has happened since January 1996. Arts organizations and museums have turned more to private foundations, many of which have been awarding large sums to programs that encourage arts institutions to engage audiences outside the familiar constituencies of these institutions. At the same time, museums have come to rely on corporations more than ever. Indeed, most big museums are so eager to attract and keep wealthy corporate board members that they are reluctant to do anything that might challenge corporate values and interests. So even as museums are becoming, in theory, more democratic, they are looking and acting more corporate.
What is now largely missing from the contemporary art programming of the Modern, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American art -- not to speak of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which collects contemporary art but wants no part of the engagement with contemporary life that is proof of a genuine commitment to it -- is respect for the courage and imagination of living artists and an awareness of the needs of the field, two defining aspects of the endowment's mission.
The widespread institutional fear of artists and of conflict, combined with the wish to please all present and future members and donors, helps explain why so many museums have come to seem like satellites of the entertainment industry, in which success is measured by popular appeal.
CLEARLY, private support, however visionary, cannot persuade museums to fight for ways of thinking that challenge their immediate social and economic interests, and it cannot persuade arts professionals to consider the art world as an ecosystem in which every part is connected.
Public support for the arts is also limited. While the new endowment structure is responsive to art that fell through the cracks before, like projects designed to develop art programs in schools, hospitals or community centers, the new categories only reward art that promises to realize some kind of quantifiable social or institutional good, thereby keeping the agency out of trouble. They do not allow it to support artists who want to explore technology, or their own psyches, or the relationship between the earth and the stars.
Just as important, the endowment cannot liberate itself from self-censorship. In 1990, Congress voted to allow the National Council for the Arts, the endowment's advisory committee -- whose members are political appointees -- for the first time to reject grants recommended by peer panels composed of experts. Last December, Congress voted to include six of its own members on the council; there were none before. Self-censorship now infects the peer-panel selection process and indeed the entire endowment system. It also infects the thinking of small and large arts organizations across the country. For the health of American art, this weight must be lifted.
No solution is possible without reinventing the very American partnership of private and public support for the arts that has been a model other countries have envied. It was indispensable to the flowering of American art in the 1960's and to the emergence of that art as a force on the international scene, communicating to the rest of the world that American culture had arrived. This model must not be dismantled.
THE endowment can continue to attend to infrastructure. It can convene panels in which arts professionals from many disciplines and corners of the country work together. With more money, it can be far more imaginative in the ways it approaches its broad and democratic mission. It must trust artists again, perhaps by commissioning individual and also teams of artists -- including controversial ones -- to tour the country and speak with audiences, town-meeting style, about their ideas of artists and art.
The endowment can work to bring together rich patrons, whose tastes and interests are so instrumental in defining private support, with arts professionals from other social classes who may have very different ideas about what art is and who it is for. All these interactions should be considered research and published. In these and so many other ways, the endowment could help define as well as support the manifold meanings and possibilities of art in this country.
The private sector could establish and endow a private agency that gives grants to individual artists, as well as to the kinds of adventurous and experimental projects the endowment is now so reluctant to support. This agency doesn't have to be on the East Coast; it could be based in Chicago, perhaps, or in Los Angeles or Houston. It could give grants in both individual disciplines and interdisciplinary categories. Like the endowment's system, the awards could be made by peer panels of 8 to 12 arts professionals from across the country, or it could invent another selection system. These public and private agencies would always be aware of what each is doing and join forces at crucial moments -- at international exhibitions, for example, when American artists need to feel that their country is behind them.
Now is the time for the private sector to act.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Updating the Residential Space at a Y.W.C.A.

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
IN Lillian Beckford's youth the residences that the Young Women's Christian Association ran in urban centers mainly provided temporary housing to young women living in unfamiliar surroundings after a relocation from out of town.
In time, they would move out, preferring more conventional housing to the Y's dormitory-like rooms, which had no individual cooking facilities or bathrooms. The residents used shared bathrooms and group kitchens down the hall. 
 Now 71, retired and living in a brownstone next to the Y.W.C.A of Brooklyn near Atlantic Center on the edge of Boerum Hill, Mrs. Beckford is hoping that the Y will resume that role once a major renovation, currently under way, is completed. One by one, the five residential floors at the top of the 11-story building are being renovated and the kitchens and bathrooms rebuilt, without any change in room sizes.
"If it's upgraded and more attractive, then women coming into the city would live there," said Mrs. Beckford, who has been active in the Y over the years, and retired from its Board of Trustees two years ago.
The work now under way is an unusual example of a moderate rehabilitation at an old single-room-occupancy Brooklyn building -- with small or even tiny rooms with neither kitchens nor baths -- done with private as well as public financing.
In recent years public financing has been almost the exclusive source of funds for modernizing single-room-occupancy buildings outside prime locations. When the financing doesn't come from the city's S.R.O. loan program, it comes from grants from the New York State Office for Mental Health or from the Federal tax-credit program, which allows the state to finance a limited number of low-income projects with tax-exempt bonds.
But the Y took a different course. First it tried for tax-exempt bond financing, but other projects were deemed to have a stronger claim on this limited resource. On the advice of its real estate consultant, Ronald Moelis, a principal in L. & M. Equities of Larchmont, N.Y., it sought participation financing through the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
In a participation loan, a private lender contributes part of the loan and New York City contributes the rest at a low interest rate. In the Y financing, the loan commitment is $4.4 million -- $1.3 million from Chase Bank and the rest, at 1 percent interest, from New York City. Chase Bank has become the largest private user of the participation loan program on behalf of nonprofit development organizations.
The Y is renovating 210 rooms, modernizing the kitchens and common bathrooms and improving all the basic building features. About 150 tenants are living through the process, moving to another floor while the floor-by-floor work proceeds. Their rent in upgraded rooms will rise gradually to the level that outsiders are to be charged, which will average $95 a week. The three sluggish elevators serving the residential floors will be overhauled.
"Basically, nothing had been done to the residential portion of the building since it was built in 1928," said Donna Ceravolo, executive director of the Brooklyn Y. "In 1989 the fitness floor was gutted and rebuilt, but other than that only the most basic maintenance has been done."
TYPICAL rooms are 8 by 10 feet with a sink and a closet, a pull chain for a single overhead light and one electric outlet. Renovation will bring new windows, new sinks with vanities, electrical outlets and optional air-conditioning. The existing common kitchens will be overhauled, but their dimensions will be unchanged. The architect is Leslie Feder of Manhattan.
For many tenants, Y living has become a comfortable longterm way of life. Some expected to be short-termers when they move in, but then stayed on amid what came to be their "family."
One example is Cora Holliday, a retired schoolteacher who has lived at the Y for more than 25 years. She came to New York in the 50's from Memphis and worked as a dietitian in a nurses' residence on Welfare Island, where she also lived. Later she took a teaching job, and found the Y as a residence through a New York City booklet on places for single women to live.
She retired in 1993 after teaching for 15 years at Junior High School 136 in Sunset Park, but she stays on at the Y. "You're never lonely here, and it's safe," she said. "And if you're sick, you have friends to take care of you. We're like one big family."
Sonia Grobman, 55, who works as a receptionist, moved into the Y two years ago when she was getting ready for a divorce, and stayed on. "I made a few friends, and I feel safer here than I did in an apartment, and I use the gym downstairs," she said. The building has a health club and swimming pool on the fourth floor.
Although tenants will have the benefit of an on-site housing manager, Yvette Williams, and her small staff, they will not have available the high level of social services that are budgeted within the government-subsidized S.R.O. renovations geared largely for a dependent population.
Loans under the city's S.R.O. loan program have produced about 5,000 units of upgraded housing for singles citywide. The program is financed at about $30 million a year.
Current or one-time Y's frequently have the type of residential space that can use these loans. And often it is the only type of financing available to them for building and housing improvements they direly need.
In Brooklyn, one Y.M.C.A. currently benefiting from an S.R.O. loan is on Ninth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in Park Slope, known as the Prospect Park Y. It has a $6.1 million loan for the rehabilitation of its four residential floors, where the 236 rooms are being rebuilt as 138 rooms for men and women. Every four rooms will share a bath, and some of the rooms will have kitchenettes. Each floor will have two large "lounge kitchenettes" for the tenants without kitchenettes. There will also be a rooftop dining hall serving cafeteria-style meals at a modest cost.
"The tenants will have an extra that many S.R.O.'s can't provide -- the use of a gym, pool and Nautilus room in the Y," said Adrian Tenhor, housing director at Lutheran Social Services, which is in charge of the rental program and will provide social services to tenants. The Y will continue to run its physical education and aquatic programs on the first two floors.
Monthly rents will range from $472 to $525, but the project received a $7 million Federal award under the Section 8 program. Low-income tenants will therefore have to pay only 30 percent of their income as rent, rather than the full "economic" rent. But about two-thirds of the tenants are expected to be able to afford the economic rent.
Lutheran Social Services will also operate Muhlenberg House, a renovation of the former Nevins Hotel at 510 Atlantic Avenue, currently in construction with a $9 million S.R.O. loan and $6 million in equity raised under the tax-credit program. The rehabilitation will produce 201 rooms in what was a seriously rundown 415-room hotel. Muhlenberg House will also have lounges and outdoor patios.
A THIRD current project in Brooklyn has been done with an $8 million grant from the New York State Office of Mental Health, and a supplemental $400,000 Federal grant, providing 150 rooms for a partially dependent population at what was long ago the Boerum Hill Y.W.C.A., at 50 Nevins Street. The Institute for Community Living, a Manhattan-based nonprofit operator, will run it as Stepping Stones, providing longterm housing for formerly homeless people with psychiatric problems.
In contrast to these three projects, the Y.W.C.A. of Brooklyn intends to look to the private market, rather than the city's pipeline of dependent or homeless households, for its new tenants. Most of these new tenants are nevertheless likely to be similar in income to those in the subsidized projects who are employed.
"We will advertise in the local papers and do special marketing to local colleges," Ms. Ceravolo said. "I think we will get a new crop of young women, but we'll continue to serve more mature women who are moving to New York."
The rules do not permit the women to have male visitors, however. "If we catch them, we get grumpy about it," Ms. Ceravolo said.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Confronting Social and Political Issues

BYLINE: By Helen A. Harrison 

 BODY:

Nils Norman/Christopher Whittey
Amelie A. Wallace Gallery, State University of New York College, Route 107, Old Westbury. Through April 30. 876-3056. 
 With this two-person installation, the recently reopened Wallace Gallery is continuing its tradition of presenting art that confronts social, economic and political issues.
Mr. Norman's drawings and scale models are proposals for grass-roots approaches to urban redevelopment, while Mr. Whittey's sculpture and graphics contrast utopian idealism with the realities of manual labor.
Neither artist bludgeons the viewer with overt propaganda, but both send messages that aim to counter mainstream notions.
Of the two, Mr. Whittey is the more complex in his examination of the disparity between theory and practice -- or perhaps the subtlety lies in his adaptation of Suprematist art as a vehicle for his critique.
Using Malevich's "White Square on White" as a template, Mr. Whittey ironically subverts the idealist vision of the artist as worker by studding an enlarged version of the painting with 16,000 plaster casts of his own fingers. The figure is not arbitrary; it is the number of digits lost in industrial accidents in the United States each year.
On the gallery walls, one set of diagrams illustrates how reconstructive surgery may restore function to damaged hands, while another reconstructs Malevich's esthetics. A set of ersatz safety warning signs amplifies Mr. Whittey's admonition, couched in manual-labor imagery but aimed equally at the art world, to play it safe.
Mr. Norman's schemes for kiosks and portable stalls are small monuments to community-based agitprop. His solar-powered "Eco/ Civil Disobedience Bookmobile," designed for Tompkins Square Park, would distribute literature on alternative survival strategies, and his LETS newsstand would serve as a clearinghouse for bartered goods and services.
Computer-generated plans and handsomely detailed models give the offbeat projects just the right aura of plausibility.
 
18th Annual Juried Photography Exhibition
Freeport Memorial Library, West Merrick Road and South Ocean Avenue, Freeport. Through April 29. 223-2522.
 Sponsored by the Long Island Arts Council, the show was selected by the noted photographer Harvey Stein. From 346 entries, Mr. Stein chose 45 images, many of exceptional quality.
One only wishes that the hanging space were less cramped, allowing each picture some breathing room. Notwithstanding its physical limitations, the show offers plenty of visual and conceptual scope.
The best-in-show award went to John Michaels for "Birch Velum," a textural montage incorporating, as its title implies, fragments of bark and suggestions of membrane.
More an all-over abstraction than a nature study, the modest black and white print makes imaginative use of photographic techniques to fuse reality and illusion.
In the black and white category, first place was taken by Jennifer McMillan for "Brooklyn Bridge," although not the one you would expect. It is in fact the Manhattan Bridge, which crosses to Brooklyn and, in this incarnation, looks as if it is literally on the move.
Its ominous silhouette seems to pulse with the shock waves of traffic -- vibrations that the camera has arrested, highlighting the mighty structure's disquieting flexibility.
Several other notable images are concerned with ambiguity, including Bill Stengel's "Cherub," a sensuously lighted portrait that looks alternately angelic and seductive, and Karen Dombrovski-Sobel's "Eve's Apple," an honorable mention winner, which has disturbingly anatomical overtones.
Another honorable mention, Kasmira Mohanty's "Metamorphosis," uses a six-print serial format to reveal and conceal an emerging figure.
Among the color entries, "Apples Nouveau," an elegant still life by Jeanne Lentz, manipulates the fruit's tonality to give it the sheen of burnished copper. Maria Moricca-Calvey took an honorable mention for "A Day at the Beach," an example of photography's power to isolate the extraordinary in the commonplace.
 
Dee Shapiro/Harriet Stanton
Great Neck Library, 159 Bayview Avenue, Great Neck. Through April 21. 466-8055.
 Best known as a "pattern painter" whose grid-based images of the 1970's resembled mosaics of high-key colors, Ms. Shapiro has abandoned nonillusionistic formalism for what she describes as "pictorial magic realism." The current selection features work from the last decade, including small oils on board that presaged her recent series of large canvases.
The small paintings, with strong intimations of Kandinsky filtered through Stuart Davis, retain the flat field and unmodeled forms of textbook modernism. This is not a put-down, for Ms. Shapiro handles these devices with authority, unifying a surprising array of disparate elements in each lively composition. Like Davis, she can inject humor into Cubist-inspired formalism, as in "Red Square With Change," alluding to geometry and the Moscow landmark, both of which she has fragmented.
Like Russia's, however, Ms. Shapiro's own change has come at the expense of unity. Her latest paintings introduce perspective, architectural elements and naturalistic motifs interspersed with geometric patterns and quotations of earlier work. "Screened Memories" crams them into a disjointed scrapbook of images. The effect is confusing. Whereas the illogic of the small works is playful and intriguing, here the flight of fancy is grounded by excess symbolic baggage and compositional overload.
Ms. Stanton has undergone an even more extreme shift in direction, from moody Abstract Expressionism to lyrical nature study. Although the show emphasizes landscapes and flower pieces, a few of the earlier canvases are also included, perhaps to illustrate that her artistic energy is undiminished.
The idea, alas, was not a good one. For all their gestural vigor, the abstractions look gloomy and earnest next to Ms. Stanton's light, airy pastels and monotypes. And in comparison to the earlier work's ambitious, even harsh, subjectivity, her recent efforts seem rather timid and safely pretty.

HEADLINE: Assisted Living: An Option On the Edge Of a Boom

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: BRIARCLIFF MANOR

 BODY:
BENJAMIN TYRA may no longer be the brash young fire captain he once was, but his take-charge attitude still serves him well. "I finally decided I needed a place to rest my weary bones," the 84-year-old Mr. Tyra said, reflecting on his recent move "away from the hustle and bustle and strains of the big city" to an assisted-living community here in northern Westchester.
In recent years, Mr. Tyra's dignity -- along with his stamina and health -- have suffered more than a few blows as even everyday tasks like hauling laundry to the basement of his Yonkers apartment or carting groceries from the supermarket tired him. Now the lanky octogenarian and his wife, Anna, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, relax by a marble fireplace, eat with peers in a full-service dining room and toss their clothing at the end of the day into a hamper to be washed, folded and returned to them the next day. 
 "Life could be better if we won the Lotto," Mr. Tyra said. "But next to that, this is pretty good."
As residents of Senior Quarters at Briarcliff Manor, the Tyras have tapped into the surging assisted-living housing market, which is finally arriving in Westchester. In many ways, the rush to capitalize on the county's graying population has turned into a free-for-all, as developers hustle to meet the needs of the frail elderly, a rapidly growing group, which is demanding more options than nursing homes.
"Until now, consumers have had few choices, but that's all changing," said Mel Gamzon, president of Senior Housing Investment Advisors, a national investment consulting concern based in Newton, Mass. "Not only is the assisted-living market big today, it's going to boom tomorrow."
But many developers have seen the New York market as daunting, which is why they have been busy building such housing in the rest of the United States but have only lately come to Westchester. The state has complex regulations governing housing for the elderly. Land prices in the county are steep, and many communities have no zoning for assisted-living units.
"Those were critical impediments, and as a result, the development community in Westchester is just waking up to the potential," Mr. Gamzon said. "Now there are a whole slew of assisted-living operators perusing options."
Despite the drawbacks, many developers are forging ahead. In this upscale Westchester community, for example, Kapson Senior Quarters, one of the largest owner-operators of assisted-living quarters in the state, has completed a 102-unit complex, Senior Quarters at Briarcliff Manor, with 16 units for people like Mrs. Tyra, who as victims of Alzheimer's disease need extended care.
"The zoning is tricky and the area expensive, but it's still worth it," said Evan Kaplan, president and chief operations officer for Kapson, based in Woodbury on Long Island, which has developed housing in many East Coast areas. Glenn Kaplan, Kapson's chief executive officer, said the company aims its marketing at the middle-aged children of its potential customers. Mr. and Mrs. Tyra's son helped them find their new home in Briarcliff, near where two other grown children and young grandchildren live.
Offspring often want their parents close by in a living arrangement that offers meals, housekeeping services, social activities, transportation and built-in health care, the chief executive officer said.
Sometimes a reverse migration takes place a decade or more after older couples retire to the South. In time, as they age and one or the other dies, the remaining spouse, often frail, is left alone. "At 85 years old, you're probably not playing too much golf or too much tennis, and your physical activities are limited, so therefore you might as well be home closer to the kids and closer to the family," Glenn Kaplan said. "Instead of traveling back and forth to care for the parent, the adult children decide to bring mom or dad back to a retirement community close by."
In Ossining, the publicly held Care Matrix Corporation of Needham, Mass., is completing the 122-unit Cambridge House-on-the-Hudson, Michael Zaccaro, executive vice president of operations, said. Sharing a model that many builders of elderly housing in New York have adopted, Care Matrix builds the rental units and offers a package of services -- like laundry and meals -- for its customers. But health care is offered separately by outside providers (in this case Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Tarrytown and the Dominican Sisters Family Health Service in Ossining), thus circumventing the labyrinth of confusing state regulations governing private developers of assisted-living quarters.
Care Matrix is also planning 168 assisted- living units in Rye Brook.
"The cost of land kept most of the larger players out of this marketplace, but we couldn't continue to ignore the demographics here," Mr. Zaccaro said. "Westchester is one of the most affluent, underserved markets in the United States."
The county's Planning Department reported that nearly 20 percent of Westchester's population is 60 or older. In 1990, there were 170,971 people 60 or older, an increase of 8 percent since 1980. The oldest residents, those 85 and older, continue to have the highest rate of growth -- "increasing the need for services and care for the most vulnerable members of our elderly population," a 1994 study by the county's Office for the Aging said. According to the 1990 United States Census, the 85 and older population numbered 14,200 in Westchester, up 36 percent since 1980.
Dr. Audrey S. Weiner, a senior vice president and the administrator at the nonprofit Sarah Neuman Nursing Home in Mamaroneck, said that by age 85, "many seniors are starting to lose their peer groups and their siblings and suffer from isolation." The nursing home, in conjunction with Westchester Jewish Community Services and the Jewish Home and Hospital, has formed Westchester Seniors Housing to expand services at Sarah Neuman, which is responding to the changing market and will include assisted living, adult day care and subacute care for rehabilitation after hospital stays, Dr. Weiner, a social worker, said. Two solariums and a pavilion have already been built in anticipation of accommodating assisted-living residents.
Another existing community for the elderly, the Osborn in Rye, is also planning to expand to meet the growing demand and offer what Mark R. Zwerger, chief executive officer, called "a continuum of care as people age" -- from independent living to assisted living and full nursing care. The 56-acre campus is undergoing a $100 million expansion, adding a four-story, 54-unit apartment building, 13 two-family houses and an 84-bed nursing home.
In White Plains, Marriott Senior Living Services, a division of Marriott International, the hotel giant, and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center are planning to build 180 rental units for seniors on the hospital's campus-like setting. The Marriott, based in Bethesda, Md., will provide housekeeping services, and the hospital will provide medical care and diagnostic services.
Connie Hildesley, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said the plan affords a less costly alternative to nursing home care, offers residents help with daily living and avoids the regimentation of medical settings. "The trend is to deinstitutionalize," she said.
Another hotel chain, Classic Residence by Hyatt, based in Chicago, had planned to convert the former Kraft building in White Plains to a community for the elderly but dropped its plans. Philip Anderson, a senior vice president for the company, said another project in New Rochelle has also not moved forward. Mr. Anderson would not say why those projects were canceled.
"We're being patient," he said. "Land's in short supply in Westchester, but we see it as potentially a very solid market." Classic Residence is developing a 300-unit assisted- living residence for the elderly in Yonkers near the Riverdale border.
Also in White Plains, a bankrupt hotel has been converted to an assisted-living residence called the Esplanade, which offers a package of services, including kosher meals.
But all of these assisted-living options come at a price. About the least expensive quarters for one person are $2,200 a month, and the most expensive are $4,000 or more a month -- for room, meals and services. If extended medical care is needed, that increases the monthly fee by about $500. The developers generally concede that assisted-living units are aimed at the middle and upper-middle class.
At the Osborn, where some units go for $4,000 a month, paying an entrance fee can reduce the monthly rate. Mr. Zwerger said the Osborn tapped various markets -- "some upscale."
Mae Carpenter, director of the county's Office for the Aging, said: "That's one of the concerns we have. There's very little interest in housing for the moderate-income senior, but considering land and construction costs, that could be a problem."
Ms. Carpenter said many elderly residents, for economic and other reasons, still prefer to remain in their homes or move in with their children. Many receive care in their homes, and the adult day-care industry is also growing to meet their needs.
For all the elderly at all economic levels, Ms. Carpenter said, a nursing home is "a last resort."
As Mildred Bohrer, a 90-year-old resident of Senior Quarters here, explained: "When you've outlived most of your doctors, you know that you're getting on. My children worried about my living alone, but that didn't mean I wasn't functional anymore and belonged in a nursing home. It shouldn't have to be an either-or proposition."

HEADLINE: Creative Women at Work in a Century Past

BYLINE: By ALBERTA EISEMAN 

 BODY:
A GALLERY of women greets the visitor to the Connecticut River Museum in Essex these days. The exhibition, "Extraordinary Yankees: Women of the Connecticut River Valley in the Arts and Literature," presents biographies of writers, painters, sculptors, musicians and actors, each with period photographs and samples of the subject's work.
"The show is the culmination of a three-part series on women," said Emily Stearns, the museum's curator, who was instrumental in creating the exhibitions. The first part, mounted in 1994, focused on social and political activists, while the 1996 show was devoted to women in business. "The current exhibit fills in the spectrum with a close look at women who have excelled in creative fields." 
 Ms. Stearns said the series was designed to show how the Connecticut River Valley defines a culture that transcends state boundaries.
"Through the lives of selected women in various fields," she said, "we have tried to demonstrate that a town like Springfield has a greater cultural and economic affinity to Hartford than it has to Boston, which is in the same state."
The earliest works in the exhibition are in a section entitled "The Needle" and they include a magnificently embroidered memorial quilt, crafted by Massachusetts resident Henrietta Lambie to express her grief at the loss of her children.
The section on the written word is the most plentiful and it shows women's creativity going public in the middle of the 19th century.
"Within the last 50 years more books have been written by women and about women than all that had been issued during the preceding five thousand years," wrote Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Godey's Lady's Book, during the 1850's.
"Not all are big names," Ms. Stearns admonished, as a visitor made a beeline for a photograph of a youthful Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896), writer, feminist, abolitionist and author of the epoch-making novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Stowe, a Hartford resident who helped support her large family with her writing, is said to have been greeted by President Lincoln in 1862 with the words: "So, you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war!"
The other big name writer in the exhibition is Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) of Amherst, Mass. For her, fame only came after death, in our own century. During her lifetime she was almost a recluse, writing poems inspired by what she could see from her window and by her own intelligence and sensitivity.
One of the first American women to succeed at a literary career was Lydia Sigourney (1797-1865), a poet known as the "Sweet Singer of Hartford." Today, she is best remembered for a street named after her, but in her time publishers competed for her poems, pious verse that often spoke of death and religious devotion. An illustrated copy of her "Poems for the Sea" is on display in a glass-enclosed case, along with a page from the manuscript of "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
A woman with the intriguing name of Wealthy Buckley Tiffany (1820-1890) was known as the poet laureate of Essex. Her verses, written to mark births, deaths and marriages as well public occasions, were printed in the local newspapers and still serve as an important record of the town's social history. The scrapbook in which she kept her work, illustrated with her own decoupage, is on exhibit.
A theme that emerges in several biographies is the conflict between work and family obligations. The musician Amy Marcy Cheney (1867-1944) of New Hampshire was forbidden by her husband, Dr. Henry Harris, from using his last name, and had to shift her emphasis from performing as a pianist to writing music. As Mrs. H. H. A. Beach she became one of the country's leading composers.
Although all well-bred girls were taught to draw, do watercolors and needlework, none was expected to earn her living as an artist during the 18th and the 19th century. A rare exception was Laurilla Smith (1789-1857), one of five Glastonbury sisters, each creative and headstrong for their day. Throughout her life, Smith taught drawing and watercolors, created her own work in a variety of media and kept a sketchbook of pen and ink drawings of her town, one of which is displayed in reproduction.
The forceful face of artist Mary Knollenberg (1904-1991) beckons the visitor, as do photographs of her figures sculptured in stone, marble and clay, and later cast in bronze. Working in her studio in Chester, the artist focused on the female body, working, she said, "over the whole stone so that all parts of the figure can eventually emerge at the same time." The most familiar face in this parade of gifted women is that of the actress Katharine Hepburn, who was born in Hartford in 1907. Hepburn is seen in a refreshingly unglamorous photograph -- bandana over her hair; wet, sandy pants -- as she attempts to repair damage done by a hurricane to her beloved summer home in Fenwick, a section of Old Saybrook.
Concurrent with "Extraordinary Yankees" is a small display of "Extraordinary Miniatures" featuring a recent gift to the museum -- a scale model of a ship captain's home authentic in all details. Exhibited for the first time, the Federal period house with its three chimneys, leaded fanlight and lion-head door knocker was crafted by Robert Lyon, a former Essex resident whose family still lives in town.
As for the main exhibition, Ms. Stearns and the museum's new director, David T. Guernsey Jr. are making plans to take it on the road.
"By this fall, we hope to have all three parts of the series prepared and available to historical societies, high schools and colleges throughout the valley area," said Mr. Guernsey, who recently took the helm of the museum. "We are also thinking of publishing a short book on the biographies of these women, so the information and the themes we have gathered will not be lost."
"Extraordinary Yankees" will remain at the Connecticut River Museum, 67 Main Street, Essex, until May 3. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $4, $2 for children.

Airlines Scramble To Add Flights to Japan

 BODY:
Despite the economic softening in Japan, United States airlines have been quick to jockey for permission to fly there more frequently and on new routes since the Jan. 30 signing of an airline agreement between the United States and Japan ending most restrictions on travel between the two countries.
 American, Continental and Delta, which had been restricted to 46 round trips a week, were granted up to 90 additional weekly trips under the accord, and they wasted little time asking the Department of Transportation to approve new routes and new frequencies.
 
 American will begin daily nonstop service between Chicago and Tokyo on May 1. It has also received approval for daily nonstops between Tokyo and New York, Tokyo and Boston, and Dallas-Fort Worth and Osaka. Service on all three of those routes is expected to begin no later than Nov. 1.
 Continental has received approval to fly a total of seven round trips a week between Tokyo and both Newark and Houston, and expects to begin flying from Newark in November and from Houston in December.
 Delta has received approval for daily nonstops between Atlanta and Tokyo, which will start June 3; for daily nonstops between Portland, Ore., and Osaka, which will start Oct. 28, and between Portland and Fukuoka, beginning Oct. 29. It received approval to increase the number of its Los Angeles-Tokyo flights to seven a week from six, and will begin that service by this summer.
Hawaiian Airlines has received approval to fly daily nonstops in the year 2000 between Kahului, Maui and Tokyo, a route not served by a scheduled carrier.
 United, which like Northwest was given automatic authority to fly additional routes or frequencies, will start new daily nonstop flights between Chicago and Osaka in July.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Harlem;
Around 125th Street, New Interest and Optimism

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
IF your mother had a fur coat, the chances are that it spent its summers in Harlem. The brick building at Amsterdam Avenue and 126th Street was a fur-storage center for almost 50 years, with armored trucks carrying the coats from retailers across the city for storage during warm weather months.
Unoccupied for the last decade, the building, built as a brewery in the middle of the last century when the area was home to a large population of German immigrants, is being offered for conversion to loft office space, movie studios, or another use that can take advantage of the high ceilings and sturdy floors of the old factory. 
 The developer, Scott Metzner of the Janus Property Company, is clearly hoping to participate in what he sees as the remarkable resurgence of Harlem, which is being stoked by Federal, state and city financial incentives and by rising rents in other once-industrial parts of the city.
"This neighborhood has the feel of SoHo and TriBeCa before they changed," Mr. Metzner said. "It has an industrial feel and it is low-rise, so there is plenty of light and air."
Mr. Metzner's project comes at a time when the area centered on 125th Street is drawing more commercial attention than any time in recent years. The Fairway supermarket under the Henry Hudson Parkway is crowded on weekday midafternoons and a 60,000-square-foot Pathmark supermarket is being built on the East Side at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue.
Recently, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced plans to redevelop the long abandoned Washburn Wire factory on the west side of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive into a three-block retail complex from 116th Street to 119th Street that will be anchored by Home Depot and Costco stores. State economic development officials said they expected construction to begin early next year.
After years of delays, Drew Greenwald of Grid Properties said he was weeks away from putting a shovel in the ground for Harlem USA, a 290,000-square-foot retail-entertainment complex that is to include a nine-screen, 2,700-seat Cineplex Odeon movie complex, HMV Records, Disney and Gap stores and a Chase bank branch.
Other retail tenants are coming, as well, Mr. Greenwald reports. "They are not ready to announce until we actually break ground, but we are 75 percent leased at this point," he said.
He said national retailers had begun to recognize that Harlem is a densely populated, relatively underserved part of the city. "This has been a neglected portion of the American population," he said. "Retailers are realizing they can sell more products if they are located there, and banks know that there are deposits there and loans to be made."
MR. GREENWALD said he had been involved since 1992 in the Harlem USA project, which will occupy most of the block on the south side of 125th Street between St. Nicholas Avenue and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. He said he anticipated beginning excavation by May 1, with the complex scheduled to open in time for the Christmas 1999 shopping season.
The decisions by Disney and AMC to participate in the Harlem USA project are making subsequent development in the area easier, real estate executives say. Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty Services, which is marketing the old fur-storage building at 1361 Amsterdam Avenue, said the nearby Harlem USA project helped educate corporate decision makers to the potential of the Harlem market.
"Northern Manhattan has a huge population," he said, and commercial rentals "are very favorable compared to other parts of the city." He said there was virtually no retail space available on 125th Street, one of the major east-west arteries of the city.
"The vacancy rate on the ground floor is two to three percent," said Barbara Askins, executive director of the 125th Street Business Improvement District, which provides cleaning and security services and adds amenities to aid businesses on the street. She said the discovery of the area by national retailers such as Rite Aid, Duane Reade and Blockbuster had stimulated interest in the upper floors of buildings on 125th Street, which she said had been vacant or underdeveloped for a long time. However, some existing merchants have complained that the arrival of national chains is driving rents to levels that strictly local businesses cannot sustain.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, compared what is happening on 125th Street to the transformation of 42d Street, which is changing from a sleazy, depressing neighborhood to a glittering office, entertainment and retail area.
"We committed $100 million to the empowerment zone," he said, referring to the state funds that were added to the Federal and state incentives already available to businesses in the zone, which extends from 116th to 132d Street. "We made public money available and we are beginning to see the results," Mr. Gargano said. "The developers appear to watch what we do and then follow us with their own projects."
Mr. Fox estimated that the combined Federal, state and city incentives could be worth as much as $6 a square foot initially, in an area of town where annual rents for industrial properties range in the mid-teens. The incentives include a Federal credit of as much as $3,000 for each employee who is a resident of the empowerment zone, $1,500 from the state per employee and $1,000 from the city for corporations who relocate above 96th Street or to boroughs other than Manhattan.
Among the major developers arriving in the area are Bruce Ratner of Forest City Ratner companies, who is undertaking a entertainment and retail project on 125th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Malcolm X Boulevards in conjunction with the Abyssinian Development Corporation, an affiliate of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. Mr. Ratner, who built the Metrotech office center in downtown Brooklyn, is a major player on 42d Street with a development on the south side of the street that will include a huge movie complex and Madame Tussaud's wax museum.
ALSO getting involved on 125th Street is Jerry I. Speyer, the president of Tishman-Speyer Properties, who is proposing a 500,000-square-foot retail-entertainment complex that would anchor the eastern end of 125th Street between Second and Third Avenues. Tishman-Speyer partially owns and manages Rockefeller Center and won the bidding to control the Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan.
Brokers familiar with the area said that now that various government programs have helped restore much of the housing stock in the Harlem area, commercial development is less of a risk than it is in other areas of the city.
"Metrotech was more of a risk than this area because downtown Brooklyn does not have the resident population you have here," said William M. Shanahan, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield. Mr. Shanahan, who is attempting to sell a building at 55 West 125th Street, said the Harlem area was a "Cinderella story" about how to rehabilitate a neglected part of the city with a combination of public and private investment.
In addition to the big names, there is a multiplicity of small names opening business in the Harlem area, people familiar with the neighborhood say.
"The big story in Harlem is that on almost every block small businesses are opening up," said Mr. Greenwald. He said the large number of immigrants coming to the area was adding energy to the commercial sector.
Mr. Metzner, whose building is under consideration for landmark status, said that whoever occupies it would add to the economic health of upper Manhattan by hiring local residents because of the incentives. He said the facade and roof of the structure had been stabilized after years of no maintenance, but that further work would need to be done once a deal has been consummated and the tenant's needs were known.
He said no zoning issues stood in the way of development of the building. "We are as-of-right," he said. "We can build almost anything anyone wants." He said his structure would be called the Mink Building, in a reference to its history as a fur storage vault.
Mr. Fox said the other developments in Harlem were providing a level of comfort for corporate executives who might have been reluctant to base operations in the area in the past, and the low rentals should be a lure. "Corporations are looking at Harlem in economic terms these days, not in racial terms," he said.

HEADLINE: Vacation Home Sales: Water Adds Heat

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
THE house on Shore Road in the Cape Cod community of Chatham, Mass., wasn't selling at $500,000. Rather than fix it up, the owner tore it down and is building something new. "He feels there's a better market at $1 million for a new house," said Marie Connolly, owner of Connolly Real Estate in Chatham.
Driving by the new-house-in-progress, Ms. Connolly agreed with his assessment. "It needed work," she said. "Somebody who could afford $500,000 would go to another part of town and buy a better house."
It may be shaping up as another record year for vacation-home sales in beach communities in the Northeast, but even in this sellers' market, buyers are looking for the most for their money, Ms. Connolly said. "Buyers are very intelligent and very market savvy," she said. "They're looking at everything."
At many destinations -- particularly near the ocean -- they may not have much to look at. In the third year of strong sales for vacation properties, with a strong economy, a soaring stock market and low interest rates, inventory is diminishing or has vanished completely.
"We are back to the early 80's," Ms. Connolly said.
Not only back, but in many areas -- particularly those with the cachet of old money, trendiness or close proximity to the water -- beyond. Brokers selling in beach communities said that record prices were being paid for waterfront properties and that in many instances sales this year were outpacing record totals for 1997.
"Our sales market has gone through the ceiling," said Timothy G. Davis, a principal with Allan M. Schneider Associates on the East End of Long Island, which had over $200 million in sales in 1997.
For many other companies the story was the same. But the impact of the sales differs from area to area. While prices of luxury properties have soared, houses in the more moderate price ranges are holding steady or increasing at a more reasonable rate, brokers say. Buyers leaning toward a country home or mountain property may even find that prices have not fully recovered from the dip in the early 1990's.
Unless the homes are on water. Whether the body of water is the Atlantic Ocean, an Adirondack lake or the Hudson River, a close proximity to water is going to increase price.
Perhaps nowhere is the strength of the waterside market so dramatic as in the rarefied heights of waterfront homes in the Hamptons. So in demand are oceanfront estates that one owner is asking a breathtaking $19.5 million. For that a buyer can have a 13,600-square-foot contemporary home on Further Lane in East Hampton with 288 feet of Atlantic Ocean frontage included in its 11 acres.
"Is it wishful thinking?" said Frank Newbold, head of the Sotheby's International Realty office in East Hampton. "No it's not. It's got to the point of literally knocking on doors on the ocean and in the estate area. We'll have a customer who says, 'I want to be on this particular street, and price isn't a problem if you find me the right house.' "
Not all buyers, of course, can afford such insouciant attitudes toward price. For many would-be buyers, increases in the market have been intimidating.
"A lot of buyers are coming to me saying the market is too high and a lot of people don't want to buy right now," said Susan Davis, a real estate broker with Pat Schultz Associates in Provincetown, Mass.
But others are willing to take their chances.
Jack Fallon, who recently reached agreement to buy a house in Osterville, Mass., for about twice the price of his home in neighboring Cotuit, is moving into one of Cape Cod's most exclusive areas, where inventory is low and record prices are being paid for prime properties.
Mr. Fallon, who moved to the Cape after retiring from the chairmanship of an electronics business in Boston five years ago, had been looking for two years. He had watched as prices rose and inventory tightened. Still, he said, he wasn't worried about making a mistake in price because he felt he had been well informed about the market.
"We feel in the worst instance prices will stabilize or perhaps decrease, but not like eight or nine years ago," he said.
Paul E. Grover, a broker and partner in Kinlin Grover Properties in Osterville, said that while record prices were being paid for waterfront homes and demand was high in Osterville, it was possible to get more for your money in nearby areas.
IN Centerville, just minutes away from the village of Osterville, a two-bedroom bungalow with 900 square feet just a block from Craigville beach is listed for $135,000. In West Hyannisport on an inlet of Nantucket Sound, a quaint Cape Cod beach house with views of the water is $299,000.
Buyers willing to go north of Route 28, where there are more year-round houses, can do even better since prices there have not completely recovered from the softening of the market earlier this decade.
In New Jersey, brokers in shore communities are also finding prices rising with increased demand. "One of the things I've been saying is, 'How do you spend $180,000 for a $170,000 house? -- just wait 30 days,' " said Jack Waters, regional vice president for Weichert Real Estate for Ocean and Monmouth County. "That's how prices are moving, and that's in all markets, not just our beach markets."
Aside from water, another factor that will boost the price tag is being close to a charming (or trendy) village.
Melanie Ross, president of Cook Pony Farm Real Estate on Long Island, used the example of a village home in East Hampton that was on the market this year at $350,000. The house, which did not have a lot of extras, was expected to sell in the $340,000 range.
"It sold in about two weeks for $15,000 over the asking price," she said, attributing the increase to location and lack of inventory.
While there are still some houses around East Hampton and Southampton for sale under $200,000, those prices are generally closer to what is being paid for land alone.
"There's a lot of building in the potato fields," Ms. Ross said.
Location and lot size are the biggest factors determining the price of new construction, said Bob Immacolato, owner of Twin Pines Realty in Wainscott. For from $300,000 to $500,000, buyers can get a new home north of Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton, Sagaponack and Wainscott, he said. The bulk of the $300,000 homes, which would have three bedrooms, two baths and a pool, would be in Wainscott on a half acre, he said. The same house in Bridgehampton or Sagaponack would be on an acre or more and start at $400,000.
"Land is the fueling factor," Mr. Immacolato said. "Once you cross the highway to the south the same thing works."
He said that a year ago a lot south of the highway on an acre or more would have cost in the low $300,000 range -- in Hamptons real-estate shorthand, "the low threes." "Now you've got to be thinking five and up," he said.
While sales are strong across the board on the East End of Long Island, which includes East Hampton, Southampton, Amagansett, Bridgehampton, Sagaponack, Wainscott and Water Mill, other ocean enclaves are finding that some price ranges are hotter than others.
In Bar Harbor, Me., Kim Bennett-Swan, a broker with the Swan Agency, said the market was strongest in the mid-$200,000's and at the high end. "I just listed a house at $895,000," she said. "There have been more showings on that, probably five times more, than on something at $350,000."
Kathy Burton, a broker with American Real Estate on Martha's Vineyard, said she was seeing the same thing. "The high $300,000's are not moving as swiftly as anything that comes on the market under $200,000 or just over, unless there's an issue with the location," Ms. Burton said. "The rare and unusual waterfront properties are selling immediately."
While she said inventory was the lowest she had seen in the last five years, there are still a variety of properties available. "You can actually get something for $150,000, but not a heck of a lot," she said.
Among her listings are a two-bedroom condominium near Oak Bluffs at $113,000 with access to tennis, clubhouse and fresh-water pond. At $169,000 there's a Vineyard cottage near Lagoon Pond outside Oak Bluffs. In the $200,000's there's new home with four bedrooms and two baths a short drive from South Beach and Edgartown Village. The mid-range is a mix of new construction, older farm houses and traditional Capes.
At $1.75 million there's a recently renovated 1929 Georgian-style house with attached guest wing. The secluded property in Edgartown has views of Nantucket Sound and is "a minute away" from the harbor and shops. At $3.5 million there's a seven-bedroom house on the water with views of Katama Bay, a three-bedroom guesthouse, a boat house and deep water pier.
Ms. Burton said that there was a lot of speculative building on the Vineyard, and "much of what you'd see is things of that variety."
ON neighboring Nantucket, inventory is extraordinarily low, with only about 300 homes for sale out of a housing stock of 8,400, said Penny Dey, a vice president and broker with Congdon & Coleman Real Estate. Although there is something available in every price range, prices are up, she said, noting that the average sale so far this year was $571,000, compared with $475,000 last year and $230,000 in 1992. To some extent those numbers are skewed, she said, by the high number of sales over $1 million.
"What's driving this market is waterfront -- stable, non-eroding waterfront," Ms. Dey said, adding that a record $7.85 million was paid last year for a turn-of-the-century waterfront home on just over an acre. "Basically we've got this chasm between average sales and extraordinarily expensive sales," she said.
The number of sales over $1 million never exceeded 20 in a year until 1996, she said, when 29 properties were sold above that price, representing 24 percent of the dollar amount in sales that year. In 1997, 52 properties were sold for over $1 million.
A small two-bedroom cottage in Nantucket town on a small lot would have sold for $120,000 in 1990, Ms. Dey said; the same house today would go for about $189,000.
However, she said, the biggest change in the market -- a trend reported in several areas -- is that people are increasingly buying property just for the land and removing or demolishing the house. That was just done recently, she said, with a 12-year-old house overlooking Nantucket's inner harbor that sold for $1.6 million.
The market is a bit more settled in Chatham, a quaint village in the elbow of Cape Cod. Ms. Connolly described inventory as "healthy," with prices starting at $94,000 for a two-bedroom saltbox with access to Oyster Pond, and going up to $1.65 million for a stately four-bedroom home overlooking Chatham Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean.
"Right now prices are not escalating," she said. "What we're seeing is the customer buyer base starting to build up."
Overall, it appears that prices on the Cape are going up. According to the Cape Cod and Islands Board of Realtors, the average residential sales price in the first two months of 1998 was $219,000, with 515 sales. In January and February of 1997 the average sales price was $171,000, with 454 houses sold. Also, there are fewer listings -- 2,879 this year compared to 3,267 at this time last year.
Shoppers looking for a home in the country or mountains will fare better when it comes to price, brokers say, and buyers not tied to a particular location have a better chance of controlling the price they pay.
 "I think we have a better value and better supply than we've had in the last four or five years," said Marilyn Spaulding of the Woodstock Corporation in Vermont. "In the early 90's prices were still way up. People were dreaming. People are now much more realistic about price and ready to sell." Around the picturesque village of Woodstock, prices for three- to five-bedroom homes range from $250,000 to $400,000, she said.
Jim Insinga, owner of North Country Property Management in Rutland, Vt., said sales around the Killington ski area had been flat in recent years but were beginning to pick up. Two- and three-bedroom condominiums that would have sold for $130,000 to $160,000 in the 1980's are now selling for between $90,000 and $120,000.
In the rolling hills of Columbia County two hours north of Manhattan, a visitor need look only as far as Main Street in Hudson to gauge the market. "In the last five or six years, about 60 antique shops have opened, and there are now eight cappuccino machines in town," said Stephen Kingsley, president of Hudson Michael Realty.
Even before Wall Street started reaching new highs, New Yorkers in search of second homes were picking up bargains in Columbia County. Although prices are much higher than they once were in this former whaling community, which boasts a rich array of antique homes, "you can still buy what would be a palace in New York for $150,000," Mr. Kingsley said. He estimated that prices in Hudson had gone up 30 percent in the last two or three years.
Out in the countryside stretching toward the Catskill Mountains, a small house with an acre or two of land will start at about $100,000. For that price, a neighbor will probably be visible. With more land and privacy, the figure moves up to about $200,000 to $300,000.
Houses along the Hudson River or property with views command higher prices, Mr. Kingsley said. For example, an early 1700's shingle house on 10 acres in Germantown right on the river is listed at $695,000. Along with the house come a guest house and a studio above the barn.
In contrast, a Victorian farmhouse on eight acres on Wire Road in Livingston, N.Y., Columbia County is on the market at $100,000. For $375,000 there's an 1860's colonial on 30 acres in Germantown with a small pond and red barn. The top of the market is a $3.75 million turn-of-the-century Stanford White creation on 85 acres of an old Astor estate in northern Dutchess County near Rhinebeck.
The market in Columbia County peaked in 1987 and 1988, Mr. Kingsley said. After that, prices dropped 30 to 40 percent until sales began picking up two years ago. "The year of the Gulf War nobody bought a house in the county," he said.
While speculative building has not taken off in the area, Ancram in Columbia County is the site of a development called Long Lake, a 220-acre recreational community at the foot of the Berkshire Mountains. The developer, Samson Management, has started work on the first phase of the project, which will include 68 homes ranging in size from 1,800 to nearly 2,300 square feet. Prices are to start at $250,000.
The company is seeking to capitalize on the town's location near Berkshire County, just across the state line, and nearby Litchfield County.
BOTH Great Barrington and Litchfield are County seeing strong sales. "We all said it will be hard to top last year, but we're doing it again," said Carolyn Klemm, a sales representative in the luxury division of Klemm Real Estate in Litchfield County, Conn.
While Litchfield County has its share of luxury listings -- which have recently included a stone castle built in the 1920's on 300 acres listed at $8.5 million -- the market has also been sprinkled with a wide variety of homes, including a four-bedroom colonial with pool on 11 acres for $349,000; a lakefront two-bedroom home with dock for $495,000; a large colonial on 125 acres with pool and "killer views" for $995,000, and a 1920's fully furnished estate for $2.75 million.
"The market is great," said Mary Mawn White, president of Barnbrook Realty Corporation in Great Barrington. "We have buyers in all price ranges, and the demand is higher than the supply."
While houses are available in the mid-$100,000's, Ms. White said that realistically a home with three bedrooms and no view would cost $250,000 to $300,000. Properties with views and a fronting on a lake are "almost nonexistent," she said.
While the current market in the Northeast is being likened to the heady days of the 1980's, brokers say, there are some differences. Much of the buying then was done on borrowed or leveraged money. Properties were being purchased and then resold after a few years.
Today buyers are often coming in and paying significant amounts -- 50 to 100 percent of the price -- in cash. They are treating the homes more as an investment in the future and spending longer periods of time there as telecommuting makes doing so possible.
Brokers agreed that the Wall Street boom and the strong economy, along with record low interest rates, were fueling the current market. "People are just confident in general," said Ms. Ross of Cook Pony Farm.

A Cool, Clear Vision From a Distant Land

BYLINE: By BARRY SCHWABSKY 

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE

 BODY:
LOUISA MATTHIASDOTTIR'S paintings include still lifes, landscapes, animal studies and portraits, but amid all these traditional motifs, there is another recurrent, underlying theme to her work: the color blue. Just as it sometimes seems as if the secret goal of the painters of the Venetian Renaissance was to put the appropriate admixture of red in their paintings, so as to lend each one the pulsating warmth of circulating blood, Ms. Matthiasdottir seems inclined to endow everything she paints with the cool, refreshing clarity of a cloudless sky.
More than anything else, that ever-present tincture of bluish atmosphere separates Ms. Matthiasdottir's mature work from what came before. Among the pictures on view in her retrospective at the Rider University Gallery, the leap can be located somewhere in the years separating "Temma" (1962-63) from "Self-Portrait With Umbrella" (1966). Not that blue is literally absent from her earlier work, of course; it's there, for example, in one of the child's toys in "Matti (Child Playing)," from 1937, or as the spine of a book in "Matthias Einarsson Reading," circa 1946. Yet with the benefit of hindsight, it may not be insignificant that in those cases, the color embodies the toy not played with, the book not being read. It's as if the artist had already recognized in this color a resource she did not yet know how to handle. 
 What is missing from these early works is precisely this cerulean atmosphere that unifies her later canvases. Otherwise, the elements of her style were pretty much in place 60 years ago, especially the deliberateness of her formal construction, her careful pressing into place of the blunt, sometimes almost awkwardly blocky shapes into which she has codified her quotidian subjects. Ms. Matthiasdottir lays her paint down in a get-the-job-done kind of way. The bristles left stuck to the surfaces of many of these paintings suggest that those broad zones of color were hardly brushed in with dainty, delicate strokes. There's no obvious fiddling with contours, yet their placement feels well-weighed.
Sometimes the reign of blue occurs quite subtly, as in a 1983 "Still Life With Ketchup Bottle,"' in which the hue is mostly displaced into some casually placed shadows yet still manages to inflect the whole painting, so that the slightly odd tone of the red bottle and a red dish can be understood only as if their color were being viewed through a blue filter.
But more often, Ms. Matthiasdottir's blues dominate her paintings overtly, as in her 1982 "Self-Portrait" or a small 1995 "Still Life" and despite a wealth of brilliantly contrasting color notes. But why is blue the keynote to her palette? It's a painting like "Reykjavik Harbor" (1991) that really explains it, although I might not have realized it without having seen the place. (Ms. Matthiasdottir was born in Reykjavik in 1917. She studied in Denmark and Paris before settling in 1943 in New York, where she continued her studies under Hans Hoffmann. But she still spends a good deal of time in her home town, as many of these paintings attest.)
Visiting Reykjavik last year, I happened to take with me a copy of "Independent People," the great novel by Halldor Laxness, Iceland's 1955 Nobel Prize-winning author. The book's cover featured a reproduction of one of Ms. Matthiasdottir's landscapes. From almost the moment I stepped off the plane, I realized that much of what I had taken for the painter's stylistic mannerism -- notably her way of transmuting spatial recession into horizontal color strata, somehow without losing a sense of real spaciousness -- was straightforward reporting of what Iceland looks like: there is no sky so clear and all-permeating as Iceland's, no place where distant vistas seem to loom so near.
THE people in Ms. Matthiasdottir's figure paintings always stand separate, and even the objects in her still lifes most often keep their distance from each other. Except where portraiture is the point, faces are only vaguely sketched: expression is not an issue. Yet these are not allegories of estrangement, as some critics have seen Alex Katz's paintings to be. These people and things are separated from one another and from their viewers, but what separates them -- this cool, luminous atmosphere -- also joins them. The distance always feels just right, at least for these taut, solid paintings, this tough-minded sensibility.
The English title of Laxness's epic is a translation of the Icelandic title, "Sjalfstaett Folk." As the writer Brad Leithauser (who has almost singlehandedly been responsible for reviving interest in the book in English) points out, the expression literally means "self-standing folk." It's a phrase hard not to remember when looking at the austere, bolt-upright figure who presides over the four wonderful self-portraits (a fifth, in pastel, is weaker and could have been left out), in which Matthiasdottir's resistance to psychology itself becomes a psychological motif. An unreconstructed insistence on empirical reality over emotional drama dominates these paintings, in which an unspoken love of home nevertheless surrounds things with crisp northern air.

Chasing Michael, or, How to Corner a Corporate Nemesis

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:
HE'S back.
Michael Moore ambled irrevocably onto the scene with his 1989 documentary "Roger and Me," which chronicled his often comic effort to ask Roger Smith, then chairman of General Motors, why he was laying off so many people. 
 Now he has a new movie, "The Big One," in which he tries to ask various chief executives the same thing. So it seemed high time to shove a microphone -- a notepad, at any rate -- at Mr. Moore himself.
For a while, this quest was shaping up almost as "Michael and Me." Mr. Moore gives the sense of someone who moves his jovial bulk casually through life, a man you call up and, 10 minutes later, meet for a beer.
But over several days, with Mr. Moore in the midst of a not-at-all-casual blitz of promoting the movie, calls poured in from no fewer than five people -- some in public relations, some with Miramax, the film's distributor. Yes, there should be some time on Monday. At 1 P.M., in midtown Manhattan. No, make that 1:30. No, at Miramax's office, downtown, at 3:15. No, still 3:15, but at Mr. Moore's office across from Carnegie Hall. Whew!
An assistant opened the door to a warren of small rooms, the hallways stacked high with file boxes. Michael Moore Central. Four or five people bustled about, one making travel reservations, another keeping tabs on Mr. Moore's site on the World Wide Web (www.michaelmoore.com).
What to expect? Half the new movie is Mr. Moore as (quite funny) stand-up comedian, the other half Mr. Moore as shining crusader.
In person, he was as imposing as on film, a great mass of denim-shirted man hunched over his computer, his back to the door. After finishing his work, he plopped down on an overstuffed couch, put his feet up and burst out, "I was kidding about O.J.!" (In his book "Downsize This!," published by Random House, he has a tongue-in-cheek chapter titled "O.J. Is Innocent.")
So it was to be Mr. Moore the comedian? Not at all. To the suggestion that with all the comedy, "The Big One" is less political than "Roger and Me," he responded seriously and emphatically: "No, it's more political. The outrage is stronger. But I'm a film maker, not a political activist. We are all citizens in a democracy. That alone implies we are all political activists. Plus there's nothing wrong with giving people who work hard all week 90 minutes of a good cathartic laugh at the expense of the powers that be."
And his message is clear: "It's no longer about just making a profit. Corporate America is now running on pure greed. This whole economic recovery is financed on the backs of overworked and underpaid people."
In his films, his book, and his series "TV Nation," he has hammered away at the economy's inequities -- the rich getting richer, the rest clawing along on two or three jobs. Does he believe that some new economic cycle is brewing, in which workers will assert their rights to a bigger slice of the American pie?
"Yes, I do," he said firmly. "That's why I ended the movie with the kids at the Borders bookstore in Des Moines organizing a union -- to end on an optimistic note." Soon, across the nation, "you'll see a rise in unions," he said.
Surely things are not as bad as in his hometown of Flint, Mich., in the 1930's, when it was the site of a pivotal auto strike. For workers to rebel, he conceded, "things have to get pretty bad."
But he quickly added: "For some people, it doesn't have to get too much worse. Unions were born when people had to work 60 or 70 hours a week. But today, a lot of people are working two jobs." Unions, he added, also were born in reaction to child labor. "But in the Midwest, I see 14-year-olds working at McDonald's, not so they can buy Nikes but because they need to help pay their family bills."
At a Borders store in Philadelphia, Mr. Moore had come across striking workers and asked them to speak out at a book signing. Mr. Moore says Borders later banned him from its stores, while Borders says that only one event was changed, because of overcrowding and a fire hazard.
"After finishing the movie, I talked to the head of Borders Inc. and told him: 'The workers didn't need a union organizer. You've organized the union by doing things like withholding money from their paychecks for an H.M.O. that had no doctor in their city.
"It is short-range thinking to downsize, to make one person do the job of two," he went on, growing animated. "If you wear your workers down, they get sick more often, and because you've shoved them into these worthless H.M.O.'s, they don't really get help."
To Mr. Moore, the "old days" loom large. "My dad used to work from 6 A.M. till 2" at G.M., he said. "He'd be home by 2:30, before we were even home from school." It was clear that he treasured this memory. "Workers were encouraged to make suggestions on making cars better," Mr. Moore continued. "These days, if you're suddenly forced to do the jobs of two people, the creative part of your mind turns off. What does that do to society? Great inventions come from those moments of 'Aha!' And often it's from people with little or no formal education. I wonder if people in factories now will have the time, energy and desire to do that."
But isn't this just nostalgia? Isn't change inevitable? Absolutely, he said: "When you come from the working class, the way I do, you don't romanticize hard labor. You welcome advances like robots."
Other changes he doesn't welcome. "There's a shift to making money from money, not from labor," he said. "What new ideas aren't being explored because everyone's logging onto the Internet to find out how their stocks are doing?"
Mr. Moore, 43, who lives on the Upper West Side with his wife, Kathleen Glynn, and teen-age daughter, Natalie, has made money -- plenty of it -- but he keeps it in a savings account. "My accountant probably thinks I'm a little strange," he said. "I don't own stock partly for political reasons. But I'm not making a judgment on people who do. It's partly just the way I was brought up.
"We did put a little money into a Broadway musical -- I don't want to say which one -- that's starting a road company. That's our total investment."
In his films, Mr. Moore is concerned -- one might say obsessed -- with job losses in Flint, where for a decade he ran a newspaper. What about opening a business there now?
"No," he said quickly. "But since 'Roger and Me,' I have given away $520,000 in grants, and a fifth of that has gone to Flint, for things like scholarships and job training."
THE 45 minutes was nearly up, and an assistant poked her head in. "Two-minute warning," she said, then closed the door.
So, a last question: Do any chief executives have a conscience?
A blanket condemnation would have been no surprise, but Mr. Moore resisted that. Rather, he mentioned an auto executive: Alex Trotman, chairman of the Ford Motor Company.
"Last year, there was a strike at Johnson Controls -- they fired the strikers and hired replacement workers," he said. "But Trotman refused to buy car seats made by replacement workers. And his action forced Johnson Controls to settle with the union. It may be because he grew up in Scotland. There's a different tradition over there -- even conservatives believe in fair play and a social safety net."
As does Mr. Moore, all joking aside.

Trash Hauler Fined

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
Suburban Carting, one of Westchester's largest private trash haulers, was sentenced in Federal Court late last month to five years' probation and ordered to pay more than $5 million to the Government, John L. Kase, the lawyer for the Mamaroneck-based company, said. Suburban will also have to pay Westchester about $800,000.
The money owed to the county stems from an illegal profit-sharing scheme involving Suburban and another carter, I.S.A. of Middletown, N.Y. Combined, they are paying roughly $17 million in back taxes, fines and restitution under plea agreements they accepted in September. Mr. Kase said that Judge Jed S. Rakoff at sentencing in Federal District Court in Manhattan in March described Suburban Carting as a mob-controlled "shadow economy." 
 But Mr. Kase, whose offices are in Garden City on Long Island, said last week that Suburban was no longer influenced by organized crime and that three trustees were managing the company. In turn, the trustees are being overseen by a Federal monitor. The carter's president, Thomas Milo, will begin a three-year jail term this spring.
Mr. Milo -- along with his companies, 11 other companies and 5 other people -- pleaded guilty to various roles in an antitrust, organized- crime conspiracy, which spanned 10 years. The goal was to control the carting industry in the Hudson Valley, said John L. Pollok, Mr. Milo's Manhattan lawyer.
The county has a contract with Suburban and a subsidiary, Trottown Transfer, for trash hauling through August.

HEADLINE: Teaching the Teachers About Investing

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
THE Texas securities commissioner stood before 200 schoolteachers here recently to warn about emu scams (the wingless birds, not the European currency units) and the wily Ohio teen-ager who raised millions from other kids for a fraudulent ticket-scalping enterprise.
The official's goal wasn't necessarily to keep Texas educators from getting taken -- although for teachers like Trudy Dossett of San Antonio, who complained of her husband's fervid stabs at money-making, that was undoubtedly a side effect. ("He is notorious for wanting to invest in everything that comes along," she complained.) 
 Instead, the appearance of the commissioner, Denise Voigt Crawford, was part of a year-old Texas initiative to prepare tomorrow's investors for the complicated financial questions that lie ahead by educating the teachers who educate them.
With 401(k)'s replacing traditional retirement plans, Social Security's future under question and more Americans investing in stocks, high school graduates are quickly facing financial choices that their parents didn't dream about. "Unlike past generations," Ms. Crawford said, "the next generation is going to have to plan for themselves."
And so, armed with $275,000 -- paid in a 1996 settlement by a securities firm that put the funds of unknowing investors into high-risk derivatives -- the Texas Securities Board set out to give basic investor information to high school teachers.
Ms. Crawford said she had spoken to 400 to 500 teachers around the state so far. The program will last another year.
The Texas initiative is one sign of the new attention that educators are giving this topic nationally. At the heart of the Texas Investor Education Project is a 180-page guide, "Consumer Approach to Investing." Teachers who attend the state's conferences receive a copy of the guide; Rosella Bannister, director of the National Institute for Consumer Education, walks them through it.
In Dallas, Ms. Bannister used slides and tossed out questions to her audience, raising such issues as whether a single person needs life insurance (probably not) and how long it takes to double your money at various interest rates: Just divide 72 by the rate; at 8 percent interest, for example, it would take nine years.
One of the most surprising slides showed how long it would take to pay off a $2,000 credit card debt, at 19.8 percent interest, if you made the minimum 2 percent payment each month. The answer: 32 years.
The guide contains worksheets that the Texas Securities Board hopes teachers will distribute to students. One explains how to calculate a family's income and expenses; another tests students' ability to interpret stock and bond quotations.
"We teach drivers' ed. We teach P.E. in our schools," Ms. Crawford said. "It's time that we teach the investors of tomorrow how to manage and protect their money."
Mrs. Dossett, the San Antonio teacher, said that even her fifth-grade students would benefit from what she learned at the conference. Children that young are already falling prey to questionable deals offered over the Internet, she said. "They go get in mom's and dad's purse and get a credit card," she explained.
But the teacher seemed especially excited at the prospect of showing the materials to her husband, Mike, who works in telemarketing. About four years ago, Mr. Dossett bought 10 candy vending machines at $2,000 each as a way to make money, his wife recalled; these days, she said, the machines are sitting in the garage.

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
Keeping a Safety Net Under a Budget Surplus

BYLINE: By CHARLES J. ZWICK and PETER A. LEWIS; Charles J. Zwick and Peter A. Lewis were director and assistant director, respectively, of the United States Bureau of the Budget in 1969.

 BODY:
IN 1999, the Federal budget is projected to show a surplus for the first time since 1969. But if we do not want to run into another long string of deficits after that, we must recognize that the nature of Government programs has changed drastically, making it infinitely more difficult to maintain a balanced budget now than it was 30 years ago.
Consider the budget in 1969, in the midst of the Vietnam War: Military spending and other traditional functions of Government -- areas that had no private alternatives, including the Treasury, Justice and State Departments -- absorbed 74 percent of the budget before interest on the Federal debt. Social programs represented only 26 percent. 
 Today, the situation is reversed. Seventy-two percent of the budget is for programs for individuals, programs that substitute for or supplement private insurance and other private spending. Our population is growing older, and these programs will grow faster than the economy, as they have for the last 30 years.
If we wish to hold the Federal budget in check or provide for lower taxes, we must deal with these Government insurance programs. Although health insurance and retirement programs could be shifted from the Government to the private sector, the resulting cost to society would be the same unless the benefits or the numbers of people covered were reduced.
When the budget existed primarily for the military and other traditional programs, a cutback meant a cutback for the overall economy; offsetting expenditures for those activities did not reappear in the private sector. But expenditures for health care and retirement do not stop at the budget's edge. Cutting back insurance spending at the Federal level most likely will mean increasing that spending at the private level.
It is argued that the number of people covered will fall when insurance is shifted to the private sector. This conclusion would be accurate if insurance were an option that consumers could forgo. We must recognize, however, that lack of coverage is what created the Government programs in the first place. Alternatively, if we were to make these private programs mandatory, they would be no different than a tax -- albeit a private one, and hardly less expensive for taxpayers.
Some people also assume that private health insurance is more efficient and ultimately less expensive. In fact, private medical costs have been increasing at the same rate as Government health costs.
YET there remains a great temptation to shift public expenditures to the private sector and declare victory on behalf of the Federal budget, forgetting that all of us have private budgets, too. In today's society, the public and private sectors are difficult to separate, and the overlap is not the exception but the rule. This overlap is what conservatives would like to remove and what the industrialized world is reluctant to sacrifice. And it is where the safety net is found.
President Clinton recognized this when he tackled health care. But simply recognizing the issue did not help. The new Congressional commission on Social Security will confront the same question.
The debate should not be about balancing the Federal budget and what to do with the projected surplus, but about what level of health care and retirement benefits the nation wants and will pay for. Relieving the public sector by shifting an equivalent burden to the private sector does not constitute a saving, and the public senses this. Having a balanced Federal budget is a welcome first move. But dumping expenditures on the doorsteps of nervous citizens may not prove to be an easy next step.

HEADLINE: First Lessons in the Power of Money

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
THE eighth graders at Macopin Middle School in West Milford, N.J., a rural town about 40 miles northwest of Manhattan, are learning some basic lessons about economics.
First, they sold candy and magazine subscriptions to their families and friends. Then, instead of pooling the money in an activities fund, as had been the custom until this year, the school set up individual accounts for each student, reflecting how much each had raised. Until they graduate, they will be able to draw money out of their accounts to use for school trips, like one last month to the theater district, where they ate cheeseburgers at Comedy Nation and then took in a matinee of "1776." 
 What did they learn from all this? "If you do something, you're going to get paid for it," said Jamie Riegler, an eighth grader who has about $100 in her account.
Some classmates have far more, some have less and others nothing at all.
"That's America," declared the school's vice principal, Ray Johnson, a husky man with a Clintonesque hair style, as he stood surrounded by the hubbub of 130 adolescents crammed into Leatherette booths for their pre-theater lunch. "It's a good lesson in economics and capitalism. In America, you're supposed to reap what you sow, so to speak."
Such lessons are among the many that the nation's children are being taught about what drives the mighty engine of the American economy. Some school systems start as early as kindergarten; others wait until junior high or high school. And the formats can range from formal, comprehensive courses about supply and demand, profit and loss, incentives and opportunity cost, to real-life experiences like balancing a checkbook or interpreting the fluctuations of the Dow.
Many schools have also become choice marketing sites for companies, from standbys like the Scholastic Corporation, which pitches books to children starting in kindergarten (and lately has been selling videos and toys, too), to more recent arrivals like the Microsoft Corporation, whose software programs are installed in thousands of classrooms and libraries.
In some areas, school gyms are bedecked with corporate logos, offshoots of school-solicited advertising or partnerships between the schools and companies. Cafeterias serve McDonald's fries or Pizza Hut slices, and soft-drink companies are signing exclusive contracts with school districts, often getting an advertising presence at schools as part of the deal. In some towns, even the school buses have ads on the sides.
Yet as the line between education and business grows fuzzier, there is little agreement about the best way to teach economics. The informal message -- that money is power -- is often delivered more emphatically by ads in schools, for example, than by the economics curriculum, if there is one.
What is being sown by educators, moreover, seems to have trouble taking root. A test conducted last year by the nonprofit Jumpstart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy found that graduating seniors knew a "dismal amount" about how to manage their money.
"The teaching of economics at the pre-college level is quite confused," said Mark Schug, director of the Center for Economic Education at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. "A lot of people think of economics as the writing of checks, the importance of savings, how to manage your financial affairs. That's all very good stuff and kids should know that. But when we talk about an actual program, it's about how kids can learn about economics as a discipline. It's a great analytical tool, the discipline of economics, with its focus on costs and choices and incentives."
MR. SCHUG'S center is one of 200 financed by the National Council on Economic Education, a Manhattan-based organization started in 1949 by business leaders who were concerned that postwar youth knew nothing about what made markets tick, or even what a market was. The council, which said it reached about 7.5 million students in the last year, works primarily with teachers, supplying materials like a stock market game and suggestions for tying economics into existing subjects like government or the environment.
"There are still not very many schools that teach economics as such," said Robert Duvall, president of the council. "Our goal is to reach every kid in the country. When people say 'reading is fundamental,' we want to add to that 'economics is essential.' "
Last year, the council published a list of 20 principles that it believes all graduating high school seniors need to know to be economically literate. For example: "When individuals, regions and nations specialize in what they can produce at the lowest cost and then trade with others, both production and consumption increase." And: "Federal Government budgetary policy and the Federal Reserve System's monetary policy influence the overall levels of employment, output and prices."
True, many parents may admit that they do not understand either of the above. But, Mr. Duvall noted, "people are called upon more and more to manage their own retirement plans. And when people go into the voting booth and are asked to decide on fast-track trade legislation, or they read that financial problems in Hong Kong are going to impact this country, they haven't got a clue. We want to do something about that. And you start with the kids."
Mr. Duvall says a third-hand story about a second grader in Timberville, Va., illustrates the advances his group is making. The little boy was asked in Sunday school to define "prophet." His reply: "It's what is left over after the costs of production are taken out."
EAGER to show educators that economics can be incorporated into the average classroom, the council has published some teachers' successful lesson plans, including one for a Little Rock, Ark., kindergarten. Called "Ginger Town Economics: A 'Runaway' Success," it expanded upon the story of the Gingerbread Man to teach scarcity and "the need to make allocation decisions." The students collected taxes in Ginger Town and used the money to buy classroom equipment.
Another lesson, first used by junior high school students in Casselberry, Fla., revolved around the students' setting up a food concession. They did everything from designing a logo (for "The Breakfast Club") to interviewing workers and learning "the importance of social and business skills in a restaurant."
Still, only 14 states have agreed to make formal economics a part of their school curriculums, Mr. Duvall said. Much of what the others teach seems to focus on practical applications: the use of money, the effect of sales taxes, the budgeting of hard-earned cash to pay for things you want.
Yet even these lessons in personal financial management may not be having much impact. For the 1,509 graduating seniors who took the Jumpstart Coalition's 31-question exam -- on subjects from money management to savings and spending -- the average score was 57 percent, a failing grade in many classes. Most said they learned what they knew from relatives, not at school, and the scores were slightly higher for the ones who learned at home.
"This implies that the schools that are teaching tools of money management may need some strengthening of their curricula," the coalition's report states, or understates.
Extracurricular activities teach their own brand of financial wisdom, but as in school, it is sometimes hard to tell if the intended lessons stick.
Girl Scouts, for instance, work on an incentive plan, collecting prizes like T-shirts and plastic mugs if they reach certain cookie-sales plateaus. Sarah Baker, a 10-year-old fourth grader from Summit, N.J., recently sold 100 boxes of cookies and got a shirt.
A victory for capitalism? "A couple of my friends thought it was too much work," Sarah said.
Teaching kids the art of self-defense against commercialism is a priority for the National Endowment for Financial Education, a nonprofit group based in Denver that has issued teaching materials to the Girl Scouts and other groups. "We will ask: What are the alternatives to buying something at the full retail price?" said Brent A. Neiser, the endowment's director of collaborative programs. "And we ask: Do you have to have that right away?"
At the sole public school in Haledon, N.J., just north of Paterson, fourth graders are busily learning how to stay within a budget. An assortment of empty cereal, juice and detergent packages are lined up on a table, suggesting a grocery store. Teachers take math principles and apply them to real-life situations, usually involving shopping and similar experiences.
"I have kids who have a real problem with math," said the principal, John R. Dunay. "But if you put a dollar sign in front of it, they get it right away." The school serves a mostly working-class mix of longtime residents and recent immigrants, many from the Middle East.
Mr. Dunay's emphasis on practical applications has brought about "Supermarket Math," in which the fourth graders use what they know about addition and rounding off numbers to figure the cost of a basket of groceries -- selected by the children and heavy on Pepsi and Lucky Charms.
"If we're working within a budget, what does that mean?" asked the teacher, Dennis Elliot.
"You're not supposed to go over the budget," answered one girl in the group of 19 children.
"That's right," Mr. Elliot said. "We can't spend more money than we have."
LaToya Williams, a 14-year-old eighth grader at the school, has already had a variety of experiences with the economy. These include an unsatisfying part-time job and the introduction of fast-food companies to her school's "closed-lunch" program, where every child is served a cafeteria meal, rather than brown-bagging it.
"We have Pizza Hut and Domino's Pizza a couple of times a month," LaToya said. She also glimpses corporate America in the "Labels for Education" program in which the school participates. Labels from Campbell Soup Company products, like canned soup and Pepperidge Farm cookies, can be redeemed for equipment ranging from basketballs to desktop computers. It's a slow process; for a Gateway 2000 Multimedia desktop computer, a school needs to turn in more than 223,300 labels. Then there's the 15-passenger van with automatic transmission and power brakes, which requires almost 1.1 million. Let's see, at 59 cents a can for soup, that would mean more than $649,000 in Campbell's sales to get the van, or $131,747 in sales to get the computer.
LATOYA is the only girl in the Haledon School's stock market club; she said she joined because her mother works at a company that lets her buy shares, and LaToya figured it would be good if she understood the market, in case the same opportunity presented itself to her.
Club members make simulated investments in stocks and track their performance week by week. At the start of the year, LaToya bought 132 shares of Lucent Technologies at $94.6875 and 158 shares of Microsoft at $79. Her gains in March totaled $2,293.75 -- a respectable sum but still far behind the club's leader, Nahim Ahmed, an eighth grader who was up $6,758.75 on his basket of stocks.
LaToya's job at the Checkers Drive-In down the hill from school taught its own lessons in real-world economics. She started in January and quit last month. "I was putting tomatoes on the buns and working on a cash register a little," she said. "They only trained me for two weeks, and they expected me to know it in two weeks. They were only paying me $5.15 an hour, and I was the youngest. They thought they could push me around." So, LaToya downsized Checkers.
Like the students at Macopin Middle School, the seventh and eighth graders at Haledon have their own accounts, fattened with money from school fund-raisers. Every dollar's worth of wrapping paper, candy, fruit and magazine subscriptions translates into 50 cents for the students, Mr. Dunay said. (There is probably at least one lesson in the economics of that arrangement: an unpaid work force is a great way to generate cash.)
The individual accounts "teach us to be responsible," LaToya said. Her own account, she said, contained enough money to let her attend the eighth-grade dance recently. "In this school, they treat the eighth graders like young adults," she said.
MARKETERS look at schoolchildren as young adults, too, aiming advertising messages at them in every way imaginable. Ira Mayer, publisher of Youth Markets Alert, a Manhattan newsletter, said commercialism in schools was clearly on the rise. "I've seen an increase in the sophistication and the order of magnitude," he said, mainly because "kids are increasingly influential in decisions and purchases."
Ads are clearly influential, too. Marianne Manilov, whose Center for Commercial Free Public Education, based in Oakland, Calif., has kept close watch on the growth of advertising in schools, said studies had shown that children could not separate the authority of their school from that of ads they saw there. "They think their school sponsored the ad," she said.
Mr. Dunay hopes to bring more corporate partners to his school, where he became the principal last fall. Haledon is somewhat off the beaten track, and so far, there have been no offers of equipment from I.B.M., say, or Microsoft. But Mr. Dunay is optimistic that this will change.
"I have friends in the corporate world that I plan to approach," he said. "They're very anxious to do it, too, because they see a potential market here." Besides, he added, "the kids learn that there are companies that are reputable and provide a good product, and others that don't."
Haledon, though, will have to compete for attention with other schools in the state and around the country. Skeptics contend that many corporations put their energies into schools where they are likely to get the highest return, in visibility and in the dollars that may flow their way as a result.
And those priorities may be the strongest lesson that students are learning about economics -- either directly, in the classroom, or indirectly, from the world around them. It is all about whether they are considered an important part of the picture, or out of the picture altogether.
Economics could explain that.
"The important thing to understand is that there are scarcities in the world," said Mr. Schug, the Milwaukee economics educator. "You have to understand that people are self-interested. Not to be confused with selfishness."

Chart: "Need to Know"
Here are 20 economic principles that the National Council on Economic Education considers essential for high school graduates to understand.
 
1. People cannot have all the goods and services they want. They must make choices.
 
2. Making choices means weighing costs and benefits and thinking in terms of more and less, not just all or nothing.
 
3. One kind of choice facing individuals and their government representatives is how to divide up goods and services among those who want them. There are many different methods.
 
4. People respond predictably to positive and negative incentives.
 
5. Generally, trading happens only when everyone involved expects to gain by the trade.
 
6. For people and for countries, concentrating on what one does best and cheapest, and then trading with others, brings greater overall prosperity.
 
7. When buyers and sellers interact, they form a market; the trading they do determines market prices.
 
8. Prices are signals that people use to learn about supply and demand in the market.
 
9. When sellers compete, prices fall and costs are cut. When buyers compete, prices rise and goods and services go to the buyer willing to pay the most.
 
10. Institutions evolve to help market economies function. Banks, corporations, labor unions, a legal system and property rights are examples.
 
11. Money makes it easier to trade, borrow, save, invest and compare the value of goods and services.
 
12. When interest rates rise or fall, they balance the amount of money saved and the amount borrowed, changing how people choose among saving, investing for the future or spending today.
 
13. Income for most people depends on the market value of the work they do or of the goods and services they sell.
 
14. Entrepreneurs set up businesses and take risks in hope of profit.
 
15. Investment in factories, machinery and new technology or in the health, education and training of people can raise future standards of living.
 
16. Government's role in a market economy includes things like providing for national defense and making and enforcing laws. Most government policies have the effect of redistributing income.
 
17. Costs of government policies sometimes exceed benefits, often because they are aimed at a goal other than economic efficiency, or because those who benefit have more say than those who pay.
 
18. Over all, income, employment and prices are determined by the combined effects of all the choices made by people, businesses, institutions and government.
 
19. Unemployment imposes costs on people and nations. Unexpected inflation imposes costs on many people but benefits some others. When inflation leads people and organizations to use resources to protect against uncertain future prices, the economy can suffer.
 
20. The Federal budget and the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy broadly influence the economy. (pg. 10)

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Investors Seek Sale Of Nuveen

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
IT is, undoubtedly, a quixotic quest: A little-known analyst at an even less-known money management firm tries to get a giant fund group to put itself up for sale.
But in tilting at the John Nuveen Company, Mario Cibelli of the New York money manager Robotti & Company has some formidable backers in the role of Sancho Panza. 
 At Nuveen's annual meeting on May 7, Mr. Cibelli plans to introduce a shareholder resolution asking Nuveen's board "to immediately initiate discussions with possible purchasers" of the company, according to Nuveen's proxy statement, filed on April 3.
Mr. Cibelli acknowledges that the outcome of the vote is all but certain. "I expect to lose," he said, noting that the St. Paul Companies, the big Minnesota insurer, owns 77 percent of Nuveen. A St. Paul spokesman said the company planned to vote against Mr. Cibelli's proposal, and Nuveen's board also opposes it.
Rather than an outright victory, Mr. Cibelli hopes to capture the votes of a significant portion of the minority holders of Nuveen's 7.5 million publicly traded class A shares. "I think it would send a strong message to management if a majority of them supported the resolution," he said.
One portfolio manager who intends to send that message with his proxy is Martin J. Whitman, who runs the Third Avenue Value fund. He has owned about 163,000 Nuveen shares for several years. "It's obvious Nuveen's results have been disappointing," he said.
Other shareholders agree that Nuveen's shares have long lagged behind its fund industry peers. While many publicly traded fund companies have soared in value the last five years -- more than tripling, in the case of Franklin Resources, or rising fivefold, as at T. Rowe Price -- Nuveen's shares rose a mere 8 percent.
Nuveen occupies a relatively lonely corner of the fund business. At the end of last year, roughly 91 percent of its $11 billion in mutual fund assets were in fixed-income funds, mainly of the municipal bond variety. And most of the rest of its $50 billion in total assets under management were in closed-end funds and unit investment trusts, many of which also specialize in municipal bonds.
That gives above-average stability to Nuveen's assets because closed-end funds and unit trusts are less susceptible to redemptions.
But investors lately have had little interest in municipal bonds, which suffered when interest rates spiked upward in 1994 and again during the flat-tax debate in 1996. Instead, Americans have flocked to stock funds the last five years.
Nuveen started offering equity mutual funds in 1996, and its equity fund assets recently topped $1 billion. But its stock funds ranked in the bottom quarter of their peer groups in the year ended March 31, according to Lipper Analytical Services. And while the company's fund assets grew by 50 percent last year, after stagnating for four years, most of that growth came by acquisition.
John P. Amboian, Nuveen's chief financial officer, said Mr. Cibelli's comparisons of the performance of Nuveen to other companies were unfair because its asset base was so different. "We are in the process of building the company to another level," he said. "That will result in significant wealth creation for the company and its shareholders."
MR. CIBELLI and Mr. Whitman complain, however, that the people receiving most of Nuveen's wealth are its executives. "Their compensation is off the wall," Mr. Whitman said. "For what they're getting paid, there ought not to be any excuse."
Nuveen's top two executives each received an average of $3.2 million in salary, bonus and stock for each of the last three years, Nuveen's proxy statement shows. That was double the average annual compensation earned by the top two executives at Franklin Resources, manager of the Franklin Templeton funds.
Nuveen says its total compensation costs, as a share of revenues, are about even with the industry average. "We believe we will generate more value for shareholders by building our businesses than by squeezing them," Mr. Amboian said.
Even investors still undecided about Mr. Cibelli's proposal can sympathize with him. Nick Truitt, an investment analyst at Conseco Capital Management, which has bought about 195,000 Nuveen shares the last six months, said, "If I had bought a mutual fund company several years ago and it had barely budged, I'd be frustrated, too."

HEADLINE: Spotted in New York: Shiny Cars

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
THE New York International Auto Show arrives each year with the Easter lilies, and for the 35 car makers with exhibits, it holds all the promise of a perfect spring day. This year's show, which opened yesterday and runs through next Sunday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, is no exception. The New York economy is booming, gas prices are at record lows and Wall Street bonuses were exceptionally rich last year.
With the sales forecast generally sunny, auto makers are eager to plant seeds of interest in models that are new, improved or not even available yet. While the Ford Motor Company used the show to showcase luxury sedans that will not go on sale for a year, competitors displayed a crop of vehicles that will make it to market sooner. Here are some of the most significant: 

HONDA MINI-VAN -- Honda goes after mainstream mini-van buyers this fall with a new, yet-unnamed mini-van. Replacing the relatively small and marginally successful Odyssey, the new van is sized and designed more like models sold by Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. Powered by a V6 engine (the Odyssey has four cylinders), the new Honda will seat seven and will be the first van with dual power-operated sliding doors. The third-row bench seat folds completely into the floor, like that of the Odyssey. The new van will be built at Honda's recently expanded plant near Toronto.
 
INFINITI G20 -- Nissan's luxury division has brought back a new version of the entry-level car it briefly discontinued. The 1999 G20, which goes on sale this summer, will start at $25,000 to compete against some versions of the BMW 3-Series and the Audi A4. Built in Japan, the G20 is based on the Nissan Primera, already on sale in Europe and Japan. The G20 is powered by a 140-horsepower four-cylinder engine and comes in standard and more sporty touring editions.
 
CHEVROLET TRACKER, SUZUKI VITARA AND GRAND VITARA -- The Geo Tracker is now a Chevy, and the Suzuki Sidekick will soon be gone. Both Suzuki and General Motors introduced redesigned versions of their small, very similar sport utility vehicles as 1999 models, with the Suzuki models getting new names: the four-cylinder Vitara and the V6 Grand Vitara. Basic versions come as two-door convertibles or four-door models with solid roofs; the fancier Grand Vitara comes with four doors and a new 2.5-liter, 24-valve V6 engine. Starting at less than $20,000, the truck-based, Canadian-built vehicles are aimed at the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V.

AUDI A6 AVANT -- Audi begins selling this station wagon version of its successful A6 sedan in June. Like the sedan introduced last fall, the A6 Avant is powered by a 2.8-liter V6 engine. Quattro all-wheel drive is available, making the A6 Avant an alternative to four-wheel-drive sport utilities. The Avant starts at about $37,000.
 
PORSCHE 911 CABRIOLET -- An open-top version of the new 911, the first redesign of that legendary sports car in 34 years, arrives in showrooms this month. The cabriolet has an electronic soft top that raises or lowers in 20 seconds. The coupe starts at about $65,000, the cabriolet at about $75,000.

HEADLINE: There, on the Autobahn, Could It Be a Lincoln?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to American-style excess, Lincoln has had its share. And as baby boomers rebelled against the overwrought, softly sprung land yachts of their parents and grandparents, the luxury-car division of Ford faltered.
Now, Lincoln is playing catch-up, with some success: Sales are up 63 percent this year, thanks to the popular Navigator sport utility; a new, sleeker Town Car, and a restyled Continental. And for its next act, it wants to slim down, tone up and slip into a sleek European suit. 
 Last week, at press previews for the New York International Auto Show, Lincoln unveiled its most ambitious weapon for wooing affluent boomers, in the United States and abroad, who are entering their peak earnings years: the LS series of medium-sized, understated, German-inspired luxury cars.
In his introduction of the LS, Jacques A. Nasser, president of Ford automotive operations, said it was "designed to travel beyond the borders -- beyond the design borders, beyond the geographical borders and beyond the pscyhological borders -- that Lincoln has traditionally operated in."
The two LS models, with either V6 or V8 power, will go on sale in about a year as 2000 models. They will join one of the most competitive segments of the auto market: the "entry luxury" category of cars priced from roughly $30,000 to $40,000.
Total luxury car sales have held steady despite a strong economy, and they are expected to remain stagnant into the next century, at about a million vehicles a year in the United States. But the lower end of this market has been growing here and around the world, with continued expansion likely. To defend their ground and preserve their pride, every auto maker of global significance has entered the fray, and Detroit's Big Three are among the last to show up.
For the 1997 model year, Cadillac introduced the European-built Catera, based on the Opel Omega. In May, Chrysler brings out the 300M, a performance-oriented sedan based on a newly redesigned platform, which it shares with the Chrysler Concorde, Chrysler LHS and Dodge Intrepid.
The lower-luxury market is dominated by Japanese and German cars like the Lexus ES 300 and BMW 3-Series. In contrast to Cadillac, which essentially put a new grille and its venerable crest on an Opel from Germany, Lincoln engineers started from scratch to develop the LS6 and LS8. The sport sedans ride on an all-new rear-drive platform, which will be shared with a midsize Jaguar that also arrives next year. The new platform is complemented with new engines, transmissions and suspensions.
"We looked at the platforms we had available to us and didn't really find anything we were looking for," said Robert F. Widmer, luxury vehicle line director for Ford.
The LS6 is aimed at the ES 300, the 3-Series and, though Ford officials will not actually speak its name, the Catera. The Lincoln's V6 engine is a more powerful derivative of the Duratec engine in the Taurus. The LS8 is equipped with a new 3.9-liter V8 derived from the V8 used by Jaguar.
Both the LS6 and LS8 are available with a new five-speed automatic transmission, which can be ordered with a feature that allows the driver to shift, though there is no clutch. The LS6 will also come with a five-speed manual transmission, a rarity in this class and the first stick shift in a Lincoln since the early 1950's.
The LS models also come with other luxury-car features like anti-lock brakes, side air bags, all-speed traction control and a yaw control that helps to eliminate fishtailing and otherwise maintains stability.
The LS sits on a relatively long wheelbase but has short overhangs, especially in the front. The car's total length is five meters, or about 16.5 feet, which is considered an international standard.
The two models look identical, except for their wheels. The LS6 is expected to be priced in the low $30,000 range; the LS8 is likely to start at less than $40,000, or below the BMW 5-Series that Ford sees as a primary competitor to the V8 model.
The LS's understated look is a departure for Lincoln, but is typical of European sport sedans, with a clean, conservative profile and wide, solid stance. One styling touch that sets it apart -- and an American one at that -- is the extensive use of chrome. The car's prominent grille is chrome plated, as is the trim around the rear license plate; a wide chrome band runs across the front bumper. (Body-color moldings will substitute for chrome on cars sent overseas.)
Until now, Lincoln has been a brand only in North America. This car, however, will be sold in 30 countries as the "Ford Lincoln," in right- and left-hand-drive versions.
Lincoln does not expect a lot of BMW and Lexus trade-ins immediately, though it has grander long-range plans. Initial buyers are likely to be people moving up from family sedans, said Jim O'Connor, the Ford vice president in charge of Lincoln. First-year sales are expected to total 25,000 -- roughly equal to Cadillac's 1997 Catera sales. Susan Jacobs, an independent auto industry analyst who specializes in the luxury car market, said Lincoln's marketing plan and sales projections were on target.
"This is the best offering from any of the domestics, including the Cadillac Catera and Chrysler 300M," she said.

HEADLINE: VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION;
Making Short Work Of Long Commutes

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER 

 BODY:
IF you think you have a long commute, consider where a typical day may take Richard Jacobs. From his home in Nantucket, Mass., it is down to Washington to meet with fellow officers of the Futures Industry Association; then to Charlottesville, Va., where he lectures at the University of Virginia; then back to Nantucket or, if needed the next morning at the Manhattan headquarters of CTC Fund Management, where he is director of business development, to his pied-a-terre in Englewood, N.J.
Living this way has its complications -- Mr. Jacobs has 11 phone numbers -- but he makes it work with a special business machine: his airplane. In the seven years that Mr. Jacobs has been flying on business, he and his single-engine Mooney 231 have become almost like partners. "I'm well known now in our industry as a pilot, and I don't think at this point anyone would offer me a job and say, 'And you can't fly,' " he said. 
 Mr. Jacobs is part of a small fraternity of business people who use personal aircraft as other people would use a car: to get to work, to accept out-of-town consulting jobs, to take clients to ball games. Like Sam Walton hopping around the country looking for Wal-Mart sites, they attribute much of their success to their ability to wrest control of their travel schedules from the airlines.
And, as fellow business flier Joseph Buscemi puts it: "It's a hell of a lot more fun."
Which is not to say that this type of travel is universally accepted. The first time that Mr. Buscemi, production director for Lyons Lavey Nickel Swift, a New York medical-advertising firm, flew a rented Piper from Long Island to Boston to check a print run, he "forgot" to tell human resources at the parent company, Omnicom Group. When he put in for expenses, he received his reimbursement -- along with a finger-wagging.
"The next time I have to sign a waiver, which I think is kind of ridiculous," Mr. Buscemi said. "The risks everyone takes driving a car and riding a motorcycle and everything, nobody crimps your style about that. But as soon as you get into a single-engine airplane, everyone panics and thinks you're going to kill yourself."
Like investors, aviators say there is a difference between danger, which cannot be controlled, and risk, which can. "There's an expression in flying: 'There are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there are no old, bold pilots,' " says Ken Bardon, president of the RF Electronic Sales Company on Long Island, who has flown for 30 years.
Flying one's own plane is certainly convenient for business. Although unprofitable airports have been closing at the rate of one a week for a decade, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, there are still 5,400 public-use airports in the United States, only 366 of which offer commercial service -- and half the commercial service is concentrated at just 21 airports.
Personal flying can be such a time-saver, Mr. Bardon said, that he sometimes rents a plane at Republic Airport in Farmingdale, on Long Island, to visit clients in New Jersey. "Sometimes," he said, "it's more efficient to fly across the Hudson River than drive it."
Cost, on the other hand, is endlessly debated among pilots. For Mr. Jacobs, the cost of maintaining a small plane, estimated at as much as $100 an hour flown, compares favorably with what his friends spend on pleasure boats.
Step a rung down the economic ladder, though, and it can become difficult to tell whether a pilot flies to work or works to fly.
Because playing jazz vibraphone is not the most reliable route to wealth, Craig Peyton -- who describes himself as a professional musician who's always had a strong attraction to flying-- concocted a circle of opportunity by mounting video cameras in the cabin and on the wing of his Mooney 201.
Now, as owner of Earth Flight Productions, Mr. Peyton sets his music to aerial scenes for use in business videos. Every time he flies from Dutchess County, N.Y., to a meeting with a client, he collects new material for the next project.
"It's called survival," he said. "On a typical trip across the country, fuel alone is going to cost you $1,500, so you'd better have a way to recoup some of it."
For James Wynbrandt, a writer in Manhattan, flying is both a means and an end. He flies and reviews planes for aviation magazines but also uses his Mooney M20-E to get to assignments that have nothing to do with aviation. He has flown to San Francisco for a job writing the "Merry Christmas From Walt Disney World" radio program, to Nova Scotia to see his co-author on a reference work on genetic disorders and to Baltimore to visit a dental museum for a coming book, "The Excruciating History of Dentistry: Toothsome Tales and Oral Oddities From Babylon to Braces" (St. Martin's Press).
"Beyond the utility, there's a certain satisfaction that you really can't put a price on," Mr. Wynbrandt said. "The things that one sees from the air, the Zenlike calmness that one experiences while flying, is in marked contrast to being squeezed six across in an airliner."

HEADLINE: Correspondence/Uncompetitive in Tokyo;
In Japan, Nice Guys (And Girls) Finish Together

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
MY intention, honest, was not to scar these Japanese kids for life. I just wanted to give them a fun game to play.
It was the fifth birthday party last year for my son Gregory, and he had invited all his Japanese friends over from the Tokyo kindergarten that he attended. My wife and I explained the rules of musical chairs, and we started the music. 
 It was not so awful for the Japanese boys. They managed to fight for seats, albeit a bit lamely. But the girls were at sea.
The first time I stopped the music, Gregory's 5-year-old girlfriend, Chitose-chan, was next to him, right in front of a chair. But she stood politely and waited for him to be seated first.
So Gregory scrambled into her seat, and Chitose-chan beamed proudly at her own good manners. Then I walked over and told her that she had just lost the game and would have to sit out. She gazed up at me, her luminous eyes full of shocked disbelief, looking like Bambi might after a discussion of venison burgers.
"You mean I lose because I'm polite?" Chitose-chan's eyes asked. "You mean the point of the game is to be rude?"
Well, now that I think of it, I guess that is the point. American kids are taught to be winners, to seize their opportunities and maybe the next kid's as well. Japanese children are taught to be good citizens, to be team players, to obey rules, to be content to be a mosaic tile in some larger design.
One can have an intelligent debate about which approach is better. The Japanese emphasis on consideration and teamwork perhaps explains why Japan has few armed robbers but also so few entrepreneurs. The American emphasis on winning may help explain why the United States consistently racks up Olympic gold medals but also why its hockey players trashed their rooms in Nagano.
The civility that still lingers in Japan is the most charming and delightful aspect of life here today. Taxi drivers wear white gloves, take pride in the cleanliness of their vehicles, and sometimes give a discount if they mistakenly take a long route. When they are sick, Japanese wear surgical face masks so they will not infect others. The Japanese language has almost no curses, and high school baseball teams bow to each other at the beginning of each game.
One can go years here without hearing a voice raised in anger, for when Japanese are furious they sometimes show it by becoming incredibly formal and polite. Compared with New York, it's rather quaint.
The conundrum is that Japan is perhaps too civilized for the 1990's. To revive its economy, mired in a seven-year slump, the country now needs an infusion of economic ruthlessness, a dose of the law of the jungle. Japan desperately needs to restructure itself, which is to say that it needs to create losers -- companies need to lay off excess workers, Mom-and-Pop rice shops need to be replaced by more efficient supermarkets and failing banks need to go bankrupt.
But Japan is deeply uncomfortable with the idea of failures or losers. The social and economic basis of modern Japan is egalitarianism, and that does not leave much room for either winners or losers. In Japan, winning isn't everything, and it isn't the only thing; in elementary schools it isn't even a thing at all.
When Gregory and his brother Geoffrey went to Sports Day at their Japanese kindergarten, everybody told us that this was the big event of the year. So my wife and I went to cheer, but it wasn't really necessary. There were three-legged races and team basketball shoots and all kinds of games, but somehow at the end of the day no one won and no one lost. There were no blue ribbons, no prizes for the fastest runner, no cheers for the best basketball shooter, or anything else; instead, every child got a small prize.
The point of Sports Day was not to divide students by recognizing individual excellence but to unite them by giving them a shared experience. Likewise, schools do not normally break up children into "fast reading classes" and "slow reading classes," because that would stigmatize the slower ones. During recess or phys ed, there is no system of having a few captains take turns picking teams, because the last-picked might be upset; instead kids divide by class or by the Japanese equivalent of alphabetical order. When drama teachers select a play to perform, they choose one in which there is no star, just a lot of equal parts -- which makes for first-rate student harmony and second-rate drama.
Of course, competition is inevitable in any society, and in Japan it is introduced in junior high schools, when children must compete intensely to pass high school and college entrance examinations. But the emphasis remains on "wa," or harmony, on being one with the group.
Ask a traditional Japanese housewife what she wants for her child, and you will sometimes hear an answer like: "I just want my kid to grow up so as not to be a nuisance to other people." Hmmm. Not a dream often heard in America.
Even in business, the obsession with egalitarian wa goes to astonishing lengths. One Tokyo bank executive told me how he envied the Japanese subsidiary of Citibank, which waives certain fees for customers who keep a large minimum balance. That would never be tolerated in a Japanese bank, he said, because it would be regarded as discriminatory against the poor. Likewise, he said, his bank cannot easily close unprofitable branches in remote areas, because then it would be criticized for abandoning the people there.
THE emphasis on wa perhaps arises because 125 million Japanese, almost half of America's population, are squeezed into an area the size of California. How else could they survive but with a passion for protocol and a web of picayune rules dictating consideration for others? If 125 million Americans were jammed into such a small space, we might have torn each other to shreds by now.
Building teamwork in Japan starts from birth. When our third child, Caroline, was born in Tokyo last fall, the hospital explained that the mothers were to nurse their babies all together in the same room at particular meal times. So on her first day of life, Caroline was effectively told to discipline her appetites to adjust to a larger scheme with others.
THIS civility and egalitarianism shape just about every aspect of life. When the Japanese translation of a book that my wife and I wrote was published, we were pleased that the first reviews were positive. But we were frankly surprised when every single Japanese review was positive, and I remarked on that to a Japanese friend. "Oh, that's the only kind of book review there is in Japan," he explained. "There are no bad book reviews. Just nice ones."
And insipid ones, of course. Indeed, Japan itself is so polite as to be a bit bland, rather like "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" on a national scale. And of course Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was never known for its hustle or economic vibrancy.
So now, Japan is trying to become nastier. Workers are being pushed out of their jobs, occasionally even laid off. Employees are no longer being automatically promoted by seniority. Pay differentials are widening. Companies are becoming more concerned with efficiency and share prices, less concerned with employee welfare.
All this will make Japan a more prosperous country, but perhaps a less civil one. The changes certainly rub against the grain here, particularly of older people.
They rub just a bit against my grain, too. I bought a long scroll of calligraphy with the character "wa," in hopes that my kids will learn harmony, instead of clubbing each other over toys. Yet on the other hand I still want them to win -- at musical chairs and everything else.
That is getting tougher, because young Japanese are adapting to greater competition, and they seem to be a bit more aggressive and individualist than their parents. Some young Japanese are even getting pretty good at musical chairs.
And little Chitose-chan, Gregory's girlfriend -- well, she may be polite, but don't underestimate her generation's ability to catch on quickly. Thirty minutes after the game of musical chairs, Chitose-chan and her friend Naoko-chan got into an argument over a party favor. Chitose-chan slugged Naoko-chan in the mouth and grabbed the toy.
Perhaps that's globalization.

HEADLINE: MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;
Arming Yourself (Financially) for Armageddon

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN 

 BODY:
IT'S a fact that 99 percent of all species on earth have become extinct. And because man is a species, the question is not "if" so much as "when." Anyway, if, like me, you grew up a few radioactive Day-Glo orange puddle-jumps away from Love Canal, the upstate New York town turned toxic dump site, you're entitled to think that if some natural force doesn't get us, we'll probably just do ourselves in.
When people in my neighborhood said, "You look radiant," they weren't necessarily being complimentary. 
 So musing over doomsday does not mean that you're crazy or cranky or that you gave up hope for Lent instead of Haagen-Dazs. And you're certainly not alone. In a recent Gallup Poll, 61 percent of adults and 71 percent of teen-agers said they believed that the world would come to an end or be destroyed. It did not help to find out last month that an asteroid might be crashing into the planet, even if the next day's headlines read, "Whoops, just kidding!"
A short catalogue of potential calamities: nuclear accidents, environmental devastation (ozone layer, greenhouse effect), plague (resistant new strains of tuberculosis, Ebola virus, H.I.V.), doom prophesied by religious groups, and the latest cause for collective concern, the year 2000 computer glitch, or Y2K.
Given all this, some people want to prepare for whatever tribulation they envision. In these days of do-it-yourself investing, that means girding your finances, as well as the usual apocalyptic tasks like building a bunker or putting your soul in order.
Consider Y2K. The predictions for Dec. 31, 1999, range from simple bank errors, disappearing stock certificates and Social Security checks to a Government shutdown, mass social unrest and global economic collapse. The alarums are not just conjectures in Internet chat rooms but the genuine fears of techies charged with finding a solution before the gong strikes midnight.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York, says there is a 60 percent chance of a global recession from Y2K problems. He advises having cash on hand, putting money in Treasury bonds and steering clear of airline stocks. The reason for the last is that today's air traffic control computers are not ready to handle the change, he believes.
"No one knows what's going to happen, but it's a systemic problem" that Y2K poses, says Robert Forrester, managing partner of the Forrester Network, a consulting firm in Norwalk, Conn. His advice: Collect six months' worth of hard copies of all financial statements and bills. Make sure you have written copies of your birth certificate, college transcripts and insurance policies. And get a letter from Social Security stating your benefits; most experts believe that the Government is less likely to ready its computers for Y2K than is the private sector.
Bert Dohmen, president of Dohmen Capital Research in Honolulu, advises steering clear of stocks like Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other companies with substantial Government business. He also worries about Washington's computers crashing.
Howard J. Ruff, publisher of The Ruff Times, a newsletter, writes about the silver lining in this computer cloud, although he agrees that the Y2K problem may be dire. He recommends investing in ZMAX, a venture that prepares companies for the transition, and Home State Year 2000 (800-232-0224), a mutual fund that invests in businesses working on the Y2K problem. Gold is also a good bet, Mr. Ruff said.
What about those like Donald S. McAlvany, editor of The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor, who worry about drug-resistant viruses, germ warfare and anthrax attacks? Mr. McAlvany suggests that, for survival, people study up on nutrition, alternative medicine and the like. For investments, analysts would look into the same areas.
Stephanie Ackler, a financial counselor at Tucker Anthony in Manhattan, does not herself fret much about these dangers, but those who do might explore companies like General Nutrition, Celestial Seasonings and Lincare, a provider of respiratory therapy, she said.
INSURANCE, the next stop on our financial doomsday tour, offers something for everyone. Although most homeowner and business policies cover any objects that fall from the sky, for instance, the especially fearful can buy anti-asteroid insurance as well. For a one-time premium of $19.95, the St. Lawrence Agency in Altamonte Springs, Fla., sells a policy paying up to $10 million for asteroid damage. Reimbursement for treatment of cirrhosis of the liver resulting from panic-induced alcoholism is included. Honest.
If your mind turns to those 10 or 12 Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union that have not yet been decommissioned, you may want mushroom-cloud coverage. The three primary insurers of nuclear risks are Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. and American Nuclear Insurers, which paid out $60 million in claims related to the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island.
Indeed, nuclear-reactor perils are one reason that Mr. Dohmen advises steering clear "of any investment in the former Soviet Union unless you like playing Russian roulette with five cylinders loaded."
Douglas S. Land, a venture capitalist with the Chesapeake Group in New York, says he is not himself convinced that the end will come with a nuclear blast, but he has investment advice for those who do. Go with Bausch & Lomb and Sunglass Hut International (eye protection), Brookstone (back-to-the-earth garden tools) and Glaxo Wellcome and other drug giants (sun screens). Or, because retailing may be wiped off the face of the earth, invest in Orbital Sciences, a satellite maker, he says.
Back on the insurance front, the spiritually optimistic may be interested in a reincarnation policy. The St. Lawrence Agency offers one that reimburses holders for lost property when they return after death.
Also, several companies sold "rapture insurance" over the years but, after a concerted effort, the industry successfully vanquished such coverage a few years ago. In the rapture, some Christians believe, the living faithful will be spirited to heaven, leaving others behind to face the Antichrist on earth. The policies granted the faithful the same status as deceased clients, with the moneys duly paid out to the beneficiaries.
Do religious groups that believe in apocalyptic doom as prophesied by the Bible invest only, say, in precious metals? The answer for many is no. The Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists and others are as stock-oriented as any large institutions.
"Though this could easily be considered a contradiction, realistically it isn't," said Milton Erhart, a stockbroker in Boise, Idaho, who advises the Adventist church. "Most religious organizations realize they must be in the equity markets if for no other reason than to fund the pension liabilities."
Of course, in thinking about the financial implications of doomsday, don't overlook stockpiling and other standard Armageddon preparations. It is always prudent to have food and water for emergencies, said Mr. Ruff, a Mormon, who suggests living off what you have in the house for a week right now, just to get an idea of your stockpiling needs. Having myself survived a few noteworthy Buffalo blizzards, I would agree that you can never have too many cans of creamed corn in the pantry.
True, the apocalypse may never come. But remember that preparing for it has yielded numerous contributions to society. It was the Adventists' interest in alternative diets and millennial bodily perfection, for instance, that led them to invent three food pillars of modern life: peanut butter, graham crackers and cold breakfast cereal.
So it's not all gloom and doom. Many prophecies are very optimistic. Just ask the pastor of the First Church of Elvis. This "Presleyterian" denomination predicts that the singer will make his second coming at the end of the millennium.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
In the Megamerger Parade, Banks May March in Front

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
DESPITE the breathtaking size and scope of the proposed merger of Citicorp and the Travelers Group, the deal merely punctuates a reality of the financial services industry: The urge to merge is real, and will remain that way for some time to come.
For investors in bank, brokerage or mutual fund stocks, the consolidation wave is the ultimate payoff for backing businesses that in the main have been outstanding performers for much of the 1990's. 
 But because the industry's fundamentals continue to look so good, it is hard to predict who may merge next.
"For an investor, it is sort of a futile activity, because every major transaction has surprised the market," said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
But speaking broadly, many analysts say banks will be doing the bulk of the buying.
"They have the size, the money, the customers, the branches and the technology," said Michael W. Blumstein, an insurance company analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. "They are coming to the party with much more than most of the other players."
Moreover, while the Citicorp-Travelers deal signals that virtually all financial services businesses are fair game, some sectors may see less takeover activity. While some analysts disagree, for example, many say that banks are unlikely to want to buy insurers.
"I don't think a lot of commercial banks have the appetite to get into the insurance underwriting business," said David Berry, research director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a bank-stock research firm in New York. "There is a lot of volatility in areas like property and casualty. Selling insurance is one thing. Underwriting it is something else."
Even if a big bank wanted to buy an insurance company, many of the biggest are off limits because they are owned by policyholders, not stock investors. (A number of these mutual companies, however, including John Hancock Mutual, Metropolitan Life and New York Life, are considering public offerings.)
Even as they acknowledge that more mergers are coming, analysts said the pace could slow early next year, as possible year-2000 computer problems approach.
"Many banks we talk to suggest that by year-end or early in 1999 they would not feel comfortable making an acquisition because of the time needed to integrate computer systems," said Frank J. Barkocy, a managing director at Josephthal & Company.
What about insurers as buyers? At the moment, they seem content to pursue mergers within their own industry in order to increase market share and economies of scale, and to shed businesses in markets where they lack a major presence.
Beyond citing these general patterns, Ms. Krawcheck, Mr. Blumstein and other analysts declined to predict who might merge with whom. But some, including Mr. Berry and Mr. Barkocy, were not quite so shy.
Here are the companies they like.
 
James K. Schmitt
Portfolio manager, Hancock Regional Bank fund and Hancock Financial Industries fund
Mr. Schmitt, whose funds have assets of $7.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, buys stocks he sees as both solid performers and sensible takeover targets.
"There will be consolidation in two directions," he said. "Banks will combine in what I call battleground states like Alabama, Tennessee and California, where a few banks have significant market share and the superregionals are not omnipresent. And we will see banks buying the remaining brokerage firms."
His regional bank fund owns Alabama institutions like Regions Financial and Amsouth Bancorp. His holdings among Tennessee banks include First Tennessee National, Union Planters and First American of Tennessee. In California he owns several smaller institutions like City National and the Westamerica Bancorporation.
Brokerage firms with underwriting capability, like Lehman Brothers and Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, would be particularly attractive to banks, he said. So, too, would regional brokerages like Legg Mason and Raymond James.
Mr. Schmitt, whose Regional Bank and Financial Industries funds were up 56.4 percent and 58.5 percent, respectively, for the last 12 months, said he does not turn over his holdings much.
"In the last few years, there have been few fundamental reasons to sell a bank stock," he said.
 
David Berry
Research director, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Mr. Berry said he was intrigued by the possibilities of three big superregional bank deals: US Bancorp with Wells Fargo, First Chicago with Banc One and Nationsbank with BankAmerica.
"From our perspective, Wells Fargo looks like a seller," he said. "They have disappointed investors since the First Interstate deal, they have no forward revenue momentum and, notwithstanding their problems, they are very shareholder-friendly."
Mr. Berry likes First Chicago as an acquisition target because of its prized assets: a strong credit card business, a leading presence in Chicago and a solid middle-market banking business in the Midwest.
Because of its location, Banc One is the most logical buyer for First Chicago, he said. But he would not rule out Nationsbank or BankAmerica as potential buyers.
Finally, "if you want to get really big, a combination of BankAmerica and Nationsbank would meet that criteria," Mr. Berry said. "It has a lot of the same characteristics as the Citicorp-Travelers deal."
Referring to the acquisitive chairman of Nationsbank, Mr. Barry added that "if you are Hugh McColl and are interested in being a major player in the consolidation of American banking, a merger with an institution like BankAmerica has to look interesting."
 
Frank J. Barkocy
Managing director, Josephthal & Company
Like Mr. Schmitt, Mr. Barkocy said the shrinking number of prize properties in certain parts of the country was likely to accelerate consolidation in the banking industry. The same logic applies to brokerage firms and investment banks, he said.
Among banks, he said, he likes Summit Bancorp in New Jersey, Mercantile Bancorp in Missouri and Hibernia in Louisiana.
"They are the largest independent banks remaining in those states," he said.
Closer to home, he said, a number of Long Island savings institutions are having difficulty in increasing revenues because of "fairly compact" customer bases. These institutions are likely to be acquired by larger ones, he maintained.
"Greenpoint Savings, Dime Savings and some other New York banks will be looking at names like Rosyln Bancorp and Haven Bancorp," he said.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
At the Bull-Market Party, Distributions Cause a Hangover

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
APRIL is a month for cruel surprises. And if you're a late tax filer just getting ready to tear into your mutual fund's distributions statement for 1997, you may very well be in for a big one.
Mutual funds paid out a record $334.1 billion in distributions for 1997, mostly from capital gains, and shareholders whose holdings are not invested through tax-deferred accounts will pay the I.R.S. accordingly. But not all of those billions flowed to long-term investors who had earned them over the years. Some were nasty side effects -- a result of changes in fund administration. 
 The Berger 100 fund, for example, paid out 34.1 percent of its assets to shareholders after a new portfolio manager cleared out many of his predecessor's holdings. GE Mid-Cap B, created out of a predecessor mutual fund through a merger and reorganization, distributed an even higher portion of assets -- 45.2 percent. And both Delaware U.S. Growth and HSBC Growth and Income realized gains of about 40 percent when they had to sell stock to meet huge redemptions.
The bottom line is that investors could have lost much of their profit to taxes. A $10,000 investment in a fund that delivered total returns of 15 percent would have lifted its owner's assets to $11,500. But if the fund distributed 25 percent of those assets, or $2,875, as capital gains, the tax bill for an investor could be as much as 28 percent, or $805. That would slash the return by more than half.
In fact, nearly 50 mutual funds paid distributions in 1997 equal to 25 percent or more of their assets. For investors who bought their shares during the year, the results were basically a return of their capital, but with Uncle Sam taking a bite.
"A lot of mutual funds are a lot less tax-friendly than most people would think," said Amy Arnott, editor of the Morningstar Mutual Funds newsletter.
No kidding. Last year's distributions were mammoth. Stock and bond funds paid out $130.5 billion in ordinary dividends, up from $73.7 billion in 1996, according to the Investment Company Institute, the industry's trade group. Capital gains payments more than doubled, to $203.6 billion from $101.1 billion the previous year, itself a record.
Of course, 1997 was no ordinary year. It was the third consecutive year of double-digit growth in capital gains, meaning funds had plenty of them on hand. It was also a time of continuing consolidation, when funds acquired one another and merged portfolios to make them more economical to manage.
To make matters worse, the market happened to correct in October, just before the end of many funds' fiscal years. "Some funds had to sell securities to meet redemptions, which made them end up realizing more gains than they otherwise would have," Ms. Arnott said.
Often, shareholders learn well in advance that their funds will reorganize, usually because of a change in management.
Berger 100 had fallen from industry leader to also-ran over a period of years under Rod Linafelter, an iconoclastic manager who left the fund early last year. Berger recruited Patrick Adams, a growth-stock manager formerly with Founders Funds, to overhaul the portfolio. It was no surprise that Mr. Adams would make plenty of changes.
In the case of the Investors Trust Value fund, shareholders had to approve the portfolio's acquisition last fall by GE Funds of Stamford, Conn., which subsequently merged it into a new portfolio, GE Mid-Cap, and installed a new manager.
"We went on a very aggressive campaign to notify shareholders of impending capital gains distributions," said Mary Stone, manager of shareholder services for GE Investment Management, the fund's adviser. "Normally we have very low turnover on our funds."
Shareholders also had to approve the conversion of a closed-end fund, Quest for Value Dual Purpose Fund Capital Shares, into the open-end Oppenheimer Quest Capital Value. When they did, "more than half of the portfolio securities were sold to meet shareholder redemptions," said Greg Stitt, a spokesman for Oppenheimer.
But a huge tax bill can be a quite unexpected side effect. After the Lincoln National Corporation bought Delaware Investments in 1995, it put the Delaware name on its own Lincoln U.S. Growth Portfolio. In 1997 Lincoln withdrew roughly $18.2 million, representing funds it had used to seed that portfolio several years earlier, as well as investment profits. Shareholders were stuck with the tax bill when a third of the fund's portfolio was sold to meet the redemption.
Taxes are an inevitable consequence of successful investing, and many mutual funds have built up very significant unrealized capital gains. Some investment advisers recommend unmanaged index funds because they seldom distribute big gains, but such funds are just as vulnerable to redemptions as actively managed portfolios.
"The tax liability built up in these funds is huge," said Cindy Bohlen, a research analyst with Marshall Funds in Milwaukee. "If you ever start to see money exiting those funds, watch out."
What is a tax-sensitive investor to do? Peter Brown, a principal of Evensky, Brown, Katz & Levitt, a financial planning firm in Coral Gables, Fla., said the best protection against being blindsided by oversized capital gains distributions is to buy funds that have just made them. "They've probably wiped out all the puff in their portfolios, and going forward it's going to be a long time before investors get hit with taxable distributions," he said.

HEADLINE: A Land Giant Is Stirring. Will Florida Ever Be the Same?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla.

 BODY:
REAL estate development in Florida conjures up visions of Eden gone awry. Over the last century, the state's subtropical environment has been battered by an onslaught of tourist attractions, billboards, strip shopping centers, beachfront condominiums and featureless subdivisions that have drained the wetlands and scarred the landscape. Planning has been haphazard and sometimes completely absent.
Now, the St. Joe Corporation, the quirky public company that is Florida's largest private landholder, insists that it intends to break with that pattern as it develops a million acres in the panhandle, some of the last pristine tracts in this state. 
 The stakes are high, both for Florida's future and for St. Joe shareholders -- the latter primarily a duPont family trust that supports clinics for the elderly and disabled, though Wall Street, too, is beginning to take an interest in a company that it long could comfortably ignore.
For decades, St. Joe was an undermanaged holding company with assets in timber, transportation and banking that fed the trust in dribs and drabs. But all that changed a year ago when Peter S. Rummell was hired away from the Walt Disney Company to become St. Joe's chief executive, chairman and in-house rabble-rouser.
"I felt a little like I'd stepped into a time warp," said Mr. Rummell, who was head of Disney's theme park and real estate development divisions. When he first asked for an overview of St. Joe's holdings, Mr. Rummell recalled, he was given a yellowed Esso gas-station map so old that it did not show Interstate 95, the main highway down Florida's east coast. Today, a large studio on the ground floor of St. Joe's headquarters here houses a research and development center with huge satellite photos delineating the company's land.
"You don't see this quantity of assets that have been maintained so conservatively for so long," Mr. Rummell said.
After a year spent assessing those assets and importing a team of outside managers, Mr. Rummell has begun to carry out an ambitious plan with social implications that could ripple across Florida -- and perhaps beyond.
In the coming decade, St. Joe intends to open up resort and residential development not on the east or west coasts of the state but along the panhandle, which despite its white-sand beaches on the Gulf of Mexico has lagged behind in growth and prosperity.
The company's holdings in the region include 30 miles of frontage on the gulf and 250 miles on inland waterways and lakes. The centerpiece of the proposed development is a series of planned communities, resorts and retirement centers that would transform not only St. Joe's vast tracts but also the panhandle itself.
Rather than the high-rise beachfront condominiums and bland retirement villages that are the hallmarks of Florida, St. Joe wants to build places that are more walkable and human-scaled -- shaped around the environment instead of ignoring or damaging it. The models are not Miami Beach or Fort Myers but the more recent communities of Seaside and Celebration. St. Joe's towns are intended, too, to reshape Florida's demographics, by appealing to families and job seekers, not just the retirees who have been the primary targets of Florida developers in the past.
All this is risky, of course. Undeveloped land is the most volatile of real estate assets, and Merrill Lynch -- which recently began following St. Joe -- estimates that 35 percent of the company's value is in vacant land. So any significant downturn in the state or national economy could poke a big hole in Mr. Rummell's balloon.
Plus, there are good reasons that the panhandle has been slow to develop. Transportation into the region is weak, making it difficult to attract visitors beyond a day's drive away. There are few hospitals or clinics -- vital for the second-home and retirement markets -- and not enough of the good schools essential to attracting permanent residents. To outsiders, the area is probably best known for replacing Daytona Beach as Florida's No. 1 destination for hard-drinking college students on spring break.
But Mr. Rummell has assets beyond his own experience and St. Joe's vast acreage, which is only slightly smaller than the state of Delaware. The company's balance sheet is debt free. The trust has given him a green light to shake up St. Joe's stolid status quo. He has already made a key acquisition -- a controlling interest in the Arvida Company, which built Boca Raton and many of Florida's more uncharacteristically charming planned communities and will build most of the houses on St. Joe's panhandle lands.
"If we are smart about it -- if we are methodical but aggressive -- it is a huge opportunity," Mr. Rummell said. "We have an opportunity to create a very special kind of region."
 
Roots in Rebellion
St. Joe may have been a sleepy business for decades, but Mr. Rummell is not its first rebel.
The company was founded by Alfred I. duPont, the black sheep of the Delaware family that grew rich selling gunpowder in World War I. He battled other family members for control of the business and caused a social ruckus in 1921 when, at 57, he married Jessie Ball, who was 21 years his junior.
But it was not social ostracism that drove Mr. duPont south; it was business. A cousin and rival, Pierre duPont, became Delaware's tax commissioner and promised to make the rich pay their fair share. When a tax deputy came calling to review Cousin Alfred's accounts, he was turned away.
"I'll be damned if I'm going to have Pierre going over my books," Alfred duPont snapped, according to a published family history. Instead, he transferred all his assets into Florida corporations and, with his bride, moved to Jacksonville in 1926.
While the rest of the country was enjoying prosperity that year, Florida was suffering from the effects of a devastating hurricane and collapsed real estate prices. Mr. duPont, with a personal fortune of $70 million to $200 million, took advantage of the situation and bought large tracts of land for just a few dollars an acre, particularly in the panhandle.
In a single transaction in 1933, he bought 240,000 acres, including virtually the entire town of Port St. Joe on the gulf. The deal included two railroads, some telephone companies and a paper mill that eventually gave the whole enterprise its name: the St. Joe Paper Company.
Mr. duPont died in 1935, leaving the bulk of his holdings in trust for the benefit of his wife; after her death in 1970, the proceeds of the trust were designated to help disabled children and the elderly.
Through the trust, control of the company fell to Mr. duPont's brother-in-law, Edward Ball, a pugnacious man who ruled with the firm hand of an autocrat. He added to St. Joe's land holdings and expanded its bank, Florida National, into the state's largest.
Mr. Ball acquired the Florida East Coast Railway Company, the historic line that runs from Jacksonville to Key West and defined migration to Florida's east coast.
St. Joe's rich lore contains a story, probably apocryphal, about an encounter in the early 1960's between Mr. Ball and Walt Disney. As part of his quiet search for land to build a new theme park in the wake of Disneyland's success, Mr. Disney supposedly inquired about the possibility of buying a chunk of St. Joe's panhandle holdings.
"We don't deal with carnival people," Mr. Ball is said to have replied -- forever altering the course of Florida land development and leaving intact the domain now being prepared for development by Mr. Rummell, the former executive with Disney.
Mr. Ball died in 1981, but control of the company remained with the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust, which as recently as 1990 owned 86 percent of St. Joe. (Its holdings now amount to about 55 percent of the company.)
The beneficiary of the trust, the Nemours Foundation, was allotted 3 percent of the trust's market value each year to run clinics in Florida and Delaware.
Only in the early 1990's, after representatives of the trust, Florida officials and outside investors began to demand that it produce more income, did change begin to shake St. Joe.
To focus on real estate, the company put other assets up for sale, including the namesake pulp and paper mills, container plants and most of the phone business. A deal is pending for the Federal Government to buy a sugar plantation in the Everglades as part of a conservation program.
In 1996, the company was renamed the St. Joe Corporation, and a headhunter was hired to find someone to run it.
 
Real Estate Man Returns
Peter Rummell was 51 when St. Joe came knocking. As chairman of Walt Disney Imagineering, he oversaw the development of a wide range of Disney projects, from Euro Disney outside Paris to Celebration, the company's new planned community in central Florida. He had an especially strong relationship with Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney.
Mr. Rummell started out as a developer in the early 1970's, working on Amelia Island Plantation near Jacksonville for the Sea Pines Company. He also worked for Arvida and spent two years as vice chairman of the Rockefeller Center Management Corporation in New York before returning in 1985 to Arvida, which had been acquired by Disney. He soon moved to the Disney side of the corporate aisle; Arvida was eventually sold.
At heart, though, Mr. Rummell is a real estate man, he says, and Disney is an entertainment company. So in January 1997 he accepted the invitation of the St. Joe board to try to reinvent the company -- and real estate development in Florida.
Besides the acquisition of Arvida, his early moves have included deploying stock options and bonus incentives, previously unheard of at the staid St. Joe, to attract a new team of senior managers. Charles A. Ledsinger Jr. was brought in as chief financial officer from Harrah's Entertainment Inc.; he recently became president and chief operating officer. Two former Disney executives, Robert M. Rhodes and Michael F. Bayer, also took senior management positions.
Mr. Rummell got a good deal for himself, too. His base salary in 1997 was $600,000, with a performance-based incentive bonus that added $300,000. He also received $5 million worth of St. Joe stock to compensate him for the value of stock options he forfeited by leaving Disney. Plus, he received stock options that, if the company's stock rises an average of 10 percent a year for the next decade, would be worth $123 million. (Since Mr. Rummell signed on, the stock is up about 60 percent; St. Joe shares ended the week at $33.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.)
His immediate task, though, is to start enough real estate projects fast enough to satisfy Wall Street that St. Joe has the cash flow to be a good investment now, not just years from now when its big developments come on line.
Toward that end, the company, borrowing a page from Disney, has branched into the entertainment business. Its most significant deal is with the National Football League, to develop interactive entertainment centers that will include technology-based games, retail stores and restaurants in an atmosphere similar to that of a football stadium. Tentatively called NFLX, the first of the 7 to 10 ventures is expected to open late next year in New York, possibly in Times Square.
But the real test for St. Joe will be developing its hundreds of thousands of acres in northwest Florida over the coming decade in a way that provides long-term value for its shareholders and long-term benefits for the state.
 
Expanding a Beachhead
One model for what Mr. Rummell has in mind sits squarely in the midst of some of St. Joe's most valuable land. St. Joe did not build Seaside and will not duplicate it, but the company's plans are taking some of their inspiration from the 240-home village surrounded by St. Joe's panhandle real estate.
Seaside, about 20 miles west of Panama City, is the beachhead for neotraditional town planning. Probably no other 80-acre strip of land in America has been so scrutinized and analyzed in the last decade as its picturesque collection of homes, built since 1981.
The houses are, by regulation, wood-shingled and clapboard, with deep front porches and whimsical cupolas. But the changes exemplified by Seaside are more fundamental than architecture. They go to scale and to the way people live. The streets are narrow, putting a premium on walking. The town is organized around a center with shops and galleries. While there are a few houses directly on the gulf, which is across the road from the main part of town, walkovers and other devices are intended to open the beach to all residents.
A stroll through Seaside uncovers the real gold mine envisioned by St. Joe. It is largely a second-home community, and the signs outside most houses are hand-lettered with the names and hometowns of its residents: Atlanta; Memphis; New Orleans, Birmingham, Ala. These are the population centers, all within a day's drive, that St. Joe hopes will provide vacationers and second-home buyers for its first large development, tentatively called Seagrove.
"There is this wide arc that goes into Texas, up to Memphis and north of Atlanta, and the people within that arc are used to coming here," said Timothy D. Edmond, the Arvida vice president who is supervising the planning for Seagrove. "And, looking at Seaside, we know they have money to spend on second homes."
Seagrove has 1,400 feet of beautiful beach frontage on the gulf and 500 acres that wrap around Seaside. The first phase calls for a resort hotel more expensive and luxurious than anything in the region, some retail space and a beach club on the gulf side of the property. Vacation and retirement homes will follow on the other side of the road, winding along a freshwater lake and behind Seaside.
Master planning has already begun, and Mr. Edmond said the process of receiving governmental approvals was expected to be completed next year.
But that may be optimistic. Florida's development rules have become tougher in the last decade; here, as in other places transformed by breakneck growth, environmental concerns can cause delays in even the most environment-friendly projects.
"Some people don't like to see big, beautiful tracts of land developed," noted Paul F. Bryan, the Orlando-based president of LaSalle Partners Development, a unit of a Chicago real estate firm.
St. Joe's long-range plan is to get people to come to Seagrove for a vacation or convention, like what they see and decide to return, first in a vacation home and then as retirees. The theory is that once the place finds its center of gravity, services will follow that attract permanent residents.
Mr. Rummell acknowledges the work ahead. The region, for example, needs better medical services. "If you are 65 years old and you've started going to a cardiologist routinely," he said, "we have to make you comfortable that you can get quality care close to your home."
There are also plans to expand at least one runway at the nearby Panama City airport, which now can handle only short-hop aircraft, and discussions about a major feeder highway.
Local government is quite welcoming. Seagrove is in Walton County, a thousand square miles stretching from the Alabama border to the gulf. Except for the beachfront, the county is sparsely populated and generally eager for the jobs and prosperity promised by new development.
"A lot of the most valuable land has been purchased for preservation by the state, so it's off the tax rolls," said Tom Powell, executive director of the nonprofit Walton County Economic Development Council. "The county government realizes that its salvation is in the development of the remaining existing land."
Nowhere is the warmth of St. Joe's relationship with government more evident than southeast of Tallahassee, the state capital, where the company is planning Southwood, which it envisions as a neotraditional community of 12,000 people and 6,000 new homes on 3,200 acres of rolling land now covered with pine trees and dotted with lakes and ponds.
In a speech early this month in Tallahassee, Mr. Rummell offered free land for a future medical school under consideration by state legislators and promised to help improve roads in the surrounding county. "Others may build developments," he told the Economic Club of Florida. "We build towns."
The first public hearing on the project is scheduled for July. Already, though, the company has been meeting regularly with state and local officials and citizens groups.
State officials praised the willingness of St. Joe management to negotiate over the most sensitive issues, including affordable housing -- something that its predecessors never did in previous stabs at developing the land and a far cry from the days when Ed Ball dictated terms to Florida lawmakers.
"The old St. Joe categorically rejected providing affordable housing, and that's why they left town and never did the development," said Jim Murley, secretary of the Florida Department of Community Affairs. "The new management is doing education and housing and all the things that are important, not only for Southwood but for the region."
Mr. Rummell is convinced that there is money to be made in Florida with a kinder, gentler type of development. He says he does not foresee a Disney-like theme park or an Orlando-like megalopolis in western Florida. Instead, he envisions a series of towns and communities where people of all ages and economic means live in proximity. Rather than cutting off beach views with high-rise condominiums, he wants to build low-rise hotels and beach clubs that offer permanent access to residents who do not live on the beach.
"I think it's the right location at the right time," he said. "We can change the story of Florida development if we do it right."

HEADLINE: The World: East and Eden;
America Is Prosperous and Smug, Like Japan Was

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
COMPARING Japan's raw hubris in the late 1980's and America's in the late 90's has become the latest international parlor game. To economic forecasters, dispensers of global-sounding sound bites and nervous investors -- and who isn't nervous? -- the eerie similarities are a reminder of what can happen when boom times beget a boom psychology. First, Americans were sounding more and more like the Japanese did in late 1989, just before they reached the mountaintop and blindly stepped into the void. Now, by some measures, Americans are beginning to act like them too.
The Japan of 1989 was not only a place of booming Ferrari sales and lavish corporate entertainment, it was a place where expectations of limitless economic success washed over serious discussion of the economy's weaknesses. Bigger was always equated with "more global" -- and size alone was thought to be enough to immunize businesses, and the country, from bad decisions. Now Japan's biggest banks own the world's most globalized collection of bad debt, which has crippled the country's economy. 
 The America of 1998 is similarly a place of boundless confidence and rationalizations for ever-rising markets. It is also a place where many economic red flags -- in this case, low savings rates, income disparities, rising trade deficits -- are often lost in the din of the boom. And when Citicorp and Travelers Group explained the merits of their mega-merger last week, there were echoes of Japan's old logic -- bigger, the new partners said, meant more global.
 
Myths
 Of course, comparisons between the Japan of a decade ago and America today, however tempting, must be made with considerable care. Japan's boom created national myths like the one that the land under the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was worth more than all of Florida. It's a matter of debate whether America's boom is inflating such a bubble of overconfidence. But as anyone who lived in Tokyo then and lives in America now can testify, this country's economic strengths today run considerably deeper than Japan's ever did.
In the 80's and 90's, the United States endured a wave of downsizing, job-shifting and retooling that the Japanese put off and put off, convinced they could muddle through. "The structural differences, the sophistication of the American financial markets, are now so great that the economies are no longer easy to compare," said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management. But he warned that "every country at the top of its economic cycle grows enamored of its own system."
There is a lot of that in the air. As the Dow toyed with the 9,000 milestone last week, even one of the President's economic advisers found himself repeating the old saw that "the four most dangerous words in an ever-rising stock market are, 'It's different this time.' " And like Japan in the 80's, the United States has an astounding capability to preach the need for economic reform abroad while missing opportunities to do exactly that when times are prosperous at home.
Remember America's low personal savings rate, one of the favorite explanations for why rich Japan was lending money around the world and America was mired in debt? It's gotten worse: Americans saved 5.5 percent of their disposable income a decade ago, and 3.8 percent last year. The Japanese, astounding as it sounds, are actually saving more than ever, fearful that tomorrow morning that "lifetime job" could turn into very early retirement. (Tellingly, though, more Japanese are putting the money in personal safes, because they doubt the solvency of their own banks.)
 
Old Habits
 And remember those evil American trade deficits? This year they will break almost all records. In part, that is because Asian nations have stopped buying American goods, while desperately shipping stuff here to export their way out of their troubles.
But those numbers also suggest that America may not have improved its productivity as dramatically as some believe. Even with the recent rise in the value of the dollar, it's not clear why America should be running trade deficits at all.
To pay for all its imports, America is still borrowing abroad -- even from the Japanese, who would much rather have their money earn 5 percent here than 0.5 percent at home. In 1990, when borrowing foreign cash to buy foreign goods was decried as evidence of national weakness, about $458 billion in Treasury securities belonged to non-Americans. Today, the figure has risen to $1.2 trillion. But in the happy glow of the American boom, this is now interpreted as a sign of global confidence in the American economy.
"This is classic economic euphoria," says Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former head of the national economic council. "In prosperous times we overstate the good and understate the bad."
Her old boss, President Clinton, gingerly began to warn against this tendency last week, saying it's time "to bear down and do more in the good times, not to relax and pat ourselves on the back." But his grand national gab-a-thon about how to save the Social Security system, which began last week, may not be enough to lift Congress out of its ideological swamp.
The Japanese sidestepped lots of tough problems in the 80's as well, back when it was unimaginable that the chairman of Sony would warn, as he did recently, that the Japanese economy is "on the verge of collapse." Perhaps the biggest lesson of Japan's bitter decade is that it's a lot more expensive to fix an economy in recession than when it's running on autopilot.
Just look at the opening of Japan's huge securities and financial services markets to the likes of Fidelity, Goldman, Sachs and Citibank -- the so-called "Big Bang" that was delayed at the insistence of Japan's financial industry back when Japan bestrode the world.
The day finally arrived two weeks ago. But if the Japanese opened the financial market a decade ago, when money was everywhere, they could have spent billions to build software systems and lure world-class talent to take on Wall Street. Now, desperately trying to avoid bankruptcy, they don't have the cash to compete with the arriving foreign hordes.
 
Buying Out Japan
 Worse yet, the foreigners are buying out failed Japanese institutions. Merrill Lynch has snapped up the retail operations -- and the experienced employees -- of the failed Yamaichi Securities Company, a giant brokerage that collapsed last year. Other American companies are now trying to persuade rich, elderly Japanese that the best place for their money is in mutual funds that invest outside their own country. It's a tough sell in small towns in Kyushu, but it's beginning to work.
Amid all the American triumphalism about the demise of the Japanese model, though, there's a lot of politics under way in Washington that sounds familiar to anyone who has hung out in the corridors of the Japan's once-mighty Finance Ministry.
For sheer audacity, it is hard to match the Citicorp-Travelers merger. It is clearly forbidden by the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, designed to keep financial institutions from mingling federally insured bank deposits with Wall Street trading.
No one doubts that those laws need to be updated; they were designed to build protective walls for small-town banks like the one George Bailey ran in "It's a Wonderful Life," not the 24-hour global behemoths of currency swaps and derivatives. And since 1979, Congress has been frozen in place, sucking in campaign contributions from all the interest groups with billions riding on how the bills are tweaked. Citicorp even helped kill a bill two weeks ago that would have enabled the very kind of merger it is now trying to complete. But by announcing the merger and then insisting that Congress make it legal, Citicorp and Travelers are attempting to make Congress pass a bill that fits the deal.
Maybe that will finally break the logjam. But even Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, noted the irony last week that Congress is under pressure "to weaken our traditional barrier to combinations of commerce and banking, precisely the practice in Asia and elsewhere that we rail against as a major source of institutional weakness."
Japan is a testament to the risks of getting the mix wrong. Its banks rose on their holdings in the Japanese stock market, which emboldened them to lend money for wildly overpriced land deals. Then the stock market collapsed, the real estate market followed, the loans went bad and the banks ceased lending -- putting the Japanese economy into a seven-year-long deep freeze.
The Government is now pumping in taxpayer money to help the banks get rid of $600 billion in bad loans. It spent untold billions last month trying to buck up the stock market, and just announced a $76 billion emergency spending program that is probably not enough to revive the moribund economy.
So maybe, amid Washington's celebrations, it's worth getting some Congressional testimony from a laid-off Japanese bank executive or two. They certainly have time on their hands.

GRAPHIC: Chart:
 
TOKYO 1989 -- Finally, the Nikkei index touches 39,000. Japanese newspapers hail the new era, projecting how many years it will take for Japan's G.N.P. to overtake America's. Japan's revered bureaucrats send missions throughout Asia teaching neighbors how to replicate the Japanese model of capitalism. The country's huge banks, awash in cash, extend their global reach with huge loans abroad, and Finance Ministry regulators ease the rules over midnight karaoke with the bankers in Tokyo's hostess bars. Restaurants sprinkle sushi with gold leaf. Japanese leaders warn that America's lazy workers and huge budget deficits are dragging down the world economy.
 
NEW YORK 1998 -- Finally, the Dow hits 9,000. The Wall Street Journal's Op-Ed page declares the arrival of a new era: old measures of market risk no longer apply. Alan Greenspan, the Fed Chairman, says that the Japanese model of capitalism is dead. Citicorp and Travelers announce a mega-merger to extend their global reach -- but first they make courtesy calls to the Treasury Secretary and the President, because the deal violates laws separating banks, brokerages and insurance. Manhattan restaurants charge $4,000 for a $1,500 bottle of wine. The President sternly warns Japan that its political paralysis and inadequate economic initiatives threaten the world economy.

HEADLINE: Old Places, New Faces

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
SATURDAY is not Nathilee Caldeira's Sabbath, yet she feels a certain reverence for the day. As Orthodox Jews dressed for worship walk to synagogues, she and other blacks in the neighborhood go about their business. They do so with an understanding that it is a sacred day. "Somehow on Saturdays, nobody really gets crazy," she said.
Sunday is Ms. Caldeira's Sabbath. Her West Indian and African-American neighbors dress for church and walk to bus stops. The Orthodox Jews go about their business, she said, but with a similarly respectful air, a certain mutedness. "It is understood between the communities," said Ms. Caldeira, 29, a research assistant at a hospital. 
 She and the Jews in her neighborhood are not friends, she said -- "There is no contact" -- but there is no tension either. "The media make such a hullabaloo about relations between Jews and blacks," she said, "but it actually runs quite smoothly." The focus of that hullabalo, of course, is Crown Heights, but that is not where Ms. Caldeira lives. Since she and her family arrived from Guyana a decade ago, they have made their home in a less scrutinized, more southern pocket of Brooklyn, between Midwood and Flatlands, in a triangle bounded by Nostrand Avenue to the west, Flatbush Avenue to the east and Kings Highway to the south.
Around them, "For Sale" signs sprout like spring daffodils, signposts of a continuing, quiet departure of Italians, Irish and secular Jews over the last decade, reflecting an exodus seen throughout southern Brooklyn. In Ms. Caldeira's neighborhood, their places are being taken mostly by West Indians seeking homes in quiet, stable communities and by Orthodox Jews crowded or priced out of Midwood.
In other neighborhoods, the trail of newcomers is similar, whether the settlers are recent immigrants or Orthodox Jews seeking more space for their growing families. They want housing: affordable starter homes for some, larger upgrades for others. And they end up colonizing new neighborhoods. Even working- and middle-class blacks, still kept out of many neighborhoods by an invisible color line, are settling in previously impenetrable terrain. The result is new ethnic enclaves in some places and new hybrid communities in others.
The old-timers in neighborhoods like Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay will tell you that the local stalwarts, the Irish and Italians, are departing for other shores -- New Jersey, Staten Island, Long Island or upstate New York. Real estate agents say the same thing. "At this end of Brooklyn," said Anthony Nasti, the president of Coldwell Banker Mid Plaza, "there are not a large number of second-time home buyers."
In the past, blacks most likely would have filled the places left by vacating whites. That is what happened in the 60's and 70's in neighborhoods farther east like Brownsville and East New York. But in southern Brooklyn in the 1990's the immigrants filling the void left by whites are mainly Russian and Chinese; some are Hispanic or Arab. Immigrants, Mr. Nasti said, make up about half the home buyers he sees. Most are Russians, whose ranks grew to an estimated 6.7 percent of the borough's population in 1996 from 3.2 percent in 1991, according to Department of Housing Preservation and Development -- the largest increase among any population group.
Brighton Beach realtors say there are typically five applicants for every empty apartment, and many Russians have left Brighton Beach behind. A swelling middle class is buying homes in Manhattan Beach, Sheepshead Bay, Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst, among other neighborhoods.
"Middle-class working Russian immigrants are probably the hungriest for the American way, and the fastest learners of it," Mr. Nasti said. "They are making investments in real estate."
The Russians are also pushing north into Midwood, where they are filling apartments, buying homes and establishing businesses along Ocean Avenue and Coney Island Avenue, mostly south of where a sizeable Pakistani community has done the same thing. The Pakistanis, too, are buying homes and pushing their boundaries north and east, along Church Avenue.
The Orthodox and Sephardic Jewish communities, who have long had a beachhead in Midwood, are growing rapidly as well. Their close-knit families cluster around synagogues and yeshivas, and their prosperity is evident in real estate. Along Bedford Avenue and on surrounding streets, the Jews are not just buying but building: renovating and expanding already large homes and even tearing down some homes and building bigger ones on the lots.
"Palatial is the only word I can use to describe it," said Alvin Berk, the chairman of Community Board 14, speaking of houses that filled back-to-back lots on Bedford Avenue and on parallel streets. And Orthodox Jews are expanding the boundaries of the neighborhood, pushing westward past Ocean Parkway or eastward past Nostrand Avenue.
All these groups -- Pakistanis, Russians, ultra-Orthodox, Hasidic and Sephardic Jews -- are advancing northward, along McDonald Avenue, Ocean Parkway, Coney Island Avenue and the streets in between. A Muslim center is being built on Cortelyou Road between East 16th and 17th Streets, and Bangladeshi businesses are opening around the intersection of Church and McDonald Avenues. Ultra-Orthodox and Sephardic Jews are moving north on Ocean Parkway as well.
And the ranks of Russian residents in Flatbush and Kensington are growing as well, as the recent opening of a Russian bath on Coney Island Avenue between Cortelyou Road and Avenue C reflects. Slowly, the Russians are diversifying the edges of Caribbean and African-American areas.
"On Church Avenue, you're seeing white faces, and a lot are Russian," said Francois Pierre-Louis, a Haitian-American who directs the Community Action Project, a church-based group in Flatbush. "You never would have seen that a few years ago."
 
Loving Lox but Missing The Italian Butcher
 All over Brooklyn's southern different languages can be heard, and different cultures and customs observed. An Italian baker who has lived in Bay Ridge his whole life, pondering the departure of many longtime customers for Staten Island, struggles to identify just where the "dark people" come from. He is referring to the area's more recently arrived Arabs, and he expresses bafflement at the kinds of breads they bake.
Farther north, Yolanda Lawrence considers the changes that have come since she bought a co-op at the northern end of Ocean Parkway 12 years ago. She moved into a neighborhood whose residents were mainly elderly Jews. No problem. Ms. Lawrence, who is black, said she loves lox and loves having her hair set for $17 with the "little old Jewish ladies" at the beauty parlor around the corner. The mix on her hallway -- elderly black and Jewish people, interracial couples, young white and black professionals like herself -- has been just right, she says.
But the elderly are moving out or dying, and taking their place are immigrants. Many are Russian, some are Caribbean, others are Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi; some are from Hispanic groups.
It amuses Ms. Lawrence, for now, that a local store carries birthday cards in Russian but not English. But she misses Carmine the Italian butcher and his gourmet cheeses. Carmine, she said, was replaced by halal and kosher competitors. And she dislikes having to go to Park Slope to buy chives because nearby storekeepers no longer stock them.
When Ms. Lawrence bought her co-op, she recalls, the board of her building examined her finances closely. So she wonders how a family of 12, recently discovered living in one apartment in the building, managed to bypass such screening. She is angry that someone is peeling the wallpaper in the hallways.
Ms. Lawrence, who works in sales in Manhattan, plans to keep an eye on things. She says that if "undesirables" continue to move into her building -- and if more local stores start stocking borscht instead of basil -- she may eventually move out. She is watching for what sociologists call "tipping."
Ms. Lawrence is an example of a new variation on an old phenomenon: a black woman watching to see how people of different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds reshape her neighborhood.
Yet she knows that in many neighborhoods, particularly to the south, she is still the one who would be watched.
In Brooklyn, moving up the economic ladder has meant in part moving south toward the water. But except for Community District 13, which contains the largely black Coney Island and Marlboro public housing projects, a tiny proportion of blacks have historically breached Brooklyn's southern districts.
"The racial line of black/white has remained much much much stronger than the person-of-color line," said Philip Kasinitz, an associate professor of sociology at CUNY, comparing the relative ease with which Hispanic and Asians have moved into certain neighborhoods with the difficulties encountered by many blacks. The exception, Mr. Kasinitz said, are Puerto Ricans who are treated like "virtual blacks."
Studies have shown that many blacks prefer integrated neighborhoods, which they define as half black and half white, but that they do not want to live in predominatly white neighborhoods they perceive as unwelcoming. "Some neighborhoods are not yet ready for black people," said Cedma Mark, 40, citing Sheepshead Bay and Bensonhurst, "and I don't want to be a hero."
What Ms. Mark and many middle-class blacks want are safe streets, good schools and peace and quiet -- qualities sometimes scarce in impoverished areas, as is affordable, middle-class housing.
"There are a lot of black dollars chasing relatively scarce black housing," Mr. Kasinitz said, explaining that that is why, when a neighborhood settled by new immigrants is perceived as friendly, "you see a huge African-American influx."
"It goes from 10 percent to 50 percent very quickly," he said.
That has happened neighborhods like East Flatbush, and in the last decade in Ms. Mark's neighborhood, Canarsie, as an aging population began selling homes and moving out. As housing opened up, blacks sometimes braved open hostility -- and sometimes paid inflated prices -- to move in. As more did, Irish, Italians, and Jews who had laready fled one black influx moved south or left the borough.
Now Caribbeans and African Americans are moving further south. Some are leaving neighborhoods like East Flatbush. Some are even leaving Canarsie, according to Dorothy Gurano, the district manager for Community Board 18, which includes Canarsie, Georgetown, Flatlands, Marine Park, Mill Basin and Bergen Beach.
They are replaced by what Ms. Guarano called "less-desirables" who sometimes live two or three families to a house. "We are getting a lot of reports of auto repairs being done in the street," she said.
Some of those leaving Canarsie are returning to Caribbean islands; some are moving to the suburbs, and others are going south, to Flatlands, Marine Park, even Mill Basin, "to see if they can get a better life for themselves," Ms. Gurano said. As they do so, once again the whites seem to be leaving.
Jean Chenet, a Haitian who works in the payroll department at the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, moved to the Flatlands area from Flatbush in 1990. He had lived in a suburb of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and wanted a quiet area in Brooklyn. It took him two years to find a place he could afford.
Mr. Chenet, 59, was the first nonwhite on his block; since then, one by one, whites have been moving out. Jamaicans, other Haitians and African-Americans have moved in.
"I was surprised to see that the people coming in weren't very mixed," he said, with a touch of bewilderment in his voice. "Apparently when black people move into a neighborhood, everybody's out." By everybody, he meant the whites.
Estimates from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development for the Flatlands/Canarsie area show a drop in the white population from 64.6 percent to 47.5 percent from 1991 to 1996, and a corresponding increase in the black population from 24.6 to 43.3 percent. Those numbers suggest that yet another neighborhood is being unstitched and restitched.
Susan Field, who has lived a few blocks from Mr. Chenet's home for 14 years, said realtors had actively sought to turn the neighborhood over by encouraging blacks to move in. State officials are investigating charges of block-busting, the use of racial and ethnic scare tactics to prompt residents to sell.
Ms. Field has a "For Sale" sign outside her house, just a few blocks from Mr. Chenet. In part, she wants a bigger house for her three children. But she also said that for people like her, the product of earlier immigrants from Europe, life in Brooklyn was no longer so appealing.
"Immigrants of prior generations are moving up the ladder, moving to Long Island, New Jersey," she said, adding: "It's not like we could look in our own neighborhood" for a new, bigger house "because of the changes."
The changes she meant are the arrival of black, particularly Caribbean, residents. "Real estates," as she calls brokers, show houses only to blacks, she said; the result is that a once heterogeneous neighborhood with a few blacks is turning into a black one. When a white person comes to look at her house, she said, "I know they're an investor, wanting to buy the house way below value and then turn it over quickly" because they know new immigrants will pay higher prices.
The neighborhood is changing in all sorts of ways, she said. Most of the newcomers were two-income families, working so hard that no sense of community congealed. "It is not a bad neighborhood," Mrs. Field said, "but it is a sterile neighborhood."
The local Roman Catholic church no longer has enough children for a baseball league; an interparish league had been formed. White children were leaving the schools, and white families the neighborhood.
"I'm not scared," she said. "I'm not running. I will move when I get my price."
 
Something Ununusual: Whites Replacing Whites
 This pattern has been repeated time and again southern Brooklyn. But in the Flatlands area something unusual is happening: as whites move out, other whites are moving in. They are Orthodox Jews, unable to find houses in Midwood or unable to afford them. Houses to the east of Nostrand Avenue, between Kings Highway and Avenue J, are within walking distance of synagogues, but they cost up to $100,000 less than in Midwood. So Orthodox Jews are "turning" blocks, too.
One woman, who refused to give her name, said that, much like Mr. Chenet, she was the only Orthodox resident, although not the only Jew, when she moved onto her block 12 years ago. "The kids were really nervous, because they had no one to play with," she said. Now they have plenty of playmates.
Mark Colton, 39, is an Orthodox Jew who moved east of Nostrand Avenue four years ago. Since then, he said, nine Orthodox families have bought homes on his block; in somecases, the sellers were secular Jews.
"You typically think of older Jews receding before younger blacks," Mr. Kasinitz, the CUNY associate professor, said of the two groups. "Here they are both young, with similar incomes."
Often, the groups seem unaware of each other, creating mini-enclaves as small as a block. "There are pockets, I suppose," Mr. Colton said of the West Indians in the neighborhood, oblivious to the West Indian man washing his car across the street. Marsha Waltuch, an observant Jew who has lived on her block for 44 years, said the Orthodox influx delighted her. "I don't think so," she said when asked if blacks lived in her neighborhood. "Well, they're on 35th Street, but not on this block." Ms. Waltuch lives on East 34th Street.
For now, such segregation within integration limits direct competition for housing, though some West Indians said they thought they paid more for houses and apartments than Orthodiz Jewish newcomers. A need for different size housing also limits competition. Because they generally have large families, the Orthodox Jews often need larger houses. It is possible that one group will accumulate more money or more residents and buy out the other group, but few people seem to think so.
Brought together by opportunity and necessity, the two groups ar molding a new southern Brooklyn. Nathillie Caldeira pondered Crown Heights and the riots that resulted there in 1991 after a black youngster, Gavin Cato, was struck by an ambulance driven by a Hasidic Jew.
"I don't know if something like that could happen here," Ms. Caldeira said. "I don't think so." Her neighborhood is more affluent, she said, and thus less tense.
And then she pondered the mystery of co-existence without contact. Neither her Orthodox Jewish nor her black and West Indian neighbors greet one another. No one says hello. "If someone were to make the effort," she asked, "would there be tension, or would it go smoothly?"
 
On the Books but Not Always in Practice
Every morning, Phyllis Spiro leaves her Sheepshead Bay apartment and boards a subway bound for SoHo. Her trip takes her through neighborhoods that are models of diversity: mixtures of Russians and Chinese, Pakistanis and Orthodox Jews.
As the train crosses Avenue J and moves northward through Flatbush, the neighborhoods become mostly African-American and Caribbean. Such divisions are so entrenched that many people don't even notice them.
Phyllis Spiro does. Diminutive and raspy-voiced, she calls herself the "old lady of fair housing." The deputy director of the Open Housing Center, a nonprofit group that fights housing discrimination, she has been battling for New Yorkers to be able to live where they please since the 1960's.
Thirty years ago this weekend, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act, making it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. The state and city also have fair housing laws. But time has shown that enforcing laws is as crucial as passing them.
It would be a stretch to attribute segregation in southern Brooklyn primarily to discrimination by real estate agents, brokers or landlords. But studies have shown that bias does play a role in housing decisions, whether in redlining or racial steering. In 1989, for example, the Urban Institute conducted 3,800 housing audits, using testers of different races, in 25 metropolitan areas. The study found that 53 percent of black renters and 59 percent of black home buyers could be expected to encounter at least one incident of discrimination.
Yet the number of formal complaints filed in New York City doesn't reflect those results. For example, Adam Glantz, a spokesman for the New York City office of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, said 597 cases citing discrimination on the basis of race or national origin had been filed in the city since 1989; of those, 17 had been found to have "reasonable cause" and 115 were resolved through conciliation; the rest were withdrawn or found to have no "reasonable cause" for a hearing.
Some realtors and city officials point to the small number of complaints as evidence that discrimination is not widespread. It tends to be the product of a "few bad apples," said Jacob Shayovitz, the president of the Brooklyn Board of Realtors.
But fair housing advocates say the low number of complaints reflects the sheer effort required to bring a case and to the fact that real estate clients often did not know they had been discriminated against.
"Discrimination is difficult to detect and prove without testing," Mr. Schill said.
The city does not do systemic testing, said Lorna Goodman, director of affirmative litigation for the Corporation Counsel, unless a complaint comes in. There are currently no investigations under way.
Ultimately, much of the work of fair housing enforcement in the city falls to the Open Housing Center, which receives thousands of complaints each year. In three or four cases, the Center files suit in Federal court. Most defendants settle, with monetary payments to the plaintiffs. AMY WALDMAN

THE ECONOMY
Producer Prices Slide
Producer prices fell an unexpected 0.3 percent in March. The drop, the fifth monthly decline in a row, came amid healthy growth in the eighth year of the economy's expansion, belying fears that low unemployment -- 4.7 percent at present -- might lead to inflationary pressures. Even when volatile food and energy costs were excluded, prices were unchanged. In another sign of a robust economy, retailers reported strong March sales. The Goldman, Sachs same-store index, which measures major retailers' sales in stores open at least one year, rose 3.4 percent, and some stores were even stronger. Wal-Mart reported a 6.2 percent gain. 

ASIA
In Japan, Half a Loaf?
Under pressure from world leaders, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, below, proposed Japan's largest package yet of tax cuts and new spending -- $75 billion, or about 2 percent of total annual economic output -- to reverse an economic decline that could have ripple effects on other big economies. But investors feared the package would be inadequate to avert a recession. The Japanese central bank had to intervene in the currency market to support the yen, and the stock market fell 55.54 points on Friday, to 16,481.12. Still, there was one bright spot in Asia's seemingly unrelenting economic gloom. South Korea, destitute just four months ago, won an enormous vote of confidence from investors around the world with the successful sale of $4 billion in Government bonds.
 
CITIGROUP
Big, Bigger, Gargantuan
Throwing down the gauntlet to Washington, Sanford I. Weill of Travelers Group, below left, and John S. Reed of Citicorp announced plans to merge their institutions, forming the world's largest financial services concern. The deal was valued at $70 billion in stock when it was announced on Monday, and shares of the two companies immediately surged, pushing up the value by $14 billion that day. Some of those gains had been trimmed by week's end as investors began to see potential problems. The big one is the nation's longstanding legal bars to combining banks and insurers. Citicorp and Travelers are gambling that they can use their political muscle and sheer weight in the marketplace to break down the barriers to creating vast financial supermarkets.
 
MARKETS
A Display of Optimism
After flirting with 9,000 a week earlier, the Dow Jones industrial average managed to close above that milestone on Monday, only to back and fill as the week wore on. Still, its close of 8,994.86 after a short trading week, up 11.45 points from the previous week, showed that investors were displaying remarkable optimism in the face of an expected slide in corporate earnings. I.B.E.S. International forecasts a decline of 0.4 percent in first-quarter operating earnings for the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's index. But two sectors -- oil and technology, which have already been discounted in the market -- account for a large portion of the drop. In contrast, General Electric reported a 13 percent gain and Chrysler exceeded estimates with a 2.9 percent increase.
 
TOBACCO
Coming Out Smokin'
The leading American cigarette manufacturers went on the offensive against legislation approved by the Senate Commerce Committee that would cost them far more than the $368.5 billion settlement they agreed to last June, saying they would no longer work for comprehensive legislation to regulate tobacco. Steven F. Goldstone, chairman of RJR Nabisco, said in a speech at the National Press Club that his company would begin aggressively advertising cigarettes and fighting for its position in court. Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard Tobacco quickly issued statements supporting Mr. Goldstone's position. House Speaker Newt Gingrich lambasted the industry and promised legislation to fight smoking among teen-agers.
 
AIRCRAFT
Rewiring Urged for Safety
The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that thousands of aircraft built by Boeing and other companies be rewired to reduce the risk of a fuel tank explosion like the one that investigators say destroyed Trans World Airlines Flight 800 two years ago. The board said the low-voltage wires that run from the cockpit to the fuel gauges should not be bundled with wires that carry high-voltage electricity; if the wiring is damaged, current could jump from one to the other and ignite fumes in the tank. Boeing said it was working with the board and the F.A.A. to address fuel tank concerns.
 
DEALS
Lenders United
Other financial services companies also announced plans to merge. Beneficial and Household International, which have competed with each other to provide consumer loans for most of this century, agreed to a stock swap valued at nearly $9 billion. Also, two companies known for controversial accounting methods will merge: Conseco, an insurance conglomerate, will acquire Green Tree Financial, which lends money to people who buy mobile homes, in a deal that Conseco says is worth $7.6 billion.
 
AUTO SAFETY
Protection on the Way
More cars will soon have side air bags. The Ford Motor Company, expressing concern about the death rate of people in cars hit from the side, will offer side air bags in the front seats on all of its cars and Ford Windstar mini-vans over the next several years. General Motors already offers side air bags on a half-dozen of its 81 models and plans to add 15 more over the next two years. Chrysler, which offers no side air bags, is reviewing whether to add them. Federal regulators, insurance industry researchers and the auto makers' own safety experts have grown increasingly worried that the spread of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which ride higher than cars, may mean that more collisions will be deadly.
 
ECONOMISTS
The New Superstars
Perhaps it ought not be surprising that people who study money are demanding more of it for themselves. But more than a few eyebrows were raised when Columbia University lured away Robert J. Barro of Harvard, one of the nation's most distinguished economists, with pay of nearly $300,000 a year and a cornucopia of perks and privileges for his entire family -- a choice Manhattan apartment, tuition for private school for his son and a university post for his wife. The Columbia provost, Jonathan R. Cole, ruefully calls top economists "free agents without salary caps." Still, the university, eager to reclaim its rightful position as a top school for economics, took the action it considered necessary.

HEADLINE: Audits Spread Unevenly Across U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Nothing touches off panic in taxpayers more than the prospect of an audit. But there are such wide disparities across the country in who gets audited that residents in New York City and its suburbs continue to be treated with kid gloves by the Internal Revenue Service while those in California have been hit comparatively hard.
Part of the reason for the difference is that the I.R.S. has been looking harder in California for people who do not file tax returns, but it is also because the agency relies on a decade-old study of taxpayer behavior that critics call obsolete. 
 Newly released I.R.S. data, obtained by researchers at Syracuse University, show that Los Angeles County taxpayers are four times as likely to be audited as those in New Jersey, even though the two areas have roughly the same population and the same average income.
Meantime, under a financial squeeze, the I.R.S. has reduced the number of audits it conducts of suspected fraudulent returns -- as opposed to those that are merely erroneous -- by nearly 75 percent, the data show. But such is the unpredictability of the I.R.S.'s tax-monitoring activity that huge disparities in the number of such fraud investigations have developed in the New York City metropolitan region.
In the highest-income district in the United States -- Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and Westchester and Rockland Counties -- fraud audits fell to 208 in 1996 from 628 in 1992. In Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, they declined to 155 from 575, and in upstate New York, they dropped to 142 from 514. In the Connecticut-Rhode Island district, they tumbled to a minuscule 57 from 848.
Such seeming capriciousness in the distribution of both ordinary and fraud audits is certain to fuel the political debate -- heating up again as Congressional elections approach -- about overhauling or even replacing the current income tax system.
The new tax information was obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research arm of Syracuse University that for years has pursued lawsuits and other tactics to obtain data from the service. The data disclose another trend that is likely to add to popular disenchantment with the I.R.S.: Back taxes and penalties are increasing for the poor and declining for the rich.
This shift is largely a result of a 1995 directive from Congress for the I.R.S. to monitor the tax returns of the working poor more thoroughly -- not only to collect unpaid taxes but also to make sure people eligible for the earned-income credit, a form of negative income tax, do not get more than they are supposed to.
Between 1992 and 1996, the average increase in the tax bill that I.R.S. auditors recommended for those making less than $25,000 more than doubled, to almost $5,700 from $2,500, while for those making more than $100,000 it fell 14.5 percent, to $19,700 from $23,000.
This year, 174 million Americans must file an estimated 124 million individual and joint returns before midnight on Wednesday. About 1 in 150 are expected to be audited; in 1996, the last year for which figures are available, 760,197 returns out of 115.4 million got the I.R.S. once-over.
The agency bases decisions on which returns to audit on several factors, including suspicions about the integrity of the preparer or information from a related return -- for example, one filed by a business partner caught cheating.
But it also gives huge weight to statistical departures from norms established in a 1988 study -- a study that critics say is outdated because of the huge changes in the American economy since then, from the Wall Street bull market to the explosion in the ranks of the self-employed.
The 1988 research was conducted by picking thousands of taxpayers at random and making them prove each entry on their return.
By gaining such full disclosure from a broad cross section of the population, the I.R.S. was able to determine how much people in various income groups actually gave to charities, paid in state and local taxes, spent on medical care and allocated to other tax-deductible costs. It then devised a statistical formula -- known as the "dif score," for discriminant function -- and focused on taxpayers who deviated the most from the norms.
More than one-third of all 1996 audits were based on dif scores, but there are geographic incongruities, from 1 out of every 110 returns in Los Angeles to 1 in 1,000 in New Jersey and 1 in 1,428 in the Carolinas.
The disparities in overall auditing rates were narrower, ranging from 1 in 62 in the two I.R.S. districts covering Southern California to 1 in 278 in upstate New York and 1 in 294 in Ohio. In the New York City region, the overall rates ranged from 1 in 133 in the Manhattan tax district that includes its northern suburbs; 1 in 172 in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island; 1 in 167 in Connecticut and Rhode Island, and 1 in 238 in New Jersey.
In interviews, three former I.R.S. commissioners all criticized the continued use of the old study. "The taxpayer-compliance measurement data are obsolete," said Donald C. Alexander, a tax partner at Aiken & Gump in Washington and the tax commissioner in the Nixon Administration. Margaret Richardson, who resigned last May, and Fred T. Goldberg Jr., who served in the Bush Administration, said that they agreed, but Mr. Goldberg added the service needed to find new ways to identify citizens who evaded taxes.
In 1995, the I.R.S. planned to update the profiles by putting 93,000 individuals and 63,000 companies through similarly intense audits, but the Republicans eliminated money for the project.
The I.R.S., of course, looks at more than just dif scores. Thomas J. Smith, the assistant commissioner for audits, said that Californians were audited the most because "the characteristics of their returns" indicate a greater likelihood that more taxes may be due. Californians have more income from self-employment and business activities that the I.R.S. has found prone to abuse than do residents of New Jersey, for example, and the super-rich in California are much wealthier than those in New Jersey.
Aside from the cumbersomeness of the tax-collection process, the biggest problem the I.R.S. faces is a budget squeeze. The agency has fewer auditors and agents to examine returns now than in 1988 -- 27,375 today compared with 31,895 then, a 14 percent decline.
Meanwhile the number of individual income tax returns grew to 115.4 million from 103.2 million in 1988, an increase of 11.8 percent.
The Syracuse University clearinghouse collects information from Federal computers, compiles it and posts it on the Internet at http:// www.trac.syr.edu with the aim of improving public understanding of how the Government functions.
"The I.R.S. has such power over the average citizen that people need to understand it," said Prof. Susan Long, the co-director of the clearinghouse. "Taxes are the one area of the law, other than traffic cops, where the ordinary citizen is likely to come into contact with law enforcement, and the most painful area of contact is the audit."

HEADLINE: Aid Groups Are Hands That Help In Bosnia

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: BRCKO, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
Every month, the brain trust of the local chapter of Bosnia's "mini-Marshall Plan" -- the military, the United Nations and voluntary agencies known as NGO's -- meets in a revived neighborhood of concrete office buildings and smoky pizza parlors to plan how to spend the next allotment of hundreds of thousands of dollars to rebuild the region.
"We can report that we've seen a school that needs a playground," Capt. Victoria Wolfe, a civil affairs officer in the United States Army, said at one recent meeting. "That's where we coordinate with the NGO's," she said. 
 Three years after the Dayton peace plan committed the countries of NATO and international organiza tions to rebuilding the shattered economy of Bosnia, the $7 billion spent annually for everything from NATO troops to new brick factories is beginning to pay off.
The central goal of the Dayton Plan -- to get the Muslims, the Serbs and the Croats of Bosnia to live together again -- is as elusive as ever. The communities remain partitioned, and most refugees have not been able to return to homes seized by members of other ethnic groups. But the reconstruction of the country is picking up speed.
Fields are being tilled. Abandoned villages are being reclaimed house by house. Churches and mosques have been rebuilt -- more frequently than schools -- and cafes and sausage joints are opening. Roads are becoming navigable, electricity is more common than not and telephone service now connects the entire country.
Those largely responsible for this effort are the NGO's, or nongovernmental organizations. There are nearly 200 here, from 24 countries, and this year alone they will spend some $1 billion, according to Christopher Miller, spokesman for the World Bank in Bosnia.
"You could say that the U.N., the European Community, even the U.S. A.I.D. programs all walk on the legs of the NGO's," said Jim Bishop of Interaction, a voluntary agency based in Washington.
There has never been as large an assemblage of voluntary agencies as here in Bosnia, nor have they ever before been given such broad responsibility. Some economists and bankers fear there are too many, viewing them as an occupation force of foreigners who are smothering the incentive of Bosnians to take over the reconstruction of their country.
NGO projects cover medical, social and commercial rehabilitation: loans for start-up businesses; counseling for widows and angry veterans; reopening of schools and job training programs; repairing of houses; provision of medical care, and establishment of human rights and democratic organizations.
In Sarajevo alone some 16,000 foreigners have taken up residence. They prowl the city's narrow streets in white jeeps with their agencies' acronyms emblazoned on the side. They have regular watering holes like the Internet Cafe. Even the city buses -- painted in the signature blue of the European Union with its gold stars -- are a mobile advertisement for the Europeans who donated them.
When the military, the international organizations and the voluntary agencies hold their coordination meetings in Sarajevo they involve more than donation lists. The military briefs the group on the latest security incidents, flashing computer-generated slides on the walls noting the sites of ethnic clashes. Then the country's fortunes are measured in projects totaling billions of dollars.
"It's far more like being in a James Bond movie than most of our other meetings," a participant said.
While the profile of the NGO's has been rising for years, the movement has come into its own in the last few years. Last year the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to one of their own: the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.
Now in Bosnia the unwieldy collection of NGO's are being asked to prove their worth in an unusual situation. Most cut their teeth on disasters in Asia and Africa, but their duties were strict disaster relief: providing food, water, shelter and medical care.
"All of a sudden we're in the middle of Europe where we're being asked to rehabilitate infrastructures and rebuild brick houses," said Nick Scott-Flynn of the NGO umbrella group, the International Council of Voluntary Agencies. "We come from situations where there were no solid houses and no infrastructure."
Critics contend that the rest of the reconstruction should be up to the Bosnians now. Mr. Scott-Flynn counters that the foreign NGO's have helped create 177 local Bosnian NGO's, which are being trained to take over the basic tasks now done by the foreigners.
Dismissing the complaints against the NGO's, Amanda M. Fernandez of Catholic Relief Services said: "We do the daily work that has to be done. We have to be here."

HEADLINE: Political Interests Arouse Raging Debate on Census

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Two years from the start of the 2000 Census, it is shaping up as the most contentious in 80 years, generating a firestorm of debate and strategizing in Congress and litigation aimed at blocking the Census Bureau from changing the way it does business.
Over the last year, the dispute over the bureau's plans to alter its method of counting the population delayed passage of a disaster relief bill for victims of flooding in the Midwest, prompted Congress and the Clinton Administration to set up an outside board to monitor the bureau and generated two lawsuits, including one by Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
 Congress has ordered the traditionally apolitical Census Bureau to draft two plans for conducting the census -- one the old way and one using the proposed new method, statistical sampling, which is at the center of the dispute.
"This is quite a battle," said Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, and one of the few members of his party to support the proposed changes.
The fight is the most heated since the 1920 census, when rural lawmakers, aghast that the headcount documented for the first time that more people lived in cities than in rural areas, refused to use the results to reapportion the House of Representatives.
At issue this time is the Census Bureau's plan to forgo its traditional, and some experts say failing, method of trying to physically count every person in the country. Instead, the bureau proposes to try to count all the people in 90 percent of the households in each census tract, which is a geographical area consisting of about 1,700 dwellings.
Using those figures, bureau statisticians would try to determine the number of people in the tract who had not been physically counted. The bureau would then check for accuracy by conducting a survey of 750,000 households nationwide and making any needed adjustments to the final total.
The statistical sampling plan was prompted by the 1990 census, which cost $2.6 billion, a 400 percent increase over the previous headcount, in 1980, even after adjusting for inflation. The 1990 effort missed 10 million people and double-counted 6 million, according to Census Bureau studies and a study by the National Research Council, an arm of National Academy of Sciences.
Most Republicans vigorously oppose the plan for sampling, arguing that it violates the Constitution, Article I, which calls for an "actual enumeration" every 10 years, and that it is much too complex for the Census Bureau to perform successfully.
But the proposal is staunchly supported by many Democrats who assert that it is the only way to get an accurate tally of minorities -- particularly inner-city blacks and Hispanic migrant workers, who are traditionally the hardest to count.
Beneath the assertions about constitutionality and fairness and the discussion over statistical methods lies a raw political fight that is based on race and redistricting. And the outcome, some experts say, could be critical to which party controls the House and state legislatures in the beginning of the next century.
Both sides say the Census Bureau's sampling method would probably help Democrats and harm Republicans, but no one is quite sure.
Sampling may increase the count of minorities, primarily blacks who are the Democrats' most loyal voters, in some Congressional and state legislative districts. Since these districts tend to be safe ones for Democrats, boundaries could be redrawn by state legislatures to shift some of the "surplus" black voters into neighboring white districts, making these districts more competitive for the Democrats.
"The Republicans are very much aware of this," said one Democratic redistricting expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "That's why they're fighting it. They're scared they're going to lose the House. Frankly, I don't see that it would make a 15- to 20-seat difference. It might make a 6-, 8- or 10-seat difference. But given the situation we have right now, that's huge."
Indeed, the Republicans are very much aware. Some even argue strongly that the reasons the party has a slim majority in the House have less to do with ideology and more with the fact that the 1990 census was conducted in the traditional way.
In his new book "Lessons Learned the Hard Way"(HarperCollins), Mr. Gingrich described last year's fight over the issue, in which the Republicans tried to force the Census Bureau to scuttle its plan to use sampling, as being "of great importance to the welfare of our party." In a meeting with Republican House members then, he called sampling a "dagger pointed at the heart" of Republican control of the chamber.
Last year, Jim Nicholson, national chairman of the Republican National Committee, sent a memorandum to his state chairmen, urging them to join in the fight against statistical sampling, saying the new method could jeopardize 24 House seats, 113 State Senate seats and 297 State House seats.
"At stake is our G.O.P. majority in the House of Representatives as well as partisan control of state legislatures nationwide," Mr. Nichols wrote.
Most experts contend that Mr. Nicholson and others exaggerate the political consequences of sampling. Still, Amos R. McMullian, president of Flowers Industries and a contributor to Republican candidates, sent out a fund-raising letter in February that used those figures and asked for contributions to help a conservative legal group, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, challenge the constitutionality of sampling.
This lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, is similar to the one filed by Mr. Gingrich in Federal District Court in Washington. Both lawsuits assert that sampling violates the Constitution's requirement that the Government conduct an "actual enumeration" of the population every 10 years.
Democrats say that using sampling is the right thing to do, but they are also aware of the political advantage the new method could bring them. In 1990, the bureau used a modified version of sampling, conducting a nationwide survey to determine who was missed. The bureau then proposed adjusting the final numbers based on that survey.
But the Bush Administration refused to adjust the census, prompting a lawsuit by several cities, including New York, in an effort to force the Commerce Department -- which oversees the Census Bureau -- to do so. The lawsuit failed. Some members of the Clinton Administration have vowed that the census setbacks the Democrats suffered in 1990 would not be repeated.
The raging political wars have baffled and demoralized the Census Bureau itself. Situated in nearby Suitland, Md., and with only 2 political appointees among more than 10,000 employees, the bureau is one of the most apolitical of all Federal agencies.
Census officials say they came up with the plan for statistical sampling at the behest of lawmakers in both parties to reduce costs and increase accuracy. Now they find themselves in a political maelstrom.
"We have gone about doing our work with the assumption that we should be looking at solutions that produce the best results," said James F. Holmes, the bureau's Acting Director. "The political side is something that we have not given a lot of thought to."
Despite the political ramifications of the census fight, House Democrats have complained that the Clinton Administration has not shown sufficient resolve in the battle.
Two months after Martha Farnsworth Riche resigned as the bureau Director while intense political wrangling was taking place, the Administration has only recently begun interviewing people to replace her. The White House has also just announced its four choices for the eight-member outside monitoring board, which was agreed upon in November. The Republicans announced their four choices in January.
The Democratic appointees, announced this week, are Everett C. Erhlich, former Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs; Tony Coehlo, a former House whip; Gilbert Casellas, former chairman of the Equal Opportunity Commission, and Lorraine Green, former Deputy Director of the Office of Personnel Management.
And, though President Clinton promised House Democrats in November that he would make the census fight a major priority, he has not uttered a word in public on the subject since.
"There has not been the total commitment on the Administration's part to this issue," said Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey.

An Eminent Voice Pleads for the Soul of Rutgers

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
The struggle for the soul of Rutgers University, which beat Princeton in the first intercollegiate football game in 1869, escalates in a week when its most honored alumnus, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, officially asks the administration to turn away from big-time sports and return to the academic and intellectual values he cherished.
In a full-page ad in the April 20 issue of The Daily Targum, a student newspaper, Friedman, Rutgers '32, declares that universities do not "exist . . . to provide entertainment for spectators or employment for athletes." This is an attack on the policies of the president, Francis L. Lawrence, who shepherded the Scarlet Knights into the Big East Conference and has helped hire major coaches. 
 Lawrence's position was made clear last year when he wrote in a local newspaper's op-ed page that while "our primary mission is the academic one," the university needed to be competitive at the same high level in athletics. "A successful athletic program, in fact," he wrote, "underlines the university's academic reputation in an especially compelling way."
To Friedman, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford, "it is not the purpose of a university to generate publicity or to stimulate sports." In a telephone interview last week, he said that "as long as athletes are admitted on lower standards than other students, sports is a corruptive influence on higher education."
Lawrence chose not to comment on a Nobel laureate's unusual and enthusiastic role as spokesman for an informal group of students, faculty members and alumni, conceived in intellectual outrage on the New Brunswick, N.J., campus several years ago and nurtured on the Internet.
The ad featuring Friedman was paid for by the Rutgers 1000 Alumni Council, led by a semiretired advertising executive, Richard Seclow of Easton, Conn., who read a newspaper story about the ad hoc group and suddenly "felt the diminishing value of my academic equity."
"I feel like a dissident shareholder," Seclow said, "especially since the administration is approaching this like a professional sports corporation."
Seclow, Rutgers '51 and a former president of The Targum, sees the campaign as eventually spreading to other large universities trying to gain national publicity and alumni donations through sports.
It was an English professor, William C. Dowling, who several years ago founded the grass-roots campaign that has suddenly expanded beyond the campus. The campaign's purpose was to help Rutgers fulfill its destiny as a "public Ivy" rather than become a "Yahoo U." football factory.
But Pete Bigelow, a senior political science major and the outgoing sports editor of The Targum, argues that the choice is not that simplistic. He thinks Rutgers can use schools like Stanford, Michigan and Northwestern as models. "Rutgers is not an exclusive Ivy," he said. "When it chose to enlarge, it had to make a commitment to making a national name and recruiting more students. In today's sports culture, athletics is a way to do that."
Lawrence has stated that Rutgers's "support for intercollegiate athletics amounts to one-half of 1 percent of the total university budget." But his statistic is less compelling than the Rutgers 1000's Internet "slum classroom contest."
One student described a "classroom that had broken windows, a gaping hole in the ceiling in one corner and toilet smells from a backup bathroom next door so bad that you could hardly concentrate on what the professor was saying." The writer went on to suggest that some of the $700,000 salary of the new basketball coach, Kevin Bannon, might be better spent cleaning up "slum" classrooms and creating comfortable seminar rooms.
This was followed by an excerpt from column in The New York Times in which William C. Rhoden described the "spacious dressing areas and custom-designed handmade cherry wood lockers" in "a room that is part lounge, part study, part theater." Bannon had designed it, and furnished it with 7 television sets hooked up to 2 satellite dishes, 5 videocassette recorders and 23 giant leather seats for his team.
To bolster its position that Rutgers was too Ivy-ish to be associated with the Big East, Dowling's group compared the fourteen conference schools, using the U.S. News and World Report's national ranking of four academic departments. Rutgers was No. 20 nationally in English, No. 22 in history, No. 16 in math and No. 22 in physics. The only other school with all four national rankings was Notre Dame, which had nothing higher than a No. 41 in math. Six of the schools, including St. John's and Seton Hall, had no nationally ranked academic departments.
But keeping company with Miami, Georgetown, Syracuse and West Virginia may well have its advantages; according to Lawrence, student applications and private fund-raising are at all-time highs.
Nevertheless, Friedman looks to the University of Chicago, where he was associated for many years.
"As you no doubt recall," he said, "Chicago was a football powerhouse before Robert Maynard Hutchins dropped the game. And as you know, it hardly harmed the university's academic standing."

HEADLINE: Makeup of American Religion Is Looking More Like Mosaic, Data Say

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
Several mainline Protestant denominations have reported losing fewer members over the last three years, easing a trajectory that once suggested the nation's largest moderate to liberal churches were sliding toward the margins of religious life.
During this same period, the rate of growth has slipped within the nation's conservative powerhouse, the Southern Baptist Convention, whose membership increased so quickly in the 1970's that it emerged as the country's largest religious organization outside the Roman Catholic Church. 
 But the annual figures do not show a clear reversal of fortune within the pattern that took hold among Protestants 30 years ago, when many conservative denominations began to gain and more liberal ones to shrink. Yet the numbers do offer a new indication of the growing complexity within American religion, which is increasingly defined by such trends as immigration, the spread of independent congregations and new religious networks, and the globalization of some organizations.
Church historians and sociologists of religion say the country's religious landscape has become too diverse and multifaceted to be described as a culture war between right and left.
"I think the old liberal-conservative paradigm is a thing of the past," said David A. Roozen, director of the Center for Social and Religious Research at the Hartford Seminary. "Today's religious world is kind of like a mosaic, rather than a nice clearcut set of boxes."
A central trend, especially among Christians, Professor Roozen said, is that energy and innovation have passed from national religious organizations to local congregations, many of which are experimenting with contemporary music and new, expressive styles of worship. Some of that creativity is occurring among Protestants, particularly in the West, he said, adding, "I think that's helping their growth trends somewhat."
Recent statistics reported by Protestant denominations present a more intriguing picture than statistics a decade ago.
For example, the 2.4 million-member Episcopal Church, which lost more than 1 million members from 1965 to 1989, grew by nearly 100,000 from 1989 to 1994. Losses resumed in 1995 and 1996, but church attendance (those who actually go to Sunday services) held stable, then rose in 1996, the last year for which figures are available.
Since 1992, two other mainline denominations, the 8.5 million-member United Methodist Church and the 5.2 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, have seen their annual membership losses narrow. Membership losses also declined between 1995 and 1997 within the United Church of Christ.
Another denomination, the 2.6 million-member Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), reported losing more than 32,000 members in both 1995 and 1996. But the loss shrank to 22,000 last year, after a surge in adult baptisms, as people without any previous Christian affiliation joined, a spokesman said.
The Southern Baptist Convention, which suffered a fierce internal struggle between fundamentalist and moderate factions in the 1980's, continues to grow. But it has seen the rate dip, to about one-half of 1 percent or less from 1994 to 1997. Still, members put a record amount in the collection plate last year, sending the Southern Baptist budget to a new high, said Herb Hollinger, editor of the denomination's news agency.
Further complicating the picture, one of the most liberal religious groups in the country, the Unitarian-Universalist Association, has been growing. Its membership has risen by nearly 20 percent, to more than 200,000, since 1981.
The Rev. Eileen W. Lindner, editor of the "Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches 1998" (Abingdon), which reported a "flattening" of membership trends among many denominations, said the complicated picture within Protestantism should be seen within the "context of the incredible robustness of American religious life."
Changes in immigration laws allowing greater numbers of immigrants from outside Europe in the mid-1960's have fueled the growth of major faiths, with American Muslims estimated at 2 million to 5 million, and Buddhists and Hindus often numbered at up to 1 million each.
Immigration, too, has helped raise the Roman Catholic ranks, to 61 million baptized Catholics, up from 50 million in 1980. The church has also gained from converts. The United States Bishops Conference recently reported that parishes nationwide would welcome nearly 100,000 newly baptized adult members the Saturday before Easter.
In other broad changes, new networks of Christian congregations have been formed, emphasizing contemporary religious music, informal dress and Bible teaching. Among them are the Vineyard and Calvary Chapel movements, which began among young converts in California and are unaffiliated with any traditional denomination.
And some denominations are undergoing a form of globalization and are no longer solely focused on their American members. In 1980, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints numbered 4.6 million, three-quarters of them in the United States. Last year, the church announced that it had 10 million members, the majority overseas.
The Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination founded in Arkansas in 1914, counts 2.5 million members in the United States and 10 times that many overseas, many in Brazil. The 8.5 million-member United Methodist Church has also expanded abroad. Although it lost 1 million American members from 1980 to 1995, it gained about 500,000 elsewhere, mostly in Africa, according to church statistics.
"American religion is in a state of permanent transition," said Bill Leonard, a church historian and dean of the Divinity School at Wake Forest University. Mr. Leonard cited a growing number of interfaith marriages and a tendency of many people to "shop around" for a house of worship as reasons for a great "flux and fluidity" in religious life.
Tidal changes have been at work on the religious scene before.
In the late 1930's, pollsters reported that 4 in 10 Americans said they attended church or synagogue regularly. That figure spiked, at nearly 6 in 10, during the 1950's, at a time of rising middle-class prosperity and the growth of families in the postwar baby boom. Much of the gain went to the mainline Protestant churches.
The Episcopal Church's statistics show that it grew to 3.3 million from 2.4 million members from 1950 to 1960, a rate of increase achieved by the Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons 20 years later. Episcopalian numbers, like those in many other mainline churches, peaked around 1965, after the baby boom.
The Rev. Charles R. Wilson, a consultant and researcher of church statistics, said, "We took our hit, and I suspect most Protestant churches did, in the 1960's, when the baby boomers got out of high school, and Pop quit caring about" religious attendance.
The falling birth rate, along with population shifts in some parts of the nation, took their toll, said Thomas E. Frank, director of Methodist studies at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University.
Some Protestant churches were hit hard by economic troubles in America's farm belt, Professor Frank said.
"There are counties in the United States that have lost 75 percent of their population in 15 years," he said. "Well, that's where the Methodists and Presbyterians and Disciples of Christ built their churches. That's where the people were in 1900."
The flip side is that other congregations, particularly those in growing cities and suburbs, expanded along with the surrounding population. Atlanta, Professor Frank said, is home to mainline Protestant "megachurches" with thousands of members.
"Huge numbers of churches are thriving because they're well adapted to where they are," he said.
Speaking of the complexity of American religious life, Professor Roozen at the Hartford Seminary, said: "It's a fun time to be a student of religion, because there are a lot of interesting changes going on. We don't know where they're going to end up."

Striking Back, Especially If the Shoe Fits

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
IN the climactic scene of his film "The Big One," Michael Moore scores a prize interview inside the sanctum of Nike's chairman, Phil Knight. Several months ago, in an achievement Moore could appreciate more than most, a bunch of teen-agers from a New York City public housing project made the sports monolith come to them.
There is no tape of this meeting for Miramax to release, only a three-page memo in which Nike comes off as witless as Knight does in Moore's new film on the subject of exporting jobs. He maintains his "basic belief that Americans do not want to make shoes." 
 Moore goes right back home to Flint, Mich., to round up a posse of jobless locals, who beg for work. Knight concludes that the pleas of the unemployed are essentially a lie.
It wasn't the scruffy-bearded billionaire himself who hurried east from his encampment in the great Northwest, to the Edenwald Gun Hill Houses in the north Bronx last Sept. 10. Leo Johnson nonetheless recognized the presence of a senior public relations manager, Vada Manager, and a regional marketing official, Lincoln Parker, to be a sign of unmistakable corporate fear.
"They came to Edenwald, all the way from Portland, Ore.," Johnson said. "Most people from Fordham Road won't come up here."
Johnson, a 38-year-old father of two from Co-op City, has in the past year galvanized more than 200 young people from the Edenwald Gun Hill Neighborhood Center, as well as a coalition of settlement houses citywide, in a Nike-targeted sneaker give-back campaign. As sportswear and other youth trends often begin in poor urban neighborhoods and spread to wealthier enclaves and suburbs, Johnson and Company have the potential to hit the sneaker king right in its pockets.
"We're at the bottom of the market," he said. "But if the bottom falls out, the whole thing can collapse."
Moore's only real weapon against corporate cruelty is his camera. Johnson, youth director of the Edenwald Center, is fighting back with young, impressionable minds. That makes him a more dangerous man to a company like Nike, which counts on unquestioning, nascent consumers to buy expensive sneakers produced in Asian sweat shops for a fraction of the price.
Not only did Nike come, but Michael Moore also called.
An offer was extended last month for a private screening of "The Big One," in which Knight -- the first c.e.o. to play along with Moore's trademark gag of showing up unannounced and demanding to see the boss -- shoots himself in his $140 Air Jordans. Leo Johnson's recruits hit the phones, filled two buses. They saw the film on March 19, slightly out of focus, similar to Knight's "Big One" defense that Nike does not employ 12-year-olds because the minimum working age in Indonesia is 14.
After the film, the buses rolled on to 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, to Niketown, in the cold rain, where more sneakers were thrown back like fish, while network cameras recorded the event for the evening news. The film director could not have staged it better himself.
"Michael Moore is like an idol of ours," Johnson said. This is Be Like Mike, in a new context, one that does not presume the only effective adolescent stimulus to be sports, and related merchandise. "We got a little sick of people saying we needed to use sports to bring our kids in," said Michael Gitelson, another Edenwald Neighborhood Center counselor. "This has always been a politically active center. We've floated a lot of different issues with the kids. Nike worked."
Johnson added: "Nike is only one issue. What these young people here have to realize, and what they've seen by the way Nike has responded to us, is that they have the power to make these companies speak to them in more honest ways, not just show them Hollywood images of shirtless black men with their chests glistening with sweat."
When the Nike people visited the Edenwald Center on East 229th Street, they obviously were not yet convinced. Michael Gitelson's memo on the meeting said Vada Manager expressed "sincere doubts" about the veracity of the information Johnson's group had spent hours gleaning from the Internet and other news media sources.
One recent stormy night, in the Edenwald Center conference room, Johnson introduced two young disciples, who said having their work questioned made them determined to do more. Christina Burton, 15, and Donte Edwards, 16, insisted that the notion of Nike-as-pariah seemed to be spreading around the 2,500-unit Edenwald Gun Hill projects. The issue, they said, was simple to grasp once put in the context of their own lives.
Their dollars spent on sneakers their unemployed mothers and fathers have no chance to make.
"People want to work," Johnson said. "I could get 1,000 people here tomorrow who would make sneakers." That would be more than Michael Moore found in Flint.

HEADLINE: Glen Frazier Leet Dies at 89; Helped Aspiring Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Glen Frazier Leet, who worked to provide financing to entrepreneurs here and abroad and who aided community development programs around the world for more than five decades, died on April 7 at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 89.
Mr. Leet's credentials in self-help and community development date from the end of World War II, when he became involved in antipoverty work in Greece. After that, he was president of Save the Children and the Community Development Foundation and a consultant to governments on their environmental and community development plans. 
 In 1979, he and his wife, Mildred Robbins Leet, founded Trickle Up, a program that has helped an estimated 350,000 of the world's poorest people, many of them women, offering to them the opportunity to build new lives by starting a small business with grants of as little as $50 each. At his death, he was co-president with his wife.
The Leets formed their own consulting firm on social issues in the 1970's. Trickle Up, which grew from that experience, was started with $1,000 of their own money, a few computers on their dining-room table and the help of a part-time assistant. It now operates in 115 countries and estimates that it has spawned about 67,500 enterprises.
The program depends on individual donations and foundation grants and now operates from its West Side headquarters with a staff of 14. Although it was formed to benefit the world's poor, it began to make grants in this country, too, in 1994. The grants are typically about $500, with a $200 follow-up, and are given in conjunction with community-based agencies like the Harlem Business Outreach Center, the Central Vermont Community Action Council or the Institute for Social and Economic Development of Iowa.
Trickle Up reported recently that more than 80 percent of the wide variety of enterprises started since 1994 in the United States have remained in business. These include a caterer, a milliner, a T-shirt printer, a leather crafter, a day-care center, a photographer, a television repairer and a word-processing service.
Glen Leet was born in Brockton, Mass. He graduated from Norwich University in Vermont in 1930 and received a master's degree in public administration from Syracuse University. In 1935, representing the American Public Welfare Association, he helped draft social-welfare legislation for state legislatures.
Mr. Leet began his work as a volunteer for Unrra, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in 1944 and led its effort to relieve starvation in Greece in the wake of war and civil strife. That work led to a stint as the United Nations' first chief of community development in the 1950's, when he directed research, training and technical assistance for building infrastructures, mostly in developing countries. He helped governments set up community projects and organize self-help efforts for the poor.
As program director and, after 1971, as president of the Save the Children Foundation, he oversaw programs in urban areas as well as among the Indians of Arizona and New Mexico. In 1973, while engaged in that work, he met the woman who was to become his second wife.
Besides Mrs. Leet, he is survived by two daughters and a son from an earlier marriage, Frederika Leet of Manhattan, Carla Leet of Houston and Glen Jr., of Kingston, N.Y.; two stepdaughters, Aileen Robbins of Manhattan and Jane Marla Robbins of Los Angeles, four grandchildren and two great-granddaughters.
His first wife, Marcia Hatch Leet, died in 1971.

HEADLINE: Rancor Eases As the Koreas Open Talks After 4 Years

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 11

 BODY:
In a basement hotel conference room, North and South Korean officials held their first face-to-face talks in almost four years today, breaking a long, hostile silence with friendly overtures.
The two five-member teams, each led by a deputy minister, met for two hours in a session that a South Korean negotiator later described as "very sincere and friendly." They said they would meet again on Sunday. 
Although the talks had been prompted by a North Korean request for fertilizer to help ease its food shortage, the agenda of the meeting was far broader.
Negotiators discussed everything from large-scale economic investments by South Korea in North Korea to plans for reuniting families separated by the country's division.
The newly elected South Korean President, Kim Dae Jung, has made improved relations with the North a high priority, and this shift in policy has lent the meetings an upbeat tone.
As they filed into the meeting room today, both the North Korean delegates -- wearing red Kim Il Sung lapel pins commemorating their late leader, and their South Korean counterparts expressed hope that some sort of agreement could be reached.
Earlier governmental talks had been suspended at Kim Il Sung's death in 1994.
"The tone of these talks is certainly much more positive than anything since the early 90's," said Selig Harrison, a fellow at the Twentieth Century Fund who is an expert on Korea. "This is an encouraging indicator that the North is responding positively to the new President."
The United States Government has publicly encouraged the talks in Beijing, saying they could prompt progress in stalled four-way talks, which include China and the United States as well as the two Koreas.
However, some Western diplomats hold out little such hope, saying North Korea had been forced to the bargaining table more by a desperate shortage of food, fuel and other supplies than by a genuine desire for reconciliation.
At today's meeting, South Korea's leading negotiator, Deputy Minister of Reconciliation Jeong Se Hyun, told the North Koreans that his country was prepared to offer not only fertilizer but also other agricultural assistance.
He dangled the hope of money flowing North, saying South Korea was "preparing for a gradual expansion of intra-Korean economic cooperation including large scale investments in your territory."
Investment has been discouraged and severely limited in the past.
But the Deputy Minister said the South Koreans wanted economic and financial aid to be part of a comprehensive discussions that would include plans for exchanging envoys, re-establishing the border liaison office from which North Korea withdrew in 1996 and reuniting an estimated 10 million South Koreans with long-separated relatives in the North.
"I would like to emphasize that the aid would be realized vis-a-vis your corresponding measures to improve the South-North relationship," he said.
He suggested that dealing with the separated families, perhaps through a border meeting center or hometown reunions, would make the South Korean public more amenable to further aid to the North.
At the talks, the head of the North Korean delegation, Chun Kum Chul, said his side was also concerned about the issue of separated families, according to South Korean journalists who were allowed to attend the session.
The reporters said, without elaborating, that Mr. Chun had said North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, had sent a letter to South Korea in February that touched on the matter.
The North Korean delegation did not speak with reporters after the meeting, but experts say that their customarily strident statements against South Korea have been muted since Kim Dae Jung's election in the South and that their country's desperate food situation has left them more inclined to bargain.
When the Soviet Union collapsed, Communist North Korea lost its main supplier of fertilizer, fuel and other goods, leaving the country extremely vulnerable. In the last several years, the country has experienced floods and droughts that have left its citizens at short of food and even, some experts say, in a state of famine.
"These talks are a very important turning point," Mr. Harrison said. "But it won't be a quick process."

HEADLINE: Nguyen Co Thach, Hanoi Foreign Minister, 75

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, April 11

 BODY:
Former Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam, the urbane diplomat who struggled but failed to normalize relations with the United States in the 1980's, died on Friday at the age of 75, foreign diplomats in Hanoi said today.
There was no immediate announcement of his death by the Vietnamese leadership, which removed him in 1991 from his post as Foreign Minister and from the ruling Politburo. 
 He had reportedly been suffering for some time from various ailments, but had recovered enough last year to lead a Vietnamese delegation that met in Hanoi with the former United States Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, to discuss missed opportunities for peace during the Vietnam war.
Mr. Thach made it clear at that meeting that Vietnam had few regrets over its conduct of the war, which ended in 1975 with a Vietnamese victory and a reunification of the country that had been divided since its liberation in 1954 from French colonial rule.
Mr. Thach, a revolutionary from the age of 14 and a career diplomat fluent in French and English, first made his mark abroad in 1968 as an aide to Le Duc Tho in secret peace talks in Paris with Henry A. Kissinger, who was President Nixon's national security adviser and Secretary of State.
He later played a leading role in the 1973 Paris peace accords, which led to the American military withdrawal from Vietnam two years before Hanoi's final victory.
He became Foreign Minister in 1980 at a time when Vietnam was economically broken and internationally isolated, and put his energies into attempts to improve relations with the West.
He apparently fell from favor when Vietnam's ally, the Soviet Union, collapsed and Hanoi sought to improve relations with China.
His attempts at rapprochement with Washington were stalled by Vietnam's decade-long domination of neighboring Cambodia, from 1979 to 1989. His removal as Foreign Minister came as Vietnam turned its attention to better relations with China.
Mr. Thach retained the respect of many of his colleagues, who saw him as the most liberal and intellectual member of the leadership, and of many of his counterparts abroad, who were drawn to his charm and reasonable approach to problems.
Nguyen Co Thach was born in Nam Dinh province, in northern Vietnam, on March 15, 1923, and left school as a teen-ager to join the resistance against the French.
He was jailed by them for a year in the same prison that later became known as the Hanoi Hilton when it housed American prisoners of war. One of the P.O.W.'s was Pete Peterson, a fighter pilot who is now serving as the first United States Ambassador to a unified Vietnam, after the normalization of relations in 1995.
Mr. Thach rose to the rank of colonel in the Viet Minh resistance and joined the diplomatic service of North Vietnam after the country's partition in 1954. Two years later he became consul general in India.
He served for two decades as Deputy Foreign Minister, gaining an increasingly high profile abroad before being promoted to Foreign Minister. He became an alternate member of the Politburo in 1982 and a full member four years later, the first diplomat to join the ruling circle.
In 1987 he gained the additional post of Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, equivalent to the position of Deputy Prime Minister.
Mr. Thach is survived by his wife, Pham Thi Phuc.

HEADLINE: In W.N.B.A., Hope for Union Of Their Own

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
A year ago, the women of the Women's National Basketball Association chose to settle for less -- modest money and little power -- for the privilege of playing professional ball in the United States and the greater good of starting a new league.
The league succeeded. Fans poured into arenas, the average 10,000-a-game attendance doubling the W.N.B.A.'s projections. And 50 million viewers tuned in to nationally televised games over the 10-week summer season. 
 Now, with their second season scheduled to begin with games on June 11, the players are wondering whether they need to ask for more.
Under the contracts they signed with the W.N.B.A., players can be terminated at any time, cannot endorse products that compete with the league's 15 sponsors, are not entitled to percentages from sales of team merchandise and receive health benefits only when they play, according to players and their representatives. The average player salary is $20,000 to $40,000 -- substantially less than that of the rival women's league, the American Basketball League. And the language in the W.N.B.A.'s contracts, the players say, is so ambiguous that it is unclear whether players are entitled to be paid if they are injured.
Chafing at the economic limitations and eager to garner greater rewards in light of the league's success, the women of the W.N.B.A. have begun to debate a volatile issue: forming a union. Conducting largely secret discussions -- the women have whispered among themselves at promotional events and talked more frankly at private dinners -- the players are trying to figure out who might represent them and how to get what they want without hurting the league they fought so hard to create.
The questions reverberate deep and wide for female athletes as, with their success and greater popularity, they face the possibilities and plagues that male athletes have grown accustomed to -- multimillion-dollar contracts, lucrative endorsements, free agency, salary caps and labor unrest. For the women, the issue of power is a real, if awkward, one. Indeed, the fear of reprisal on the issue of unionizing is so great that players refuse to be identified by name in speaking about it.
"Everybody was so happy and excited to be playing pro ball -- all the hype, the fans, the big time -- nobody was going to complain," one prominent W.N.B.A. player said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We're willing to do what it takes to see the league succeed. But we also have to look after our own interests."
Trisonya Thompson Abraham, an agent who represents a W.N.B.A. player, said the players want "what the men have." She added: "They're playing in the same venues as the men, they have the N.B.A. name, its logo. Now they want a players association like the men have."
Unionization and the ability to bargain collectively that would come with it are not ideas that league officials are eager to embrace now.
"We are striving to be a major league sport; we want to be the fifth major league," said Valerie B. Ackerman, the president of the W.N.B.A., which drew 1.12 million fans last year. "That having been said, unionization is likely. We accept its possibility. But in some respects, it does seem premature. We're trying to make decisions that are right for us as a business. Decisions that will help us be viable and profitable in the long term and successful for years to come."
 
Pay From $5,000 To Six Figures
 The W.N.B.A. is owned by the 29 teams of the N.B.A., and the players -- 140 players are scheduled to play on 10 teams this summer -- are signed and paid by the league. The league refuses to release information on how much money it made last year -- its sources of revenue include ticket sales, television money, merchandising and sponsorship fees, although people knowledgeable about its finances say the W.N.B.A., at minimum, took in more than $10 million through ticket sales. Clearly, though, the league's single-entity structure is intended to control marketing and costs, and that desire to control costs has produced strikingly restrictive contracts with the players.
Although star players like Rebecca Lobo of the Liberty, Lisa Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks and Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes of the Houston Comets are being paid in the six-figure range, players on the taxi squad receive as little as $5,000. Agents for several players said their clients were unable to subsist on the salaries paid by the league.
Many players, like Kym Hampton and Wanda Guyton, who briefly thought the deals with the W.N.B.A. would relieve them of the financial need to play overseas to survive, wound up still needing to play in Europe and elsewhere this year. Promotional rewards for most of the players -- the league picks who makes such appearances -- typically amount to fees of from $500 to $1,000.
And unlike the men in the N.B.A., who receive a percentage of sales on team merchandise, the women do not contractually receive any revenues from the sale of millions of T-shirts, sweat shirts, athletic shoes and team banners -- even those bearing images of their faces. In one recent telling moment, in fact, one of the league's athletic apparel sponsors complimented a player about how well her jerseys were selling. When the player asked if the company would send her one or two jerseys to give to family members, the company's representative declined. The player bought her own.
Moreover, the players in the W.N.B.A., whatever the benefits of the league's $15 million spent in marketing last year, say they are in certain ways worse off financially than the women of the A.B.L., which just ended its second season. Those women, on average, are paid more -- $40,000 to $125,000 -- and receive better benefits, including a 401 (k) program. The A.B.L. players also are, through stock holdings, part owners of the league, their contracts are guaranteed and, through a loosely defined players association, they have a say in management decisions.
 
After One Season, Seeking Alternatives
 The W.N.B.A. players' contract negotiations with the league did not result in terms nearly so advantageous.
"We received lots of questions from this first generation of women professional basketball players who found themselves with 'take it or leave it' contracts," said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports Foundation, which has served as a consultant to professional female athletes. "They wanted to know from us what alternatives they had."
One alternative that has growing appeal is a union. Aside from providing higher salaries, improved health benefits, agent certification, guaranteed contracts and licensing revenues, a players union could fundamentally change the way the W.N.B.A. conducts its business. With a union, players believe they could have a say on issues like draft eligibility and the length of the season and also have the ability to contest dismissals or disciplinary action.
The history of female professional athletes and unions is mixed. The Women's Tennis Association, formed decades ago in an effort to gain tournament prize money equal to men's, has generally been regarded as a formidable success. But the three women's professional basketball leagues that preceded the W.N.B.A. and the A.B.L. never had unions and never lasted long.
"A lot of girls are being ripped off by agents," a W.N.B.A. player said. "Right now, there are no rules governing agents because that's what a union does. The N.B.A. players association certifies agents, sets fees and arbitrates disputes between players and agents. We don't have anybody looking out for us, and we really need it because this is so new to many of us."
The informal talk about unionizing has led to various proposals. The N.B.A. players union said it would like to represent the women, and many of the W.N.B.A. players feel it is the logical choice. The Women's Coaches Association, which has 4,500 members in the collegiate and professional ranks, is also lobbying for the job. There are, too, a handful of sports agents interested in organizing the women.
"We began talking to several players last summer with respect to unionization," said Billy Hunter, executive director of the N.B.A. players union. "The great majority were generally receptive. But the first year, most of the women were a bit reserved and conservative, because their main ambition was to insure the survival and success of the league and they didn't want to do anything to impede or jeopardize the league."
Mr. Hunter said it could take two to four years to put together a full-blown union and thus said joining the men made sense. "We've dealt with the league for 40 years," he said. "We obviously have the expertise."
But others, including some W.N.B.A. players, expressed reservations about joining ranks with the men.
"When it comes to choosing who gets the top lawyer, who gets the best representation? Does the union send its top gun to handle Latrell Sprewell or the 10th player on the bench for a W.N.B.A. team?" Paula McGee asked. Ms. McGee helped lead the University of Southern California to National Collegiate Athletic Association championships in 1983 and 1984 and played professionally overseas. She now represents her twin sister, Pamela, a center-forward for the W.N.B.A.'s Sacramento Monarchs.
"Another thing," Paula McGee said. "The men aren't concerned about issues like maternity leave. Some of these women are primary care givers. Normally, when a player is traded, they have to report to the new team within 48 hours. If I'm a man, no problem; the wife stays at home. If I'm a married woman with kids, it gets a little more complicated."
 
What Impact Would a Union Have?
 At this point the players seem uncertain who to choose, perhaps, in part, because they are not quite certain what it is they want to do. Some want to hold off on doing anything until the issue can be further studied.
The Women's Sports Foundation has established a committee that is looking into the needs of professional and amateur female athletes and aims to make wide-ranging recommendations on everything from marketing to money for players in all sports.
W.N.B.A. officials, in their defense, note that the league helps players with housing and transportation expenses during the season, and they say that the addition this season of two franchises in Detroit and Washington has resulted in 28 more jobs for players. The league said it has also increased salaries by 25 percent over last year.
Still, league officials are wary of the impact of a union.
"We have one season under our belt," said Ms. Ackerman, the W.N.B.A. president. "We did better than expected the first year, but does that mean we will have continued success? I hope so. I just don't know.
"We recognize the league will develop and evolve and we are very receptive to input from wherever it comes, be it the teams, players or sponsors," she added. "But we're trying to look at what's right for the W.N.B.A. most of all, and focusing pretty much exclusively on our business interests and business needs, and harmonizing those needs with those of the players."
But Ms. Thompson Abraham, the agent, said the players are interested in, if also nervous about, seeking their own definition of full justice.
"Right now, players, especially those in the W.N.B.A., are powerless," she said. "But they're so happy to be a part of a league where they can stay at home that they're happy to settle, even if it's not perfect. The players want to play, and they know that if they don't take it, there will be someone out there ready and willing to take their place."

HEADLINE: Taxi Conversions Are Another Step In the City's Move to Cleaner Vehicles

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Last week, a Queens taxi garage made news with the announcement that it was buying 100 natural-gas-powered vehicles, but for some time New York City has been laying the groundwork for cleaning up automotive emissions.
The first step has been to build the nation's largest fleet of natural-gas-powered vehicles -- 3,000 in all -- from taxis to delivery vans to buses. The second, and perhaps more important, step is to establish fueling stations to service the vehicles. 
 Industry officials and advocates of alternative fuels say that the growth in fueling stations would encourage the buying and use of natural-gas-powered vehicles, which produce far less pollution than gasoline-powered cars. And the fueling stations could also be used to service vehicles powered by a newer technology: fuel cells, which, in effect, are batteries that never need recharging.
And fuel cells mean that pure hydrogen could supplant natural gas, meaning no vehicle emissions and even better fuel economies.
"When you look around the rest of the country, you don't find the same kind of concentrated forward motion as you find in New York," said Richard Kassel, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Robert B. Catell, chairman and chief executive of Keyspan Energy Company, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Union Gas that has been a leader in the city's natural-gas conversion efforts, said he expects that within a decade more than half the city's delivery vans will be powered by natural gas.
But there are huge obstacles. One is the price of gasoline -- about $1.15 a gallon now -- which city transportation authorities fear may be too low to push car buyers to shift to natural gas. Another is that there are already millions of electrical outlets, which advocates of electric vehicles say can be used to recharge the vehicles. Still another is that the range of natural-gas vehicles is limited and that fueling stations are sparse, particularly in rural areas.
Moreover, to many people, hydrogen power still seems more at home in laboratories than the marketplace.
New York ranks first among cities east of the Mississippi in particulates and ozone, two forms of pollution that can severely damage lungs. Well over half of these pollutants could be removed in New York City by eliminating automotive emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles, Mr. Kassel and other experts suggest.
Buses are a special problem. Despite its leadership in converting delivery vans and taxis, the city has been slow to switch over its bus fleet to natural gas, according to Inform Inc., an environmental research organization.
But advocates of alternative energy draw inspiration from the city's record on encouraging a natural-gas-vehicle market. They point to 1,500 municipal vehicles, from pickups to full-size sanitation trucks; 1,000 vehicles owned by fleets, from United Parcel Service to the Postal Service to milk companies, and 700 vehicles owned by Brooklyn Union and Consolidated Edison, the principal sellers of natural gas in the city.
And taxis represent perhaps the most expansive frontier. On Thursday, the Ford Motor Company announced that it sold Winner's Garage in Queens 100 natural-gas-powered cabs to replace its entire fleet. That brought the city's number of natural-gas taxis to 270.
"I can't think of a city that's making a big push toward natural-gas taxis like New York," Mr. Kassel said.
More than 300 additional cabs are expected to be sold under incentives offered by the state and Ford, totaling more than $10,000 per vehicle, enough to cover the additional expense of such cabs.
In mass transit, the city Department of Transportation has bought 53 buses for the 7 bus franchises it operates. It has ordered 174 more and has said that it will exercise an option to buy 120 others. Its total fleet is 1,100 buses.
The Metropolitan Transit Authority has been less aggressive. Just 39 buses in its fleet of 3,500 are powered by natural gas.
But in total, the converted cars, vans, trucks and buses could begin to form the basis for a hydrogen-powered transportation system. Already, 50 natural-gas fueling stations exist in New York State, most in or around the city. These could be used to directly inject hydrogen into fuel tanks or to inject natural gas, from which pure hydrogen would be extracted in the vehicle.
A fuel cell in the vehicle would combine the hydrogen with oxygen through an electrochemical process, without combustion. This process produces energy, leaving pure water as the only waste product.
"Anything you can do to bring natural gas into the transportation system is paving the way for the hydrogen fuel cell," said James Cannon, senior energy fellow for Inform, the environmental research organization. "Every conquest natural gas makes today will help people down the road get to hydrogen."
Private companies are pushing ahead on both natural gas and the fuel cell. All three big American auto companies -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- are offering natural-gas-powered cars this year for the first time, and all three are developing prototype fuel cells. Brooklyn Union is already demonstrating fuel cells at industrial plants on Staten Island, while a waste-water treatment facility in Yonkers uses fuel-cell technology.
New York State is also working on a number of fronts. One program gives buyers of cars powered by alternative fuels up to $5,000 in an investment tax credit and truck buyers $10,000.
New York is also the only state to require 2 percent of all vehicles sold this year to have "zero emissions," a program that can help in the sale of electric or gasoline cars.
The city, under a 1991 law, is also stepping up its purchase of alternative-fuel vehicles. This year, 80 percent of new municipal cars and trucks must use fuels other than gasoline or diesel fuel. Another city and state idea is to paint some curbs green as free parking spaces for alternative-fuel vehicles.
All this is beginning to add up to pressure for cleaner cars.
"The technology's available right now," Mr. Catell of Keyspan Energy said. "What's needed is a little bit of market pull."

Expos Have Eyes on Downtown to Turn Around the Team's Fortunes

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Claude Brochu, managing partner of the Montreal Expos, expects the club to turn a profit this year. With a $9.2 million payroll, that economic trick should not be hard to execute. But Brochu is looking well beyond this year.
"I've made a commitment to the organization that we're not going to go through what we've gone through," said Brochu, keeper of the major leagues' lowest and most widely discussed payroll. 
 "We either build a competitive team in Montreal or do it somewhere else. We feel we have a very talented group of players and we think we can win with them in a couple years."
The days of shedding players for financial considerations are over, Brochu said. From here on, the payroll goes in only one direction -- up.
"We'll double the payroll next year and again the year after," he said. "Then probably increase by who knows how much the year after that. We have to position ourselves at 90 percent of the industry average or we'll never win."
Integral to the Expos' ambitious long-range plans is a new stadium, making Montreal one of a growing number of cities whose baseball future is linked to a new playground. It is happening in Milwaukee, Seattle, Detroit and San Francisco, where new parks are under construction, and it is a dream of more than half a dozen other teams, including Pittsburgh, San Diego, Minnesota, Cincinnati and Florida.
All of these teams see visions of Baltimore and Cleveland in their dreams because the Orioles and the Indians offer living proof of what new parks can do for revenue. In addition, the Indians are a vibrant example of how a team can be built along with the new park.
The Expos' meager payroll is the lowest in the majors since the Indians paid their players $8.8 million in 1992. The Indians now have one of the highest payrolls but also one of the best teams, having won three consecutive division championships and played in the World Series two of those three seasons.
"We outlined our game plan some time ago," Brochu said. "I figure in this business you better have a $50 million payroll or you won't win. There's no sense being at 40 or 35 or 20. You won't win."
The average payroll, Brochu said, will be in the $65 million to $70 million area in a few years. "If we're going to compete," he said, "we will have to have a payroll that will be at least 90 percent of that average."
In recent years, low attendance has undermined the Expos, who have developed some of the best players in the majors who no longer play for them. From a record of 2.32 million attendance in 1983, the Expos have dropped to a more typical 1.5 million fans, which they drew last season.
"In my estimation," Brochu said, "in 1994, we probably had one of the best teams of the decade, but we wouldn't have drawn two million people. I was concerned we didn't have a baseball town. But I've identified the problem. It's clear we have a stadium problem. If we relocate downtown, we can do in Montreal what was done in Cleveland and maybe what was done in Baltimore. If we go downtown, we'll bring in the business community, which we haven't had before."
The Expos hope to get a $180 million, 35,000-seat park with an umbrella-type roof that will cover the field and the seats when it rains. A downtown site has been staked out and an option taken on the land.
The club's goal is to sell $100 million in personal seat licenses by June 30 as a sign that corporate Montreal wants the team to remain in the city and that the government should formulate a plan to finance construction of the new park.
"We're no longer a small market; we're a micromarket," Brochu said. "We can't afford to take on any debt service. This thing has to be completely financed by the community."
In the meantime, the team will struggle to be competitive with players named Brad Fullmer, Jose Vidro, Javier Vazquez and Trey Moore. "Sure, it's tough," General Manager Jim Beattie said. "Veteran players have a hard time going through it."
But just as the players are frustrated, Beattie said, so is everyone else.
"Our owners are frustrated that they've had to operate this way," he said. "But we're trying to save the club for the city of Montreal. It's not a lot of fun for anybody to be going through, but it's the reality of the game today that puts teams like ours at a disadvantage, and we have to battle at it."
Brochu said he knows he has made himself unpopular by starting at the bottom again. "But you have to look at the bigger picture," he said. "The business community is not concerned about who's playing third base for us right now."
 
Battered From the Start
 The Seattle Mariners lost Randy Johnson's first two starts, in which he gave up 12 earned runs in 11 2/3 innings. The Kansas City Royals lost Pat Rapp's first two starts, both against Baltimore, in which he allowed one run in 14 innings.
Pitchers have had no shortage of awful starts in this young season. The worst of the worst: Jeremi Gonzalez, Chicago Cubs, seven batters, no outs, six runs; Marc Valdes, Montreal, five runs in one third of an inning; Kevin Tapani, Cubs, nine runs in two innings; Jim Bullinger, Seattle, 10 runs in 3 and a third innings; Manny Aybar, St. Louis, 7 runs in 2 and one-third innings.
 
Cubs Put Out and Receive
 The Chicago Cubs decided it was time to make an investment, and it has already paid off. Unlike last year when the Cubs lost their first 14 games, this season they have won 6 of their first 7, and 8 of their first 10.
"The past year and a half or so we didn't do very well," Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, said. "I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."
Two factors figured in the decision to spend money, MacPhail said.
"We felt we had a more legitimate foundation to build on than we had the past two years," he said. And for the fans' sake, he added, "We felt it was important to turn it around and have a good season this year."
The Cubs signed closer Rod Beck and shortstop Jeff Blauser as free agents and traded for second baseman Mickey Morandini and left fielder Henry Rodriguez. Their payroll, which was $30.8 million at the end of last season, soared to $49.4 million.
The winter spending decisions paid off even before the season began with a six-game winning streak following an opening-day loss.
"Our season-ticket sales are up and our individual ticket sales are up," MacPhail said. "That's no easy feat based on a 68-win season."
 
Ups and Downs for Rosado
 Last July 8, Jose Rosado experienced the biggest thrill of his incipient career. Midway through his first full major league season, the Kansas City Royals pitcher pitched in the All-Star Game and received credit for the victory when Sandy Alomar Jr. hit a tie-breaking home run while he was still in the game.
The next day the Royals changed managers, and Tony Muser is still looking for the pitcher who performed well enough to be named to the All-Star team. Before the break, the young left-hander had a 7-4 record and a 3.39 earned run average. After the break, he skidded to 2-8 and 6.75, doing nothing to impress the new manager. Rosado didn't make a favorable impression in spring training either and lost his job in the starting rotation.
Last Thursday, in his third appearance as a reliever, Rosado gave up an eighth-inning run that gave Baltimore a 2-1 victory.
 
A Lasting Impression
 Kevin Millar, yet another member of last season's Class AA Portland (Maine) Sea Dogs, joined the Class Z Florida Marlins last week, but it was an earlier stop in his minor league travels that added to the significance of his promotion.
The 26-year-old infielder began his professional career with the St. Paul (Minn.) Saints of the independent Northern League in 1993. That is the team owned by Marvin Goldklang. The team has started and revived the careers of a growing number of major leaguers.
"Kevin was different from the others," said Goldklang, who also is a Yankees limited partner. "He was the first player we signed to his first professional contract after he went through the draft undrafted."
A third baseman who had gone to Lamar University, Millar was deemed by scouts to have a slow bat and to be below average defensively.
"I signed him largely on the recommendation of his college coach, Jim Gilligan," Goldklang said. "He came in as the 22d player on a 22-man roster and won the third base job. He was one of the hardest workers I've had on the team. He did not have a slow bat, and he was better defensively than advertised."
In five minor league seasons, Millar batted .313, and with Portland last season he hit 32 home runs and drove in 131 runs and was named the Eastern League player of the year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bill Has Egypt's Copts Squirming

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
A proposed American law aimed at reducing persecution of religious minorities abroad has aroused anger here, even among the people it is intended to help, and has brought an outcry against American interference in the domestic affairs of other nations.
The Freedom From Religious Persecution Act was approved on March 25 by the House Committee on International Relations by a vote of 31 to 5. It is expected to be submitted to the full House in May. The Senate bill is pending in the Foreign Relations Committee. The bill would mandate sanctions against countries found guilty of religious discrimination. 
 Advocates of the law have made it clear that it is aimed at these situations: China's persecution of certain Christians, Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists; Saudi Arabia's treatment of its non-Muslim expatriate work force, and the alleged systematic persecution of the large Christian populations in Egypt and the Sudan.
But the legislation has been opposed by many Egyptian Copts, the largest Christian minority in the Arab world.
If enacted, such a law could strengthen the demands of those in Congress who want to eliminate American economic aid to Egypt, now at $2 billion a year, which has been a pillar of Egyptian-American relations for nearly two decades -- since Egypt signed the Camp David peace accord with Israel.
The proposed law comes as the Arab world is boiling over with accusations that the United States applies a double standard of justice -- punishing Arab and Muslim countries with sanctions while overlooking alleged Israeli violations of Palestinian rights. The assault on the proposal has been joined by Government and opposition news organizations, members of Parliament and members of the public -- including leading figures among Copts, who feel they are being used as pawns by enemies of Egypt.
"Those who are trying to incite foreigners to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs are, in fact, stabbing Copts in the heart," said Edward Ghali Eldahabi, a Coptic member of the People's Assembly, a consultative group made up of senior jurists and community leaders.
Another Copt, Mounir Abdelnour, chairman of the board of Vitrac, a major exporter of food products, said: "Yes, there are problems. But we are not killed in the streets by Muslims, and these issues can be solved within a framework of a national dialogue."
Copts contend that they are not a cultural or ethnic minority but Egyptians whose ancestors embraced Christianity in the first century. They make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population of 65 million.
Speaking privately, prominent Copts in business, the arts and the professions concede that there are indeed discriminatory measures against Copts.
One is an archaic law dating from the Ottoman Empire era that bans the construction or repair of churches. Another is the general failure of Egyptian schools to include Egypt's six centuries of Coptic influence before the advent of Islam in high school history courses.
Copts are also excluded from much of the country's political life, including senior Government jobs, and from most top-level academic positions. Still, most Copts here maintain that the wisest way to deal with the issue is quietly, and within Egypt.
"We don't have an affirmative action program, if you will, concerning Copts but there is no active persecution," said a high-ranking Coptic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
One of Egypt's most successful Coptic businessmen, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "Such laws may advance the political agenda of some, but they overlook the harm it could do to all Copts here."
"As the population grows bigger and poorer, Islamic fundamentalism has grown considerably stronger," he continued. "It would be like hitting the wall with your head. The Americans can impose sanctions, but they cannot and will not help us."
On the other side of the divide, those leading the lobbying for the measure are the growing and powerful Coptic populations in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia -- estimated at well over 600,000. The Coptic immigrants, most of whom have arrived in the last 20 years seeking economic opportunities, have formed powerful lobbies that encourage political activism.
"We did not invent the law," Selim Naguib, a leading activist among Copts in Canada, said in a telephone interview. "This is a matter of sovereign American decisions. But if Egypt practices no discrimination against its Christians, as the Government claims, why do they fear it?"
Mr. Naguib, a retired jurist who lives in Montreal, has co-signed full page advertisements like one that appeared in The New York Times on Feb. 13 and The Washington Post on March 24 contending that Christians in Egypt are treated as second-class citizens by Muslim militants in the Government establishment and that hate crimes against the Copts are not pursued vigorously by law-enforcement officials.
"I love Egypt as much as anyone," he said. "But it defies logic to say there are no problems for Copts when they are getting killed in their churches and shops and excluded from Government except in the most token fashion. Instead of saying everything is fine, what are the solutions our critics are proposing to address these problems?"
The Government's reaction has been to marshal legions of Copts to assert in newspapers, on radio and television that they face no discrimination and to brand those outside as traitors.
"This small minority of fanatical migrant Copts has allowed itself to be a toy in the hands of Zionist organizations opposed to Egypt, spreading these lies in very expensive paid advertisements to provoke foreign nations into pressuring Egypt," said Makram Mohammed Makram, a Muslim who is chairman of the board and executive editor of the Government-owned Al Mussawar. His comments reflected the official view that Christians are doing well in business and professional circles.
A different view has been expressed, though, by many Egyptian Muslims -- particularly among the large liberal elite -- like Saeed Alnajaar, an intellectual and pro-democracy activist who is leader of the New Appeal Club, a liberal forum. He contends that the problems the Copts face are part of "the general political stagnation of the country, which needs to adopt a truly democratic opening in which all issues can be discussed freely and openly."
"On the personal level," said Mr. Alnajaar, "Copts in Egypt have no problems, but it is unquestionably true that on the institutional legalistic level they have something to complain about. The issues are not difficult to solve with some good will -- but above all with a great deal more freedom for all."

HEADLINE: Can-Do American's Patience Paid Off With an Ulster Pact

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 11

 BODY:
Ask George J. Mitchell why he gave up the comforts of retirement from the United States Senate to spend three years trying to wring a peace agreement out of the feuding political leaders of Northern Ireland and he will tell you about his 6-month-old son.
On the day that Andrew Mitchell was born last October, Mr. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, asked his staff to find out how many babies were delivered in Northern Ireland that day. There were 61. 
 "I believe that they are entitled to the same chance in life that I want for my son," he said. "Peace, political stability and reconciliation are not too much to ask for. They are the minimum that a decent civilized society provides."
They are also qualities that have been notably at a minimum in Northern Ireland, where leaders are more accustomed to greeting one another with robust snubs and rebukes. Mr. Mitchell likes to quote David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, who says, "Northern Ireland is the only place I know where someone will drive 100 miles out of his way just to receive an insult."
On Friday, Mr. Ervine joined other political leaders around the negotiating table in praising the former Senator for his stewardship of the 22 months of talks it took to produce that day's peace accord for Northern Ireland. There was general agreement in the tributes that without his guidance and forbearance no accord would have emerged.
As the praise for the self-effacing and indefatigably upbeat 64-year-old chairman continued, Mr. Ervine put it more simply: "I don't know how you stood us all that time."
Lord Alderdice, leader of the moderate Alliance Party, which includes Roman Catholics and Protestants, said: "At various times in this process I have really felt for him. Here the United States sent one of its most able, skilled, talented, humble politicians, a supreme diplomat, and frankly we didn't deserve him."
In his own closing remarks, Mr. Mitchell said he had not had a cross word directed at him the whole time. This probably made him unique in that room, where so much bitterness was continually on display.
Over breakfast recently at the Stormont Hotel across from the drab Civil Service buildings where negotiators met, he theorized that "people here are very nice and friendly -- they're just not friendly to each other." That they remained friendly to him stems from the attribute most often cited for his success: his patience and his willingness to listen.
Since beginning to come here regularly three years ago as an economic adviser to President Clinton, a mission that grew into his assignment as chairman of the peace talks, Mr. Mitchell has become a popular figure in Belfast. On his strolls through the lobby of the downtown Europa Hotel, where he normally stays, he has to pause to shake hands and greet well-wishers.
"Back for more torture?" the piano player in the hotel bar once asked him on one of his more than 100 shuttle-diplomacy trips.
Since taking over the talks in June 1996, his schedule has been to fly to Belfast for the three days of the week that the negotiations are on and then to return to his law practice in Washington and to Heather MacLachlan, the woman he married after leaving the Senate in 1995, promising her that he was also leaving politics.
At the outset of the talks, his widely praised bent for patient attentiveness could be time-consuming. He let Robert McCartney, head of the militant UK Unionist Party, which eventually quit the negotiations, speak for seven hours uninterrupted. He reasoned that just the fact that political leaders of this conflicted society were talking was progress.
Mr. Mitchell said that in more recent months, the pace of the talks had quickened. "When we go in there, we really get down to work," he said.
A member of the Senate for almost 15 years until his retirement in 1995, Mr. Mitchell said his experience there prepared him well for his role here. "I had plenty of practice listening to long debates, seeing people waste time, stall and delay," he said. The big difference in Northern Ireland, he said, was "the overlay of violence," a reminder of which he received at the start of each day in Belfast when an aide would brief him at breakfast on the shootings and mortar attacks and fire bombings that had occurred overnight. Sectarian bloodshed has cost more than 3,200 lives since 1969.
Political parties were admitted to the talks only after signing a commitment to nonviolence and democracy known as the Mitchell Principles. When paramilitary fighters represented by the Ulster Democrats and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, were linked to killings in January, the two parties were suspended from the talks until the truces were clearly holding again.
Mr. Mitchell's success in establishing those entry conditions demonstrated a talent that was to become essential in the last two weeks: the ability to draft language that Northern Ireland's politicians could agree on. "I once told them that the challenge we faced was having to find a way to come up with words that neither side owns," Mr. Mitchell said.
There are long-nursed bitter hurts in the politics of Northern Ireland, grievances stemming from episodes in history that are recalled and cited as contemporary rationale for holding to unyielding positions. Political leaders have to take soundings of their followers more frequently than public figures do in other Western societies. Missteps can be fatal.
"The political pull in Northern Ireland is not toward the center but away from it," Mr. Mitchell said. "Compromise is a foreign concept. There are no win-wins, only winners and losers, and that's a part of their history, culture, vocabulary and experience."
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain noted this characteristic in his remarks in Belfast on Friday, saying that the agreement should end the tradition. "Put this agreement into practice, and we all win," he said.
Aware that part of the reason for throwing a former United States Senator into the Northern Ireland mix was to inject some American can-do positivism into a nay-saying culture, Mr. Mitchell said he once mused out loud about American history.
"I talked about the drafters of the Constitution where big states wanted representation by population and small states wanted it by states and this fellow from Connecticut jumped up and said, 'Why don't we do both?' Every American believes that compromise can result in a better idea than the beginning ideas."
By February, Mr. Mitchell realized that they would not make the May deadline set by Mr. Blair unless he fixed a firm cutoff point, and with the backing of Mr. Blair and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland he settled on last Thursday, the last day before the four-day Easter break. He said then that in his days as Senate majority leader he had always found scheduling votes just before the summer break a good way to focus people on taking action.
On Friday night, he reported a further reason for the rush. He said he feared that the splinter guerrilla groups determined to undermine the talks might try to assassinate him or one of the other participants.
Early on Tuesday, he presented all the parties with his synthesis of their arguments, noting commonalities and reducing to clear options the areas of continuing disagreement. It was that document, refined in three days of round-the-clock dealing, that formed the basis for the agreement that emerged on Friday.
The strong possibility of collapse dogged the talks until the very end, and only the intervention of Mr. Mitchell, the two Prime Ministers and President Clinton on the phone from Washington in the feverish last hours held it together.
In the early hours of Friday, Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, said the design of the new council being created to link the governments of the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland was too subject to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, which will have a Protestant majority. A compromise was worked out whereby the council will be set up before the new Assembly is in place to shape it. Sinn Fein appeared to be back on board.
Then David Trimble, leader of the largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, raised deal-breaking objections over the disarmament of paramilitary groups, reform of the predominantly Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary and how prisoner releases would be treated. Mr. Blair composed a letter giving him the necessary guarantees that he would not be "locked into" an arrangement that could not be broken in the event of a resumption of I.R.A. violence. Mr. Clinton was asked to phone Mr. Trimble with reassurances.
On Friday afternoon, some of Mr. Trimble's party members raised objections to a provision that appeared to make the release of paramilitary prisoners automatic rather than dependent upon conditions at the time. Mr. Trimble withheld his support of the final document until he could quiet the dispute with clarifying language.
"At 4:45 P.M. he said he wanted to go," Mr. Mitchell said Friday night. "At that moment I thought this process is too volatile so we better get it done. I told my staff to tell everyone the meeting was at 5 P.M."
At 5:37 P.M. Mr. Mitchell made his dramatic announcement that a settlement had been reached.
If on flying back to the United States today he is leaving behind what he has described as the most difficult negotiations of his political life, that will not be the dominant memory. In his parting words to the delegates in Belfast, he said, "I have been in politics for 30 years and never have I felt this sense of gratification and responsibility and gratitude that I feel today."

HEADLINE: Evidence Is Scant That Workfare Leads to Full-Time Jobs

SERIES: DOES WORKFARE WORK? First of four articles.

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Three years ago, when a national overhaul of welfare was still a Republican dream in Washington, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began his own ambitious experiment. At its heart was a vast expansion of workfare -- sending tens of thousands of New Yorkers into parks, city offices and hospital wards to work for their welfare checks.
Since then, 200,000 people have passed through what has become by far the largest workfare program in the nation: more than 34,000 are enrolled today. Mr. Giuliani often hails workfare as a keystone of his mayoralty and a national model for rousting people from a culture of dependency. 
 When he does so, he can point out that the city's welfare rolls have shrunk by nearly a third, in part because workfare has forced out people who used to work secretly while getting public assistance. Workfare, the Mayor often says, has also taught some welfare recipients lessons about the ennobling value of work and the responsibility of contributing to society.
But an extensive examination by The New York Times found scant evidence that workfare has accomplished one of its central goals: moving a significant number of people from welfare to full-time work.
Workfare has provided limited job training for many of the poorly skilled, poorly educated New Yorkers on public assistance. Much of the work is so menial that it offers few, if any, skills that employers demand. Participants receive little help looking for a permanent job; half of them get none at all.
And there is no indication that many people have been able to use workfare as a springboard to a real job: a recent state survey, the first of its kind, found that after three months off the rolls, fewer than a third of those who left welfare in New York City had found full- or part-time jobs on the books.
Where workfare leads is a matter of growing urgency as welfare recipients for the first time face being cut off the rolls under new state and Federal laws. The Federal law, enacted two years ago, places a five-year limit on single mothers; adults without young children, supported by the city and state program formerly called Home Relief, are under a two-year limit on cash benefits.
But many workfare participants say they already knew how to push a broom or pick up trash and are mystified at how workfare will lead them to a permanent job.
Mark Cummings, who is 46 and used to be a handyman and plumber, has picked up trash and done odd jobs in Prospect Park since 1995 in return for public assistance. He enjoys the work, is treated well by his supervisors and has only one real complaint: "I just wish this led somewhere."
The Mayor and his senior aides declined to be interviewed for this article and for most of the others in this series of articles. They would not discuss the history of workfare or even some basic questions of fact. Nor would they talk about its future, although the city has quietly made some recent adjustments, and the Mayor's new Social Services Commissioner has hinted of more to come.
"The feeling here now is they would rather not sit down and discuss these issues," said Mr. Giuliani's deputy press secretary, Jack Deacy. "They feel the program's well known."
Some aspects of workfare have indeed been reported before. But to understand in far greater detail how workfare works, and to assess its effectiveness, four Times reporters visited more than 50 work sites over the last four months and spoke with hundreds of participants and supervisors.
The inquiry showed that workfare had failed to live up to a number of promises:
*The Mayor says workfare participants have not taken the places of regular city employees. But, in seeming violation of state welfare law, many participants, especially those cleaning city office buildings or working as clerks and receptionists, are doing work once performed by civil servants. In some cases, they are working side by side with civil servants, doing the same tasks.
*There is a severe shortage of child care for mothers called to workfare. Although state law requires the city to find safe child care for those mothers, the shortage has left some caseworkers unable -- or unwilling -- to give women the help they need. And while mothers without proper care are supposed to be excused from workfare, caseworkers sometimes threaten to cut off their welfare benefits, pushing them into leaving their children in substandard care.
*Picayune or technical work rules are sometimes rigidly enforced, pushing people off welfare whether it is warranted or not. These punishments have created a sizable churning in which thousands of people are cut off the welfare rolls each month, only to return later. When welfare recipients challenge these sanctions in administrative hearings, they are successful two-thirds of the time.
*Working conditions have improved, but workfare participants are still sometimes denied access to toilets and drinking water or lack basic equipment like raincoats and boots. Some, like Clara Chalk, who sweeps the streets of Brooklyn, have not even been issued winter coats.
Even with such problems, many workfare participants said they were happy to be working, were usually treated fairly and found most supervisors empathetic. "This is better," said Celena Vargas, who was raking leaves at a Bronx housing project. "I didn't do anything in my home."
But critics of workfare, and some proponents as well, argue that if people are to find real jobs, most need to know more than how to report to work on time -- especially in a city where the unemployment rate is 9.2 percent, nearly double the national average. They point out that the welfare population is hardly a model labor pool: many recipients have limited skills and educations, a significant number are addicted to drugs or alcohol and some resist the idea of working.
The critics of workfare are hardly limited to liberal Democrats and advocates for the poor. Across the country, where the welfare caseload has dropped by about a third, local officials rethinking welfare have largely shunned workfare as an expensive program that has not been notably successful at getting people into real jobs. Instead, they have pushed people directly into the private job market, especially in areas where unemployment is much lower than in New York.
New York is the only city to move large numbers of single mothers into workfare. By contrast, Los Angeles County, with the nation's largest welfare caseload and second-largest workfare program, hopes to keep most mothers out of workfare. Officials plan to spend the next two years helping mothers look for jobs, improve their basic education and hone their vocational skills. Only mothers who do not find jobs after two years will end up in workfare.
Mr. Giuliani, though, often does not use jobs as a measure of workfare's success. He emphasizes instead the 31 percent decline in the welfare rolls, to 797,000 last month from 1.16 million in 1995. The core of that decline, he said in a speech in February, "is the workfare program, which continues to be controversial, but it's something that I think is probably the best thing that we've done."
But many participants said the public debate had ignored many daily realities of what is formally called the Work Experience Program. Some said there was often not enough work to fill a shift. Parks workers are often sent home early, especially in winter. Some W.E.P. workers who sweep streets or clean outside housing projects said they finished in an hour or two, then spent their shifts hanging out.
Sometimes, supervisors just make work.
At the Sedgwick Houses, a housing project in the Bronx, a workfare crew finished raking leaves by 10:30 one morning, recalled Yolanda Green, a member of the crew. The supervisor grabbed the plastic bags into which the leaves had been swept, dumped the leaves back out and told the workers to sweep them up again. Ms. Green refused, but before the dispute could be resolved, rain began to fall and the workers and their supervisor went inside.
 
The Mission
A Shift From Training To the 'Work Ethic'
Workfare in New York dates back to the Koch administration in the mid-1980's, when the city began requiring some welfare recipients to choose from a mix of training programs, high school equivalency classes or work experience in city agencies.
Early in 1995, the Giuliani administration started to expand workfare dramatically and to narrow the choices. What it created were essentially two programs.
The first participants were adults on Home Relief, who are required to stay on workfare until they find full-time jobs. Participants typically work 25 to 35 hours every two weeks -- in six- or seven-hour shifts -- most of them for the Sanitation or Parks Departments.
There are no training or educational programs available for W.E.P. workers on Home Relief. The Mayor says he is convinced that most participants need only learn basic work skills to get a job in the private sector.
"In welfare, I think one of the prime mistakes that we made was we put training first and work second," Mr. Giuliani said in an interview with Times reporters and editors four days before his re-election last November. "And therefore when they did that institutionally, millions of people lost the work ethic. Work is hard. Getting up every day, making sure you get to a job, getting yourself cleaned and ready to do it -- there's a certain discipline that's required for everybody in that. And what we were doing in welfare was training, training, training, training."
In 1996, the city expanded workfare again, to single mothers on welfare. Some were forced to leave college or other school programs. By last January, the last month for which complete data were available, there were 17,000 single mothers in workfare, along with 16,000 adults on Home Relief.
Most mothers work five days a week from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M., usually filing papers or doing general cleaning in city offices. After six months, they spend a month in a basic job-search class and are sent out to look for work. Those who do not get a job -- and they are the vast majority -- usually return to workfare.
Today, despite the expansion, the 34,100 people in workfare represent fewer than 10 percent of the adults on welfare. An additional 130,000 adults have been deemed eligible for workfare but have yet to be put to work. City officials declined to explain why.
From the start, the city essentially took a one-size-fits-all approach to workfare. Participants were generally given low-skill jobs, whether or not they had work experience.
For 14 years, Eustacia Ojeda had worked as a cashier in a Brooklyn liquor store. A year ago, the owner retired and the store shut down. She was making $140 a week at the time. Now, she finds herself picking up trash in the parks and feeling bitter that the city is not helping her find a job.
Ms. Ojeda went on Home Relief when her unemployment benefits ran out. She gets food stamps, a rent allowance and $101 a month in cash. In return, she sweeps and rakes five days every two weeks at the Parade Grounds, a complex of baseball diamonds and tennis courts next to Prospect Park.
"We don't learn anything here," she said. "The program says you come here for training, but all we do is pick up paper."
Ms. Ojeda said she had been answering newspaper ads in hope of finding work. Nothing has come through, and she suspects it has to do with her age. "It's hard to find a job now for me, because I'm 56," she said.
Critics of workfare say her predicament shows the futility of the one-size-fits-all approach. Since she already knows basic work skills, they say, the city should be teaching her new skills to make her more marketable.
"It's one thing if all you want to do is to create a permanent workfare work force," said City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the General Welfare Committee. "But the fact is that we are supposed to go from welfare to work, not from welfare to workfare."
Of course, many, if not most, people in workfare do not have Ms. Ojeda's long grounding in work. But whether the stain on someone's resume involves time in prison or an interrupted education, even proponents of workfare say that kind of personal history is precisely why people need to learn more than basic work habits to get a job.
"Workfare is an essential first component in any welfare reform program," said Suzanne Strickland, a supporter of the W.E.P. program who as a private consultant created a city program on linking welfare recipients with private companies.
Ms. Strickland said it was an important administrative achievement just to have reviewed everyone in Home Relief to determine who was capable of enrolling in workfare and to strip the rolls of people who had used welfare to supplement off-the-books jobs.
But because more than half of those on welfare do not have high school diplomas, she said, work experience has to be combined with education, training and experience in private companies to move people permanently off welfare. Also, many companies require applicants to pass a drug test, "and that's a problem," she said.
"Work experience in a workfare program," Ms. Strickland said, "just is not a credential to get you in the private sector."
 
The Numbers
Hard to Determine Program's Success
Whether many people ever reach the private sector is a central mystery of workfare.
City officials take two approaches when talking about welfare to work. Mr. Giuliani often says work experience is valuable in itself -- whether or not it leads to a real job.
"They clean the parks, they clean the streets, they clean the buses and they clean the sanitation trucks, and they contribute back to the rest of society," he said in a speech in February. "Now what's wrong with that? That is exactly what the social contract is all about."
At other times, though, Mr. Giuliani and his aides say workfare has moved a large number of New Yorkers into real jobs. Asked how many W.E.P. workers had found permanent jobs, Mr. Deacy, the deputy press secretary, said there were 130,000 "documented job placements" between 1994 and 1997. But neither he nor the Mayor's press secretary, Colleen Roche, would respond to questions about whether these placements involved only people in workfare or in welfare over all.
The number of W.E.P. workers specifically known to have obtained permanent jobs is much smaller. Since 1995, about 1,000 have been hired full time by city agencies: 300 by the city's Housing Authority, 200 by the Parks Department, 97 by the Health Department and 451 by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the city hospitals.
The Parks Department says it helped 750 W.E.P. workers get jobs in private companies over the last three years. An additional 640 found jobs through the city's Businesslink program, created to connect welfare recipients with jobs, during the fiscal year that ended last June, a mayoral spokesman said.
The first broad statistical insights into the question came from the recent state survey, and it found that of those who came off the rolls in New York City from July 1996 through March 1997, 29 percent made at least $100 on the books in the first three months after leaving welfare.
The survey used computer databases to compare lists of people whose benefits had ended against records of wages reported to the state by employers over the following three months. The survey did not distinguish between full-time jobs and part-time or occasional work; nor did it take into account people who were working off the books, were self-employed or had moved out of the state.
Mr. Giuliani highlighted those flaws in publicly criticizing the state study. But the city has not surveyed people leaving welfare or workfare, and has blocked independent attempts to survey former welfare recipients, including those working off the books.
An attempt by professors at Columbia University's School of Social Work broke down in part because the city wanted to review and respond to any report before publication.
And The Times sued the city last fall, seeking the names and addresses of those leaving welfare so it could create a random sample for a scientific survey.
City lawyers contended that the information was confidential under state law. Lawyers for The Times argued that state law requires the city to furnish the information, provided the newspaper does not publish recipients' names and other personal information. The newspaper has promised in writing not to do so. On Friday, Justice Bernard J. Fried of State Supreme Court ruled that The Times was entitled to the information. City officials said they would appeal.
In recent months, while Mr. Giuliani has continued to hail workfare as a great success, the city has quietly begun to make some changes that seem to acknowledge that work experience, by itself, is often not enough to move people from welfare to work.
Six months ago, the city started tailoring programs toward some single mothers' educational and work histories. Those with recent job experience were sent immediately for a four-week job search, instead of first spending six months in workfare.
Many single mothers who lack a high school diploma or English-language skills have been enrolled in programs in which they alternate between a week in workfare and a week of studying. About a quarter of the mothers in workfare are now enrolled in work-study, city officials said.
The Mayor and his new Human Resources Commissioner, Jason A. Turner -- who arrived from Wisconsin in February with a reputation for reconfiguring welfare -- have not said much publicly about other changes in workfare. But there have been hints that they may shift direction.
Speaking to legislators in Albany last month, Mr. Turner said his highest priority would be to route welfare recipients directly into private jobs and into temporary, subsidized jobs in private companies. Workfare should be considered a useful alternative for those who cannot get permanent or temporary employment, he said.
For now, though, three-quarters of the mothers in workfare are still left working in city agencies with occasional breaks for a job search. As for childless adults, they must still figure out on their own how to make the journey from workfare to work.

Does Workfare Work?
 
TODAY -- An uncertain road to a real job.
 
TOMORROW -- A low-cost city labor force.
 
TUESDAY -- The scramble for child care.
 
WEDNESDAY -- Trimming the rolls: Tough or too tough?

Agins/The New York Times)(pg. 1); "Real Work or Make-Work? 2 Views of Workfare" -- ONEKKI CLARKE, pregnant at 14, a high school dropout at 17, is convinced that workfare is her ticket out of welfare. Now 19 and the mother of two chidren, Ms. Clark enrolled in a work-study program four months ago. Every two weeks, she spends four days in class, working toward a general equivalency diploma, and six days in a Bronx nursing office, where she has learned many office skill. She dreams of going to college. Her progress was interrupted late last month, when she became homeless. But she is determined to make the setback temporary; she hopes to be back at the job and her studies as soon as she finds. ANNETTE COTTON is in many ways a model workfare participant. Miss Cotton, who is 41 years old and lives in the Castle Hill section of the Bronx, has an associate's degree from Touro College and a substantial work history: before going on welfare six years ago, she was a clerk and a receptionist and helped run an informal day-care center. For the last two years, whe has been a workfare worker at two neighborhood playgrounds and has received a written citation for diligence from her supervisors. But while she says she has been looking for work lately, she seems depressed and unsure how to use her workfare experience to get back on her feet.

HEADLINE: So, How Much Did You Pay for Your Ticket?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
IT was a typical flight in the era of deregulation: United Airlines Flight 815 from Chicago to Los Angeles, with 204 tickets sold at almost as many prices.
 Deregulation has changed the way passengers are routed and tickets are sold. To illustrate the wide disparity in fares, United provided details of this Boeing 757 flight last Oct. 31 from its hub at O'Hare International Arport. A total of 186 passengers showed up for the trip, 68 of them beginning their journey in Chicago and the rest changing planes there. The flight would end in Los Angeles, but that was the final stop for only 97 ticket holders; most of the others were bound for Australia, on a different plane with the same flight number. 
 But if any of the 33 passengers who held tickets only for the Chicago-to-Los Angeles trip had compared notes, they would have found that they had paid 27 different fares. One paid nothing, using frequent flyer miles; another who bought a first-class ticket on the day of departure paid $1,248.51. And one who bought a coach ticket on the day of travel paid $108.26.
 Illustrating the complexity of pricing, Gregory Taylor, vice president of revenue management at United, said the last passenger was probably an older person flying on a special deal called a Silver Travel Pack, which requires advance purchase of coupons and advance reservations, and then exchange of a coupon for a ticket on the day of the flight.
 In general, people who bought their tickets earlier paid less, but not always. The lowest cash fare paid was $87.21 one way (purchased 29 days in advance), but one compulsive planner bought his ticket before Labor Day and paid $229.60.
 Deregulation is a success, according to both the airlines and Government aviation experts, because average fares are down and travel is up. The Air Transport Association, the big airlines' trade group, says fares, adjusted for inflation, are down 35.5 percent from 1978.
 It has made life complicated, though, with airline pricing completely divorced from cost and, from the passenger's side of the ticket counter, arbitrary. The Transportation Department said last week that it was formulating a policy to determine when pricing crossed the line from arbitrary to predatory, with big airlines squeezing out little ones.
 The big airlines say they are simply more efficient. Cyril D. Murphy, vice president for international affairs at United, said that before deregulation, planes flew about 55 percent full, with only three or four fares offered. Since then, he said, planes are fuller so the costs are spread wider, and the average fare has dropped sharply, allowing a boom in air travel and benefiting both consumers and the airlines.
 In the weeks and even months before a flight, prices fluctuate. Rather than let seats go empty, Mr. Murphy said, airlines will mark down prices if demand is slack. But they also hold out seats until the last moment, for last-minute travelers; the high price charged at that point, airline executives say, is the airlines' reward for taking the risk that the seat might go empty.
 But customers, Mr. Murphy acknowledged, do not always see it that way. "We always assumed we had a happy customer base," he said. "We didn't understand that on a micro basis, that isn't what the customer was seeing."

HEADLINE: The World;
Surprises in the Global Tourism Boom

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
IF those spring holiday airport crowds seem worse than ever this year, think of that suitcase on your foot as merely a harbinger of even bigger things to come. Travel -- yearround and around the world -- is taking off on a phenomenal upward trajectory, with the numbers of tourists growing faster, proportionately, than the population of the countries they come from, or go to visit. Trips closer to home are also on the increase almost everywhere. Spending on travel is expected to grow fivefold in the next two decades.
An industry that moves so many people from place to place -- on as many as six billion trips a year -- and accounts for 10 percent of the world's annual economic growth is bound to have more than just economic effects. Decades ago package tours began laying waste to the Spain's Costa Brava, Caribbean islands and some priceless Himalayan valleys. In the hamlet of Lukla, the jumping-off point for Mount Everest, they started serving muesli and french toast for breakfast and selling nice, soft toilet paper for trails with no toilets. Borneo's jungles got video. Want a picture of a stately African Masai hunter or an Igorot villager in Luzon? Pay up. You take their privacy, and maybe their souls. They take your money. 
 But mass travel has another side. More people are meeting people than at any time in history. In a country like China, where millions are beginning to travel, this exposure could either bind the country or further fragment it as people decide how much alike or different they are. Imagine the earful tour groups from Beijing or Shanghai might get traveling in Tibet or Hong Kong some day. Travel creates jobs and earns hard currency in scores of countries, including the United States, where it is a major export and services industry. Its very destructiveness has sounded alarms, and not just a few countries have awakened in time to save their land and heritage, learning in the process how precious their culture is.
Travel, even group tourism, has been around for centuries. People have long teamed up on pilgrimages, as we know from Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales." Thomas Cook, the father of modern tourism, got his start in the British Midlands taking groups to temperance rallies (tea and sandwiches included). The difference now is scale. Wide-bodied aircraft, deregulation and competition mean more routes and lower fares. With the almost complete collapse of Communism, many barriers have fallen or been torn down, releasing pent-up demand for travel in both directions: visitors out, visitors in. Rudimentary English has become the industry's international language.
Even Americans, still laggards at crossing borders when compared with many Europeans and Asians, picked up a record number of passports -- six million -- in the last year, the State Department says, and there are now more than 45 million American passports in circulation.
In an age of global economics, business travel has pushed up passport applications, not only for the traveling executive. Family members are now nearly three times as likely to be included on business trips than in 1990. Robert Kaplan, who poked around the far corners for his book, "The Ends of the Earth" (Random House) said business travelers are now probably the most savvy tourists. "Look at Forbes, Fortune -- what business people read," he said. "They are filled with articles about the outside world."
Paradoxically, the electronic connections enjoyed by businesses and home computer owners may be encouraging, not discouraging, travel. The Travel Industry Association of America found that six million Americans booked trips online this year, often after browsing through electronic encyclopedias, atlases and the home pages of state or foreign tourism authorities. The association predicts that by the end of 1998 bookings via the Internet may rise to 18 million.
 
Voyages to Granny

Cyberspace can never beat the heat, the smells, the sounds, the sense of Foreign. For Mr. Kaplan, the experience of arrival may be the tipoff to a place.
"Look closely at airports and you can see how a country is doing," he said. "Is the airport safe? Do you have to pay bribes? Airports are quasi-governmental places." Closer to home, he added, "you don't have to leave Penn Station to know that New York is getting better."
As more immigrants become United States citizens, getting to grandmother's house is no longer just a jaunt over the river and through the woods, but more likely a voyage over continents and seas. Immigrant families, fewer of whom have had to renounce all ties to their homelands because of political dangers, are traveling back to keep their children in close touch. Americans with deeper roots here go to take a look at where their neighbors came from.
When Catherine O'Neill, an expert on refugees, and her husband, Richard Reeves, the political writer, went globetrotting with their joint extended family a year ago, she handed out questionnaires at each stop. "I really felt that they are going to live in a global world, and that to understand it only from the perspective of the U.S. and Europe is not really seeing it," said Ms. O'Neill, the author with her husband of "Family Travels: Around the World in 30 (or So) Days" (Andrews and McMeel). "I asked them: In this country do they have jobs that we don't have in the United States? What kind of movies are being advertised? How do people get around the streets? In your life, will this country be important?"
Twenty years ago, when the world's population was 4.4 billion, 287 million people took international trips, according to the World Tourism Organization. By 1996, when global population stood at about 5.7 billion, 595 million international tourists were on the move. In 2020, the tourism organization's experts predict, 1.6 billion of the world's 7.8 billion people will take a foreign trip.
 
Internal Travel
 Billions more will take their first, modest vacations closer to home. For example, a man in Beijing named Wang and his small family recently boarded No. 1 Special Tourism Bus in the Chinese capital for their first trip to the Great Wall, about 60 miles away. Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, which told their story, said that Mr. Wang was one of nearly 77 million people who visited tourist sites in or around Beijing last year. They spent, on average, about $10 a family.
In India, the world's second-most-populous country, whole villages charter buses and occasionally trains to take people with very little expendable income to places that were out of the reach of earlier generations. Tour operators everywhere are finding that standards of living need to rise only marginally for people to get an itch to hit the road. Perhaps even because of hard times -- like the economic stress Asia is now experiencing -- the popularity of short trips continues to rise.
Not every place is automatically threatened by an invasion, said Mr. Kaplan. "Are we messing up the world?" he asked. "I see that more in the Caribbean than anywhere else, where the islands are so small. But the Hyatts and Marriotts in a place like Cairo kind of disappear among the 14 million people."
The widely held view among environmentalists -- who don't know whether to weep or cheer at the news that ecotourism is now one of the fastest-growing travel sectors -- has been that mass international tourism has been the most damaging to natural settings. But as numbers of domestic travelers grow, that assumption cracks. In the case of India, with nearly a billion people, foreign travelers are still very small in number -- not even one-sixth of the 17 million tourists who go to Thailand annually, for example. Indian beaches and mountain resorts, monuments and historical sites are taking a trouncing from short-haul Indian visitors. Similarly, Southeast Asia is experiencing a boom in the construction of clubs and golf courses for the local business class, and it has forever altered rural landscapes.
Countries can respond to environmental and cultural problems imaginatively. The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan raised prices and limited the number of tourist visas issued; it also developed with the World Bank a trust fund for protecting one of the last pristine mountain environments in Asia. The World Bank and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, have both helped the Mexican state of Oaxaca excavate, preserve and display Meso-American archeological ruins -- saving sites but also making them accessible to tourists in a controlled way.
"Oaxaca is the best example of how you can have cultural tourism enhance the value of a historical site by having a local population very committed not only to conservation but to helping new generations create a new heritage of living cultures," said Lourdes Arizpe, a Unesco cultural official and a Mexican anthropologist. "Otherwise, we turn the world into a museum."
For both tourists and hosts, fortifying cultures as well as buildings is important, said Deborah Luhrman of the World Tourism Organization. "Tourism provides the money to restore local sites and monuments," she said. "It also helps the people who live there to understand the value of what they have."
"Travel is one of the basic human rights now," Ms. Luhrman said. "It is part of what makes the quality of life better. For some people, the right to travel has become part of political freedom."

SHAPING A NATION
 Twentieth Century American
 Architecture and Its Makers.
 By Carter Wiseman.
 Illustrated. 412 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $39.95. 
 This book is about as good a summary of American architecture of this century as anyone is likely to write. It is full and accurate in its facts, wise and fair in its judgments. Carter Wiseman, who for 16 years was the respected architecture critic of New York magazine, states his premise clearly in the introduction: "I believe that serious architecture should be buildable, useful and beautiful." An obvious truth, you would think, yet one that needs affirmation at the end of a century in which architecture has too often been perceived as a sport of clashing verbal manifestoes rather than as the art of designing places for human habitation. Wiseman is comfortable in the world of ideas, but he understands that an idea becomes truly architectural only when it has been embodied in a physical reality.
If you are any kind of fan of architecture, reading a book like this is like visiting the town you grew up in. Wiseman takes you on a long informative stroll among familiar landmarks. Here are the wonderful small masterpieces of the turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts movement, the great factories of America's industrial heyday, the nostalgia of the Colonial Revival, the soaring Art Deco towers. Then comes the shocking arrival from Europe, in the 1930's, of the modern movement, followed by its triumph and then by a series of reactions against it -- the preservation movement, the urbanism of the indispensable Jane Jacobs and the post-modernist revivals of the 80's and 90's. Finally you arrive at the computer-influenced design of today. Wiseman shows you, too, a scrapbook of photos of your town's old-timers: Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies van der Rohe, Frank Gehry and other architects of an amazingly diverse century.
Wiseman is a challenging guide. His praise is not easily earned, and when it does come, it is usually framed in a "yes, but" format. His strength is the care he takes to step back for a longer look, to sketch the cultural and social background of a career or a building. At his best, he can illuminate an entire reputation in a few words. The pages on the Pop-chic world of Robert Venturi, for example, are definitive, unsparing without being unsympathetic.
There are a couple of standard ways to write a book like this, both of which Wiseman avoids. You can string all your material on the thread of a single idea, making everything into a march of progress. The classic example in architecture books is Sigfried Giedion's "Space, Time and Architecture" (1941), a morality tale about the birth, tribulations and victory of the modern movement. That kind of master narrative, giving shape to history by presenting it, in the manner of Marx, as a tidal trend, is hopelessly out of fashion. But if you can't supply such a plausible fiction to give meaning to your material, you risk producing the second kind of bad book, the one that presents history as encyclopedia: just one thing after another, which in the case of architecture means one style after another, each expressing nothing more significant than boredom with the previous style.
Wiseman skirts both traps by bringing into his story, as much as possible, the writers and theorists who shaped the culture from which the architecture sprang. He refuses to make myth, but by showing us how others did he gives his book a quality of intellectual and social narrative that raises it above the level of merely factual history. He starts by returning to the beginning of the 19th century to find the sources of the architecture of the 20th. You gain a sense of the cultural discourse from which architecture arises, from early copybooks to the theorists of today.
If there is a weakness, it is overcrowding. "Shaping a Nation" covers a lot of ground. It is packed so tight with fact and judgment that there often isn't space for a building or a designer to be fully fleshed out. In 386 pages of text, 190 different architects are discussed, not to mention many people in other fields -- and a lot of those pages are broken up by photographs. Wiseman seems never to have met a fact he didn't want to include. The inevitable result is writing that sometimes stuffs whole eras into a speedy sentence or two, as in this appraisal of the influence of Andrew Jackson Downing and Alexander Jackson Davis in the 19th century: "The stylistic shift promulgated by Downing and Davis away from the neo-classical was abetted by the increasing size and economic diversity of the post-revolutionary population. And that led, predictably enough, to a steady fragmentation of the Colonial heritage." You need to possess some knowledge of your own to fill in the blanks when the writing becomes this skeletal. It is only fair to add that I tested the book on a high school senior with a passionate interest in architecture but no formal study of it, who reported that he understood the book just fine and liked it. Still, it probably isn't at its best as an introduction for raw beginners.
For a book so packed with facts, errors are few and minor. William Rawn did not renovate the Boston Navy Yard and Wright's Larkin Building, despite its importance to architecture, was at no time "one of Buffalo's most prominent landmarks." Perhaps the only slip of any importance is the statement that at Thomas Jefferson's original Unversity of Virginia, one of the nation's greatest works of architecture, the lawn was enclosed on three sides but left open to the west. Metaphorically that is probably true -- the lawn conceived as looking out toward the open frontier -- but geographically the open side is south. And I would quarrel with Wiseman's conventional view that it was a disaster when, in 1896, the opening was blocked with a new building by Stanford White. White's enclosure of the lawn occurred in the same decade as the appearance of the historian Frederick Jackson Turner's classic essay on the closing of the American frontier. Architecture embodies history. But it is exactly this kind of author-reader argument that makes the book fun.
A few gripes: Wiseman's prose is literate but so conventional it sometimes sounds like committee work. He can be loose with words -- "romantic" is one he throws around too much and never defines. Of Louis Kahn, the greatest American architect of the second half of the century (as Wright, far greater, was of the first), the author says he avoided "literal romanticism," whatever that may be. And why is European modernism, with its Cubist abstractions and its ardent, often impractical social utopianism, always described as "rationalist," while Wright, with his fuller sense of life, is "romantic"? Such words need closer examination. The book in general is well produced, but the color reproductions are bad. The numerous large portraits take up too much space -- most architects look like anyone else -- but a few are gems, as is one of Wright in 1915 with flowing tie and long curls, still trying to resemble, at 48, a Wildean esthete.
These are blemishes in a welcome work. Architecture, more even than the other visual arts, must be experienced directly to be experienced at all. You must inhabit its spaces, sense its scale and its materiality, know it in its setting. "Shaping a Nation" should send many people out to do just that.

HEADLINE: Coalition and Builder Battle in Riverhead

BYLINE: By MARY CUMMINGS 

 BODY:
When the East End's principal business was farming, Riverhead was the commercial hub for both forks of Long Island. But for almost 20 years, while South Fork towns have boomed as chic resorts and second-home havens, and the North Fork has evolved into elegant wine country, Riverhead, a town of 23,000, has been languishing. And for almost as long, the town's preservationists, planners and Main Street merchants have been arguing with large-scale commercial developers over the real key to Riverhead's rebirth.
Now, the forces appear poised for a showdown: earth-moving equipment is already at work on the site of a planned 51-acre megamall that its opponents feel was improperly pushed through the approval process last November. 
 On one side of the battle is East End Properties, the New York City-based development company that plans to build the mall on the corner of Route 58 and Mill Road on the outskirts of town. Called Riverhead Center, it is to be a shopping mecca with twice the retail space of downtown Riverhead. H. B. Gianos, the 38-year-old president of East End Properties, argues that eastern Long Island is a woefully underserved market, with potential profits that Riverhead is ideally located to reap. In his view, Riverhead Center is the solution to the town's economic problems.
"You can see how starved people moving in from the West are," Mr. Gianos said. "They're used to being able to go to a modern supermarket, the cinema."
By bringing in a huge new Waldbaum's, a multiplex theater and stores like Home Depot, Circuit City, Staples and Barnes & Noble, as well as other national and local retailers to the Riverhead Center site, Mr. Gianos insists that he is insuring Riverhead's survival. As he sees it, the town's future is as a shopping venue offering access to large-scale retailers and outlet stores, plentiful space and ample parking. Downtown Riverhead, he feels, can sustain itself with entertainment and eating attractions. Mr. Gianos contends that in serving the needs of consumers who have been deprived of competitive, convenient shopping, Riverhead Center will also provide the jobs and tax revenues Riverhead desperately needs.
To bolster his argument, Mr. Gianos points to the success of the Tanger Outlet Center farther west on Route 58. Having opened in 1994 as a 285,000-square-foot outdoor mall, Tanger is undergoing expansion and is on is way to becoming the largest manufacturers' outlet center in the country.
On the other side of the conflict are the forces whose ideal is to retain the rural character of Riverhead's surroundings while channeling commercial activity back into the moribund downtown district. "Keep Riverhead's Future in Riverhead's Hands" is the battle cry of their newly formed organization, the Riverhead Growth Coalition, whose membership includes local businesses and private citizens.
On March 19, the coalition held a news conference in downtown Riverhead to set forth 11 reasons "why Riverhead Center should not be permitted" and to start an advertising campaign under the banner, "Don't Let Big-City Developers Determine Riverhead's Future."
"Right now, there is a surplus of commercially zoned space along Route 58 and in downtown Riverhead," said Barry Barth, the group's spokesman, who is also the proprietor of Barth's Drug Store and president of the Riverhead Business Improvement District. "There is plenty of room for cinemas, restaurants, building supply stores, supermarkets and other businesses, and we would welcome their addition to our community." Meanwhile, the battle is being fought in the courts as well as in the news media. A series of suits and counter-suits was begun last spring when the improvement district, whose volunteer members are dedicated to strengthening the local business community, joined the Riverhead Building Supply Corporation and several other businesses, including the local hardware and electrical-supply stores, to sue the town of Riverhead, challenging the process by which it had approved Riverhead Center. When that suit was dismissed last December, it was quickly followed by another, which argued that the rezoning in 1997 permitting commercial development on land extending from the Riverhead Center site to the eastern entrance of the Long Island Expressway had been carried out without due consideration of the impact such development would have on the community.
The rezoning, which was widely criticized in the letters column of the local paper as an 11th-hour sellout to developers more interested in enriching themselves than in serving local needs, added momentum to a wave of anti-administration sentiment. Voters ultimately swept the Town Supervisor, James Stark, a Republican, and his two running mates out of office last November. The victors, members of the new Riverhead Party, were led by Vincent Villella, a Main Street businessman and a former Republican.
In a countersuit, Mr. Gianos and his company contended that Riverhead Building Supply's huge new drive-through lumber yard on Pulaski Street, which had its grand opening early last month, was spared the kind of scrutiny from the town that Riverhead Center received.They pointed to the high volume of truck traffic that the site would generate in a neighborhood that includes a day care center and a Little League field. The suit alleges a lack of compliance with the state's Environmental Quality Review Act.
Two months after Mr. Villella took office and found himself "stuck between the two lawsuits," as he put it, he was bracing for more suits from Riverhead Center. They arrived on March 18, when the developer filed suit against the Riverhead Business Improvement District and several of its individual members, contending that the district is prohibited by its own bylaws from participating in lawsuits.
"The funny part of it," Mr. Villella said, "is that before the election I was on the board of the B.I.D. It's getting out of hand, and I'm going to have to meet with both parties."
Describing himself as a "good mediator," Mr. Villella admitted that finding common ground in this case would not be easy.
"It'll never happen," Mr. Gianos said, suggesting that the recalcitrance is all on the side of his adversaries. He described the legal challenges to the rezoning that paved the way for Riverhead Center as nothing more than "vehicles to obstruct competition" and said the suits were financed and orchestrated by Riverhead Building Supply to fend off competition from Home Depot. He contended he was warned at the outset that this would happen.
"Early on I was told I was in big trouble by the most powerful family in town," Mr. Gianos said, referring to the Goodale family, the owners of Riverhead Building Supply, which he called the East End's "monopoly building supply company."
"I was told in no uncertain terms that they would do everything to oppose Home Depot," he said.
Mr. Gianos said he had tried to reason with the family but has had no success. Nor does he appear to have changed any minds among members of the Business Improvement District, whom he charged with adopting "anti-competitive, anti-business tactics to maintain the status quo" in Riverhead after failing to generate new jobs themselves or to complete any of several plans for creating downtown attractions.
In a vigorous public relations campaign, Mr. Gianos has issued statements predicting that Riverhead Center will create approximately 1,200 "permanent, year-round jobs," inject "millions of new dollars into the region's economy each year" and contribute greatly toward the "commercial revitalization of Riverhead." Riverhead Center will also make a significant tax contribution to the town, Mr. Gianos said, citing projected annual real estate taxes of $850,000.
"We are not, as a company, thrilled to have Home Depot come to Riverhead," conceded Jesse R. Goodale 3d, speaking recently for Riverhead Building Supply and his family. But, he added, "we as a company are perfectly prepared for Home Depot to go into any property presently zoned for it. There is plenty of room."
Mr. Goodale insisted that his objection is not to Home Depot, nor even to Riverhead Center per se. What he and the others are challenging, he said, is the decision made by the previous administration to open up a huge swath of land for commercial development on Route 58 without considering the impact the development of miles of megamalls would have on the town.
"It is our contention," he said, "that they should not have done this major rezoning until and unless the town has in place a master plan for commercial development in the town as a whole." Mr. Goodale has little doubt what that impact will be: increased traffic and the continued decline of the remaining downtown businesses.
"The basic thrust," he said, "will be to forever change the nature of this town."
In stressing that he is neither anti-growth nor anti-competition but rather pro-planning and pro-Riverhead, Mr. Goodale advanced themes that the Riverhead Growth Coalition has expanded on in its campaign. At the top of its 11-item list of reasons why Riverhead Center must be stopped is the surplus of vacant, commercially zoned space that already exists along Route 58 and in downtown Riverhead.
In this, the forces against Riverhead Center are powerfully armed with a 1997 report on retail commercial development prepared by the Suffolk County Planning Commission. According to the report, in 1996 the town of Riverhead had an overall shopping-center vacancy rate of 17.1 percent. The vacancy rate in Riverhead's central business district was even higher -- 27 percent -- the highest of any downtown in eastern Suffolk County.
The Planning Commission's director of planning, Stephen Jones, said the existing vacancy rate was a major reason for the commission's decision to rule against Riverhead Center when the project came before the commission for approval a year ago. (Since the commission's role is advisory, the Town Board can override its decisions with a majority-plus-one vote, which it did.)
"For starters," Mr. Jones said, Riverhead Center's application was for "retail square footage that is twice as big as downtown Riverhead, and to say it wouldn't have an environmental impact is inaccurate." It would constitute "a dramatic expansion of retail in a traffic corridor, Route 58, where a tremendous amount of shopping centers exist now," he added.
Mr. Jones noted that "the fierce fighting for the retail dollar" has taken a new twist in recent years. The struggle is no longer between downtown and shopping centers, he said; it is now shopping center versus shopping center. It follows, he said, that the creation of Riverhead Center will do damage not only to downtown Riverhead but, "because it's so large, it will do damage to all of the existing shopping centers on Route 58."
Calling the environmental impact statement that was submitted with the Riverhead Center application "completely faulty," Mr. Jones said the Planning Commission had seen "no evidence that Riverhead or anybody else was looking at the whole picture."
That, Mr. Villella suggested, is one of the tasks he was elected to tackle.
"We are updating it as we speak," Mr. Villella said of the town's master plan, which was developed in the early 1970's but never officially adopted.
If the supervisor has his way, the new plan will reflect what he believes to be valid on each side of the argument over Riverhead's future, a conflict he feels has escalated well beyond reasonable debate.
"We are not against development or growth," Mr. Villella said of his administration. "We are against the way it was done without any planning."
As for Riverhead Center, "there is opposition," he said, "but there are a lot of people for it." He said that since the shopping mall will probably be built, he is preparing to work with everyone involved.
"People want the movies, they want Home Depot, the bookstore and restaurants," he said, "but when you put it all together in one project, it scared them."
To allay those fears, Mr. Villella offered reassurances that capitulating to Riverhead Center will not inevitably mean abandoning Riverhead's downtown, with its core of surviving businesses that still offer a hometown touch; its riverfront, and the handsome brick buildings on Main Street.
"We have to change the mix completely in the downtown area," he said. In the future, he predicted, "there will not be as much retail as there has been." The planned expansion of Swezey's Department Store, a Main Street mainstay, is a good sign, he said, "but there has to be a combination" of retail and other attractions. He noted that his administration is pushing ahead with a long-stalled plan for a large aquarium, and that it has not abandoned plans to create a downtown arts district to lure artists and galleries to upstairs space on Main Street. He added that he hopes to raise the money needed to complete long-delayed renovations that will transform Riverhead's boarded-up Suffolk Theater, an Art Deco movie house, into a performing arts center.
One path toward achieving Mr. Villella's goals for the theater leads straight to Mr. Gianos, who has offered money for the project. Stung by the attacks on him as an "outsider," Mr. Gianos points out that he has a long history of commercial improvement in Riverhead and is as interested in creating a lively, economically viable downtown as anyone. He said his company deserved credit for bringing numerous improvements to the town, among them an elegant Ramada Inn that had formerly been a run-down motel, and housing for the elderly that the company created from a dilapidated apartment complex. In this spirit, he said, he offered to contribute $1 million to complete the work on the Suffolk Theater.
When he first made the offer, it was rejected by the town, Mr. Gianos said. He looks upon the rebuff as more evidence that he will never crack what he sees as an anti-competitive clique that runs Riverhead.
"Everyone went to high school together," he said. "It's really sad, because the victims here are the people of Riverhead."
That is not an outcome that Riverhead's elected protector and self-designated peace-maker, Vincent Villella, is prepared to accept.
"I'm talking with him," he said.

HEADLINE: Lessons to Be Learned From the Glitter of Broadway;
Duke Students Examine the Business Side of the Arts

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Though it is certainly a theater district institution, one would hardly call Sardi's an institution of higher learning. But on a recent afternoon, 15 Duke University students assembled beneath the show-biz caricatures on the restaurant walls for a class on leadership and vision.
The day before they had gathered at Wynton Marsalis's apartment to observe the trumpeter tutor a protege, and that evening they saw "Il Trovatore" at the Metropolitan Opera and briefly chatted with Sarah Billinghurst, the assistant manager, about business matters and fund-raising operations. 
 Now, in Sardi's main dining room, Prof. Bruce Payne, a lecturer in public policy at Duke, called the class to order to discuss leadership as conveyed in such divergent artistic forms as Verdi's "Trovatore" and Mr. Marsalis's conducting of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.
The students, six men and nine women, are spending a semester abroad in New York, the country's cultural capital, to learn firsthand the place of the performing arts in American life. The program is sponsored by Duke's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy and the Metropolitan Opera. Mr. Payne, who devised the program and is its director, said it is aimed at undergraduates headed for careers in law, medicine, business and government who may be "very well educated but culturally deprived," as he put it.
"The idea is to get nonfine arts majors to think about questions of leadership and policy in the arts," Mr. Payne said. "Who supports the arts, why it matters and why it makes Jesse Helms so angry."
Their scholarly pursuits include attending 15 operas, 20 plays on and off Broadway, half a dozen dance performances, New York Philharmonic rehearsals and performances, talks with actors, producers, directors and singers and visits to nearly every museum in the city.
"I had to sell my parents on the idea," Meredith Groban, a junior from Rockville, Md., said. "They didn't quite understand how living in New York and going to the theater, the opera and the symphony was consistent with my major in labor relations."
Of course, there is also the required reading -- "The Diary of Anne Frank," "The American Canvas" and many others -- and the writing. Students must produce a short paper every other week and a term paper. Not to mention an independent studies project on a topic of their choice with New Yorkers who have been appointed adjunct instructors for the semester.
Upon successful completion of their semester in New York, which costs about $10,000, the equivalent of a semester's tuition at Duke, the students earn four course credits, which counts as a full semester of study. They live at the St. George Hotel in Brooklyn, commuting to Manhattan by subway.
Victoria Engelhorn, a third-year economics and French major who makes her home in London, said of the living arrangements: "Here you live with closed doors, like apartment living, and my next door neighbor is an elderly woman. In the dorms, we usually have our doors open, know everyone and we're all the same age. I like living in a New York landmark, but everyone keeps telling us about the pool at the St. George and we were a little disappointed to find that it's no longer open."
Nearly all the students described it as a chance to explore a city and culture seemingly worlds apart from the ivy-covered campus they left behind in Durham, N.C.
"I find Duke itself very constricting," said Carla Murphy, a junior who was raised in Queens and has family roots in Barbados. "Most of us are 20-year-olds trying to find ourselves, and this is the kind of experience that helps make you a complete person."
But the program has a mission beyond its stated educational purpose: to whet the appetites of tomorrow's patrons, corporate donors, board members and policy makers. In the view of those whose business it is to fill the big houses on Broadway and Lincoln Center as well as regional theaters and repertory workshops, there is a need to develop knowledgeable audiences.
"It's what we used to call connoisseurship," said William Robert Bucker, dean of the School of Fine Arts at the University of Minnesota at Duluth and former director of education for the Metropolitan Opera. "It used to be related to the visual arts and to developing students with the potential to become great collectors or the potential to go to museums and see what was best in the art of past and present.
 
Future Decisions About 'Quality'
"We're trying to develop that same kind of connoisseurship with the performing arts," he added. "We want students to come away and be able to make thoughtful, intelligent decisions about quality, about what is good. Because ultimately, as leaders in their communities, they will be responsible for making decisions that have an impact on those very issues as they relate to arts organizations in their communities."
The curriculum includes two public policy courses, "Leadership and the Arts" and "Policy, Philanthropy and the Arts," both taught by Mr. Payne. Dr. Bucker returns from Duluth once a month to teach a third course, "Music and Drama, Performance and Politics."
The Duke program relies on the kindness of artists and arts institutions like Lincoln Center and the Shubert Organization, both of which provided teaching space, discount tickets and guest lecturers, the support of Duke alumni in the New York area and a bevy of F.O.B.'s -- "friends of Bruce."
Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, an author and the chairwoman of the Historic Landmarks Preservation Center, who taught a course at Duke with Mr. Payne on philanthropy and the arts, invited the students to her Park Avenue apartment for a lecture on landmarks preservation, followed by lunch and a tour of her art collection. The SoHo penthouse loft of Andy King, a caterer and corporate concierge, was the site of a dinner and a discussion on the differences between leadership and management with Richard J. Caples, whose interest in dance led him from a job as a corporate lawyer to the position of executive director of Lar Lubovitch Dance Company.
Molly Ringwald and the cast of "How I Learned to Drive" spoke with students after they attended an evening performance, and Douglas Carter Beane, the author of "As Bees in Honey Drown," gave a lecture on the Drama Dept., the repertory theater Mr. Carter Beane cofounded.
"Gee, I wish I had a class like this when I was a college student," said Mr. Carter Beane, echoing sentiments voiced a few nights earlier by Ms. Ringwald.
Classes are regularly held at Mr. King's loft, the Met's Guild Board Room and Sardi's, which offered its space after Mr. Payne got in touch with Jack Thomas, director of sales development for the Shubert Organization, the restaurant's landlord. Mr. Payne often asks for and receives the keys to friends apartments and private offices on a moment's notice.
"The arts, whether for profit or nonprofit, thrive on mutual aid," Mr. Payne told his students "People in New York's arts community are thrilled to help out because they want bright people to care, to share their enthusiasm."
To help students understand that experience of volunteerism, Mr. Payne had them work as clerks stuffing envelopes, selling T-shirts and working backstage with wardrobe at a fund-raising benefit for the Doug Varone Dance Company.
Mr. Payne acknowledged that one of the "ulterior motives" of the program was to encourage students to broaden not only their horizons but their career paths as well. Which explains the lecture by Mr. Caples, the corporate attorney turned dance company executive.
Indeed, Ms. Billinghurst of the Met says the next generation of art administrators will come from "all sorts of different backgrounds" rather than from the traditional pool of fine arts majors and scions of wealthy families.
"Who knows," she said. "Some of the students in this class could work for a ballet company or theater company."
Tom Sowers, a senior in the R.O.T.C. who is headed for the Corps of Engineers after graduation, still seemed committed to his goal halfway through the semester. But the discussions of relevance and leadership in the arts were not lost on him. Before the semester began, Mr. Sowers had had some difficulty trying to persuade his military science professor of the relevance of his decision to study arts in New York City.
"Bruce shows us how you can see leadership not only in a general's command on a battlefield, but in Wynton Marsalis's approach to jazz," Mr. Sowers said. "As an officer I will be responsible for leading a command, and it's a compelling argument that you can find leadership within a dance company as well as in a 40-troop platoon."

HEADLINE: A Dash Past Rush?

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
Rush Limbaugh, the talk-radio personality whose flair for political bombast helped revitalize AM radio, is no longer the most listened-to person on the airwaves, at least according to one survey.
Talkers magazine says that Mr. Limbaugh has been eclipsed by a pair of polar opposites: Dr. Laura Schlessinger, whose knack for concise put-downs and an unswerving moral compass have helped her tap into a culture impatient for accountability, and Howard Stern, whose locker-room antics help that culture stay in touch with its seamier underbelly. 
 Experts on radio say the ascent of Dr. Schlessinger and Mr. Stern over Mr. Limbaugh reflects a broader shift away from political talk radio as the strong economy and weariness with scandal dull the public's interest in Washington.
And with the Beltway news often resembling celebrity gossip -- another favorite subject of talk radio -- there is less fodder for the left-right debates on which shows like Mr. Limbaugh's have thrived.
"The trend has been to more well-rounded talk programming," said Eric Weiss, a Los Angeles radio agent. "Political talk is clearly not as popular as it was several years ago. A whole slew of right-wing talk shows were launched."
According to the survey by Talkers, a trade-journal of the talk radio circuit, Dr. Schlessinger's show has a weekly national audience of 18 million, followed by Mr. Stern at 17.5 million and Mr. Limbaugh with 17.25 million.
Stephen C. Lehman, president and chief executive of Jacor Communications Inc.'s Premiere Radio Network, which carries Mr. Limbaugh's show, disputes Talkers' findings that Mr. Limbaugh's audience is shrinking and contends that Mr. Stern's audience is closer to seven million. "The big discrepancy is with Stern," he said. "Something's off."
In any case, industry experts say it is clear that political shows are losing some of their luster. Other radio personalities with a political bent, drawn into the medium by Mr. Limbaugh's long success as host of a call-in show, are seeing a decline in listenership, according to Talkers.
"There's been a slowing in the growth of political talk since 1996," said Michael Harrison, publisher of the journal, based in Longmeadow, Mass. That year, Mr. Limbaugh's popularity peaked at 21 million listeners. "Limbaugh's decline is now at a point where there is a trend," Mr. Harrison added.
G. Gordon Liddy, Michael Reagan and Oliver North also saw declines in listenership in the fall survey. Last month CBS radio canceled the show of Mary Matalin, the former Republican campaign official. Previous pink slips went to Mario Cuomo, Gary Hart and Joycelyn Elders, also short-lived talk-show hosts whose political hard knocks proved inadequate training for the demands of keeping a daily show current.
"To go into talk radio in the 90's and think they can succeed by taking someone with marquee value isn't going to cut it," Mr. Harrison said. "Radio is not oratory. It's conversations."
No one knows that better than Mr. Limbaugh. "It isn't his politics; he's a great entertainer," said Walter Sabo, a talk-radio programming consultant. "Rush's audience couldn't have gotten any bigger," Mr. Sabo said. "If he slips a little, everyone else has a long way to go."
Dr. Schlessinger, who has a doctorate in physiology and is a licensed marriage and family counselor, has mastered the art of summing up anecdotes and spewing confrontational opinions with lightning quickness.
She is heard on 450 stations that have a nationwide audience of 18 million. Stations in the Los Angeles area carried her three-hour show for two decades before it was syndicated in 1994 and its popularity took off. In September, Jacor paid $71.5 million for the show. Industry executives estimate it generates about $30 million in advertising revenue.
Last year, as part of a move to establish itself in radio programming and syndication, Jacor paid $50 million for Mr. Limbaugh's show, which is carried on 600 stations. Its revenue is estimated at close to $38 million by industry executives.
Mr. Stern's show is independently controlled, and is unusual in the syndication business for demanding a licensing fee from stations, which then can sell advertising on the show. Under most programming arrangements, a station gives up some commercial time, which is sold to advertisers by the syndicator, in exchange for obtaining the programming.
Dr. Schlessinger's appeal to adult women indicates how the talk format, like music, is beginning to splinter as programmers seek to appeal to different demographic groups, Mr. Sabo said. Mr. Limbaugh is typically tuned in by older men, while Mr. Stern draws younger males. All-talk formats aimed at younger audiences are also moving to FM, such as WTKS in Orlando, Fla., and WRKO in Boston, in part because it is more profitable, airing 18 minutes of commercials an hour compared with 14 minutes on music stations, he said.
If there is unanimity among radio executives over Dr. Schlessinger's ascent, there remains quibbling in some quarters over the rest of the results in the Talkers survey. There is room for dispute because unlike television ratings, radio ratings are not based on a single show but cumulative listening to a station over a week or in a particular time slot.
Counting listeners tuning in to syndicated programming with certainty is difficult because audiences can be counted twice, when syndicated shows are broadcast more than once by a station, or missed entirely if shows are carried in cities too small to be surveyed by traditional ratings services like Arbitron.
Because syndication companies keep their list of affiliates secret, Talkers compiles its findings through focus groups and research with individual stations, Mr. Harrison said.
But he disputed the assertion by Mr. Lehman of Jacor that the survey's figures for Mr. Stern's and Mr. Limbaugh's audiences were incorrect. "Its credibility is based on our reputation. We have more to lose than anybody."
To try to settle the dispute, Arbitron, at Jacor's request, is conducting a more definitive market survey, which is expected to be completed this week.

HEADLINE: Shouting Financial Advice in Crowded Field

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
They might as well be offering thinner thighs in 30 days. Or at least it can sound that way.
"Best Buys in Big Funds." "Best Credit Cards." "New Ways to Save on Taxes." "Invest in Smart Chips." 
 Such are the cover lines on personal finance magazines that currently crowd the newsstand. With their big promises and sheer number, they have begun to resemble the many women's service magazines that have long tried to lure readers with quick-fix claims.
There was a time when Kiplinger's Personal Finance and Money were the only magazines offering people information about how to manage their finances. In just the last six years, though, the field has grown considerably more competitive -- Worth, Smart Money, Individual Investor, Bloomberg Personal, Family Money, Your Money and Mutual Funds Magazine have all joined the competition.
And the new titles keep coming. The number of new magazines that focus on business and finance climbed to 19 in 1997 from 3 in 1992, reaching a high of 22 in 1996, according to the annual guide to new magazines released last month by Oxbridge Communications Inc.
Why has personal finance become such a hot category? How much financial advice can one country take? And are these magazines too eager to promise the moon?
They are proliferating, media experts say, by riding the wave of a strong economy and may well crash and burn -- or at least calm down -- when the market does. But they also say that the magazines are responding to a fundamental shift in society: Baby boomers have reached their 50's and are looking for advice on how to manage their future finances and pay for their children's college educations. And Americans' growing investment in the stock market means they want to know more about how to do it wisely.
Magazine executives also point out that retirement planning has changed drastically; pensions are fast becoming a thing of the past in favor of 401(k) plans, which require that people decide for themselves how to provide for life after work. And people are faced with decisions about their companies' stock or profit-sharing plans.
"There are 77 million baby boomers in a collective midlife crisis where money issues are critical to them," said W. Randall Jones, the founder and chief executive of Capital Publishing, which started Worth magazine six years ago. "Generation X is much more interested in money than baby boomers were at a comparable age -- the universe is expanding dramatically."
As to whether these magazines overpromise, their editors say that their recommendations are based on thorough research and that they emphasize long-term investment over short-term gains but that cover lines demand a hard sell to move magazines off the newsstand.
"We editors in the field have an ambivalence about the kinds of headlines that work best," said Knight A. Kiplinger, the editor in chief and publisher of Kiplinger's, which was founded in 1947. "We don't like list headlines like 'Six Hot Stocks for Tomorrow,' but it is manifestly clear that more emphatic headlines sell better on newsstands, so we all engage in it to some extent."
Indeed, some express concern that people will think they can get rich quick just by reading a magazine. "I worry about recommending individual stocks to people as opposed to exploring how things work," said Marshall Loeb, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review who was the managing editor of both Money and Fortune, published by the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner. "When you look at the panoply of financial magazines out there, there is more overpromising than you would like."
But the trend may continue. Conde Nast Publications, a unit of Advance Publications, last month mailed a financial supplement called Conde Nast Currency to the 9.2 million subscribers of its 16 magazines and is considering future editions. Capital Publishing is starting a new women's finance magazine next year with the working title of Equity. And Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., said he planned to acquire new business titles.
In addition, traditional business magazines like Fortune, Forbes and Business Week have expanded their coverage of personal finance, as have most national newspapers. General interest women's magazines like Glamour have begun to offer more financial columns, as have men's magazines like Esquire. Consumer Reports devoted its cover story last month to mutual funds.
And all of these print ventures are competing with a growing number of offerings on the Internet, not to mention television and radio. Indeed, the circulation of many personal finance magazines declined during the second half of last year.
The proliferation of personal finance magazines has also helped change the way people are thinking about service journalism -- long considered a standard element of women's magazines: The 10 Latest Lipstick Shades for Spring, Lose Weight on Low-fat Cheesecake.
"For a while the assumption was that a more literate audience wouldn't read service," said Steven Swartz, the editor in chief and president of Smart Money, which was started by Dow Jones & Company and the Hearst Corporation six years ago. "We said, 'Let's do a personal finance magazine for people used to reading well-written and well-reported stuff and see if we can't hold their interest.' "
Editors say the increasing sophistication of service journalism has made it easier for them to attract writing talent to the category. "Personal finance, when we started, was a backwater of journalism," said the writer James B. Stewart, Smart Money's editor at large and a Pulitzer Prize winner and former editor at The Wall Street Journal. "To get good journalists to write on the subject was difficult."
When the economy falters -- as all say it inevitably must -- where will this leave the magazines? Editors are counting on their magazines to become even more essential as guides to help mitigate the damage.
But whether or not readers will stick with the magazines in an economic downturn, advertisers are bound to go south, media executives say. They did after the 1987 stock crash. Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance Magazine folded in 1989 after six years; Kiplinger's acquired its circulation list.
The most recent figures show Money leading the pack with a paid circulation of just over 2 million, followed by Kiplinger's at 1.1 million; Smart Money at 688,000, and Worth at 551,000.
No one really knows whether these magazines are making a profit or what they charge for their ad pages, but Kiplinger had its best year ever in ad page gains in 1997, with about a 12 percent increase, to 934 pages, and Money and Smart Money each saw ad pages increase about 5 percent, to 1,362 and 1,141, respectively.
"If this is the pain of competition, beat me harder," Mr. Kiplinger said. Advertisers say they are excited about the category because the demographics are so good; personal finance magazines have readers advertisers want. As a result, the magazines have seen an influx in ads from mutual funds and financial services and from advertisers that are new to the category, like fashion designers and travel services.
Magazine executives point out that profitability has become less pressing, given that many of the newer titles are owned by big companies that can afford to carry them, like Dow Jones and Bloomberg.
A shakeout, however, may prove inevitable, media experts say. And with an increasing number of people seeking advice or making trades on line, some say the magazines ultimately cannot hope to compete with the immediacy of the Internet.
"It's impossible for magazines like Worth, Money, Smart Money to deliver a serious financial product at a time when other people can deliver information instantaneously," said James Cramer, the trader who has written for most personal finance magazines, helped start Smart Money and recently started thestreet.com, a financial Web site.
"Every issue that is being worked on right now that was closed before this week is just completely out of date, given that this week Citicorp and Travelers merged," Mr. Cramer added.
Magazine editors counter that advice on the Web often comes from companies selling their services. People "aren't stopping to think, 'Yes, the information I'm getting might be untainted but one of these days there will be an egregious conflict of interest,' " Mr. Stewart said. "That's where the battleground in financial journalism is going -- between traditional publishers and the financial services industry for the minds and dollars of the consumer."

HEADLINE: 3 More States Stopped Taxing Poorest Families in '97, Study Says

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Three states last year stopped taxing the incomes of families living below the official poverty line, but New Jersey and three other states that significantly cut taxes for the middle class and the rich in recent years continue to tax the incomes of poor families, a new analysis of state tax laws shows.
The survey was conducted by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research organization in Washington that studies how taxes and Government spending affect the poor. Its findings come as governments are trying to move millions of people off the welfare roles and onto payrolls. Yet tax burdens have discouraged many poor people from seeking work because in some cases the marginal rate of taxes can exceed 100 percent of the higher incomes from jobs, which means that going to work can initially result in a lower standard of living. 
 Last year 21 states taxed the incomes of families of four making less than $16,405, the Federal poverty line, while 20 states and the District of Columbia set the threshold at $16,500 or higher. Nine states do not tax any income.
The three states that raised the threshold so that the poor would not be taxed were Maine, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.
Also, a single parent with two children who made less than the official poverty level of $12,804 for a family of three paid income taxes in 20 states last year, but was exempt in 21 states and the District of Columbia.
Nicholas Johnson, who directed the study, praised the three states that stopped taxing the poor, but said, "What is surprising is that more states have not taken advantage of a strong economy and higher-than-expected revenues to provide more tax relief to the working poor."
In New Jersey a family of four making $150,000 received more than $1,300 in state income tax relief last year under a series of cuts that began when Gov. Christine Todd Whitman took office, while a family of four at the poverty line saved $60, reducing their tax bill to $160, according to the research organization.
In Michigan, tax cuts in 1994 and 1995 mean that a family making $200,000 saves $450 while a family of four at the poverty line saves $50, paying $282. Ohio has also cut taxes for upper-income residents, while taxing families of four who make as little as $12,000.
Last year Oregon gave out one-time tax rebates that were worth an average of $2,004 to households of four making over $100,000 and $79 to families making between $10,000 and $20,000, the study said. A family at the poverty line paid about $240 in income tax before the rebate, said Chuck Sheketoff, director of the Oregon Center for Public Policy in Silverton, Ore., an affiliate of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
Six states tax the incomes of very poor families, those making less than half of the Federal poverty level. New Jersey starts imposing income taxes on families of three or four at $7,500.
Illinois taxes families of four starting at $4,000, while the thresholds are $4,600 in Alabama, $5,000 in Kentucky, $6,100 in Hawaii and $8,200 in Virginia.
In 1994, New Jersey raised the threshold for liability to $7,500, from $5,000, and thus reduced taxes on the poor. In recent years, thresholds were also raised in Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Oregon and Utah. In Oregon, Mr. Sheketoff said, many poor people leaving the welfare rolls for jobs were not aware of the state tax law changes and did not take advantage of them.
New York does not tax families of four until their income reaches $22,300. A single parent with two children starts paying New York income taxes at $21,200.
David Liebschutz, associate director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany, a research arm of the State University of New York, said that "in the rush to relieve tax burdens, many states -- and New Jersey is a pretty good example -- focused on reducing the highest marginal rates" and did little or nothing to help the poor.
"Low- and moderate-income people are not at the top rate so those cuts do not benefit them at all," Mr. Liebschutz said. "Second, many states did not adjust standard deductions and exemptions, which is the mechanism that wipes out income tax burdens for many of the working poor at the Federal level."

HEADLINE: Essay;
The Syntax of Sin Tax

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Even more addictive than nicotine is money. The anti-smoking lobby has found a way to hook the Federal Government on tobacco money.
If its latest scheme to snatch a half-trillion dollars in new cigarette taxes becomes law, Uncle Sam -- raking in a huge national sales tax -- will have a vested interest in the continuation of smoking. 
 Look ahead. One day there will be a recession and the budget will plunge into deficit. Popular handouts like free milk for children in prison will be dependent on the tax revenue from tobacco sales, just as education will depend on tax receipts from gambling casinos.
Result: further political dependency on "sin taxes," the government's cut of profit on booze, crapshooting and smoking. What politician is now likely to cut out programs supported by tobacco billions, or raise taxes the painful way to balance a budget? No; if you depend on sin, you are inclined to protect it.
A sin tax is a tax that falls heaviest on the poor. The cause is not that the poor do more wrong than the rich, but that there are many more poor to do wrong. Under the McCain-Clinton plan, a cigar-puffing plutocrat will pay a pittance more for the pleasure of smoking while the worker earning $20,000 a year will have to pay the Government nearly one tenth of his total wages.
But it's for his own good, think liberals who have just delightedly discovered the disincentive of taxation. Because smoking is filthy and unhealthy, we are helping the poor person who dares to indulge his lust to smoke by making him pay a whopping fine. He'll stop smoking or go broke.
The tobacco-bashers don't even whisper that because 50 million bumper stickers would soon appear saying "I smoke and I vote." Instead, the campaign against everybody smoking is pegged on saving the children.
Using that unassailable aim, tax-and-spend politicians would make adult smokers, who do well over 90 percent of the smoking, pay up to two bucks a pack more for their habit -- supposedly to discourage teen smokers by making the purchase too costly for those on a parental allowance.
Even if the protect-the-kids pitch were true and not just a political adman's deft mode of persuasion, it would mean that rich kids could smoke and poor kids could not.
Do we really want officialdom to introduce the horrors of economic inequity to 13-year-olds? If the Katzenjammer kids see rich Rollo taking a deep drag on a pleasure only he can afford, are they not given an incentive to steal it -- thereby creating a lifelong habit of crime? Or to buy a pack around the corner from an entrepreneur who buys tobacco in bulk and rolls it into tax-evasive, affordable coffin nails?
Not only would the smokiller's currently popular plan place a huge tax on the poor and make the Government dependent on the prolongation of the tobacco habit, it would make smoking an even greater symbol of youthful rebellion.
That's why the current cockiness among legislators in Washington -- riding a popular wave of revulsion at the past lies of tobacco executives -- is so wrongheaded. The victors won't settle for the sort of medium self-immolation negotiated out of the tobacco industry by state attorneys general; they want financial punishment to satisfy the most ardent smoker-haters and ease the way for Washington's big spenders.
Small wonder that the industry, showing prudent concern for its customers, stockholders and employees, refuses to trade away constitutional rights to advertise a dangerous product that lawmakers do not have the courage to outlaw.
The tax-'em-to-death notion is a huge hoax designed to raise regressive sales taxes painlessly. Such taxing is no good for you just as smoking is no good for you.
The difference is that taxation stunts economic growth but smoking kills. I quit smoking 30 years ago because I have the yen to survive, but I have no right to live off those foolish enough to smoke. How, then, to help others kick the habit without making Government a smoking-tax addict?
Control nicotine as the drug it is. Take the big marketing concessions squeezed out of the chastened industry before the deal-breakers waded in. And set an example for your own kids.

HEADLINE: ABUSES ARE CITED IN TRADE OF MONEY FOR U.S. RESIDENCE

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
A Federal program that grants wealthy foreign investors permanent residency in the United States is being manipulated, the Immigration and Naturalization Service says, with investors' money being pooled so that most of them obtain residency visas without making the required investment.
The program, established by Congress in 1990, envisioned wealthy foreigners investing directly in American businesses. But in recent years, a cottage industry of consultants has sprung up to pool money in creative ways from the foreigners, who under the program must invest at least $500,000 in an American business that creates or saves jobs. In return, the foreigners receive a permanent residency visa, or green card, the coveted document that is the first step toward American citizenship. 
 A six-month Government review concluded last month that many of the consulting firms that link the immigrants to business opportunities in the United States had improperly exploited loopholes to guarantee rates of return and limit investor risk. Under some consultants' plans, for example, foreigners would only have to pay about one-third of the required $500,000 investment, with a promissory note for the rest that could eventually be forgiven by the consulting firm or the American business.
"These plans do not meet either the spirit or the letter of the law established by Congress," said Russell Bergeron, a spokesman for the immigration service.
But when immigration officials moved this year to revoke more than 5,000 visas granted under the program, mostly to immigrants from Taiwan, China, South Korea and Hong Kong, a number of influential lawmakers from both parties, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, protested that the Government was changing the rules in midstream.
The immigration service, the lawmakers said, knew all along what the investors were doing and never raised an eyebrow when the Government approved the visa petitions. The lawmakers criticized a freeze the agency has imposed on most new visas until it sorts out what kinds of investments are allowed. They contend that the freeze has stymied growth in economically depressed parts of the country that the program was intended to help invigorate.
"For months, American jobs, created by the investor visa program, have been ensnared in bureaucratic red tape," said Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who heads the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration. "Job opportunities have been stifled by a heavy-handed Government agency."
In response to the criticism, the immigration service backtracked a bit late last month, allowing 1,500 investors and their families, who had received conditional green cards and completed a two-year waiting period, to stay in the United States.
But hundreds of other applicants in the pipeline will have to refile their visa petitions under new guidelines being developed. Critics say the immigration service did not publicize this decision, leaving immigrants and their lawyers in limbo.
"The immigration service is wreaking havoc on everyone's lives, and it makes zero sense to me," said Denyse Sabagh, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, who now represents one of the consulting firms.
The issue has rekindled a fierce debate over the propriety of using permanent residency visas to attract foreign capital and create, or at least save, American jobs.
The uproar also underscores deficiencies in the immigration service. Its loosely worded regulations are an easy target for consulting firms looking for loopholes. And its examiners, who are trained to ferret out most routine immigration fraud, are ill-equipped to address increasingly complicated financial plans.
"The I.N.S., unlike the I.R.S., isn't typically an agency that has to police against highly sophisticated investment devices," said David A. Martin, the former general counsel of the immigration service whose blistering 36-page memorandum last December became the centerpiece of the Government's review of the program.
For the immigration service, the visa program is the latest in a string of contentious issues to catch the attention of the Republican-led Congress, which over the past year has criticized the agency for wrongly naturalizing tens of thousands of immigrants and which has even suggested abolishing the service.
The immigrant investor program, which offers 10,000 visas a year, has never caught on the way its proponents had hoped. Until two years ago, the immigration service never issued more than 600 visas a year to investors and members of their immediate families.
Congress created the program to compete with other countries, including Canada and Australia, that offered similar visas to attract foreign capital and create jobs. But the American model required larger investments, the hiring of at least 10 employees who were not related to the investor, and an audit two years after the visa was issued to insure the investment and employees were still in place.
In the past two years, immigration officials say consulting firms have devised savvier business plans for immigrants to use and stepped up their marketing, particularly in Asian and Middle Eastern publications. The number of visas issued to investors jumped to 1,110 in fiscal year 1997 from 295 visas in fiscal year 1996.
At the same time, American consular officials in Tokyo, Taipei, Guangzhou, Seoul and Hong Kong raised questions about dozens of visa petitions. Consuls found that many plans called for a down payment, typically $150,000 on a $500,000 investment, and arranged a promissory note for the rest. After two years, the investor would get a green card and then, the plans suggested, the remaining $350,000 would be forgiven.
Last month, the California Department of Corporations ordered a Virginia-based firm, Interbank Immigration Services, to stop offering investment programs to wealthy immigrants.
The company, California officials said, promised qualified immigrants a green card within eight weeks if they bought a stake in a Delaware limited partnership. The stakes were in turn sold to a Bahamian enterprise for an annuity that matured in five years. But state officials said investors had no guarantee that they would realize the promised benefits.
Reports like this prompted the immigration service to conduct its review. "Little by little, the program may have gotten out of control," said a State Department official familiar with the visa program.
But many consulting firms say that they have followed the rules and that they are being penalized for the abuses of a few or by lax oversight by immigration officials.
One such firm, American Export Partners of Charleston, S.C., has pooled more than $8 million in cash and promissory notes from investors, mostly from Asia, and, with the Government's blessing, created a commercial financing company to make loans to American exporters. Thirty-eight of the firm's investors have received green cards, said Timothy D. Scrantom, a managing director.
One loan was a $750,000 line of credit to Pillow Perfect, a bedding manufacturer in Woodstock, Ga. "They're providing financing for my company to grow and hire more people," said Paul Ratner, president of Pillow Perfect, whose work force has increased to 50 employees from 20 employees in the past two years.
Mr. Ratner said that he had consulted several local banks but that American Export was "more competitive and easier to deal with."
Other middlemen are changing their marketing practices to address the Government's complaints. One of the largest consulting firms, AIS of Greenbelt, Md., said it sent a revised business plan to the immigration service in February.
"Things are continuing to evolve," said William P. Cook, a lawyer for AIS who was the immigration service's general counsel when the visa program was created.
The immigration service insists that it still supports the program -- but with several changes -- and plans to ask the Commerce Department and Small Business Administration for technical help in reviewing future immigrant-investor financial packages.
But immigration lawyers and their clients say the program will stay stuck in neutral until the immigration service drafts a clear set of rules for the industry and immigrants to follow. "What we need now is for the I.N.S. not to issue more general counsel memos, but regulations," Mr. Cook said.

HEADLINE: U.S. BUSINESS ROLE IN POLICY ON CHINA IS UNDER QUESTION

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
In the 1992 election, many of America's aerospace manufacturers backed Bill Clinton. But when President Clinton took office, he immediately disappointed some of them on a key issue, barring them from launching their most lucrative satellites on China's low-cost rockets.
The aerospace companies' counterattack was vehement -- and effective. After a lobbying campaign that included appeals to the President by C. Michael Armstrong, then the chief executive of Hughes Electronics, Mr. Clinton gradually came to take the industry's side. 
 But there was an important caveat: The companies had to keep a tight rein on sophisticated technology sought by the Chinese military.
So in May 1997 the Administration was jolted by a classified Pentagon report concluding that scientists from Hughes and Loral Space and Communications had turned over expertise that significantly improved the reliability of China's nuclear missiles, officials said.
The report, whose existence has been secret, prompted a criminal investigation of the companies, which officials said was undermined this year when Mr. Clinton approved Loral's export to China of the same information about guidance systems. Loral's chairman was the largest personal donor to the Democratic Party last year.
An examination of the Administration's handling of the case, based on interviews with Administration officials and industry executives, illustrates the competing forces that buffet Mr. Clinton on China policy. In this instance, the President's desire to limit the spread of missile technology was balanced against the commercial interests of powerful American businesses, many of which were White House allies and substantial supporters of the Democratic Party.
"From the Chinese point of view, this was the key case study on how the Administration would operate on contentious issues," an Administration expert on China said. The message, the official added, was that Administration policy on issues like the spread of weapons and human rights abuses "could be reversed by corporations."
The White House denied any political interference in the issue.
"I am certainly not aware that our policy has been influenced by domestic political considerations," said Gary Samore, the senior director for nonproliferation and export controls at the National Security Council. "From where I sit, this has been handled as a national security issue: seeking to use China's interest in civilian space cooperation as leverage to obtain nonproliferation goals."
The Administration's China policy has come under intense scrutiny in the last year. Congressional investigators have been examining whether China sought to influence policy through illegal campaign contributions to Democratic candidates in 1996. That connection, first suggested in intelligence reports and echoed by Senator Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who led hearings on campaign finance, was never proved.
The handling of the satellite case raises questions about the influence of American contributors on China policy, according to officials.
 
2 Companies Tilt Toward Democrats
Since 1991, the aerospace industry has divided its political contributions equally between Democrats and Republicans. In the same period, however, Loral and Hughes tilted toward the Democratic Party, giving $2.5 million to Democratic candidates and causes and $1 million to the Republicans.
Administration officials say the contributions played no role in the decisions to permit China to launch American satellites.
"The Government has to balance risks: the risk in not letting American companies get their satellites launched by the Chinese, which would reduce our high-tech advantages, and the inherent risks of technology transfer," said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
"That's why we impose such strict safeguards, and we are determined to investigate and use our laws to prevent that possibility," Mr. Rubin said.
 
Waivers Required After Tiananmen
The criminal investigation of Hughes and Loral has its roots in 1989, when sanctions were imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square, requiring a Presidential waiver for satellite launchings. Eleven such waivers have been granted by President Clinton and his predecessor, George Bush.
But in late 1992, American intelligence discovered that Chinese companies had sold missile technology to Pakistan, raising tensions on the subcontinent.
In the first months of Mr. Clinton's Presidency, Democrats and Republicans in Congress pressed the Administration to take action. Mr. Clinton responded with sanctions that barred American companies from sending military goods to any of the Chinese concerns involved in the Pakistan deal.
The move had the effect of halting several pending and future American satellite deals because the Chinese rocket-launching company was one of those under sanctions.
Mr. Armstrong of Hughes, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, wasted no time in getting the President's attention. He wrote two blunt letters in September and October 1993 that reminded Mr. Clinton of his support for several Presidential policy initiatives like the North American Free Trade Agreement, officials said.
He bemoaned his company's loss of business to foreign competitors and requested Mr. Clinton's personal involvement. Hughes's biggest loss, the company says, was the opportunity for a joint satellite manufacturing plant in China, which the Chinese awarded to a European competitor.
 
Clinton Confronts Department Tussle
A key issue was whether Hughes satellites were civilian or military, a murky question in the export control laws. If the satellites were labeled commercial, the sanctions invoked over the Pakistan deal did not apply. Mr. Armstrong told Mr. Clinton, officials said, that Hughes satellites should not be considered military because their technology did not have military applications.
Soon after the letters, Mr. Clinton assured Mr. Armstrong in an open meeting that he was trying to resolve the tussle between the State Department, which licensed military exports and wanted to keep authority over satellites, and the Commerce Department, which licensed all other exports and was on the side of the satellite industry.
"I'm trying to get on top of this to decide what to do," Mr. Clinton told Mr. Armstrong.
At about the same time, the Administration gave signals that it was moving toward the industry's position. After one signal, Mr. Armstrong sent a letter to a senior White House official relaying a positive reaction from Chinese officials, White House officials said.
In early January 1994, the President sent another positive signal -- what Hughes officials then called a "a good first step." Three satellites were labeled as civilian, including one slightly modified Hughes satellite, which allowed their launchings to proceed.
Mr. Clinton's decision helped the industry. But the satellite makers wanted a broader decision that made the Commerce Department the primary licensing authority for virtually all satellites. The Commerce Department weighs the economic consequences when it considers an export license. The State Department looks at security concerns.
In 1994, Loral's chairman and chief executive, Bernard L. Schwartz, went to China with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. Mr. Brown helped Loral close a mobile telephone satellite network deal in Beijing.
A few weeks later, the President's top political aide, Harold Ickes, wrote a memo to Mr. Clinton in which he said Mr. Schwartz "is prepared to do anything he can for the Administration."
In December 1994, the President selected Mr. Armstrong to head his Export Council.
And the sanctions stemming from the Pakistan sale were lifted in late 1994 as China promised to curb missile sales to other countries.
Still, the satellite industry had not achieved a major objective. So in 1995, Mr. Armstrong sent another letter to Mr. Clinton, signed by Mr. Schwartz, arguing that the Commerce Department should become the primary licensing authority for satellite exports, an industry executive said. (Mr. Armstrong, who recently became the chief executive of AT&T, declined through a spokeswoman to comment.)
The debate not only affected national security but also had enormous commercial implications. The businesses that rely on satellites are highly competitive, and European companies were more than willing to take advantage of China's low-cost services. Without the Chinese, American companies faced long waits to get their satellites sent into orbit because of a shortage of rockets. Satellite technology is crucial to an increasing number of businesses, from cellular telephone networks to global broadcast conglomerates.
 
Chinese Rocket For Loral Crashes
Finally in March 1996, Mr. Clinton shifted major licensing responsibilities for almost all satellites to the Commerce Department. The State Department retained control over a few highly sophisticated satellites as well as any sensitive support activities, or technical assistance, in connection with civilian satellites.
The industry and the Chinese applauded the action. But the events that followed a failed launching in China immediately raised questions about whether the new policy sent a wrong signal.
On Feb. 15, 1996, a Chinese rocket carrying a $200 million Loral satellite crashed 22 seconds after liftoff at the Xichang Satellite Launching Center in in southern China.
Chinese officials needed to figure out what went wrong. By April an outside review commission, headed by Loral, was assembled to help the Chinese study the accident. It included two scientists from Hughes.
On May 10, the commission completed a preliminary report, based on over "200 pages of data, analysis evaluation and reports," documents show. It found that the cause of the accident was an electrical flaw in the electronic flight control system.
But the report, which was promptly shared with the Chinese, discussed other sensitive aspects of the rocket's guidance and control systems, which is an area of weakness in China's missile programs, according to Government and industry officials.
The State Department learned about the report and made contact with Loral.
Loral, in what officials said was a cooperative effort, provided the review commission's report and a long letter explaining what happened. Loral told other commission members, including the two Hughes scientists, to retrieve all copies of the report because of the serious security concerns of the Government, officials said.
But the two Hughes employees believed that there was no legal obligation to comply with the request, officials also said. In late May, Hughes received a letter from the State Department charging that the transfer of information was a violation of the arms export control laws, according to officials. Loral received no such letter.
One year later, the Pentagon completed its damage assessment of the incident. It concluded, officials said, that "United States national security has been harmed."
The Pentagon report prompted a criminal investigation into Loral and Hughes by the Justice Department and the Customs Service. The companies say their employees have acted properly, but they decline to discuss the matter.
One key issue is whether the data turned over to the Chinese required a State Department license and, if so, whether company officials were aware of that fact. The criminal inquiry has found evidence that several days before the review committee had its first meeting with Chinese officials, Loral executives were told by their security advisers that any sharing of information required a State Department license, according to Administration officials. Loral never sought a license, but it may have sounded out the State Department.
An industry official said Loral had immediately told the State Department about the review commission meeting with the Chinese but had received no reply.
 
More High-Tech Data Exported Recently
Whatever the evidence, criminal charges may never be brought because Mr. Clinton approved the export to China by Loral of similar satellite guidance information two months ago. He acted despite the strong opposition of the Justice Department, whose officials argued that the approval would seriously undercut any criminal case.
The required notice to Congress by the President of his action was sent during a recess.
Administration officials say the decision was politically sensitive but correct because no wrongdoing had been proven and Loral had subsequently acted responsibly.
Since the inquiry began, Beijing and Washington have been exploring even more space cooperation.
Last fall President Jiang Zemin visited the United States and stopped at a Hughes site to talk about satellites. In advance of Mr. Clinton's trip to China in June, the Administration is seeking a broader agreement with Beijing on space cooperation.
But the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York, says the Administration should provide a "thorough review" of the Hughes-Loral case to Congress before it goes ahead with a plan to expedite approvals for American satellite launchings by China.

HEADLINE: Many Participants in Workfare Take the Place of City Workers

SERIES: DOES WORKFARE WORK? -- Second of four articles.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In the dimly lighted basement of 125 Worth Street, three blocks north of City Hall, Maurice Simmons, a broad-shouldered 21-year-old who attends accounting school at night, spends his days hauling sacks of garbage and unloading trucks carrying office supplies.
On the seventh floor of the building, which houses the New York City Health Department, Cecilia Mathis mops, sweeps, dusts and cleans bathrooms. 
 And in an office on the second floor, Evelyn Price, a stern but understanding supervisor, coordinates the schedules of dozens of workers, processes time cards and keeps tabs on no-shows.
Notwithstanding the differences in their tasks, these three workers have one big thing in common: workfare. They are required to do their jobs to obtain their welfare checks, and they are doing work once performed by civil servants.
By filling a spectrum of jobs -- from feeding hospital patients to painting park benches to translating at welfare centers -- workfare participants have quietly become an important, but unofficial, part of New York City's municipal work force.
These unheralded workers do much of the grunt work that makes city government run. Workfare participants and welfare experts say many New Yorkers fail to understand a significant fact about the program: the 34,100 people in the city's Work Experience Program constitute a low-cost labor force that does a substantial amount of the work that had been done by municipal employees before Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani reduced the city payroll by about 20,000 employees, or about 10 percent.
Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly declared that his program, by far the nation's largest, was not meant to replace regular workers and has in no way done so.
But interviews with more than 50 workfare workers and visits to more than two dozen work sites make it clear that many participants have taken the place of city workers. Not only are many doing much of the work once performed by departed city employees, but in many instances, they are doing the same work as current ones. Some union leaders contend that the workfare program violates a state law barring public employers from replacing regular workers with workfare participants. Two unions have sued the city on this issue.
"We're doing the same jobs as regular workers, but we're not getting paid for it," said Ms. Mathis, the Health Department cleaner, who works 24 hours a week and receives not wages but a $124 welfare check every two weeks and Medicaid coverage.
A decade ago, 20 salaried city employees did the Health Department's maintenance work, but as a result of attrition and buyouts, their number shrank to 3 by 1995. Now the building uses 50 part-time workfare participants.
The same story holds true for maintenance workers in other municipal buildings downtown, including the Criminal Courts building, Family Court, the Surrogate Court and the headquarters of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
In many municipal agencies, the city has shrunk its regular work force and increased the number of workfare participants. The Sanitation Department's work force slid from 8,296 in 1990 under Mayor David N. Dinkins to 7,528 in early 1994, when Mr. Giuliani took office, then down 16 percent more last year, to 6,327. Today, the department employs more than 5,000 workfare laborers, who wear bright orange vests, sweeping streets and doing other tasks around the city.
Probably the best example can be found in the Parks Department, where, because of a mixture of layoffs and attrition, the nonadministrative work force fell to 1,925 in early 1994, from 2,786 in 1990. Under Mr. Giuliani, park employment has dropped 40 percent more, to 1,156. The void is filled by more than 6,000 workfare participants, who rake leaves, pick up trash and do other tasks.
But if situations like these raise the ire of many union leaders, Mr. Giuliani's efforts to expand workfare have been greatly helped by the acquiescence of the labor leader with the most potential to create a storm. That official, Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37, the umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal workers, is a close Giuliani ally and has often said he can stomach the program as long as the city does not lay off any civil servants.
There are significant political dividends for Mr. Giuliani in this new work force. During past administrations, mayors often reduced the municipal labor force in times of fiscal trouble, only to anger the public, which complained about dirtier streets and deteriorating services. In fatter times, mayors would expand the work force again.
Mr. Giuliani, too, cut the city's payroll to hold down spending, but he was able to use workfare to pick up the slack. And now, with the economy strong and the city's coffers full, he can maintain services while holding the line on labor costs.
For many New Yorkers, though, there is a downside to the Mayor's policy: expanding workfare while shrinking the municipal work force means fewer opportunities for the many New Yorkers who traditionally viewed civil service jobs as a springboard to the middle class.
While a small number of participants -- about 1,000 -- have ended up in city jobs, workfare laborers often complain that the program is not a path to civil service. As Winona Cruz, who does clerical work at the city's housing agency, said, "It's good working here, but they don't want to hire us."
 
The Scope
The Range of Jobs Is Large and Growing
The range of workfare jobs -- and displacement -- is vast. Welfare recipients are repairing the Coney Island boardwalk, while at a public housing project on the Lower East Side, workfare participants polish floors, wash windows and remove graffiti.
At a welfare center in Brooklyn, not only do workfare participants interview recipients to see if they have filled out forms correctly, but they serve as translators, messengers, receptionists and filing clerks. And at Bellevue Hospital Center, workfare laborers like Eva Simon serve lunch to staff members, move patients between floors and occasionally transfer bodies to the morgue.
Before going on welfare, Ms. Simon worked for 14 years as a nurse's aide at Harlem Hospital Center but quit two years ago when her daughter was dying of sickle-cell anemia. Workfare has pushed her back into the job market, and her hope is that by working in two departments at the hospital, she will be offered a permanent job.
Whether the new state welfare law allows workfare participants to do jobs like Ms. Simon's is the subject of growing debate.
The law, enacted last summer, prohibits communities from using workfare participants to perform "a substantial portion of the work" normally "performed by regular employees." It also bars assigning workfare participants to positions created when a public employer dismissed workers or "otherwise reduced its work force."
Mr. Giuliani and his aides have refused to be interviewed for this series. But in responding to the unions' lawsuit, they have vigorously denied that the program violates state law. The workfare participants, they say, are in different job categories from city workers and do not perform much of the work ordinarily done by current city employees.
Over the last couple of years, the Mayor has also addressed the issue in an effort to reassure municipal workers. The jobs performed by workfare employees, he argues, either were never done by city workers or had not been done for several years.
"We fill positions that haven't been filled in some time by people who were working for city government," Mr. Giuliani said in September 1996 in attacking a Metropolitan Transportation Authority plan to replace transit employees with workfare participants. "We don't take jobs away from people. We try to use the workfare program to expand jobs."
The Mayor and his aides say workfare participants should be viewed as a pool of low-cost laborers available to perform services that might otherwise not get done. New Yorkers can thank workfare, they say, for making parks, streets and municipal buildings cleaner.
Many union officials give Mr. Giuliani credit for not laying off anyone to make way for workfare laborers -- such layoffs are not allowed under Federal law. Even so, the painters' and carpenters' unions suing the city charge that workfare has taken jobs from regular city workers.
"They're absolutely doing our work," said Stephen Melish Jr., president of the Civil Service Painters Union. "I don't see why a person on welfare ought to perform a job for the equivalent of $3 an hour when the prevailing wage is $20 an hour."
From the painters' perspective, the overriding reason behind workfare is to slash labor costs.
Workfare participants typically receive $5,000 to $12,000 a year in benefits, depending on their rent and the number of children they have. In contrast, a civil service janitor or clerk earns about $20,000 a year, and a civil service painter, $40,000.
While it is probably impossible to estimate how much money the city might be saving through workfare, the labor leaders say the extent of displacement is illustrated by the staff cuts in some agencies and the way workfare participants have picked up the slack. According to union officials, the number of salaried carpenters in the Parks Department has dropped from 54 in 1990 to 22 today, while the number of civil service painters has fallen from 30 to 5. In the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which maintains municipal buildings, the number of carpenters has fallen from 15 to 4.
In the breach, the union leaders complain, people on workfare have been performing a variety of carpentry and painting tasks: erecting bleachers, repairing benches, putting Sheetrock on walls and painting park buildings and benches around the city, as well as the swimming pool at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx.
The unions' position has found support from several quarters.
In a recent report, the labor committee of the City Bar Association found that in certain agencies, workfare participants performed a variety of jobs once done by civil servants. Last May, in a lawsuit in which some workfare workers sought to be paid the prevailing wage for their jobs, Justice Jane S. Solomon of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected the Giuliani administration's contention that workfare participants were not doing the same work as many city employees. She said it was "absurd" to suggest that workfare participants who, in the words of the city's lawyers, were doing "simple" clerical filing, were not performing exactly the same work as full-time workers doing "complex" filing. While her ruling on the pay issue was overturned on appeal over legal issues, her factual findings stand.
For his part, Mr. Hill, the chief of District Council 37, has lent his outspoken support to the Mayor's contention that workfare has not displaced municipal workers.
"No W.E.P. worker has replaced a city worker who's working," Mr. Hill said.
While he has grumbled recently that workfare has deprived some union members of highly prized overtime work, Mr. Hill has some kind words for workfare, noting that the Parks Department has promoted many District Council 37 members to supervise the sea of workfare participants.
But Jim Williams, a lawyer with the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit legal center that represents the poor, took a different view. "The assertion that W.E.P. workers are not doing the work of city employees is a complete fiction," he said. "It's not true."
Some union officials assert that the combination of a smaller civil service and a larger workfare force will weaken municipal unions by reducing their ranks. They fear that the city will undercut labor's bargaining leverage by threatening to replace city workers with workfare participants.
"It has to weaken unions," said Arthur Cheliotes, president of Communications Workers Local 1180, which represents 7,500 city workers. "It has to weaken entry-level workers. There aren't enough jobs at the lower rung, so it has to drive the poor into deeper poverty by putting them at each other's throats, competing for jobs."
 
The Workers
Not Always Separate, But Always Unequal
The workfare program has had many unintended, even surprising, consequences. Many low-level city employees have found themselves promoted to supervise workfare participants. Occasionally, some workfare participants are supervisors themselves. And in many cases, participants are placed in the innards of the welfare bureaucracy, helping move its huge gears forward.
For 13 years, Edwin Hargrave has worked as a janitor at Health Department headquarters. When he began, there were 20 full-time janitors. Now Mr. Hargrave, who earns $20,000 a year, is one of three.
"The others took the buyout, they retired, and now these people are doing the work," Mr. Hargrave said, gesturing to several workfare participants having lunch alongside him in a basement locker room.
Together, they unload boxes of toilet paper and copying paper from trucks, and they carry large plastic sacks of garbage to the street. They also run up and down stairs to change light bulbs and carry supplies.
Perspiring from all the lifting, Mr. Hargrave said, "We could use some more male W.E.P.'s."
He means more workfare participants like Maurice Simmons, who is attending night school in the hope of becoming an accountant next year. To support himself in the meantime, he has turned to welfare. For a year, he has been assigned to janitorial tasks, working from 8 A.M. to 3 P.M. three days one week and four days the next.
"I like it, but I'm not really getting paid for it," Mr. Simmons said. "It would be great to earn as much as the regular janitors. We're being exploited. There's no question." Every two weeks he receives a $100 welfare check and $122 in food stamps, but in no way does he view this as regular pay.
Among workfare participants there are two common refrains: if only they earned as much as the regular workers, and if only the city would hire them as permanent workers.
That is certainly the dream of Evelyn Price, who is in the unusual position of being both a workfare laborer and a supervisor -- she helps oversee Mr. Simmons and 50 other workers. Ms. Price, who has been a workfare participant for three years, carries a clipboard as she keeps tabs on her subordinates.
Ms. Price, 53, who spent 10 years as a clerk at a Long Island City garment factory before it closed, has repeatedly applied for jobs, but she said employers are loath to hire people her age. Assessing her current post, she said, "The work is all right, it just doesn't have the money to go with it."
At the welfare office in downtown Brooklyn, more than a dozen W.E.P. workers find themselves in the odd position of helping keep the city's welfare leviathan running. They assist caseworkers and act as their right hands and, sometimes, their surrogates. The workfare participants sometimes interview welfare recipients, help run the records room, enter data into computers and translate Spanish or Russian. Occasionally, when caseworkers do not want to deliver bad news to recipients -- no emergency check to cover the rent, for instance -- they ask their workfare assistants to do it.
One workfare worker, who insisted on anonymity because he feared being kicked off welfare, said: "I'm doing more work than some of the regular case workers, so I ask, 'Why can't I get a job here?' This job is so unfair. I'm not getting paid, so why are they heaping so much work on us?"
Workfare participants seem to have an uneven, and often uneasy, relationship with regular city employees.
Some civil servants see workfare participants as a threat to their jobs; some others view them as a welcome crutch to lean on so they can take it easy or take long lunches. Workfare workers at some agencies complain that city workers look down on them and push them around. But at other offices, participants say, municipal employees treat them as equals and bend over backward to teach them what they can.
Adam Simpson helps manage the elevator system at Bellevue Hospital Center, one of 18 workfare participants there. Eva Simon serves lunches and transports patients, and Sonia Marcus works in human resources, answering phones, filing records and processing time sheets.
Despite Mr. Hill's general denial that workfare participants have replaced laid-off workers, the leaders of the hospital workers local within his local, District Council 37, say that assignments like those at Bellevue show that displacement has occurred.
Sarah Kennedy, executive vice president of the local, said that more than 500 workfare participants were performing tasks once done by some of the 1,000 employees laid off in 1996. Her local wants the city to hire hundreds of full-time workers.
"We're against using W.E.P. workers for the same jobs that people are being paid for," Ms. Kennedy said. "We have nothing against them. We want them to work and get paid. This is a way to bust the union. They're trying to use slave labor."
This issue was given new urgency last month when the hospitals agency said it would lay off 800 more workers. Under pressure from Ms. Kennedy's local, Mr. Hill issued what was for him an unusually stiff warning to the Giuliani administration: the city should not go through with its plans at the same time it is increasing the use of workfare participants.
"I'm not going to let workfare people replace our people in the hospitals," he said.
 
Does Workfare Work?
 
YESTERDAY -- An uncertain road to a real job.
 
TODAY -- A low-cost city labor force.
 
TOMORROW -- The scramble for child care.
 
WEDNESDAY -- Trimming the rolls: Tough or too tough?

HEADLINE: Despite His State's Health, Maryland Governor Struggles to Gain Re-election Foothold

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, April 12

 BODY:
The good times are rolling in Maryland.
As in many other states, a robust national economy has helped state lawmakers create jobs, improve schools and reduce crime. The 1998 legislative session ends on Monday in Annapolis with a projected budget surplus of $426 million, the state's largest in more than a decade. 
 Yet in a year in which the strong economy is expected to protect incumbents all across the country, Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland is one of the few governors among the 25 seeking another term who appear to be headed for trouble.
Despite a long list of accomplishments since his election four years ago, Mr. Glendening, a Democrat in a heavily Democratic state, is struggling to project an image and message that a majority of Maryland voters find appealing.
A poll released last week by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research reflected a political landscape that has not changed much since he took office in 1994. It also reflects widespread dissatisfaction with Mr. Glendening in some regions where the local leaders say he failed to keep promises or support local projects.
Based on results from 803 registered voters and a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points, the poll found that only 38 percent of respondents had a favorable opinion of the Governor and 35 percent had an unfavorable opinion. Matched against his likely Republican challenger, Ellen R. Sauerbrey, who lost to Mr. Glendening by 5,993 votes four years ago, Mr. Glendening held an edge by only 45 percent to 41 percent.
Even leading Maryland Democrats, including Peter B. Krauser, the state party chairman, and Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, one of the state's most popular politicians, have resisted endorsing Mr. Glendening before the September primary. In addition, the Democratic leaders of two of the state's most populous voting districts -- Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore and Wayne K. Curry, who succeeded Mr. Glendening as Prince George's County Executive -- have withheld any public support of the Governor.
Mr. Glendening dismissed the poll results and criticism as irrelevant, "like talking about the outcome of a baseball game in the first inning." In an interview, he said he was confident that Marylanders would keep him in office, once they focused on the highlights of his administration and realized they were achieved despite strong opposition from "powerful, wealthy enemies" like the National Rifle Association, tobacco companies and gambling interests.
But as Mr. Glendening's re-election campaign gears up, his message is being shouted down by opponents from both parties who characterize him as the latest in a long line of Maryland governors tainted by scandal and poor judgment.
They cite a series of issues since Mr. Glendening took office that raise questions about his honesty. Among them are his contentions that Prince George's County had a $48 million surplus when he left as its executive in 1994 and that he was unaware an executive at a New Jersey health-care company, the Merit Behavioral Care Corporation of Park Ridge, who was raising money for him in 1996 was bidding on a state contract.
Mr. Curry has insisted that Mr. Glendening left the county with a $100 million deficit and that Mr. Glendening returned the campaign donations from a New York City fund-raiser that was organized by Albert S. Waxman, Merit's chief executive, after a controversy erupted.
"It has just been a whole pattern of things," said Eileen M. Rehrmann, the Harford County Executive and the top Democratic challenger to Mr. Glendening. Ms. Rehrmann's campaign manager, Larry Gibson, had run a campaign for Mayor Schmoke.
For all her success in Harford County and her growing popularity elsewhere, Ms. Rehrmann may be the least of Mr. Glendening's concerns this year. His campaign manager, Tim Phillips, called her challenge "tactically bothersome and strategically insignificant," although he conceded that Mr. Glendening would have to spend more on the primary than he wanted to.
But Ms. Sauerbrey, a tenacious former state lawmaker, is another story. Promoting a 24 percent cut in the state income tax, she carried 21 of the state's 24 voting districts in 1994, losing the 3 biggest: the Democratic strongholds of Baltimore City and the suburban Washington counties of Montgomery and Prince George's.
Since then, Republicans have registered 55,000 more voters in the state than the Democrats have, fueling hopes among Republican leaders that Ms. Sauerbrey could become Maryland's first Republican governor since Spiro T. Agnew won in 1966.
Ms. Sauerbrey, who challenged the 1994 election results in court because they were so close, predicted that population shifts from Baltimore to neighboring counties would help increase her advantages where she was more popular than the Governor. She also said she was spending more time where she was weak in 1994, particularly among African-American communities in Baltimore and Prince George's County.
"Maryland is gradually changing into a state more hospitable to Republicans in general," Ms. Sauerbrey said. "Voter trends are moving in our direction, even in areas where we have had no Republican presence."
Referring to the poll results, Mr. Glendening said, "We made a mistake or two -- there's no question -- but not very many."
Yet he confidently predicted that the success of his programs would gain him more votes than any criticism might cost him.
Others are not so sure.
Eric Uslaner, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland, where Mr. Glendening was once a colleague, said the booming economy "should make it a breeze for a Democratic incumbent in a Democratic state."
But that, Mr. Uslaner added, depends upon the Governor's ability to convince voters that the criticism is either wrong or unjustified.
"At this point," he said, "the only person who can beat Parris Glendening is Parris Glendening."

Did Powerful Businesses Compromise U.S. Policy?
A secret Pentagon report says that two American aerospace manufacturers turned over expertise to China that improved the reliability of its nuclear missile program. An examination of the Administration's handling of the case illustrates the tug-of-war at work on America's China policy, with the goals of powerful American businesses that are often major contributors to the Democratic Party at odds with the Government's desire to limit the spread of missile technology.

A Governor, but Not a Shoo-in
A robust economy has helped Maryland create jobs, improve schools and reduce crime, but the state's top elected official, Parris N.

HEADLINE: So Far So Good as Chemical Weapons Are Burned in Utah, Officials Say

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOOELE, Utah

 BODY:
In the still air of this desert valley, home to the world's largest stockpile of chemical weapons, a collective sigh of relief is almost audible.
In nearly two years of operation, a prototype chemical weapons incinerator has destroyed 1,500 tons of sarin gas, one quarter of the depot's stock. Zeroing in on faulty lots of weapons, disposal workers also cut the number of "leakers" last year to 27, two-thirds the annual average number of bombs found to be leaking chemical gas here in the 1990's. 
 The results -- and the local revenue -- have prompted at least one local official to suggest transporting other chemical weapon stocks to here for destruction, although the idea is widely opposed.
Environmentalists had bitterly fought the Tooele incinerator, once predicting that workers would come out in body bags. But the only recorded injuries have been to two workers who slipped on icy walkways outside the incinerator, 17 miles south of Tooele (pronounced too-ELL-ah), a town of about 15,000 people southwest of Salt Lake City.
"My constituents are pleased we are finally getting rid of this stuff," said the local official, Gary Griffith of the Tooele County Commission, which has long supported the incineration of the weapons here.
The massive incinerator is the world's most concrete advance in weapons reduction since the Chemical Weapons Convention went into effect one year ago. The treaty rules out the methods of disposal that were popular through the 1970's: open burning on windless days, burial by bulldozers and dumping in the ocean.
Tooele's incinerator, which resembles a steamship beached in the desert, 45 miles southwest of from Salt Lake City, is the fruit of 20 years and several billion Federal dollars in research and construction.
"This is the Rolls-Royce of incinerators," said Amy Smithson, who has reviewed the plant's operation and who is a senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center, a research organization in Washington that specializes in military issues. "The Army has put more safeguards on this incinerator than exist on any incinerator in the world."
Russian technicians have toured the Tooele incinerator as part of efforts to destroy all of their country's stocks. But Russia, whose 40,000 tons of chemical weapons is the world's largest stockpile, is not expected to meet the Russian Government's 2007 deadline under the treaty, because it lacks sufficient money. The United States has a deadline of 2004.
In the 1980's, the United States military withdrew all its chemical weapons stocks from Europe and shipped them to Johnston Atoll, in the Pacific. An incinerator started operating there in 1993 and has burned about 1,500 tons, or almost 75 percent of the stocks.
Two more chemical weapons incinerators are under construction at storage sites in the United States: one at Anniston, Ala., the other at Hermiston, Ore. A construction contract is to be awarded soon for an incinerator at Pine Bluff, Ark. And Government researchers are testing chemical neutralization technologies for possible use at the other stockpile bases: Aberdeen, Md; Richmond, Ky; Newport, Ind., and Pueblo, Colo.
But environmentalists continue to try to block all incinerators, including Tooele's, saying they are unsafe.
"Our lawsuits are meant to derail the technology, not to derail the U.S. mission," said Craig Williams of the Chemical Weapons Working Group, a citizens' coalition based in Kentucky. "These facilities, as they are designed and operating, do not protect the public."
Utah has reason to be skeptical about the military's safety claims. In Nevada in the 1950's, the military exploded nuclear bombs in open-air tests when the wind was blowing away from Las Vegas, Nev., and toward Utah. In 1968, about 6,400 sheep were accidentally killed when the wind changed during an open air test of nerve agent at the Dugway Proving Grounds, an Army installation about 40 miles west of here.
But a series of scientific reviews seem to be easing public fears about Tooele's incinerator, the first to operate in the continental United States. In two telephone surveys conducted last year by Dan Jones and Associates, a polling group, the number of respondents in the Salt Lake area who considered the incinerator risk to be "significant" or "very significant" dropped sharply, to 28 percent in September, from 44 percent the previous March.
Last year, a panel of 16 independent scientists reviewed operations at the Tooele plant at the request of the National Research Council. In its report, the panel upheld Army calculations that said burning Tooele's munitions would be far less dangerous than storing them.
Then in September, a separate study rated "prospects for continued safe operation" of the incinerator as "very good." This report was prepared by independent consultants contracted by the Utah Citizens Advisory Commission, a diverse group appointed by the Governor, Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican.
The report was commissioned after a series of plant shutdowns and accusations of lax safety practices by former managers at the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, as the plant is officially known.
"While there have been highly publicized problems and occurrences at T.O.C.D.F.," the report said, "these have been very minor with respect to both public and worker safety. None of these have resulted in release of measurable amounts of agent into the atmosphere and no appreciable agent exposures have occurred to workers, visitors, or the public."
In a highly computerized plant dependent on robots, shutdowns are to be expected at the outset, the report said. But the report added, "The operating staff are gaining experience, and operations are becoming more routine."
Oversight is so heavy, the report said, that some managers spend up to 50 percent of their time responding to inspections and audits. In a 10-month period, there were 28 outside evaluations of the incinerator. Such favorable safety reports have prompted The Salt Lake Tribune, Utah's largest newspaper, to publish a series of editorials with such headlines as "Burn chemical weapons" and "Incinerating the doubts."
Next June, a permit to double the plant's rate for incineration is expected to be issued by Utah's governing agency, the Solid and Hazardous Waste Control Board.
"If we can go full rate at midyear, we can really take off in terms of quantities of agents disposed," said Timothy W. Thomas, manager of the incineration program here.
So far, the incinerator has destroyed almost 14,000 rockets, bombs and bulk containers in the process of burning the sarin gas. With the perception of a smooth operation, some people here have been emboldened to challenge inhibitions on transporting chemical weapons.
Government plans to duplicate Tooele's $650 million disposal plant at the seven other sites around the nation represent a colossal waste of taxpayers' money, argues Mr. Griffith, the county commissioner.
"None of this stuff was hatched here to begin with," he said of the chemical weapons that were shipped here by rail and road, largely from a Denver production plant, in the 1950's and 1960's.
Arguing that stocks in Colorado, Arkansas and Oregon should be shipped to the Tooele plant for incineration, Mr. Griffith said duplication meant that "we are spending billions for nothing."
"We let mass hysteria, lack of common sense, steal money out of our pockets," he added.
But on a broader state and national level, his idea does not have much support. And locally, some environmentalists say they suspect, county officials are falling in love with their plant for economic reasons. Under the conditions for incineration, the county receives $970 from the Army for every ton of chemical agent incinerated. These royalties, about $1.5 million so far, are helping to finance the construction of a sports complex on the edge of town.
Before the incineration began at the Tooele incinerator on Aug. 22, 1996, the Deseret Chemical Depot, as the Army installation is officially known, held 13,600 tons of chemical weapons, or 43 percent of the nation's total arsenal of 31,500 tons.
On the issue of transporting weapon stocks for destruction, advocates of local disposal contend that the days of shuttling chemical weapons around the nation are over. Public opinion and the unstable nature of 50-year-old chemical weapons rule out transportation, they say.
"The politics of transportation are impossible," said Ross Vincent, a member of a parallel panel of advisers in Colorado, the Chemical Demilitarization Citizens Advisory Commission. "Here in Pueblo, we would be lucky to get this stuff across the county line, much less across the state line."
Mr. Vincent, a Sierra Club official, also argued that transportation to Utah could prove as expensive as destruction in Colorado.
"You would have to build new fleets to move this stuff," he said. "You would have to buy off every county between here and the destination site."

HEADLINE: A Victim of a New Economy, The Corner Bank is Fading

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
They are the ghosts of banking in New York City.
The former New York Bank for Savings, a 19th-century Beaux-Arts landmark at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street, took its last deposit in 1981 and is now a rug store. 
 Another city landmark, 55 Wall Street, was vacated by Citibank in 1993 and is being renovated as a hotel. And at 33d Street and 10th Avenue, a building where Chase and Citibank employed hundreds of data-processing workers until 1995 is now home to The Daily News, WNET and other media companies.
The recycled buildings, with their newly chiseled or painted facades, are not the only signs of a passing era of banking in the city. A wave of consolidation and restructuring has caused dozens of banks to vanish in the last decade, and their once-familiar names -- Richmond Hill Savings Bank, Crossland Savings, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chemical -- are quickly fading in the city's collective memory. Along the way, thousands of jobs have been eliminated and more than 200 neighborhood branches closed.
The wave has crested in recent days with the proposed $70 billion merger of Citicorp and the Travelers Group, both based in Manhattan, and two other huge mergers that are expected to be announced today -- one of which would create the nation's first coast-to-coast bank. The Citicorp-Travelers deal would create a monolith engaged in stock trading, insurance and high-technology financial services, pushing the neighborhood bank teller further toward the status of an artifact in American commerce, like the village blacksmith.
These changes have generated no small amount of pain: in addition to the layoffs, advocates for the poor warn that the disappearance of bank branches will only worsen a chronic lack of banking services in neighborhoods outside Manhattan.
But despite the retrenchment, industry experts say New York City is coming out ahead, maintaining its status as the national epicenter of the new financial services industry, from venture capital to mutual funds to risk arbitrage. And they insist that the city stands to benefit as regulatory barriers break down between traditional banking, securities trading, insurance and other businesses.
"If I were worried about New York City's future, it would only be because I was worried about financial services as a whole, and I'm not," said Roy C. Smith, a professor of finance at New York University. "It has all become an interconnected circle, with people moving from one sector to the next."
Indeed, last week's merger proposal has simply accelerated a trend that has been reshaping the city's banking industry for years. According to the New York State Department of Labor, employment at the city's commercial banks -- not including brokerage houses or investment banks -- plummeted by a third between 1988 and this year, to 112,300 from 177,600.
The drop in the number of banks doing business in the city, and their branches, has been almost as steep. Federal data show that there were 85 banks and 1,200 bank offices in the city at the end of last year, down from 120 banks and 1,545 bank offices in 1988.
Economists say the impact on employment, although severe, has not been as catastrophic as the state figures might suggest, since many of the companies that have been taking away bank business are also providing jobs for bank workers.
"We were an overbanked city," said Carol Parry, the executive vice president for community development at Chase, the city's largest private employer. Perhaps more than any other, her bank represents the changes that have reshaped the industry: it acquired Chemical in 1995, only two years after Chemical had taken over Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
In reorganizing its new holdings, Chase closed more than 100 branches, but Ms. Parry said that it had found ways to deliver consumer services more efficiently. "We do not abandon communities," she said. "But having branches across the street or right next door to each other was not necessary."
Industry analysts say the shake-up has its roots in New York City's historic role as the nation's center of finance, which has made it a magnet for banks from around the world and led to duplication of many customer services. Beginning in the 1980's, with the introduction of conveniences like automated teller machines and banking at home by computer, they say some of the most routine bank branch services became redundant and unprofitable.
And growing competition from other financial service companies has carved deeply into bank profits. The biggest blow has come in the shift of people's assets from bank deposits to mutual funds, retirement accounts and other investments. Other competition has come from credit card companies and home loan brokerage concerns, which have cut into the banks' consumer business, and from investment banking houses, venture capital concerns and others that have lured away the business of corporate finance.
It is against that backdrop of an industry splitting into competitive pieces that experts say the surviving New York City banks will benefit if Federal regulations, which now limit their ability to diversify, break down. And they say the proposed marriage of Citicorp and Travelers, more than any other, will put pressure on Congress to change the rules.
"This merger is great for the city," said Mitchell Moss, an economist and urban planner at New York University. "It means the rest of the world is going to buy financial services in New York."
Whatever benefit may eventually flow to the city from its bank industry shake-up, the immediate results have been grim. Government figures show that employment gains at brokerage houses, financial consulting firms and other related businesses have fallen far short of making up for the banking cutbacks.
"The losses have not been remotely offset," said Rae Rosen, senior economist of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. While shrinking in importance to the city economy, she said, the New York commercial banks are also continuing a long downward spiral in their share of the nation's banking business, commanding less than 7 percent last year compared with more than 13 percent in the 1960's.
Executives say many of those being displaced from bank jobs are being helped by the region's strong economy and high demand for workers, if not at other banks or financial services companies, in other fields.
"Even though the number of banks that people can go to has gotten dramatically smaller, we are seeing very little overhang of chronic unemployment," said Lee Pomeroy, an executive search consultant who specializes in financial services. A former vice president at Chemical Bank, he said he left in 1987 "when I realized banking was the land of shrinking opportunities."
Mr. Pomeroy said workers being eliminated by banks now have much better prospects than in the early 1990's, when they faced the combined problems of a weak regional economy and a glut of laid-off bankers. Banking executives and managers are turning to a broad spectrum of other fields, including financial consulting and insurance, he said.
Since most entry-level bank workers receive at least rudimentary training in word processing, data entry or other computer skills, they are also in demand by companies in other fields, he said.
Still, the retrenchment of commercial banking poses problems that have less to with layoffs than with the level of banking service. A particular worry is the number of branches in poor neighborhoods far from the commercial core of Manhattan. Advocates for the poor, immigrants and elderly people say these areas have always been underserved. Now, with the elimination of many small banks and the branches of larger ones, they say the problem may be growing worse.
"Historically, there would have been a local savings institution that people could go to with their projects, but today they find themselves walking the halls of Chase or Citicorp," said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the New York Investment Fund, a business-sponsored philanthropical organization, who has spent more than 10 years leading a program to build housing in poor areas.
"The banks that are left are being expected to do more, and for the most part they are stepping up to the plate," she said. "But there has to be a limit to how many people and much of their resources they will devote to community development lending."
And even where banks have retained branches in poor areas, they have provoked repeated criticism for offering fewer services in those offices than in wealthier areas. Automated teller machines, in particular, have been the focus of complaints, with Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate, charging that banks have installed fewer of them in sections of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens than in Manhattan.
Still, bank executives and some analysts say the only way to maintain many of their traditional services amid the industry's retrenchment will be through technology -- not just in the form of automated cash machines, but through a growing assortment of bank transactions that can be conducted over the phone or home computers. "While we are processing fewer transactions in the branches, people are becoming much less dependent on them," Ken Herz, a spokesman for Chase, said.
Because of the pressures on New York City banks to continue their retrenchment and reorganization, Mr. Moss said customers would have no choice but to rely more on electronic bank services.
"Banks used to be the equivalent of financial temples, putting people close to God," he said. "Now the marble of the temple is becoming less important than its phone line to the outside world."

HEADLINE: For Gay Soldiers, Service Means Lying

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Trouble With 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' " (editorial, April 8), on the Defense Department report showing that the number of homosexuals being forced out of the military under the policy is higher than when the policy was adopted in 1993: 
 You say the "Pentagon spin is that service members are voluntarily declaring themselves gay to get out of the military." You go on to ask, "But if that were true, wouldn't discharge numbers have stayed roughly the same from year to year?" This ignores several realities.
There is less stigma associated with homosexuality today, so new recruits who find the military tougher than expected can claim to be homosexual and get an honorable discharge with taxpayer-financed transition benefits. Veterans use the same excuse to gain their freedom to pursue careers in a robust economy, and a growing number escape obligations after expensive taxpayer-financed legal and medical schooling. Meanwhile, military recruiting and retention are severe problems.

Prices of the 30-Year Treasury Issue Decline in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday, hurt in part by speculation that the Bank of Japan had sold Treasury bills to raise cash for its efforts to support the yen.
The weakness in the market, however, also stemmed from comments made by a Federal Reserve governor, Laurence H. Meyer, on Thursday. Mr. Meyer said that the economy's "performance is exceptional but unsustainable," suggesting that any slowdown generated by Asia's financial crisis may have arrived too late to ward off an increase in interest rates by the Fed. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 21/32 yesterday, to 102 25/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.93 percent, from 5.88 percent on Thursday. The Treasury market was closed on Friday in observance of Good Friday.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc., in Boca Raton, Fla., called the market "a little vulnerable because we have not been able to go up on good news, instead the market is focusing on yen-dollar trade."
Trading volume was up in the shorter maturities but thin in the longer-maturity coupons, Mr. Pugliese noted, leaving bond prices susceptible to sharp fluctuations. One large seller or one large buyer can move the market on days like yesterday, he said.
With reports expected today on March consumer prices and retail sales, "tomorrow will be a pivotal day for bonds, depending on how the market reacts to the monthly retail and Consumer Price Index numbers," Mr. Pugliese said.
"Market participants have been growing accustomed to friendly numbers," he said.
Rates at yesterday's weekly Treasury bill auction were higher in what was described as a weak and sloppy auction. The bid-to-cover ratios were poor, with some analysts attributing the outcome to activity by the Fed, which was in the market selling securities for a customer.
The average rate for the three-month bill was 5.035 percent, up from 4.960 percent last week, while the six-month bill was awarded at the average rate of 5.130 percent, up from 5 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's regular weekly bill auction of three- and six-month maturities:

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN BANKING: THE CONSOLIDATION;
Big Mergers: Economies That Could Break the Scale

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The old American financial system -- with banks unable to cross state lines and barred by law from getting into some other financial businesses -- was a messy and inefficient one. But it encouraged a diversity that may have helped the economy.
The new system, cemented by mergers and takeovers that are coming in a wave, is hailed by Wall Street for its efficiency as economies of scale reduce costs. But the presence of fewer substantial competitors also means that the remaining ones are more likely to make the same mistakes if the financial environment again turns hostile. 
 Some of today's big players got to be big precisely because they avoided the mistakes of their larger competitors. But there will be fewer midsize players in the future with the ability to move up to the front ranks.
To see just how much the financial landscape has changed in a generation, consider the lineup of large banks a quarter of a century ago, at the end of 1972. Then there were 10 commercial banks in the United States with assets of more than $10 billion.
Today, with all the mergers that have transpired in recent years -- and the ones announced in the last two weeks -- just three of those banks are to be owned by the same companies that controlled them a quarter of a century ago.
The amazing change in banking leadership in this country is a result of several factors. Some banks faltered in the 1970's and 80's because of bad loans. Others were able to grow because of more friendly regulatory treatment in their states as interstate banking became possible. Others merged as banks faced intense competition from other financial services providers.
As this year began, five of the top 10 of a quarter century ago were still owned by the same owner, or by a successor whose name reflected a reorganization, not a takeover.
But Citicorp, the company that owns Citibank -- then called First National City Bank of New York -- agreed last week to be acquired by Travelers, the insurance and brokerage giant. And yesterday, BankAmerica agreed to be merged into Nationsbank, the successor to a North Carolina bank that ranked 33d in size a quarter of a century ago.
The three remaining are all New York banks -- Morgan Guaranty, Chemical Bank and the Bankers Trust New York Corporation. Chemical Bank is no longer around, but its parent corporation, the Chemical New York Corporation, is, having been renamed the Chase Manhattan Corporation when it acquired that bank a few years after absorbing another of the top 10, Manufacturers Hanover. J. P. Morgan still owns Morgan Guaranty, but has indicated it would consider a merger if it is unable to become an investment banking powerhouse on its own. Bankers Trust has expanded into investment banking and has shown no signs of wanting to be bought, though there has been speculation that it might become a target.
Outside New York, there were four banks in the top 10, as compiled by American Banker based on data from the end of 1972. All but BankAmerica had already gone the takeover route before the latest wave. Security Pacific, based in Los Angeles, was taken over by BankAmerica. Chicago's Continental Illinois, a victim of bad lending in the 1970's, had to be rescued by the Government and was eventually acquired by BankAmerica. First Chicago was taken over by a Detroit bank in 1995, only to have the merged entity agree to be bought yesterday by Banc One of Columbus, Ohio. A quarter of a century ago, that company's predecessor, First Bank Group of Ohio, was the third-largest banking company in Columbus. It was nowhere near the top 100 in the nation.
The fate of the Chicago banks reflects the fear in which they were held back home. For decades, Illinois law barred them from expanding to other parts of Illinois. That was supposed to protect downstate banks. In the end, it merely left them open to acquisition by banks from outside the state and assured that the headquarters of big Chicago banks would no longer be in Illinois.
During this great period of consolidation, Wall Street has fallen in and out of love with the banks several times. There have been worries over bad loans, over the costs of all that branch-bank real estate in an increasingly computerized age, and of deteriorating market share for banks as mutual funds have come on strong.
But lately, there has been an intense love affair. In the 1990's, interest rates have come down -- and the biggest reductions have come in what banks pay for deposits, not what they charge for loans. With the economy healthy, relatively few bad loans have appeared, and Wall Street has come to expect good profit increases for the banks that survive, with each merger meaning the elimination of redundant costs and opportunities to sell more products to more customers.
Of the four banks in yesterday's deals, the stock in three rose. Banc One shares rose in early trading but settled back to end unchanged at $61.75.
Part of the problem there was that in a meeting with analysts yesterday, John B. McCoy, chairman of Banc One, said his goal for annual profit increases now was 13 to 15 percent. He tried to hint that he really didn't mean to imply the figure could be as low as 13 percent, but some analysts immediately noted that the old figure had been 15 percent, and the stock soon weakened.
Eight years ago, when bad loans were bringing banks down and analysts were vying to predict failures correctly, the idea of banks as growth vehicles would have seemed quaint. If and when the credit excesses of this era appear in earning reports, it may again seem odd.
The old system that kept banks within state lines, and out of other financial businesses, may have been inefficient. But it meant that when the biggest players stumbled, there were others who could grow to take up the slack. And the huge number of banks meant that banks were likely to pursue differing strategies, some wiser, or luckier, than others. Contrast that with European countries, which tended to be dominated by a few large banks that were likely to make similar mistakes.
The consolidation phase of American banking is continuing, and there is no sign of an early end. The resulting behemoths may be better at squeezing out costs and at marketing the most products. But they are less likely to be nimble in the way that smaller institutions could be, and that fact -- in the next economic cycle or the one after that -- may prove to be very important, and the source of disappointment to investors.

Yesterday's bank mergers sparked investor interest in the banking sector as Wall Street tried to guess which banks might seek out combinations. Here are some of the companies likely to do a deal and their recent performances.

HEADLINE: Test Census Is Attracting Few Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: CHESTER, S.C., April 8

 BODY:
Only five people three unemployed workers, a member of the volunteer fire department and a clerk at the local motel -- showed up one evening at the public library for the test to be census takers. But officials from the Census Bureau were thankful for the few who did come. Some nights, the turnout is even more disappointing.
"For every 10 calls we get from people who say they want to take the test, 50 percent don't show up at all," said Jackie P. Shaw, chief recruiter for the Census Bureau's regional office in Charlotte, N.C. 
 As the Census Bureau begins a critical dress rehearsal in South Carolina for the 2000 Census, it is encountering the same problem that has bedeviled private industry across the country. The bureau cannot find enough workers.
In an effort to attract more workers, the bureau has recently raised the pay by 50 cents an hour for workers at the South Carolina test site. Now, census takers can earn as much as $10.50 an hour, while some supervisors can make as much as $14 an hour for the temporary jobs that last six weeks and pay no benefits.
With the jobless rate the lowest since the early 1970's, welfare rolls plummeting and the American work force radically changed over the last 30 years, census officials have been scrambling to hire enough people to perform the critical work of knocking on the doors and counting members of those households that have not mailed in their census form.
"Every place you go into in this area, especially the type of people who in the past we have been able to recruit from -- namely the fast food industry, places with high turnover and fairly low wages -- they are all looking for people," said Ms. Shaw, who is supervising recruiting in the 11 counties in South Carolina that make up one of the three test sites.
No one can predict the shape of the country's economy two years from now, but South Carolina's hiring difficulties could be compounded by an even older problem of finding temporary employees when the traditional source of such workers, stay-at-home wives, has been shrinking.
By the end of last week, officials here had recruited fewer than 4,369 people, or roughly less than 38 percent of the workers needed to canvas the test area starting on May 16. Officials hoped that by the end of April they would have hired 80 percent of the 11,575 employees who they will eventually need. But now they are afraid they will fall far short.
Unemployment is so low in some areas where the bureau is trying to recruit -- it is 2.3 percent in Richland County, home of Columbia, the capital of South Carolina and one of the counties in the test -- and welfare rates have fallen so fast that bureau officials are concerned about the quality of some of the applicants. "Frankly, the people who are unemployed in a market like this -- my eyes have been opened -- are, for the most part, unemployable," Ms. Shaw said.
As a result, the bureau has embarked on a new strategy, focusing its recruiting efforts on retirees and on people who are already working, but who want to earn some extra money in the evenings and on weekends. "I stress to all my recruiting assistants: do not spend all of your time; in fact, do not spend the majority of your time on the unemployed folks," Ms. Shaw said.
The bureau is even running into resistance from local businesses. Recently, the bureau asked a number of local plants if they could place recruiting posters on company bulletin boards, advertising the opportunity for part-time work. The companies, fearing the loss of workers, refused.
"There are not really a lot of companies we have found who are enthusiastic about their employees working another 30 hours," said Peter Iwema, assistant manager for recruiting for the South Carolina test site.
The Census Bureau's problems in South Carolina underscore how difficult the next census will be. Currently Congress is squabbling over the bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to estimate the population in the year 2000. That method, which is loosely similar to public opinion polls, is opposed by Republicans who say it is unconstitutional and prone to manipulation for partisan political purposes.
Census Bureau officials say they are attempting to get a change in Federal rules to allow employees in other Federal agencies to do the census work part time.

HEADLINE: Ukraine's Dangerous Decline

 BODY:
Last year, Ukraine and Turkmenistan were the only former Soviet republics to see their official economies shrink. Ukraine's steady decline is the main reason that voters abandoned the relatively reformist governing party in parliamentary elections two weeks ago. The big winner was the Communist Party, a group so troglodyte that it favors "voluntary reunification" with Russia. The vote practically insures that Ukraine will see none of the reforms the country needs.
Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine has had some limited economic success, largely thanks to the skill of the central bank governor, Victor Yushchenko. Inflation, 10,000 percent five years ago, has fallen to around 10 percent today. About half the economy is now in private hands, compared with 70 percent in Russia. 
 But privatization has not generated economic growth. Important areas, like agriculture, have yet to be touched. The tax system is arbitrary, burdening legitimate businesses and driving them into the shadow economy. Regulation is stifling -- setting up a construction company requires some 50 different licenses, virtually all of which must be accompanied by bribes. President Leonid Kuchma and his allies in the Parliament introduced an important package of reforms more than a year ago, but it died, a victim of the pervasive corruption that is choking modernization and driving away investment.
Ukraine's economy also suffers from the country's uneven progress in democratic reforms. Ukraine is one of a handful of former Soviet republics that have had relatively clean parliamentary elections and changed their presidents. The country's treatment of national minorities is also good, and it has shown the political maturity to give up its nuclear weapons. But Ukraine's newspapers and especially its television stations are politicized and controlled to the point where they cannot keep an eye on the Government.
Ukraine is the fourth-largest recipient of American aid, but that assistance may be cut in half under a misguided new law requiring the Administration to certify that the country is making progress on the problems of a few American investors. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund should condition their assistance on changes like tax and regulatory reforms designed to speed economic growth. Ukraine's politicians need a clear message that economic reform cannot wait.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN BANKING: THE NEW BANKAMERICA;
Hands in a Lot of Markets And a Foot on Each Coast

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
As expected, the Nationsbank Corporation and the BankAmerica Corporation announced a $60 billion merger yesterday that would create the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits and would have relationships with 30 percent of the nation's households.
The combined company, to be called BankAmerica, would catapult ahead of the Chase Manhattan Corporation and would have a truly national reach, stretching from Nationsbank's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., to BankAmerica's home in San Francisco. It would be second in assets only to Citigroup, the proposed $70 billion combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. announced just a week ago. 
 Nationsbank and BankAmerica aim to be the biggest consumer bank in the nation and expect to achieve significant economies of scale, temporarily putting aside the notion that banks need giant securities firms, insurance companies and asset management units to compete in the increasingly global marketplace.
"This is going to be the best franchise in the country, both in terms of their retail and wholesale businesses," said Robert Albertson, a Goldman, Sachs & Company analyst.
The proposed merger could lead to 5,000 to 8,000 job cuts, an undetermined number of which would involve layoffs, and is expected to result in expense reductions of $2 billion in the two years after the merger. The companies said they expected the merger to close at the end of the year. Unlike last week's merger agreement between Citicorp and Travelers, which involves few overlapping business, the BankAmerica transaction with Nationbank would permit the merged company to reduce back-office costs as it combines similar businesses like investment banking and credit card operations.
The new BankAmerica would have $570 billion in assets, compared with $697 billion for Citigroup. In market capitalization, it would also be second, with $133 billion to Citigroup's market capitalization of roughly $140 billion. Most important, it would have branches in 22 states coast to coast, with little overlap. There are only two states where both NationsBank and BankAmerica now have branches: Texas and New Mexico. BankAmerica had previously announced that its retail operations in Texas were for sale but reversed that decision yesterday.
Hugh L. McColl Jr., 62, would be chairman and chief executive of the merged company, which would be based in Charlotte. Over the last decade, Mr. McColl has gobbled up banks at a rapid clip to create a giant franchise out of the once small North Carolina bank known as NCNB.
David A. Coulter, 50, of BankAmerica, would be president of the combined company and Mr. McColl's designated successor. But the board will favor Nationsbank, with 11 of the new board's 20 members coming from that institution.
The leadership issue was not contentious, Mr. McColl said in a news conference yesterday. "We figured out which one of us was the oldest and who would get out of the way the quickest," he said, "and I won."
This is not the first go-around for the two companies. Merger discussions were held in 1995 between Nationsbank's Mr. McColl and the former BankAmerica chairman, Richard M. Rosenberg, who retired in early 1996 and was replaced by Mr. Coulter. At the time, though, the deal faltered because they could not decide who would run the combined company, where it would be based and what it would be named.
This time both companies' executives set aside egos to get the deal done. In late March, Michael O'Neill, the chief financial officer for BankAmerica, and James Hance, his counterpart at Nationsbank, held initial meetings in San Francisco, said a person close to the talks. Meetings in San Francisco followed on April 2, with Mr. McColl and Mr. Coulter joining the discussion. There, along with Edward Herlihy, a lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz who had advised Nationsbank on its acquisition of Barnett Banks and had counseled BankAmerica on other deals, the two companies outlined the basic merger terms.
The four bank executives flew to Phoenix for the Bankers Roundtable, an industry conference, after their meetings in San Francisco. There, Mr. McColl and Mr. Coulter hammered out the last of the details.
To keep the deal quiet, executives from both companies met secretly in Dallas last week to conduct due diligence far from the watchful eye of employees, analysts and reporters, said the person close to the talks. On Thursday, BankAmerica's board approved the merger. Nationsbank's board approved the merger the next day.
The transaction is a stock swap that involves BankAmerica's shareholders exchanging their existing stock for 1.1316 shares of the new company. Nationsbank shareholders will retain their existing shares.
The stocks of the two bank companies soared in early trading before settling back at the end of the day. BankAmerica finished at $91.375, up $4.625, while Nationsbank gained $4.1875 to close at $80.625.
Merrill Lynch and Montgomery Securities provided investment banking advice to Nationsbank, while BankAmerica was advised by Goldman, Sachs. Nationsbank received legal advice from Wachtell, Lipton and Smith, Helms, Mulliss & Moore. BankAmerica's counsel was Wachtell, Lipton.

HEADLINE: 3 Large Securities Firms Post Strong Earnings Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Three big securities firms -- Merrill Lynch & Company, the Paine Webber Group and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. -- reported strong earnings gains yesterday for the first quarter, helped by the booming stock market.
The companies' stocks rose after the reports and amid speculation, set off by mega-mergers in the financial industry, that more securities firms will become takeover targets. 
 Merrill, the biggest securities firm, said its profits rose 11 percent. Paine Webber, which is the seventh- largest firm, said profits were up 20 percent, and Donaldson, at No. 8, said its profits rose 55 percent. All the results handily beat analyst forecasts.
Wall Street firms are benefiting from the healthy economy and rising corporate profits, which are enticing millions of individuals to put their money into stocks and other investments. This has encouraged many companies to raise cash by selling both stocks and bonds -- businesses that earn securities companies hefty underwriting fees.
Meanwhile, consolidation in many industries also continues to generate significant revenues for Wall Street firms that provide advice on corporate mergers.
The booming business on Wall Street has caught the eyes of commercial banks and other companies looking to diversify as Depression-era restrictions that have separated financial services in the United States continue to crumble. Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and Donaldson have all maintained their independence. But the three companies all have been mentioned as ripe targets by analysts and have been the subject of takeover speculation.
The speculation was heightened -- and the shares of the three firms surged -- yesterday after the Nationsbank Corporation and the BankAmerica Corporation announced a giant merger and the Banc One Corporation said it would combine with the First Chicago NBD Corporation. The two deals followed last week's planned union of the banking giant Citicorp and Travelers Group, the financial services giant.
Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and Donaldson credited their strong performances to healthy gains in asset management fees, brokerage commissions and investment banking, which includes underwritings and corporate mergers advice.
Merrill, the leading American underwriter of stocks and bonds during the quarter and No. 1 in advising on corporate mergers, earned $518 million, or $1.30 a diluted share, compared with $466 million, or $1.17 a share, a year earlier. Revenues after interest expenses rose to $4.6 billion from $3.8 billion.
The results beat Wall Street expectations of $1.11 a share, according to Zacks Investment research. Merrill's stock was up $4.125, to $99 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Asset management and portfolio service fees rose 50 percent, to $970 million. Brokerage commissions increased 23 percent, to $1.4 billion. Trading revenue rose 16 percent, to $951 million. Investment banking revenue was up 32 percent, to $810 million.
Meanwhile, Paine Webber earned $120.7 million, or 77 cents a diluted share, compared with $100.8 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. Net revenues rose to $1.11 billion from $984.8 million.
The results exceeded analysts' forecasts for earnings of 64 cents a share. Paine Webber's stock was up $2.125, to $48.9375 on the Big Board.
Donaldson, the brokerage subsidiary of the Equitable Companies Inc. earned $134.2 million, or $2 a diluted share, up from $86.4 million, or $1.37 cents a share. Revenues minus interest expenses rose to $1.1 billion from $763 million. The results were much stronger than the $1.32 a share Wall Street expected. The company's shares were up $7.375, to $101.25 a share on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: This Year in Argentina, Two Brothers Build an Empire;
Outsiders, They Bet on Future of a Global Breadbasket

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
Moments after taking off from an airport here, Alejandro Elsztain peered out at the verdant patchwork of family farms spreading over the Argentine horizon.
"At the beginning of the century, the land is what Argentina was known for," Mr. Elsztain told a group of investment fund analysts on an airborne tour of farms he manages. "And in the future, Argentina will once again be known for its agriculture. We are just beginning." 
 When Mr. Elsztain (pronounced el-STINE) speaks of "we," he is referring not just to Argentina, but also to himself and his older brother, Eduardo, whose fortunes are increasingly intertwined with the fortunes of their nation. With a vision of Argentina awakening from six decades of economic slumber to become a dominant agribusiness power in the next 15 years, the two brothers are quietly building Latin America's newest real estate empire before either has reached the age of 40.
Though their gamble that Argentina will become the next big breadbasket in an increasingly integrated global economy is only beginning to pay off, they have already emerged from obscurity. Since Eduardo talked his way into George Soros's office in New York City eight years ago and came away with a $10 million check, they have become darlings of Wall Street's emerging-market gurus and Argentina's free-enterprise revolutionaries intent on smashing the nation's quaint tradition of inefficient, underfinanced family farms and ranches.
The history of Latin America is full of wealthy "hacendados" and "rancheros," powerful figures who pulled the strings from behind the scenes. Not the Elsztains. They are outsiders, third-generation Jews from Eastern and Central Europe now in a thoroughly Roman Catholic country, whose vision is nourished by a mystical Orthodox faith usually associated with the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.
With an audacity that has stunned many in the Argentine business community, the Elsztains doubled their rural land holdings to 1.1 million acres in the last year -- a vault that suddenly made their farm company Cresud Argentina's largest landowner and biggest producer of beef and grain. Meanwhile, their separate real estate company, IRSA, headed by Eduardo Elsztain, is remaking the skyline of Buenos Aires and pushing the city's development south and east.
"There is a tremendous amount of capital going into the developing world," Eduardo said in a recent interview. "That pool of money is translated into increases in salaries. People who have a jump in salary first begin to eat a little better. That creates a demand for food, and that's where Argentina will grow."
Cresud is bringing about big changes in Argentine ranching and agriculture with biotechnology, extensive irrigation of marginal land and one particular innovation that horrifies most gauchos and Argentine beefeaters who shun fatty meat. Cresud recently entered into a joint venture with the Texas-based Cactus Feeders to begin fattening 100,000 head of cattle a year with corn rather than traditional Argentine grass to increase yields and produce cuts of beef marbled with more fat to appeal to American and Asian tastes.
Believing that the Argentine middle and upper classes can only expand and grow richer, the Elsztains' real estate arm is buying up shopping centers, office buildings and hotels around Argentina at a dizzying pace. It is also helping restore the capital's shabby river waterfront to splendors not seen in 60 years. Abasto, a sprawling neighborhood known until recently for muggings and seedy tango bars, is suddenly gentrifying as the Elsztain brothers begin to build a giant high-rise middle-class housing project abutting an even larger shopping center complete with a dozen movie theaters and a children's museum.
IRSA last year swallowed up its biggest competitor and acquired assets worth more than $350 million, bolstering its real estate portfolio to an estimated value of $800 million, according to a recent Bear, Stearns report. And now, with local partners in Venezuela and Brazil, the company is taking its mall empire outside Argentina. The cover of its last annual report displayed a key entering a lock in the shape of the entire South American continent.
The Elsztains say the economic upheaval in Asia is little more than a speed bump. In the long term, they contend, the sprawling pampas of Argentina will feed a growing Brazil, a Europe that must cut its immensely expensive agricultural subsidies and an Asia that will continue to move away from an agrarian production system as it industrializes.
In recent years, as the Argentine Government slashed farm export taxes, land prices have rapidly appreciated. Nonetheless, they remain considerably less expensive than comparable lands in Canada and the United States. The company stands to gain from a further escalation of land values, local and foreign analysts say.
"The Elsztains know that Argentina can produce meat, wheat and milk cheaper than the United States," said Osvaldo Cortesi, an agricultural economist at Macroeconomica, a local research organization. "They know that as agribusiness expands in Argentina, land prices will rise."
Argentina's share of world beef exports has already doubled since 1993, in large part because of a 400 percent increase in exports to Brazil. With the United States last year opening its market to Argentine beef for the first time in six decades, and with Japan soon expected to follow, international experts say the future for Argentine beef growers looks even brighter.
Since 1990, the country's agricultural exports have climbed 80 percent, to more than $9 billion last year. Its current annual grain output of 60 million tons is expected to climb to 80 million tons in 2000, according to local and foreign analysts.
Nevertheless, the Elsztains are feeling at least a short-term chill from Asia. Jittery foreign investors have shied away from Latin stocks in recent months, jolting Cresud, which is traded as American depository receipts on the Nasdaq market, and IRSA, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The companies' shares are well off their highs of $24.625 and $46 last year; Cresud closed yesterday at $20.25, down 12.5 cents, and IRSA, at $36.0625, down 43.75 cents.
Weak international commodity prices, particularly for corn, have been a drag on Cresud. Rental rates have slowed, and some analysts consider retail sales in IRSA's shopping centers vulnerable. Moreover, concerns that the last decade of political stability may not last hang over Argentine markets.
"There are two if's," said Hector R. R. Lawrence, Pioneer Hi-Bred International's manager in Argentina. "If there is no political change in the rules of the Argentine economy and if there is no international crisis that provokes capital flight from Argentina, these two brothers are going to be extremely successful."
Alejandro, 32, is the day-to-day manager of Cresud, while Eduardo, 38, is the top executive of both Cresud and IRSA. They both assiduously keep a low profile and refuse to answer any questions about their religion, family members or personal lives.
Alejandro is a trained agronomist with a love of the outdoors and riding horses gleaned from childhood visits to a family farm. Though he sometimes displays a quick temper, he also has a warm smile and a teasing, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humor. In the recent tour of his properties with analysts, he mixed dense statistical presentations with fun. He plied his guests with sizzling steaks and Argentine wines and humored them by leading a tour of his fields on horseback. He then encouraged them to milk the cows and feed the calves.
Eduardo is the dour, bearded brother. He is a man of few words, but by all accounts he is the real visionary of the family. He is an Orthodox Jew who seeks guidance from Lubavitcher rabbis, intellectual direction from the English philosopher Karl Popper and economic perspective from Mr. Soros, the financier. Visitors to his office in Buenos Aires leave with copies of the writings of the Grand Rebbe, the late Menachem M. Schneerson, and a sense that Eduardo finds a spiritual mission in his investments.
"I feel every person is born with a mission in life," Eduardo said. "So when you make a business, you are not only making a business but elevating something, and that is how the person grows and elevates himself beyond the material world."
For all his seriousness, though, he lets loose, too. On Purim, Eduardo joined in a service that was held in his office and attended by fellow executives and members of the local Lubavitcher community. At every mention of Haman, the evil Persian leader who plotted the destruction of the Jews, he whistled in a loud jeer and banged a double AA battery on the table. That night in March, at a boisterous Purim party, he danced in wild gyrations as he drank kosher wine straight from the bottle.
Eduardo was not always religious, associates said, nor did he always seem destined for success. As a high school student during the times of the military dictatorships, acquaintances said Eduardo sympathized with the leftist opposition. He did not graduate from college. He went to work in his father's small real estate company and gradually found religion, spending a year in Israel in 1980.
In 1990, as Argentina was beginning to emerge from a devastating fit of hyperinflation, Eduardo spent a year in New York City studying Jewish teaching in the mornings and lobbying Mr. Soros and other investors in the afternoons. In a single meeting, Eduardo convinced Mr. Soros that new policies of the Argentine Government intended to deregulate and privatize the economy were worth a gamble.
With Mr. Soros's $10 million, a partner and a secretary, Eduardo founded a portfolio management company. As the Argentine stock market exploded in 1991 and 1992, he took profits and turned his attentions to real estate. IRSA now has a market capitalization of about $697 million, and Cresud, about $252 million. Mr. Soros holds about one-quarter of the shares of both companies, and Eduardo has since made at least one other deal with him, investing with Mr. Soros in Apex Silver Mines Ltd.
Eduardo describes himself as a contrarian who saw values in properties and stocks driven down by decades of political instability and hyperinflation. When Argentina was left staggering again in the wake of Mexico's monetary crisis in 1994 and 1995, he became only more aggressive in his pursuit of both urban and rural properties. That paid off when the Argentine economy took off again, growing last year by 8 percent with only a slight slowdown so far this year.
"The companies are growing with the country," Eduardo said. "The more the country grows, the more we will grow."

The two brothers who own Cresud, an Argentine farm company, use most of their land for raising crops and cattle for export. Their business has been successful in part because the cost of land is much lower in Argentina than in other parts of the world.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Warns U.S. Markets Could Tumble

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that while the United States was likely to ride out the remainder of the Asian financial crisis largely unscathed, the American stock and bond markets were increasingly vulnerable to a major fall.
The assessment was contained in a survey of world economies, published as finance ministers from around the world began arriving in Washington to assess the impact of the Asian crisis and debate how the world should react to such shocks in the future. The meeting comes as Congress is debating whether to increase the United States' contribution to the monetary fund by $18 billion, a step opposed by many Republicans and some Democrats. 
 In the survey, the fund lowered its projections for world economic growth for the second time in four months, predicting that it would slow to 3.1 percent from 4.1 percent a year ago.
The major drag on world growth, the report suggested, would come from Japan, which the fund's economists said in polite language would be lucky to post zero percent growth this year. Other economists are predicting that Japan could slip into a deep recession that might drag down much of the rest of the world.
Such projections will almost certainly keep Japanese officials on the defensive this week. Already they have been attacked by European and Asian nations for a slow and insufficient response to their country's financial slide.
Last week, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan announced a $76 billion financial stimulus package in response to overwhelming international pressure.
"Everyone called the Japanese and put the screws to them," said a senior international financial official involved in this week's meetings. "And still, they came up with something the markets view as insufficient."
Predictably, the United States received the best marks for the management of its national finances over the last year, and the monetary fund projected that inflation would remain low through the rest of the year, in part because of a flood of low-priced Asian imports.
But the fund warned that American stock prices were currently "at or very near historical peaks." The fund's chief economist, Michael Mussa, said at a news conference that a sharp fall in the market was "a risk that should warrant concern at this point in time."
"There needs to be concern about the possibility of an equity market correction," he said, "but I don't have any reason at this stage to fear that there would be large adverse consequences from such a correction."

HEADLINE: 1,500 Executions Cited for Iraq In Past Year, Mostly for Politics

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 13

 BODY:
The Government of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has executed at least 1,500 people in the last year mostly for political reasons, a former Dutch Foreign Minister has concluded in a report to be presented on Tuesday to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
Most of the deaths occurred during a "prison-cleansing campaign" in November and December ordered by Mr. Hussein's younger son, Qusay. He directs Iraq's Special Security Organization, one of a number of armed intelligence agencies that sustain an atmosphere of terror in Iraq, diplomats based there say. 
 The report says that after Qusay Hussein's visit to one prison, Abu Gharib, large numbers of prisoners condemned to death or to sentences of 15 years or more were shot, hanged or electrocuted there and in other prisons. The families of those shot were forced to pay for the bullets used before they could claim the bodies.
The report was prepared by Max van der Stoel, former Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, for the Human Rights Commission. It is in line with charges that Iraq exiles have been leveling against President Hussein's administration in recent months.
Reporting on human rights issues is virtually nonexistent inside Iraq, where the news media are controlled and opposition to the President and his family is met with draconian measures -- including assassination and imprisonment without fair trial.
This report follows a separate study for the United Nations in March that concluded that Iraq leads the world in forced disappearances, with 16,000 people reported missing in the last decade.
The Clinton Administration has made an improvement in Iraq's human rights record a prerequisite to the lifting of economic sanctions imposed in 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- along with a demonstrable end to prohibited weapons programs.
The United States is likely to face pressures in the United Nations Security Council, though, by the end of this month to reward Iraq for what appears to be a new spirit of cooperation with arms inspections.
Mr. Van der Stoel, who holds the title of United Nations Special Rapporteur on Iraq, has been refused entry to the country since 1992. His survey, completed last month, is based on reports and documents smuggled out of Iraq as well as on information compiled from a number of sources by exiled Iraqi opposition groups. He also collected information in Turkey because information reaches that country through Iraqi Kurds in the border area.
His report paints a picture of persistent persecutions of the Kurds, of the Shiite tribes in the southern marshes and Turkomans and other ethnic or religious groups. It describes a relentless pursuit of all political critics or would-be critics.
Among the instances of summary executions that he cited were the killings in October of 14 military officers and politicians who were accused of planning an attempt on President Hussein's life.
In another instance he cited, 23 people were sentenced to death, among them three military officers charged with "maneuvering" against the Government.
He received reports of the executions of army deserters, Islamic activists, Shiite tribe members and people connected with opposition groups that maintain offices in exile -- including nine people with ties to a group called the Iraqi National Council and seven people associated with another group, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq.
As with other United Nations human rights investigators, Mr. Van der Stoel guards his sources of information to protect them from retaliation. His work is given considerable credibility because he has been reporting on Iraq since the Persian Gulf war.
"Iraqi law imposes life imprisonment and, in certain cases, death on anyone insulting the President," the report says. It notes that the Iraqi Government explanation is that officials distinguish between criticism and insult, reserving death for the latter.
Mr. Van der Stoel said he found this distinction "neither convincing in theory nor reflective of the factual situation in Iraq."
Membership in political parties not officially working with the governing Baath Party is punishable by death, the report says. And crimes against property can also bring the death penalty or in some cases disfigurement. Iraqi thieves may be branded, or limbs may be amputated, or both. In December, Iraq executed four Jordanian students who had smuggled $850 in auto parts into the country.
In addition to information about executions, the report details a continuing Iraqi policy of forcibly resettling people belonging to ethnic minorities -- especially Kurds and Turkoman people in Kirkuk, north of Baghdad -- and of moving Arabs into that region. Mr. Van der Stoel says Arabs are given incentives of money and apartments to settle in Kirkuk.
"Families who are perceived to be opposed to the regime, families who have relatives outside Iraq or in southern Iraq and those who have relatives in detention or executed are said to be the first targets of forced displacement," the report said. It added that officials from the Baath Party are given the power to move targeted families, often with as little as 24 hours' notice.
Today in Baghdad, the official Government newspaper Al Qadissiya called Mr. Van der Stoel an agent of American intelligence and Zionism who had been ordered "to spread lies and put out idiotic reports that no one will take seriously."
Iraq has told United Nations committees that it is fighting a rising crime wave brought on by sanctions. The Van der Stoel report challenges that explanation and also criticizes Iraq for not accepting for more than four years a Security Council plan allowing the limited sale of oil to raise money for food and medicine.
"Instead, the Government of Iraq decided to rely only on domestic production to meet the humanitarian needs of its people -- preferring to let innocent people suffer while the Government maneuvered to get sanctions lifted," the report says.
In another document issued today, the International Atomic Energy Agency submitted a six-month report on investigations into Iraq's nuclear program that found "no indication of prohibited materials, equipment or activities."
The Atomic Energy Agency's report said its monitoring activities would not only continue but would also be expanded and upgraded with new technology.
But the lack of any damaging new findings is likely to lead to another attempt by Russia and possibly by France and China as well to close the file on Iraq's nuclear case. Under requirements of the Security Council, all prohibited Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological weapons must be destroyed or accounted for, along with long-range missile delivery systems.

HEADLINE: 1998 Candidates Advertise Early And Expensively

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
Taking a lesson from the 1996 Presidential campaign, an array of candidates in this year's midterm elections has begun buying television advertising months earlier than usual, promising another election year likely to break spending records.
Gone are the days when candidates husbanded their resources for pre-primary or post-Labor Day advertising blitzes. Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Connecticut Republican who eked out a victory in 1996, spent close to $100,000 around New Year's on a television spot on her sponsorship of a health care bill. 
 Senator Harry M. Reid, Democrat of Nevada, went on the air a month ago with $350,000 worth of television advertising. And Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican whose popularity dropped with his stewardship of the Senate's Whitewater hearings, began broadcasting commercials upstate and on Long Island in May 1997, a full year and a half before Election Day.
The early commercials are not confined to the traditional big-money states with major television markets like California, New York and Illinois. Nor is it just the candidates who are taking to the airwaves. The Arkansas Democratic Party, for example, broadcast two television commercials in January attacking Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, on education and parole issues.
Strategists in both parties attribute the trend to President Clinton's decision in 1995 to mount the earliest, most intensive television campaign ever by an incumbent President. The Republicans never responded to the barrage of advertisements in the fall of 1995, which were paid for by the Democratic National Committee and focused on the budget battle between the President and the Republican Congress.
The cost of those advertisements led the Democrats into frenzied fund-raising that came back to haunt them amid accusations of questionable practices. Factions in the Clinton campaign argued over how successful the commercials were, but many consultants now believe that Mr. Clinton locked in his re-election victory during that period in 1995 by defining the Presidential race on his terms.
Now, in contests across the nation, candidates and their strategists are trying to duplicate that success.
"People do think that they are reading the Clinton playbook," said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic consultant. "And it's also fueling a great deal of fund-raising because people think they need to get the money early to get the ads done early. And that does not mean that you don't have to have the ads on late. It means you have to have the ads on early and late."
Fergus Cullen, the deputy campaign manager for Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, a Republican, said, "We certainly did notice the Clinton campaign's tactics of using early media to help solidify an early lead."
Mr. Rowland made his first television advertising purchase, worth $200,000, last October -- more than a year before Election Day -- for a spot on his proposal to provide health insurance for uninsured children.
For another set of wealthy challengers this year, the role model is less President Clinton than Steve Forbes, the magazine publisher who became a major force in the early Republican primaries through his television advertising. "There's definitely an 'if you have it, spend it' rule," said Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political and issue advocacy campaigns.
In California, Alfred A. Checchi, the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines who is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, began television advertising just before Thanksgiving for a June primary, the earliest of any candidate in the state's history. The standard Mr. Checchi set promises to lead to the most expensive state election campaign in the nation's history, with an estimated $20 million in television ads already purchased racked up in that one race alone.
In Illinois, John Schmidt, a losing contender for the Democratic nomination for governor, as well as Peter Fitzgerald, who won the Republican Senate primary, both put vast amounts of their own money into sustained television campaigns.
In several cases, those using television early are the incumbents, who traditionally have an easier time raising campaign money. The commercials showcase particular votes or initiatives or reintroduce themselves and their records.
"When an incumbent does media early, it's rather like sending out newsletters rather than running for office," said Dick Morris, the strategist who pushed Mr. Clinton to mount his own early television advertising. "He's shaping the perception of his incumbency."
Senator Reid of Nevada, in one of two commercials that first appeared a month ago, focused on the Federal Government's plan to create the nation's only high-level nuclear waste disposal site in Nevada. "I used my seat on the Appropriations Committee to help cut $30 million from the waste site budget," he says in the spot.
Governor Rowland's second television spot, "A Better Connecticut," was broadcast at the end of January and said the state's economy had improved under his stewardship.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication, said that the appearance of year-round campaign commercials raised the question of whether "campaign advertising has become a form of governance."
Another old truth of television advertising -- that when you go on the air, stay on the air -- is not always being followed this year.
"You can't go on the air nine months before the election and stay up -- unless you are Warren Buffett or Bill Gates," said Dave Karvelas, chief of staff to Representative Johnson of Connecticut. Instead, candidates are planning periodic bursts of commercials unless, like Mr. Checchi, they have fortunes to spend.
Some consultants are still dubious about the whole trend, particularly during an election cycle when the public seems tuned out of politics. "The fact that candidates want to run commercials early doesn't mean that voters want to watch them early," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "There's a risk of people just not paying attention."
Charles E. Cooke Jr., the editor of a nonpartisan political newsletter, noted that early television commercials were also in vogue in the 1986 midterm elections. "The fad then was to go on the air early and define yourself before your opponents defined you," Mr. Cooke said.
"A lot of people who did that in '86 became nonmembers in '87," he said, "because they spent their money too soon."

In Banking Mergers, Big Enough Doesn't Exist
The $60 billion BankAmerica-Nationsbank merger and $30 billion Banc One-First Chicago NBD merger that roiled the United States banking industry yesterday illustrate the intense pressure on the top 50 domestic banks to increase their size and reach.
It also suggests that the biggest banks believe the only way to flourish is to create an operation with a nationwide customer base. News Analysis. Page A1.

The Nationsbank-BankAmerica combination would create the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits and would have relationships with 30 percent of the households in the country, from Charlotte, N.C. to San Francisco. D10. 

In the credit card world, the Banc One-First Chicago NBD merger was the big headline because their combination will create the No. 2 credit card business behind Citibank. D10.
 
The investment banking subsidiaries of Nationsbank and BankAmerica are rivals. Now, Robertson Stephens and Montgomery Securities face the prospect of working together, which may not be easy. D11.
 
Gains at 3 Big Wall Street Firms
Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette all reported healthy gains in quarterly earnings on the strength of the booming stock market. The share prices in all three securities firms rose, partly on speculation they are prime targets in the current wave of mergers reshaping the financial services industry. D2.
 
Stocks Struggle to End Mixed
Despite two new huge bank mergers and a rally in the financial sector, stocks struggled to a mixed finish. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.44 points, to 9,012.30, its second close above 9,000. Some broader market indicators ended with slight losses. D13.
 
Treasury securities fell, hurt by speculation that the Bank of Japan had sold some of its holdings. The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose to 5.93 percent from 5.88. D13.
 
I.M.F. Sees Mixed Outlook
The I.M.F., in an assessment of world economies, said that while the United States was likely to ride out the remainder of the Asian financial crisis largely unscathed, the American stock and bond markets were increasingly vulnerable to a major fall. A9.
 
Gillette's New Shaving System
Gillette is expected to announce its largest product introduction ever today, its first new shaving system in nearly a decade. D8.

Anti-Smoking War of Words
An ambitious advertising campaign to discourage smoking among teen-agers begins this week in Florida, financed by the tobacco industry as part of a settlement reached last year with the state.

Abortion Exception in Algeria
Algeria, which bans abortion, responded to growing pressure from women's organizations by allowing abortion for women abducted and raped by militant Islamic rebels. As many as 1,600 young women have been abducted since 1994, according to Algerian officials. A6
 
Optimism on U.S. Economy
The I.M.F. said that the United States would probably ride out much of the Asia crisis, but that American markets were vulnerable to a major fall in the stock and bond markets. The assessment was contained in a survey of world economies, published as finance ministers from around the world were arriving in Washington to evaluate the effect of Asia's currency shocks. A9
 
Pentagon Warning on Court
The Pentagon warned more than 100 foreign military attaches that the proposed International Criminal Court, scheduled as a tribunal for gross human rights abuses or war crimes, could subject soldiers to frivolous or politically motivated investigations by a rogue prosecutor or an overzealous tribunal. For nearly four years, the United States has supported efforts to create such a Court. A11
 
Report on Botha Testimony
South Africa's leading news agency reported that former President P. W. Botha had finally agreed to appear before the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a day before he was to stand trial for refusing to obey repeated commission subpoenas. But truth commission officials denied a deal was final. A11
 
Nigerian Push in Sierra Leone
The Nigerian-led West African force that restored Sierra Leone's ousted President to power in March has launched an offensive to root out those who briefly supplanted him, aid workers said. The West African force was using tanks and jets in its drive against the remaining strongholds of the military junta and its rebel allies in the far east of the country. (Reuters)
 
Remains Linked to Bay of Pigs
A Pentagon official said he had found two bodies in Nicaragua that he believed to be those of anti-Castro Cuban pilots who crashed on their way to support the aborted 1961 invasion at the Bay of Pigs. The official, Bradley Adams of the Army's Central Identification Laboratory, told reporters in Managua that the excavation had uncovered human remains and personal effects. (Reuters)

Court Asked Not to Intervene
The Clinton Administration told the Supreme Court that there was no legal basis for granting requests for a stay of execution made by Paraguay and a native of Paraguay imprisoned in Virginia. The International Court of Justice has told the United States to "take all measures at its disposal" to stop the execution. A14
 
The Clintons' Tax Returns
The President and Mrs. Clinton gave $840,000 from the proceeds of Mrs. Clinton's best-selling book "It Takes A Village" to charity over the last two years, their tax returns show. The tax returns also showed that the Clintons had income of $569,511 and paid $91,964 in Federal income taxes. A16
 
Priorities for the Airlines
Vice President Al Gore will announce priorities for airline safety today, so that the airline industry and the F.A.A. can focus on the most important efforts, like more rigorous checks of engine parts, new equipment to help planes avoid flying into mountains and a new campaign to increase seat-belt use.

HEADLINE: Economics All-Star Says He Will Stay With Home Team, After All

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
One of the nation's most prominent economists, Robert J. Barro, has decided to back out of a highly publicized, exceptionally lucrative deal he had negotiated with Columbia University and will instead remain at Harvard University.
It is not clear what motivated Dr. Barro, 53, to change his mind weeks after he had, in a very public fashion, accepted Columbia's offer, which involved a pay package of nearly $300,000 and a wide range of benefits. 
 But according to colleagues and friends with whom he spoke yesterday, it appears to be just a question of cold feet.
"'My sense is that it was emotionally a big problem to make this move," said Elhanan Helpman, referring to Dr. Barro's earlier decision to leave Harvard. Dr. Barro, after all, had always professed to being quite happy there.
Professor Barro did not return telephone calls and E-mail seeking comment yesterday.
The mood at Harvard, which had not suffered a successful raid at a senior level from a rival university since 1979, was one of quiet vindication.
"Better a broken engagement than an unhappy marriage," Harvard's dean of faculty, Jeremy R. Knowles, said.
Dr. Barro's colleagues at Harvard, who had been stunned by his earlier decision to leave their top-ranked department for Columbia's department, which is ranked 14th, found themselves surprised by the professor once again.
"Robert is a very unusual guy," said Professor Helpman.
Professor Helpman recently left the University of Tel Aviv to join the Harvard department. "Everybody's happy here," he said.
Columbia, meanwhile, had just made its official announcement of Dr. Barro's arrival on the front page of The Columbia University Record, the official house organ.
Dr. Barro is a Chicago conservative with a libertarian streak who has written scholarly articles that are cited by other researchers as often as those of economists like Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas. He has also written for The Wall Street Journal and Business Week.
After Columbia spent months to engineer a deal attractive enough to lure Dr. Barrio to its campus on Morningside Heights in Manhattan, Harvard had made a counteroffer involving some sweetening of his contract and a new research center for him to direct.
At the time, Dr. Barro said that the counteroffer, presented to him personally by Harvard's president, Neil L. Rudinstine, was, if not too little, then too late. "If he had offered me in November what he did in February, I probably would have stayed," he said.
Still, Dr. Barro's last-minute change of heart was not a result of Harvard's making an 11th-hour effort to win him back. The terms of his deal to remain at Harvard are expected to be the same as they were in February.
At the same time, despite the storm of criticism of Professor Barro's deal from Columbia professors in departments other than economics, there is no sign that that Columbia had in any way begun to back away from the commitments it was making to lure Professor Barro.
Officials at Columbia University did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
But Professor Barro's decision to jilt the school is clearly a major embarrassment.
Professor Barro's rich deal with Columbia have been the subject of gossip within the economics profession since it was struck in mid-February and details were disclosed in The New York Times last week.
Columbia's administration has been besieged by complaints and inquiries from people in other departments who reacted not just to the record-breaking salary but also to the news that the economics department, as part of the deal, was getting five permanent tenured positions and one visiting professor at a time when salaries and positions were frozen in other departments.
Yesterday, the senior faculty members in the Harvard economics department were forwarded the following E-mail from Dean Knowles to the department chairman, Jeffrey G. Williamson:
"I am happy to let you know that Robert Barro has decided to remain at Harvard ("absolutely and unequivocally") on the terms that he and I had discussed in February. I have reported Robert's change of heart to the President. Please share this surprising and happy news with each of your colleagues."
Dean Knowles expressed sympathy for his counterparts at Columbia, saying, "I'm very glad, of course, that Professor Barro has decided to stay, even though I'm sorry that the departments at two institutions should have been on such a seesaw."

HEADLINE: Will Mayor Exit? Washington Wonders

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
For the last 20 years Washington has been consumed with the political fortunes of its artful Mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr.
But rarely has speculation over his viability in office grown as intense as it has this spring. 
 Mr. Barry, 62, who has served four terms since 1974, has not said whether he intends to seek a fifth four-year term this year, a delay that is fueling speculation that he will not challenge the four other Democrats who have entered the September primary.
The surest sign that Mr. Barry is seriously considering other options is his increasing willingness to acknowledge a life after governing, something he never did publicly before this year.
"A number of people are looking for opportunities for me," Mr. Barry said last week in his weekly news conference, discussing one of them, a college teaching job. "I've got two or three solid offers in six figures."
To the ears of many local residents and political analysts who have long followed Mr. Barry's career, that sounded like a retirement speech.
"He has never toyed with the public like this," said Mark Plotkin, a local political analyst. "I think he has decided that there is nothing left to prove. He came back, rising like the phoenix, in one of the greatest political comebacks of all time, and he could go out on a high -- although that's an unfortunate choice of words."
The reference is to the one interruption in Mr. Barry's colorful career as Mayor of the District of Columbia: a drug conviction and six-month prison term. The incident forever tarnished his image, and many residents, business leaders and Federal lawmakers now view him as the biggest obstacle to the return of power to locally elected officials and continuing economic growth.
Since its creation three years ago, a control board has in effect managed all aspects of city government, answering only to Congress. The Mayor has been left with nominal authority over city agencies, most of which are now run by a chief manager appointed by the control board.
The shift in power was a critical factor in turning chronic deficits into a $348 million surplus this year and a projected surplus of $196 million for next year. The control board is to shut down after the city has balanced its budget for four consecutive years.
Beyond the budget, other signs are just as encouraging for the future of Washington. Crime rates are falling. Housing sales are picking up.
But whether the trends continue once the control board shuts down could depend as much on a mayor's image and relationship with Congress as on policies. And some Federal lawmakers contend that someone other than Mr. Barry would give the city new advantages with Congress, including a long honeymoon.
"It could make all the difference in the world," said Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d, the Virginia Republican whose subcommittee on the District created the control board. "There is no question that a new mayor with a different agenda could achieve positive results in dealing with Capitol Hill. I think you would see a restoration of democratic rights to the city sooner and the likelihood of more money invested in the city."
"Ultimately," Mr. Davis added, "the control board is just a substitute for a bad mayor. It's a very ineffective way to do things."
John Tydings, president of the Washington Board of Trade, said many of the region's business leaders also predicted better times for the city under a new mayor.
"It goes back to the economic development aspect of the job," Mr. Tydings said. "A new mayor would improve the image of the city as the national capital and strengthen relations with Congress."
For his part, Mr. Barry remains unfazed by criticism and images of a city without him leading it. He contended last week that if he chose to run, he would have enough financial support and voters to prevail in a crowded primary.
"The winning part is not a factor," Mr. Barry said. "I know I could win."
As the Democratic nominee, he would probably face Carol Schwartz, a Republican member of the City Council whom he defeated in 1994.
And for those who say he would not run, "that's their problem, not mine," Mr. Barry said in a brief interview today. "I have plenty of time to decide." Rather, he said, his deliberations center on how best he might serve the city in the future. But that, too, is something he has never said openly before.
"He reminds me of longtime House Democrats who were committee chairmen and all of a sudden Republicans are in charge," Mr. Plotkin said.
"They don't find it fun anymore," he said. "I don't think the Mayor is having fun anymore, and I don't think he's going to run."

Indonesian Currency Gains Against Dollar

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The Indonesian rupiah climbed to its highest level against the United States dollar in two months during Asian trading yesterday as the market cautiously welcomed Indonesia's latest pact with the International Monetary Fund. The dollar was sold at 7,550 rupiah, its lowest level since Feb. 13. 
 The strengthening of the rupiah followed the publication last Friday of Indonesia's new 117-point I.M.F. program. After three weeks of negotiations, the two sides agreed to a plan to restructure Indonesia's private debt and a tough requirement to consolidate the nation's crippled banking sector. Given progress on carrying it out, the way is now clear for the I.M.F. to release to Indonesia its next portion of assistance funds.

HEADLINE: In the Rockies, Culture Knows How to Survive;
Intellectual Life on a Small Scale Gets More Attention Than Money

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: BOZEMAN, Mont.

 BODY:
One Saturday night at the Willson Auditorium on Main Street, a creaky 1,100-seat theater in a school that is the busiest entertainment venue in this growing Rocky Mountain town, the attraction was the Chord Rustlers, a local singing group that, with 44 members, represents Montana's largest chapter of S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A.
The initials, of course, are those of the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America. And as the Chord Rustlers, ages 12 through 85, estimably harmonized their way through "Chattanooga Choo Choo" and "Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie," it seemed as if Bozeman itself was expressing its artistic heart: simple, consonant, old-fashioned. 
 But Bozeman's cultural life is not quite as wholesome and uncomplicated as all that. Indeed, in a state where the arts receive scant support from the government, where private philanthropic foundations hardly operate and where there is not a single Forbes 500 company to stand behind its local arts organizations, this city of about 35,000 residents (including the 10,000 or so students of Montana State University) is home to a vibrant arts community. It may be small but it is stubbornly prominent.
And perhaps most significant, artists here of every stripe speak of a regional voice, of art that is Bozemanesque, characterized by a reflection of Montana's vast landscape.
"When I came here I was writing in a more compressed manner," said Eric Funk, a composer who moved here from Portland, Ore., in 1986 and whose opera "Pamelia" had a concert performance at Carnegie Hall three years later. "Now my sonorities are more spread out. I'm writing over six and seven octaves.
"It's the land, I think. Two years ago I did a residency in Brandenburg, Germany, and the people there said to me: Your music, it's just so slow-moving. And I think that pace, too, comes from living here."
Unlikely as it sounds, in a place where ranching and outdoor tourism are the primary economic forces, Bozeman offers a good example of the survivalist mentality that one finds among artists in cities throughout the country, where, like desert flowers, the arts manage to bloom without the presumed-to-be-necessary life-sustaining elements of a national spotlight and available money.
"If you put all the arts organizations and activities together, you'd have the fifth largest employer in town," said John Barsness, the executive director of Montana Arts, a nonprofit group that provides administrative services to seven arts organizations in Bozeman.
"The arts are alive and well here, flourishing in spite of the politicians, and in spite of the fact that we live on the edge of the fund-raising universe. There are 50,000 private foundations in the country, half of them significant. Of those, fewer than 40 fund in Montana in any given year, and that covers social services and the environment, not just the arts."
Indeed, Bozeman is far better known as a gateway to the outdoors. The Big Sky ski area is nearby, and Yellowstone National Park is less than a two-hour drive away. And it is growing largely because it has been discovered by wealthy second-home buyers from California and elsewhere, people who tend, Mr. Barsness said, to support the arts where they've come from but not where they've just arrived. The most prominent example, he said, is Ted Turner, whose huge ranch is within an hour of the city. "He's been very generous about the environment. But I can't tell you anyone in the arts who's received a dime from him. So that's our challenge locally, to develop new audiences in a seasonal population that has its allegiances elsewhere."
Nonetheless, with much of the philanthropic support coming from local businesses, the ballet company, in its 14th season, runs a school with 150 students. The Intermountain Opera is set to stage "La Traviata" next month, its 20th anniversary production. The Bozeman Symphony, with 75 professional and amateur musicians (and an equivalent-size choir) plays a season of five concerts with nearly 800 subscribers. And all have survived in spite of having to perform at the Willson.
 
Acoustics Frustrate Strings and Soloists
"Acoustically it's pretty miserable," said Marilyn Traez, executive director of the symphony, which is in its 30th season. "The strings and soloists can't hear each other. Without a new hall, we're limited as to how much better we can get. But raising the funds for a performing arts center has never been done in Montana, and I don't know that we're all that close."
At the Museum of the Rockies, Bozeman boasts a world-class collection of dinosaur bones. The city is home to dozens of painters and sculptors (including Deborah Butterfield), musicians (including the baritone Pablo Elvira) and writers (including the novelist and naturalist David Quammen).
Two independent bookstores sit within a block of each other on Main Street. The Vigilante Theater, a nonprofit company now in its 17th season, produces only original work, typically on regional themes, and often tours the state. Its most recent production, "Wuf!," a musical about the controversial program of reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone Park, played six performances in Bozeman and is to be performed in Missoula, home of the University of Montana, and smaller towns.
Bozeman also provides an enthusiastic audience for pop music, fueled by KGLT-FM, one of the nation's few remaining free-form alternative music stations; Vootie Productions, a local presenter since 1991, put on 45 shows last year, including Phish and the Indigo Girls, for more than 3,000 people at the University Field House.
And in contrast to the practice in many more urban places, the schools continue to maintain substantial programs in art and music. "There's just a tremendous number of kids involved in music programs," said Mr. Funk, the composer, who supplements his income by conducting the Helena Symphony, two hours away, and by teaching piano.
"This is a great place to write," Mr. Funk continued. "The thing I miss is the collegial interaction, being among people who really understand how to read a score and can talk about it. But it's not a bad trade-off for the wide open spaces."
The trade-off is one that many artists in Bozeman acknowledge.
"It's not art about people here so much as it is about place," Steve Kelly, a painter, responded when asked if there was a vision that united local artists. "It's a landscape-based esthetic. I don't think you can make art here without having that as your focus."
Clarice Dreyer, a sculptor who operates a combination coffeehouse, flower shop and art gallery with Mr. Kelly, agreed. "The land is more important to me than having museums to go to," she said. "I used to go to New York to see shows a lot more. Now I'd just rather take a drive and look around."
Even nonvisual artists find the terrain inspirational.
"That's what sustains the arts activity -- the artist's relationship to nature," said Mary Overlie, a dancer and choreographer who grew up here and has just returned after living in New York and Europe for three decades. "My choreographic work is extremely spatial. A lot of slowness and silence. No throwing things at the audience but making them observe. That's very much Montana, which kind of turns everybody into a tourist."
But vast spaces and isolation have their drawbacks. Audiences, for example, are harder to gather. Conservatism is the rule. (A year ago a billboard by Mr. Kelly in downtown Helena criticizing the slaughter of buffalo who wander out of Yellowstone became a local political issue.) Ann Bates, artistic director of the Montana Ballet, laments that it is almost impossible to find male dancers.
"It's so hard for artists here because the population base is so small," Ms. Overlie said. "I don't know if I can say that the population around here is friendly to the arts."
 
Anonymous Donor Finances a Haven
And for artists there is limited opportunity for the kind of society that often fosters intellectual creativity. One solution was the Emerson Cultural Center, established in an old school building off Main Street, when a community group raised the money to buy it from the city in 1992. The cost was not quite $500,000, more than half of which was provided by an anonymous community donor. The center now sponsors educational programs, presents music and dance performances from visiting troupes and has a 700-seat theater, as well as work space for more than 40 artists, a couple of cafes -- including Mr. Kelly and Ms. Dreyer's -- and a handful of galleries.
One gallery houses the work of artists sponsored by Montana Indian Contemporary Arts, a nonprofit organization that promotes painting and other artwork on the state's seven Indian reservations and by members of its 10 tribes. The state itself is not exactly diverse -- few Indians live in Bozeman, which is overwhelmingly white -- and MICA, as the organization is known, has obstacles other than the normal ones faced by Montana artists.
 
'A Little Better Than Most Places'
"Living here is a challenge," said Susan Stewart Medicine Horse, the executive director of MICA. "It can be pretty racist, and we live with that. Bozeman's a little better than most places, but it's there."
The one-room gallery contains both traditional and abstract contemporary work by Indians from the Gros Ventre, Blackfoot, Oglala Lakota and Crow tribes, including paintings by Mrs. Medicine Horse. She and her husband, Tyler Medicine Horse, whose specialty is the re-creation of traditional Indian art objects with contemporary materials, plan to create a performance and installation piece in New York City on April 17, at 6 P.M. at the American Indian Community House Gallery, 404 Lafayette Street, near East Fourth Street in the East Village. They will also speak about their work at the National Museum of the American Indian.
That Bozeman accommodates a wide range of artistic expression is evident every Tuesday night, when, almost next door to the MICA gallery at the Emerson, the Chord Rustlers rehearse. It's an occasion resembling a lodge meeting, where men like Russ Ludeman, a charter member of the group, which was founded in 1975, come for camaraderie. Mr. Ludeman, 61, sings in two quartets, the Doodle Dandies and the Par Fours.
"The Par Fours are a bunch of old guys," he said. "Our cumulative age is 270. But we put on a good show and people like it." Of course, anyone doubting that the Chord Rustlers are hip in Bozeman need only speak to another member, Jake Bloxham, an 18-year-old movie projectionist who wears a bandanna on his head and three earrings in each ear. "I'll tell you one thing," he said. Since I started doing this I haven't had any trouble finding a date."

HEADLINE: Guggenheim Announces Record Gift, $50 Million

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum announced yesterday that it had received a cash pledge of $50 million from Peter B. Lewis, the chairman and chief executive of the Progressive Corporation, a Cleveland-based insurance company. It is one of the largest cash gifts made to any visual arts institution and the largest the Guggenheim, founded in 1937, has ever received.
"This is a huge amount of money," said Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director. "It sends a signal that the trustees are supporting this museum in an impressive way." 
 Mr. Lewis, who has been a Guggenheim trustee since 1993, had already committed $10 million of the $50 million he is giving to the museum two years ago when the Guggenheim began its $200 million capital campaign. He is to give the museum $10 million each year for the next four years.
Mr. Lewis's initial $10 million gift paid for the restoration of the theater under the museum's famous Fifth Avenue rotunda, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Work was completed in 1996, and it has been named the Peter B. Lewis Theater. The rest of his initial gift helped establish an endowment for educational programs related to the use of the theater.
The $40 million that was pledged to the Guggenheim yesterday will be used solely for the Guggenheim's endowment, which will now be nearly $100 million, museum officials said.
"I think the Guggenheim is a fascinating and important dream," Mr. Lewis said in a telephone interview yesterday. "It's now a worldwide institution, and institutions of this kind should be fostered."
His generosity toward the Guggenheim has helped encourage other trustees to increase their giving too. Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon and president of the Guggenheim's board, had committed $20 million to the capital campaign and just increased his gift to $25 million. Since Mr. Lewis's gift, other trustees have followed, with a total of $8 million in new pledges. Mr. Krens said that the Guggenheim had pledges in hand totaling $144 million.
The latest promised gifts are going into the endowment. "Any great institution has to have a solid endowment," Mr. Krens said. "It gives you a level of security and makes you feel stronger all the way around." Mr. Lewis said he became involved with the Guggenheim in the early 1990's when he was working on the design of a house with Frank Gehry, the Los Angeles architect who designed the new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. It was Mr. Gehry who introduced Mr. Lewis to Mr. Krens. "Frank wanted me to meet Tom because he thought we were kindred spirits," he said. "And that's how it all started."
Mr. Krens's vision of creating an international network of Guggenheims initially drew more criticism than praise. Since arriving at the Guggenheim in 1988, he has been accused by some of treating the museum as if it were a global corporation, with little regard to exhibitions.
Back then there were only two Guggenheims, the famous Fifth Avenue building and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. Under Mr. Krens's direction, the museum opened a branch in the heart of SoHo in 1992. He is responsible for the $58 million renovation and expansion of the Fifth Avenue building and he masterminded the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, which opened in the Basque region of Spain in October and has drawn crowds ever since. Attendance has already reached a half a million visitors, more than doubling the museum's expectations. In November the Guggenheim also opened a 7,000-square-foot exhibition space in Berlin on the ground floor of the newly renovated Deutsche Bank on the Unter den Linden, near the Brandenburg Gate.
With these new museums has come new art for the Guggenheim's permanent collections. The Guggenheim Bilbao recently acquired Robert Rauschenberg's "Barge," from 1962-1963, which it bought in a 50-50 partnership of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Guggenheim Foundation in New York. Meanwhile, Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin has shown its first site-specific work, James Rosenquist's "Swimmer in the Econo-mist," a room-size mural that will be owned by the Guggenheim Foundation and Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin.
"It's one thing to say you're going to do something; it's another thing to do it," Mr. Krens said. "This gift should remove any doubt people had about the Guggenheim."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Securities Rise Slightly As Inflation Remains in Control

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities rose modestly yesterday, after another report showed that inflation remained in check.
The gains were constrained, however, by the lingering concerns prompted by recent remarks from a Federal Reserve official who suggested that the Asian economic turmoil, which had been expected to help keep inflation under control by slowing growth, might have less effect on the United States than originally expected. 
 The 30-year bond rose 11/32, to a price of 103 5/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.90 percent, from 5.92 percent on Monday.
Bonds were lifted by the Labor Department's report that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged in March and that even the so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up only one-tenth of 1 percent.
Donald Fine, the chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management, noted that even on a year-to-year basis, the overall index was up only 1.4 percent, with the core rate up only 2.1 percent.
Investors in the bond market are encouraged by signs of lower prices because inflation erodes the value of their holdings.
The data point to growth with low inflation, a scenario that suggests that the Fed may continue to be able to keep interest rates at current levels.
Still, the market continued to have jitters from comments last week by Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, who said that the economy's "performance is exceptional but unsustainable," suggesting that any slowdown generated by Asia's financial crisis may have arrived too late to ward off an increase in interest rates by the Fed.

HEADLINE: More Merger Mania

 BODY:
BankAmerica of California proposed this week to merge with Nationsbank of North Carolina to form the country's largest bank chain, spanning the continent and serving almost half the states. Banc One of Ohio proposed to join with First Chicago. These colossal marriages, which follow last week's proposed union of Citicorp and Travelers, raise two questions. Are small banks doomed and, if so, need anyone care?
One potential problem bears watching -- whether the mergers will threaten service to low-income neighborhoods. The outcome is within the control of regulators. The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to serve poor neighborhoods. To the extent that mergers make banks profitable, mergers also make it easier for banks to meet their C.R.A. obligations. 
 Otherwise, there seems little reason to worry. The three mergers pose no threat to most consumers because none would dominate any financial product or region. Even BankAmerica-Nationsbank will control about 8 percent of bank deposits, not nearly enough to dictate interest rates.
The economics of installing computerized information and other administrative systems mean that big banks will outclass small banks in important ways. But community banks say they charge lower fees for many services and still turn a profit. If so, they have nothing to fear. Customers will search out low-cost providers. If it turns out that the boast is idle, or that bank customers crave the no-fee national A.T.M.'s and other services that large banks can provide, then small banks will disappear.
What the mergers do suggest is that the C.E.O.'s of major chains are itching to test whether bigger is still better. After Congress legalized interstate banking, regional banks gobbled up statewide chains. Then regional banks expanded further into superregional giants like Nationsbank. The next logical step is to create a national customer base over which to spread huge administrative costs. If profitable, then a half dozen or so national bank chains will before long fight for business across the country.
It is possible that merger mania in banking may turn out to be as evanescent as the merger mania that hit industrial America in the 1980's. Customers should now sit back and watch the games unfold, confident that they have nothing to fear from huge banks as long as there are other huge banks lurking in the same neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Tough Workfare Rules Used As Way to Cut Welfare Rolls

SERIES: DOES WORKFARE WORK?: Last of four articles.

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
By restoring the luster of the work ethic and providing a path to real jobs, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani often says, his workfare program has played the central part in the dramatic reduction of New York City's welfare rolls. The numbers he cites are stark and indisputable: the rolls have dropped more than 30 percent in the last three years, to 797,000 from 1.16 million.
But an examination of workfare shows that the program's role in that decline often has little to do with offering a route into the job market. In many ways, workfare has become welfare's back door, allowing the city to trim thousands of people from the rolls each month for violating its work rules. 
 In the first eight months of 1997, about 16 percent of workfare participants -- or an average of 6,100 out of 36,000 people each month -- were cut from the rolls for infractions that ranged from showing up late to refusing a work assignment.
Precisely how much of the overall drop in the rolls can be attributed to such sanctions is not known. The city does not track the fluid movement of individuals through the system -- on and off the rolls and often back on again, sometimes more than once in the space of a single year.
Even so, welfare experts in and out of the administration agree that the sanctions have had a significant downsizing effect. Underlying the numbers, though, is a fierce debate over interpretation:
To the Mayor and his aides, sanctions are used sensibly and appropriately. Even so, the process is meant to be tough: a big stick is needed, they say, to teach the discipline of work, of getting up in the morning, every morning, and showing up at a job on time.
But advocates for the poor argue that the city has overzealously enforced often technical rules without sufficient regard to the lives and dignity of the truly needy -- but with considerable attention to the political benefits of trimmer welfare rolls. The sanctions process, they say, has created a sizeable churning of the rolls, in which thousands of people are dropped each month, only to return later.
The advocates point out that when recipients get state hearings on their sanctions, they win two-thirds of the time. This means that while most remain off the rolls, about a quarter of the nearly 6,100 sanctioned each month -- about 1,400 -- were reinstated after filing appeals. And many more reapplied at the end of their punishment periods -- generally three months but as many as six -- though the number who actually returned to the rolls is not known.
The aggressive use of sanctions is hardly limited to New York's workfare program, which Mr. Giuliani vastly expanded three years ago. Whether they use workfare or, more commonly, programs that stress job training and placement in private industry, welfare officials across the country have stepped up their use of sanctions as pressure to move people off the rolls has increased.
"In general," said Demetra Smith Nightingale, director of welfare research at the Urban Institute in Washington, "caseworkers are using sanctions more than they used to because time limits mean that there's now more at stake if they don't get people into the job market."
Of course, the reasons for the drop in New York's welfare rolls go beyond sanctions.
Some who leave welfare do get real jobs, but available evidence indicates that they make up a small fraction. A recent state survey found that fewer than a third make more than $100 on the books in the first three months after leaving the rolls. The survey did not distinguish between full- and part-time jobs, nor did it take into account people who were working off the books, were self-employed or moved away.
At the same time, workfare -- or, more precisely, the prospect of having to participate in workfare -- has driven many people off welfare without finding jobs. To these people, it is more appealing to rely on off-the-books jobs, to move in with friends or relatives or to otherwise turn to others to get by, say city officials and advocates for the poor.
Not only has welfare become easier to lose, it has become harder to get. Since the city adopted a tough new screening process, the rejection rate for those applying for aid has doubled, to 54 percent in 1997 from 27 percent in 1994.
The Mayor says the new screening procedures have helped weed out thousands of welfare cheats who would give false addresses or hide other sources of income. But some advocates say that, for many people, the new admissions rules and the sanctions have turned public assistance from a full-time program into a part-time one -- with part of the year spent on the rolls and part spent trying to get on or waiting out a penalty.
"It's like musical chairs, where there are 9 chairs but 12 people," said Liz Krueger, associate director of the nonprofit Community Food Resource Center. "The real number of people needing welfare is still 12, but the caseload is only 9."
 
The Sanctions
Penalties Increase As Workfare Grows
Enrique Segarra Sr. was told he would lose his benefits about a year ago because he was half an hour late on the first day of his workfare assignment. He said he thought he had allowed enough time for his three-fare trip -- from bus to subway to another bus.
But when he arrived at the Bronx Sanitation Department garage at 7:30 A.M., the supervisor wouldn't listen to his explanations and sent him home with instructions not to return. Two weeks later, he was notified that the process to cut off his welfare benefits had begun because he had violated workfare rules by arriving late without a written excuse.
At a state appeals hearing, Mr. Segarra produced bus schedules proving he could not have gotten to the garage any earlier, and the city withdrew its plan to cut him off.
City officials argue that the penalties are a tool for teaching the importance of work and for rooting out those who are unwilling to work for their benefits.
"We have a basic social contract that says that for people who are going to seek benefits, the government has the right to ask for something in return," said Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser to the Mayor. "So if someone is not willing to participate, then the government's obligation to provide benefits is released as well."
That philosophy led the city to expand the use of sanctions as it expanded workfare in early 1995. City statistics for years prior to 1996 were not available, but since the vast majority of New York State residents on workfare live in New York City, a rough calculation can be done with statewide figures. Those figures, from the State Department of Social Services, show that the number of workfare sanctions doubled in the first fiscal year of the expansion, 1995, to 28,119, from 14,856 the previous fiscal year.
In the calendar year 1996, for which city figures are available, there were 82,538 sanctions issued in New York City alone. The number appears to have decreased slightly in 1997: in the first eight months of the year, 49,568 sanctions were issued; extrapolated for the whole year, that would work out to about 75,000.
To advocates for the poor, the number of participants who get their benefits restored on appeal suggests that the sanctions are often issued unfairly.
Even as the overall number of sanctions dropped in 1997, the number of appeals filed in the entire year went up 17 percent, to 45,239 from 38,431, according to the state. And of the 24,845 appeals in which a hearing was held in the entire year, more than two-thirds -- 16,673 -- went against the city, roughly the same percentage as the year before. (The rest of the cases never got to a hearing; some people simply disappear from the system, while others opt to wait out the penalty period.)
For single adults, sanctions range from three to six months without any benefits. After the penalty period, they must undergo the newly rigorous application process. But mothers are treated differently: They lose only their share of the welfare check, while their children's benefits continue. And they are given a chance to get a first-time sanction lifted by complying with the work requirement; subsequent sanctions result in an automatic three to six months without benefits.
The opportunity to cancel a first-time sanction by complying was intended to be more lenient than a fixed penalty. But the policy has actually left more than 20,000 welfare mothers in what city officials call "sanction limbo." For while single adults can reapply after a penalty period, mothers must comply or face an open-ended penalty.
To advocates for the poor, this imposes an unequal burden on the mothers who have good reasons for avoiding workfare. To the Giuliani administration, though, many of these mothers are taking unfair advantage of the system, since they continue to receive benefits for their children. That's why the Mayor is pushing Gov. George E. Pataki to toughen the penalties by cutting off the children's checks as well.
The reasons for punishment vary, but city officials and welfare advocates agree that most sanctions are meted out to workers who never show up, show up late or call in sick without providing documentation. Some workfare participants have been cut off because their school schedules, or their children's, have interfered with workfare assignments or because they say they misunderstood the city's procedures or notices.
Workfare handbooks and assignment sheets plainly state that workers can lose their benefits if they do not call a supervisor before their reporting time if they will be late or absent. Workers are told that acceptable excuses for absences include holidays, illnesses, a family emergency, jury duty and employment interviews. They are also told not to bother to return to work without a written excuse.
The city contends that these work rules are fair, and that it enforces them evenhandedly.
"If people have a good reason to be excused, they are excused," Mr. Coles said. "And if there are instances of sanctions that are inappropriate, we try to correct it right away."
But welfare recipients and advocates for the poor say that some people lose their benefits because supervisors enforce work rules so rigidly that they would be unusual in the private sector or elsewhere in the public sector.
Ian F. Feldman, a Legal Aid Society lawyer in the Bronx who has represented scores of workfare participants, said medical documentation was a common problem because welfare recipients seldom have regular doctors.
"If you were sick and you didn't go to the doctor that same day and get a note, you're finished," he said. "But not even a person with the best health care goes to the doctor for everything little thing."
At the same time, the advocates say, others are cut off because the system cannot deal with the complicated realities of their lives.
Kathleen Parks, for example, lost her benefits when she stopped showing up at her workfare assignment as a clerk for the Parks Department in March 1996 because, she contended, an ex-boyfriend was stalking her at work.
Ms. Parks, who is 43, said in an interview that co-workers had tried to protect her from the ex-boyfriend, who screamed obscenities and hurled bottles at her when she left work. But with time sheets showing her absences, the city quickly closed her case.
She lost her first appeal because she had nothing but her word in her defense. At a second hearing, she was represented by a lawyer, who got her an order of protection and presented it to the judge along with her conscientious work record. Nine months after Ms. Parks was dropped from the rolls, the judge reinstated her, with back benefits, writing that the documents proved "her refusal to participate was not willful or without good cause."
She has not been reassigned to workfare since she was reinstated.
 
The Alternatives
Avoiding the Stigma By Leaving the Rolls
Workfare has also had a less direct effect on the size of the welfare rolls: It has contributed to what welfare experts call a "smoke-out effect," pushing people off welfare whether they have jobs or not.
In some cases, welfare recipients who were already working off the books have decided to leave the rolls, experts say. There are no reliable estimates of how many people fall into that category, but welfare experts say that because it is virtually impossible to survive on welfare benefits alone, a significant number of welfare recipients probably rely on other sources of income.
Many others have either gone out and found work or have turned to friends and relatives for help rather than deal with the stigma of welfare or a city bureaucracy that they believe to be hostile.
For instance, Alexa Perez, a sophomore at Hunter College and mother of two little boys, decided she would go without her share of her family's benefits when the city told her she had no choice but to report to a maintenance job at a housing project on the Lower East Side. She decided that a workfare assignment that lasted from 9:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. five days a week would interfere with her school and child care schedules too much to be worth the $80 a month she would lose.
Since then, she has started working 30 hours a week at a clothing store near school, where she makes $200 a week.
"My grades have suffered a little, but you have to do what you have to do," she said, adding that she would not consider reapplying for welfare.
Not only has the Giuliani administration's welfare message pushed large numbers of people off the rolls, some experts say; the strong economy has allowed some of those who have left welfare to either find work or rely on acquaintances who have benefited from the good times.
But Irv Garfinkel, a professor at Columbia University's School of Social Work, said the economy had probably been less of a factor in New York than elsewhere in the country because the city's 9.2 percent unemployment rate is still relatively high.
The Giuliani administration has not cooperated with Dr. Garfinkel's request to study what happens to people when they leave welfare. (City officials have also refused to provide information on former welfare recipients to The New York Times. The Times sued, and last week, a State Supreme Court justice ordered the city to release the information; the city is expected to appeal.)
Dr. Garfinkel, though, has a theory that falls somewhere in between the Mayor's and the advocates' versions of reality.
"My guess is that about one third of the people already had jobs and are managing fine without welfare," he said. "Another third are getting jobs, which is the Mayor's story, and the other third can't get it together and the changes have made it impossible to function in the system, and that's the advocates' story."
 
Does Workfare Work?
 
SUNDAY -- An uncertain road to a real job.
 
MONDAY -- A low-cost city labor force.
 
YESTERDAY -- The scramble for child care.
 
TODAY -- Trimming the rolls: Tough or too tough?

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index Flat in March

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
Consumer prices were unchanged last month while the value of retail sales fell unexpectedly, the Government reported today.
Consumer prices have been flat in two of the last three months. The tame inflation rate affected the sales data because "businesses can't raise prices -- and in some cases they're cutting them," Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said. That cut into the value of retail sales even though the volume of goods being sold is rising about 3 percent monthly, he said. 
 Price growth was held in check during March by the fourth consecutive monthly drop in energy prices, the Labor Department said. The core inflation rate, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs, rose one-tenth of 1 percent in March.
In February, prices had increased one-tenth of 1 percent over all and three-tenths of 1 percent after food and energy costs were removed.
As for the retail report, the Commerce Department said that sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in March. At the same time, though, it revised February's sales increase to seven-tenths of 1 percent, up from the gain of half a percent reported initially.
Low unemployment and rising incomes suggest people have money to spend, so March's sales decline might have been nothing more than a "natural pause" for the economy, said Gary Thayer, an economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
The biggest news in the consumer price report was a 1.2 percent drop in energy prices, which account for about 10 percent of the price index over all. Energy costs may begin rising, however. Gasoline and other energy prices have been increasing so far in April.
Food prices were unchanged last month and tobacco prices declined 2.6 percent following a rise of 2.9 percent in February. Transportation service costs fell six-tenths of 1 percent, housing costs rose two-tenths of 1 percent, recreation costs grew four-tenths of 1 percent and the cost of medical care rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
Prices for personal computers and supplies fell 2.8 percent in March.
In its retail report, the Commerce Department said sales of big-ticket goods, including autos, appliances and furniture, fell four-tenths of 1 percent during March.
When auto sales were excluded, March's sales increased one-tenth of 1 percent. Sales of cars and light trucks fell 2.8 percent in March from a year earlier, as bigger discounts from auto makers did little to bring consumers into showrooms.
An unusually late Easter may have also caused some consumers to postpone holiday purchases until April, said William Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Home-Grown Giant Of Central America

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR

 BODY:
Inside, the main terminal at Comalapa Airport here is crowded with business people, tourists and visiting Salvadoran-Americans scrambling to make their flights. Out on the tarmac, TACA airline workers are busy painting new planes with the company's new logo: five golden macaws flying in unison.
These are boom times for commercial aviation throughout Latin America, and TACA is one of the main beneficiaries. Already the dominant force in a Central American market that is growing 8 percent a year, El Salvador's energetic flag carrier is expanding into the Caribbean, seeking Washington's approval of a code-sharing agreement with American Airlines and increasing its presence on lucrative routes to and from the United States, where capacity has been struggling to keep up with demand. 
In 1997, in fact, air traffic between North America and the rest of the hemisphere surpassed that on routes to Europe for the second consecutive year. Airline executives think that explosive growth will continue for several years: since President Clinton signed a regional open skies agreement in Costa Rica last May, the number of seats on flights between the United States and Central America has increased 40 percent.
With the end of the wars that racked the region in the 1980's, tourism is resuming and the large numbers of Central American immigrants in the United States are able to visit their homelands safely. In response to that growing demand, Delta Air Lines this month started daily nonstop service from Atlanta to four Central American capitals and United has begun a daily nonstop flight from Chicago to Guatemala City.
For TACA -- shorthand for Transportes Aereos Centro Americanos -- that means more head-to-head competition with some of the giants of the industry on what could be less than favorable terms. As a relatively small carrier, the company benefits from neither the economies of scale nor the name recognition of United States rivals.
Until now, "we've been fortunate to be in the right place at the right time," Roberto Kriete, TACA's board chairman, said in an interview at company headquarters here. "Continental, Delta and United are all aiming their heavy guns at Central America, but I think we have a formula and a strategy that can make things work and enable us to survive in what promises to be a time of tremendously intensified competition."
Less than two decades ago, amid wars in much of Central America, TACA International Airlines was a tiny carrier, with revenue of $18 million and initials that were said to stand for "take a chance airlines" because of its irregular schedule and suspect equipment. Today, the privately held company generates $600 million a year in revenue and has earned a reputation as an efficient and scrappy carrier.
"You've got to give these guys credit," Robert C. Booth, director of Aviation Management Services, a Miami-based consultant, said. "They're not from the old school -- air force generals trying to run an airline. They're very bright businessmen who know what they are doing and were quick to jump on the privatization bandwagon when Central American governments moved that way."
Founded in 1931 by a pilot from New Zealand, TACA has over the last decade bought controlling stakes in competing airlines in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua and opened a subsidiary in Honduras. They are, respectively, Lacsa, Aviateca, Nica and TACA de Honduras.
The resulting five-carrier alliance has permitted Grupo TACA to centralize management, maintenance, purchasing, reservations, insurance and accounting, and to provide a common logo and uniforms. The group, which has nearly 5,000 employees, flies to more than 40 cities in 19 countries from Canada to Chile.
On April 20, the airline will take another step forward when it begins daily nonstop service from New York City and Washington to San Salvador. TACA's larger United States competitors, however, predict that their upstart rival will find it harder to maintain a foothold in the American market.
"They're a nice little regional carrier, run by very good people," said Greg Brenneman, president of Continental Airlines, which plans to begin daily nonstop service from Newark to San Jose, Costa Rica, this summer. "But they're small, and their product quality is largely not the same" as that of the big United States carriers.
Ben Baldanza, TACA's managing director, said, though, that the airline sees itself as "the real Latin American carrier," offering "the sort of warmth, sensitivity and hospitality" that the growing number of Latin Americans traveling to and from the United States often complain is lacking in their big northern rivals. "We understand the culture because we are the culture, not because we have gone to training classes," Mr. Baldanza added.
TACA has been adept at finding and exploiting new niches in which to operate. Late last month, for instance, the company's new joint venture, Inter-Cuba S.A., began operations, flying routes among six Cuban cities and offering domestic passengers an alternative to the state-run Cubana Airlines.
TACA officials are also planning to expand flights elsewhere in the Caribbean, with service on the lucrative New York-Santo Domingo route, in which American Airlines faces no competition from a Dominican carrier. It is to begin as soon as a Dominican subsidiary can be organized. TACA already flies to Santo Domingo from Havana and Caracas and, since the fall, to Havana from Toronto.
In anticipation of increased service, TACA and two South American partners signed a multibillion-dollar purchase agreement with Airbus Industrie last month. Joining forces with Lan Chile and TAM, a Brazilian airline, TACA ordered 88 A320's and put in an option for 87 more, at what Mr. Booth describes as "a substantial discount off the sticker price."
But the outcome of another crucial element in TACA's plans, the proposed code-sharing deal with American, is not so clear. Other carriers have objected to the arrangement, arguing that it would give TACA and American a combined market share of 65 to 80 percent to every Central American destination. After more than a year, the United States Transportation Department has yet to approve the tie-in.
"It's like Coke and Pepsi coming together, and all of a sudden it costs two bucks to take a drink," Mr. Brenneman of Continental said. "We definitely believe it's anticompetitive and in the end hurts the customer, and we are stringently opposing it."
TACA officials argue that the delay sends a discouraging message to other Latin American countries that are trying to negotiate open skies agreements with the United States. As they see it, established carriers like American, Continental and United already have broad access to the Latin American market, and their Latin American competitors merely want reciprocity.
"I view it as a mistake for the United States to have made TACA a guinea pig," Mr. Kriete said. "In order for us to compete in a global market, we need strategic alliances. All the other Latin American carriers are looking at our experience and saying 'be careful.' "
Additional open skies agreements are important not only to TACA but also to relative newcomers like Delta, which has acquired a 35 percent stake in Aeroperu to bolster its advance into Latin America. "Open skies marks a turning point for us because it allows us to fly to cities where we can see that the profit margins are very good at a time of phenomenal growth," said Rudi Forster, general manager of Delta's Latin America division.
On its home turf, TACA has also faced recent criticism. Legislators and travel agents hoping to stimulate tourism complain that TACA, the largest private employer in Central America, is able to keep fares at an artificially high level and benefits from a cozy relationship with the Salvadoran Government.
Last month, for instance, Copa, the Panamanian airline, complained when Salvadoran officials withdrew permission for it to add a second daily flight here. The reason given was that increased competition "puts in danger the millions that TACA is investing in El Salvador," according to Government documents supplied to reporters.
"It's hard to see where TACA ends and the Government begins," a diplomat here said. "There are very close ties between the two."
TACA executives dismiss such complaints as jealous carping that "goes with the territory," as Mr. Baldanza puts it. More important, Mr. Kriete argues, is TACA's commitment to the region in good times and bad, its ability to thrive despite the fact "there is no equity market in Central America," in contrast to recent arrivals who could just as easily withdraw if a downturn comes.
"We can't go anywhere else," Mr. Kriete said. "We're here to stay. Our future depends on it."

HEADLINE: The Old Tax Dodge;
While the Affluent May Lead the Way, Others Eagerly Follow

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
You cheated a little on your taxes, right? Join the club.
As millions of Americans prepare to drop their tax returns in the mail tonight -- 11th-hour filers make up perhaps a fifth of the nation's 174 million taxpayers -- there are mounting questions about just how much fibbing is going on. 
 While there are no official data, a number of economists and tax preparers say that tax cheating is on the rise. And, significantly, the Government trusts ordinary wage earners far less than it does wealthier people who earn significant income from selling investments at a profit.
Since 1994, in fact, affluent taxpayers have had powerful incentives to cheat on capital gains taxes, but Congress has begun no research or enforcement initiatives to make sure those taxes were properly paid.
Not that it stops there.
The tax on capital gains, experts say, is just one of many that are widely ignored, underreported or evaded, often with increasing frequency. These are among the others:
*Taxes on self-employment work, especially jobs usually paid in cash, like house painting and gardening, and income from flea markets and other cash businesses. The I.R.S. estimates that only about one dollar in five is reported.
*Taxes on mail-order goods from out of state, an obligation so widely ignored that tax returns show that one taxpayer in 100 pays in Connecticut and only one in 500 in New Jersey.
*Income taxes on gambling winnings and tips.
*Gift taxes on transfers of more than $10,000 annually to a relative or friend.
*Estate taxes on people who die leaving more than $625,000 for individuals and $1.25 million for couples, the amounts not subject to tax.
*State and local taxes on investment property like stocks and bonds.
*The "nanny tax," owed on wages paid to child-care providers, house cleaners and other in-home workers. This was paid by 314,000 or so households in 1996, down from nearly 500,000 in 1994, when paying it was much more complicated.
"The primary reason some taxes are not paid is that your chances of getting caught are so low," said Daniel Mitchell, a tax policy expert at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.
Anne M. Magro of Rutgers University, who teaches tax and has studied the behavior of accountants, said: "Minor cheating on tax returns is a lot like speeding -- most people do it, but very few have a crisis of conscience when they do. The penalties are low, the law seems excessively restrictive, the chance of getting caught is small, so what's the harm?"
The harm, of course, is that other people's taxes must be higher to support the Government. Many taxes get little enforcement attention, and Congress has been steadily whittling away at the I.R.S. budget to enforce tax laws. Only about 1,000 people a year are indicted for tax crimes.
The maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains is now 20 percent, essentially half the top rate on earned incomes. And that difference, combined with a disclosure system that reports only one side of asset sales or requires no reporting, makes it irresistible for many people to understate gains or to claim that earned income is a gain subject to the lower rates.
This problem vexed the tax system in the three decades after World War II, spawning a whole industry of tax lawyers and accountants who, because of the wide gap in tax rates, specialized in devising ways to convert earned income into capital gains. That industry was seriously undercut in 1986 when the top rate on both incomes and capital gains was cut to 28 percent.
But starting in 1991 and then in a further move in 1993 the Democratic-controlled Congress raised the top income tax rate, ultimately to 39.6 percent on earned income -- still a far cry from the 91 percent rate under the Eisenhower Administration. Last year, with Republicans in charge, lawmakers reduced the top long-term capital gains rate to 20 percent.
Capital gains, income that overwhelmingly flows to the most affluent Americans, are subject to far less reporting than wages and generally are not subject to withholding. For example, when an individual sells stock, the brokerage firm reports to the I.R.S. the gross proceeds, not the stock's cost, leaving that to the taxpayer.
And when an item that has risen in value -- like a small business or an artwork -- is sold privately, there is seldom a report filed with the I.R.S.
"I suspect there is a lot of not reporting of capital gains transactions," said William Gale, who studies taxes for the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
Several tax preparers said they saw little risk in overstating a stock's cost, even in a sale in which the gross proceeds are reported to the I.R.S., because fewer than 1 percent of returns are audited.
"If you calculated your basis as $100 a share and it was really $50," said one tax preparer in Manhattan, who insisted on anonymity, "it would be wrong, it would be a crime, but even if you got caught you would never be prosecuted if the rest of your return was clean because you could argue it was just a mistake, that you forgot about the stock split."
The I.R.S. has no data on how many people have been charged with capital gains tax evasion, said Larry Blevins, an agency spokesman.
Alan Auerbach, a University of California economist who studies taxes, said the rhetoric from Capitol Hill about the I.R.S. gives comfort to those who cheat.
"These attacks on the I.R.S. are just a disaster," he said. "I can't think of anything more irresponsible than going after the I.R.S. in a world in which we depend on self-assessment and the perception that others are paying their taxes fairly."
The I.R.S., at the direction of Congress, has since 1995 zeroed in on low-income taxpayers who understate their income to qualify for the earned income tax credit, a form of negative tax, and on people who file no returns.
Still, some experts warned that the risks of cheating were greater than many people believed.
"You have to assume," said Julian Block, a former I.R.S. criminal investigator and now a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., that "the agent assigned to the audit of your return will be the equivalent of Eliot Ness and not Li'l Abner."
Sometimes tax professionals cheat and the I.R.S. does not notice. Charles Davenport, a Rutgers University professor of tax law and an editor of Tax Notes, a weekly magazine on tax policy, said he was once astonished to find himself working with lawyers who refused to report an estate of more than $1 million -- far above the tax threshold.
He said the lawyers thought his insistence on reporting the estate was bizarre, one of them telling him it was common practice not to in the city where the law firm was situated. Mr. Davenport resigned from the case.
Vicki Abt, a Pennsylvania State University sociologist who has studied gamblers for two decades, said she had yet to meet one who reported winnings. The only winnings the I.R.S. learns about, she said, are those of people who win big jackpots or walk away from the blackjack, craps or baccarat tables with more than the $1,200 of slot-machine winnings on which Federal reporting is required. Table games are exempt.
Verenda Smith, spokeswoman for the Federation of Tax Administrators, is one of many tax policy experts who worry that the debate is disheartening to honest taxpayers.
"I get increasingly irritated," she said, "with debates that leave me feeling like I have been called an idiot for caring how my government is funded and wanting to participate in my government."
Tax experts say the kind of two-sided reporting that is done on wages and salaries, together with a perception of tough enforcement, is critical to compliance.
Mr. Gale said "the three most important things to avoid evasion are withholding, withholding and withholding, because where there is withholding, compliance is very good."
Such reporting makes it difficult to cheat and explains why Tom Burger, chief of employment taxes for the I.R.S., estimates that it collects 99.5 percent of taxes due on wages with payroll withholding.
The I.R.S., though, guesses that it lost close to $12 billion in 1992 from unreported capital gains, or 8 percent of the total.
The I.R.S. generally favors more reporting but has had a hard time persuading Congress to expand such requirements, because they involve more paperwork for business and individuals.
The agency likes to tell what happened when Congress first required a Social Security number for each child: the number of children claimed as deductions fell by seven million. And in the years since, the numbers have not bounced back, indicating that many people were claiming children they did not have and that some divorced couples had counted the same children twice.
Outside the Federal system, the most widely ignored tax is undoubtedly the levy on mail-order goods from out of state.
Richard Pomp, a professor at Connecticut College, often orders from catalogues because "I hate shopping, I hate driving to the mall and fighting crowds and being mistreated by some surly clerk who doesn't know the inventory and, of course, I avoid the tax."
Most of the tens of millions of Americans who buy clothing, toys and books from catalogues do so at least in part to avoid sales taxes, experts say. What few people know is that in most states they are formally obligated to pay a "use" tax, at the same rate as the sales tax.
Only 1 percent of Connecticut residents pay it, state Revenue Department figures show, even though the state income tax form requires individuals to report use taxes they owe.
Sometimes, when a tax goes unpaid, government is partly responsible in encouraging misreporting.
In recent years, Connecticut, Maine and some other states have added a line to their income tax forms for people to report their use tax obligation. But the forms do not explain the use tax, or even mention mail-order purchases.
Falsely writing "zero" on the use tax line makes the taxpayer subject to enforcement action, but as a practical matter states do not prosecute people for small underpayments. After all, given the widespread view that mail-order taxes are avoidable, it would probably cost them more to collect the tax than they would generate in additional revenues.

When it comes to taxes, economists and tax preparers estimate that most people cut a few corners. Here are a few examples.
 
CAPITAL GAINS -- Not just stocks, it also includes collectibles and underreported income from the sale of a business.
 
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- Underreported income from nannies, house painters and others who are paid in cash.
 
MAIL-ORDER GOODS -- State taxes on these items are almost never paid.
 
GIFTS -- Transfers over $10,000 are taxable but are often not reported.
 
CIGARETTES AND LIQUOR -- Many people stock up on them in states with no sin taxes.
 
ESTATES -- Taxes on estates of more than $625,000 for individuals, or $1.25 million for couples, are often circumvented.
 
SMALL-BUSINESSES -- Those which handle a lot of cash, like bars and hardware stores, may underreport their income.

HEADLINE: U.N. Arms Inspector Fears Baghdad May Erect New Barriers

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 14

 BODY:
Less than two months after Secretary General Kofi Annan won an agreement from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to allow unfettered weapons inspections of presidential properties, there are signs that Iraq intends to curtail access to the sites.
In a report that is expected to go to the Security Council in the next few days, the arms expert who led an inspection of the eight sites after the agreement was reached says his Iraqi counterpart told him the visits were not part of an "indefinite" process. Iraq had previously contended that presidential sites should be off limits. 
 "It is quite clear that there is a difference in view here, and I reflected that in this report," the deputy chief inspector, Charles Duelfer, who led the inspections and wrote part of the report, said in an interview today. "This issue will ultimately have to be addressed by the Security Council."
Iraq's initial refusal to allow inspectors in the presidential sites, including one large palace complex in Baghdad, played a major part in leading the United States to the brink of a military attack on Iraq early this year.
For the first time the inspectors were accompanied to sites by diplomatic observers, as the accord stipulated, and the main body of the report was written by Jayantha Dhanapala, Under Secretary General for Disarmament Affairs and leader of the diplomatic delegation that accompanied the inspectors.
His summary is generally positive, saying the Iraqis were willing to compromise when differences arose.
But Mr. Duelfer says he met resistance from the leader of the Iraqi arms negotiating team, Gen. Amir Mohammed Rashid, when Mr. Duel fer asked for a written agreement that changes would not be made at the sites without at least 24 hours' notice.
General Rashid balked, telling Mr. Duelfer that any such promise would prejudice the Iraqi position that the inspections were "a finite process, not an indefinite process." Mr. Duel fer wrote in his report that General Rashid made it clear that Iraqis considered the right of access limited to perhaps no more than short follow-up visits in the very near future.
The presidential sites collectively cover nearly 19 square miles and more than 1,000 buildings. Officials say they could be used to hide documents, research material and weapons components, if not the actual weapons. Iraq is suspected of hiding biological and chemical arms programs and cannot account for all of its delivery missiles.
United Nations arms inspectors and the Security Council have assumed, despite doubts about Iraqi pledges, that the recent tours of the once-closed sites could be "base line" visits to lay the groundwork for future inspections.
Several Security Council members had pressed Mr. Annan in February, on his return from Baghdad, for assurances that there were no hidden ambiguities in the Iraqi promise. For example, until the last minute in Mr. Annan's talks, Iraq had demanded a 60-day limit on visits to presidential properties. When Mr. Annan's mission to Baghdad was at a critical point, the deadline issue was described by his aides as a potential "deal breaker."
Now, some officials fear, Iraq is trying to reinstate the deadline.
But Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's representative at the United Nations, said in an interview today that there would be absolutely no back-tracking on the agreement negotiated by Mr. Annan. "We're still committed to that," he said. "There's been no change in our position."
Other officials say the Secretary General is withholding the report from the Security Council until Iraq explains the stand taken with Mr. Duelfer, an American. He is the deputy chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, which has been assigned the elimination of Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons technology and production.
The visits to the presidential sites did enhance the inspection process, officials said, and those gains are reflected in the report. Officials said they had finally proved that they could have access to prohibited areas in Iraq and construct a data base from what they saw.
The team inspected hundreds of buildings during eight days of visits that began on March 26. Even the brief visits could have given them a sense of what the areas might contain -- what spots needed a second or third look and what areas could be eliminated from suspicion, at least for now. It was in Iraq's interest to make the inspections run smoothly despite a few disagreements over boundary markers, photography or the use of helicopters over Baghdad.
The Special Commission says inspections must continue until they have answered all outstanding questions about weapons that have not been accounted for.
The inspectors place great importance on Mr. Annan's assurances that their work will not be circumscribed now that Iraqis have direct access to the Secretary General's office and they are not confined to dealing with the Security Council, which imposed sanctions on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
"It is essential to note," Mr. Duelfer wrote in his portion of the new report, "that the fundamental issue of continued access is by no means solved and has only been postponed to the future."
Iraq has high hopes that the crippling economic sanctions will be lifted by the end of the year if it follows the script laid down by the Annan mission. President Hussein has run up large construction costs on extravagant palaces and monuments to himself, and the Iraqi people have suffered from a shortage of food and medicine. A resumption of oil sales would meet both needs.
Iraq faces two other potentially troublesome reports this week.
A team of international oil experts has been in Iraq assessing its ability to produce more oil under a plan that allows limited sales to meet civilian needs. Iraq says it cannot meet the expanded $5.2 billion in sales permitted every six months by the Security Council unless it can repair its oil wells and pipelines.
Also this week, Richard Butler, executive chairman of the Special Commission, will submit a crucial six-month report on the entire inspection process. This period has been the most tumultuous to date, and the report will form the basis of a review of the sanctions by the Security Council.

HEADLINE: MCI Has Stopped Pursuing Local Residential Customers

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
When the MCI Communications Corporation, the nation's second-largest long-distance company, began offering local residential telephone service on Long Island and in New York City and some of its northern suburbs last summer, the move was hailed by consumer advocates as an alternative to Nynex, now Bell Atlantic.
But earlier this year and with much less fanfare, MCI, which had long sought access to local telephone markets, quietly stopped seeking customers for the service in the New York metropolitan region, as well as in other parts of the country. It will, however, keep marketing local service to businesses. 
 The setback for MCI illustrates the unusually contentious war the company has been waging with the Bell Atlantic Corporation. It also shows the regulatory difficulties and legal uncertainties that many telecommunications companies face when entering a marketplace that was, until recently, a monopoly. "Rather than lose money, we decided to stop selling the service," Brad D. Burns, an MCI spokesman, said.
Mr. Burns said the trouble with MCI's local residential service in the metropolitan region stems from a court ruling in January. The decision struck down a Federal Communications Commission order that would have forced Bell Atlantic and other regional phone companies to sell their service to new competitors, like MCI, at a more substantial discount than they already do.
The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis, is being appealed to the Supreme Court, but a decision there is not expected until next year.
Mr. Burns said that under the existing rate structure, MCI cannot profit by reselling the time it buys in bulk from Bell Atlantic. MCI is also unable, he said, to offer customers discounts on their long-distance bills as a reward for signing up for the company's local service, a move that might have attracted enough customers to make local residential service more financially feasible. "It's called bundling, and bundling is something we can't do," he said.
Currently, MCI charges $6.30 a month for basic service in the city, compared with Bell Atlantic's rate of $6.60. Both companies also charge a small amount per call, depending on the time. MCI also offers a flat rate of 10 cents a minute, offpeak (7 P.M. to 7 A.M. and on weekends), and 20 cents a minute, peak (7 A.M. to 7 P.M. on weekdays), for all toll calls within the metropolitan area, rather than the sliding scale used by Bell Atlantic, which charges different rates based on the time and day.
In addition to its service in New York City, MCI offers local residential service in Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and in parts of California, Michigan and Illinois. The company refuses to say how many customers signed up for local service in the New York region, but it has about 100,000 residential customers nationally.
Current MCI residential local customers will not be affected by the decision to stop expanding the service, Mr. Burns said. He added that the company hopes to resume offering local residential service, but he would not predict when. "The economics are pitiful," Mr. Burns said, adding that the company is losing about $3 a month for each of its local residential customers and stopped offering the service in January.
He also conceded that that there have been problems with MCI's local residential service, including delays in having additional lines installed in homes and confusion over switching long-distance carriers. He blamed the problems on "strategic incompetence" by Bell Atlantic and other regional carriers.
"They are holding up the process," Mr. Burns said. "Bell Atlantic gets an order and drags its feet."
A Bell Atlantic spokesman, Jack Goldberg, disputed MCI's assessment. "We have had this ongoing debate with MCI for some time," he said. "The only obstacle facing MCI is their own lack of interest."
Mr. Goldberg added that service orders that reach Bell Atlantic are processed within 24 hours and any delays are because of MCI. He noted that he personally tested an MCI local residential line and experienced service problems. "I live on the Upper West Side, and one evening I called their 800-number to convert a second line, and I got a rep in Colorado who didn't know Manhattan," he said. "And from the moment we placed that order that evening, it was more like two to three weeks before MCI conveyed that order to my operations center."
He also said that MCI, which is based in Washington, was deliberately providing poor service in local residential markets as a ploy. He said that MCI was disingenuously trying to claim that it was being hampered by regional carriers, like Bell Atlantic, from entering local markets in the hope that regulators would retaliate against regional carriers by blocking them from entering long-distance markets.
"They will do enough in a half-hearted, underfunded way to try to create some evidence that it is someone else who is stopping them," he said. "MCI is totally uninterested in providing local service, and they can't say that."
Maureen Flanagan, a spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic, also noted that several dozen small companies, like RCN Telecom Services of Princeton, N.J., have established local residential service in New York City. "They are succeeding and they are doing quite well," she said.
Mr. Burns scoffed at that assertion. "That's a typical monopoly response," he said. "Just because they are offering local service and growing fast doesn't mean they are making a dime. In fact, most are losing their shirts."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Ends Over 9,100 Despite Mediocre Earning Reports

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Investors decided to be cheered yesterday.
Maybe it was that any actual earnings news looks good after company analysts have forecast the worst profits growth in seven years for the first quarter. Or maybe it was just that the investors still think stocks are the best bet in a low inflation, low interest rate environment -- even if earnings are mediocre at best. 
 What else could explain why lower-than-expected earnings from International Paper and just as-expected earnings from Eastman Kodak and several other companies helped send the Dow Jones industrial average up almost 100 points to a new high and its first close over 9,100.
"It is a market that has a momentum of its own," Byron Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said.
And investors could be even happier today because they will actually have a positive earnings surprise. After the stock market closed, Intel reported that despite a sharp fall in profits last quarter, earnings were still better than expected. That is the kind of surprise -- even if it was contrived with company jawboning -- that investors like.
Intel earnings were 81 cents a diluted share before charges, while analysts had forecast 72 cents a share, according to First Call. But that 72-cent forecast is down from 93 cents at the beginning of the year and it was warnings from the company that helped send those analyst estimates lower. Intel's stock jumped as high as $79 in after-hours trading.
"The analysts are terrified to have an estimate out there that the company can't beat," Mr. Wien said. "As a result, companies are going to come though better than expected."
The Dow rose 97.90 points, or 1.1 percent, to 9,110.20 while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 6.06 points, to 1,115.75, a smaller percentage gain that left this broader index still below its recent record high. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 18.08 points, or 1 percent, to 1,843.03. Advancing stocks led declines on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,899 to 1,103.
Almost 30 points of the Dow's climb came from the surge in Kodak, which rose 3 13/16, to 70 13/16, and International Paper, which rose 3 3/8, to 54 3/8.
Kodak reported earnings that met analysts' estimates, but said that worldwide film sales were still declining. Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation, said that the Kodak analysis at his firm saw positive news in the report because "the reduction in costs was impressive." But Prudential Securities' Kodak analyst, B. Alex Henderson, cut his forecasts for 1998 and 1999 after the report.
International Paper had earnings of 25 cents a diluted share, which was 2 cents below the consensus estimate from First Call. At the beginning of the year, the earnings estimate was at 44 cents a share.
J. P. Morgan slipped 5/16, to 147 5/16, after reporting lower earnings that met expectations. But the stock is still up 11 percent in the last two weeks because of the speculation about mergers among big financial concerns.
Gillette was a big loser yesterday after it introduced its new shaving system. The stock dropped 4 1/8, to 120 1/4.
Surely, the economic data reported yesterday morning supported the view that inflation remains low while the economy continues to perk along at a pace that is just right -- strong enough to support profits but moderate enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates to slow the economy down. The Consumer Price Index for March was unchanged while retail sales slipped one-tenth of 1 percent after rising strongly in the first two months of the year.
"People are not forgetting the pretty good news that came out this morning," Mr. Johnson said. This environment, he added, "is enough to encourage all that money that is flowing into stock mutual funds." And once investors put it there, money managers have to put it to work by buying stocks, even if they think they are too expensive or overvalued.
"There is an urgency to put the money to work in stocks," Mr. Johnson said, so that managers do not risk being outperformed by a rival.

HEADLINE: Screen Test for Main Street;
Suburbs Put Faith in Multiplexes for Economic Revival

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, April 10

 BODY:
First, New Rochelle trumpeted the news a year ago that it was building a 20-screen movie theater to reinvigorate its ragged downtown.
Then, White Plains announced in February that it, too, would build a theater for its anemic downtown, only its theater would have 24 screens. Then Yonkers got into the act, promising to crown the revival of its tumbledown waterfront with a 14-screen theater. 
 Suddenly, people around here began toting up the score for Westchester County and realized that 148 new screens were being planned or seriously considered in settings like Mount Vernon, Port Chester, Tarrytown, Cortlandt, Elmsford and Ossining. If all 148 go up, the largely suburban county would have 213 movie screens, more than triple the 65 the county has now.
Whether Westchester, population 875,000, has enough devotees of the cinema to support each one of those movie screens is a question that may well be asked by local officials and bankers, who will have to approve and finance some of the deals. But what is happening in Westchester mirrors what is happening around the nation.
More than 2,000 screens were opened across the country last year, the most ever in a single year, giving the United States 31,865 movie screens. In New York City, at least four theater chains have plans for multiplexes, including a 25-screen AMC Entertainment theater on 42d Street that will embrace part of an 85-year-old burlesque hall.
The driving force behind this wave of new movie screens is the country's extraordinary appetite for films, with Americans going to the movies 1.4 billion times last year and buying $6.4 billion in tickets. The teeming offspring of the baby boomers, although raised on videos and cable, seem to relish sitting in front of a communal screen. And they are reaching their teen-age years, the prime moviegoing age. At the same time, older boomers whose children have taken off for college have time on their hands and, in a robust economy, the money to spend.
"People are going to the movies in numbers we haven't seen in decades," said Jim Kozak, communications director of the National Association of Theater Owners. "More people went to the movies in 1997 than any other year since 1959."
Also taking place is a serendipitous convergence of the yearnings of local government officials, theater owners and real estate developers.
Mayors of struggling cities like New Rochelle covet multiplexes because they draw people downtown at night, bringing new life to restaurants and bars and attracting new merchants like ice cream parlors. Government officials in more rural areas like them because, unlike malls, they give people something to do besides shop and eat.
"Entertainment seems to be the way to go to bring back cities of New Rochelle's size," said Mayor Tim Idoni of New Rochelle, which has 67,000 residents. "There's a lot of retail out there, the office development industry is in a lull, so the way to bring people back to Main Street is to entertain them."
Developers love the multiplexes because they create a stream of patrons for shops on their properties. The theaters also fill mall parking lots at idle times and use interior space, like basements, that is otherwise wasted.
Theater owners love multiplexes because the ability to offer a variety of films allows them to fill seats that would be empty with a single moderately popular film. When a movie like "Titanic" is shown, a theater manager can project the film in several screening rooms at staggered times to maximize the audience, yet know that people who have been closed out can be served in the same theater with a second choice. Meanwhile, the cost of projectionists, ushers and insurance is spread out among many screens.
There are, of course, skeptics and outright detractors. Fay Dolnick, a research associate at the American Planning Association, warns that with too many multiplexes feeding on the same cheek-by-jowl audience, "multiplex mania may become multiplex cannibalism."
Beth Peterson, executive director of Downtown New Jersey, a nonprofit advocacy group for revitalization of older business districts, says she dislikes multiplexes that kill off cornfields and replace them with "a sea of asphalt." From her office in Somerville, she can travel five minutes in any direction and find a multiplex on the drawing boards. Statewide, the number of screens has grown to 828 from 559 in 1990.
"Desirable places to live are malling themselves to death and entertaining themselves to death and you wonder, 'Does the population exist to support all of them?' " she said.
Others lament the passing of another cornerstone of American life, the village or neighborhood theater like the one in Larchmont, where neighbors can gather in front of a single screen and chuckle or weep at the same movie. Clearview Cinema Group, the Larchmont Theater's new owner, is thinking of converting it into a triplex.
Almost nowhere does the multiplex trend seem to be as voracious as in Westchester. It combines some of the nation's most prosperous villages and a half-dozen struggling cities. The multiplex industry sees opportunity in both.
In the last decade, White Plains has received a number of wounding blows to its reputation as the City of a Thousand Stores. The shuttering of entire office buildings in the real estate slump of the late 1980's was followed by the opening of an upscale mall, the Westchester, that diverted customers from downtown.
After that, two linchpins of the main thoroughfare, Mamaroneck Avenue, were closed -- a 47-year-old Macy's and a cavernous Woolworth's. Dozens of storefronts on Mamaroneck Avenue are now empty.
But several theater chains have expressed interest in White Plains, a city of almost 50,000 people with populous towns nearby that does not have a single theater. The Macy's site, flanked by two large municipal garages, lured a developer, Tishman Speyer Properties, and Loews Theaters, which operates 1,020 screens nationwide. Loews will enter Westchester for the first time.
"We'll not only have a revitalized Mamaroneck Avenue, we'll have a different look," said Mayor Joseph Delfino. "I can see ice cream parlors, restaurants more active than they are today and stores that don't exist today."
Similarly, New Rochelle's efforts to resurrect its downtown had been blocked by a dead mall. Wrecking balls have just torn that mall down and work crews are beginning to build an entertainment complex that is to include a multiplex operated by Regal Cinemas, the nation's second-largest chain with 2,337 screens, as well as a supermarket and two ice-skating rinks. Mayor Idoni says he hopes that once the theater is open people will begin drifting one block down to Main Street and patronizing its long-suffering shops.
Port Chester, a heavily blue-collar village at the crossroads of two interstate highways, 95 and 287, is so eager to build a multiplex alongside a Costco shopping-club warehouse that it is willing to arrange a second relocation of its largest private employer, Nadel Industries, a plastics factory that provides 200 jobs. Just two years ago, the village loaned Nadel $5 million to move to its current location.
Officials in more pastoral towns like Somers and Cortlandt are also happily anticipating multiplexes in shopping centers.
"People want to be able to go to a single place and have a choice of 11 different theaters," said John Felt, director of planning for Cortlandt, where an 11-screen theater is under construction. "It's analogous to television. We once had three channels and now we have 104."
Right now, Westchester probably has too few screens. Like other moviegoers, Peter Graff of Briarcliff complains that to get into the most popular films at the All-Westchester Saw Mill, a 10-screen multiplex in Hawthorne, he has to arrive an hour early. On Saturday nights, the parking lot is a madhouse.
"It would be nice if there were more screens," said Mr. Graff, a journalist. "You wouldn't have to get here so early."
But a tripling of screens may be just too many. "Someone may go in with a 12-screen and be knocked down to 10 or 8 because of parking," said Albert Annunziata, director of research for the Westchester County Planning Department.
The newest player in the multiplex game in Westchester demonstrates how the business, which sprouted 36 years ago when a Kansas City, Mo., theater was split in two, has mushroomed relatively overnight.
Ten years ago, A. Dale Mayo was an investment banker trying to start his own business with a mini-mall in Tenafly, N.J. Tenafly's leaders persuaded him to build a theater instead. His company, Clearview Cinema Group, now operates 37 theaters with 169 screens, including newly acquired theaters in Bronxville, Larchmont and Mamaroneck, where Clearview hopes to add screens.
Recently, Mr. Mayo announced plans to build a 15-screen theater in Carmel, Putnam County, and he has also been asked to build the 14-screen theater on the Yonkers waterfront, which he envisions as an art house like Manhattan's Angelika theater that will show foreign and independent films.
Mr. Mayo says his multiplexes will show films like "Deconstructing Harry" and "Wings of the Dove" that appeal to more mature audiences -- "especially senior citizens, empty nesters and people with small children." That is why his theaters stock treats craved by aging yuppies, like Perugina chocolates, bottled water and cappuccino.
In the new age of theaters that suit a multiplicity of tastes, even the popcorn at his theaters is customized, made with canola oil, which is better for cardiovascular health than corn oil.

More theater complexes are being built nationwide, greatly increasing the number of indoor movie screens. Following the trend, and demand, for more theaters, Westchester County plans to add 148 screens in the next three years, increasing its existing screen count of 65 to 213.

HEADLINE: A Nasty Family Fight Breaks Out Among Democrats in the Race for Governor in California

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 14

 BODY:
With candidates spending record amounts to buy television advertising in a tight race, it was only a matter of time before the Democratic primary campaign for governor of California turned into a nasty family feud, and in the last few days, it has.
First, one candidate, Al Checchi, the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, ran a commercial attacking a rival, Representative Jane Harman, for voting to raise Social Security taxes. Since Ms. Harman cast that vote -- to raise taxes on only the wealthiest recipients -- as part of approving President Clinton's landmark budget package in 1993, she struck back, accusing Mr. Checchi of distorting her record. 
 Then Mr. Checchi, who has spent more than $18 million of his personal fortune, most of it for television advertisements that never mentioned his party affiliation, began broadcasting an advertisement last weekend that promotes him as "a leader for President Clinton," and shows him shaking hands with the President. That drew a pro forma scolding from the White House -- which is officially neutral in the primary -- and an agreement from the Checchi campaign to stop using the President's image.
"Those photos belong to Al Checchi and there's no legal ban on their use," said Mr. Checchi's manager, Darry Sragow. "But in deference to the White House, we'll either change the photos or change the ad."
The sparring reflects the closeness of the race, the tightest Democratic primary fight in the state since 1974, when Edmund G. Brown Jr. won the nomination in a field of seven. The latest Los Angeles Times poll, released over the weekend, shows Mr. Checchi and Ms. Harman, both newcomers to statewide politics, virtually tied for the nomination, trailed by Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, a two-decade veteran whose campaign has faltered in the face of his rivals' heaving spending. All three led the presumed Republican nominee, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, in hypothetical fall matchups.
"We're seeing a spending spree extraordinaire, the likes of which we've never seen before," said Leslie Goodman, a former senior aide to the Republican Governor, Pete Wilson, and now a communications consultant in Sacramento. "The question is, through all the clutter, what cuts?"
Mr. Checchi, who has never run for office before but is worth perhaps three-quarters of a billion dollars, has tried a bit of everything. Last year, his support in the polls stood at just 1 percent, but his ad blitz has raised that to the low 20 percent range.
Because the June 2 primary will be the first in the state's history in which candidates of all parties will appear on a "blanket" ballot, Mr. Checchi has taken pains to cast himself as a moderate businessman who would cut bureaucracy and automobile insurance rates, without emphasizing his party affiliation.
But after Ms. Harman's own $4 million advertising blitz brought her swiftly within striking distance, Mr. Checchi adopted a more traditional approach, and is running a commercial in which his friend and fellow Northwest board member, the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, attests to his "commitment to basic Democratic ideals of fairness, equality and economic success."
In the advertisement that pictures Mr. Checchi with Mr. Clinton, a narrator says of Mr. Checchi, "As a teen-ager he was inspired by J.F.K. and marched with Martin Luther King for civil rights." Mr. Sragow said that that was a reference to how, as a 15-year-old growing up in suburban Maryland, Mr. Checchi went to watch the 1963 march on Washington with his father, an official at the Food and Drug Administration.
Mr. Checchi's claim to be "a leader for President Clinton" is based in part on his having contributed the maximum $1,000 individual donation to the President in 1996 and $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee, but the Harman camp notes that he also gave $1,000 each to Bob Dole and Steve Forbes that same year, contributions that Mr. Checchi says were based on old friendship.
The campaign wrangling also reflects the tangled web of relationships, rivalries and old feuds among the candidates' aides and advisers, many of whom were allies in various California or national campaigns in the past and now find themselves not only divided but well aware of each other's quirks, faults and playbooks.
The media advisers for the three campaigns -- Bob Shrum for Mr. Checchi, David Doak for Mr. Davis and Bill Carrick for Ms. Harman -- were all once allied in support of candidates like Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. But in the 1990 California Democratic gubernatorial primary, Mr. Carrick worked for Dianne Feinstein, while Mr. Doak and Mr. Shrum worked for State Attorney General John Van De Kamp. Later, Mr. Doak and Mr. Shrum's partnership, based in Washington, broke up.
Similarly, Mr. Sragow, the Checchi campaign manager, worked for Ms. Feinstein in her unsuccessful 1990 campaign for Governor, and Ms. Harman's campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, worked on Ms. Feinstein's successful Senate race two years later.
Mr. Carrick, who handled California strategy for Mr. Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, engineered the White House's rebuke of Mr. Checchi this week. Meanwhile, Senator Feinstein, who declined to enter the Governor's race this year because she said she had no stomach for attacks from Mr. Checchi, this week took the unusual step of attacking Mr. Checchi's advertisements as "grossly misleading" and "dreadful."

HEADLINE: U.S. Treasury Chief Offers Plan to Avoid Crises Like Asia's

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin today outlined an American initiative to avoid future economic convulsions of the kind roiling Asia, declaring that the international financial systems set up at the end of World War II need drastic updating "to be as modern as the markets."
In a speech opening three days of talks in Washington focusing on the Asian economic crisis, Mr. Rubin proposed new rules that would all but compel nations to disclose embarrassing financial data that many governments have routinely withheld. 
 In a proposal that Mr. Rubin developed with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Secretary also said the United States should consider new rules that could bar foreign banks from operating in the United States unless their home countries imposed strong regulation on their financial institutions.
Such a drastic step could limit the ability of fast-growing nations to conduct business in the United States. Indonesia, Thailand and Korea all lacked such systems before their banks began to crumble under the weight of bad debt and plunging currencies last year.
Mr. Rubin's speech contained echoes of the cold war era of arms control: In effect, he called for more international inspection and monitoring of national economies that could pose a potent threat to their neighbors. And he urged an end to the traditional secrecy that has cloaked many vital economic statistics that provide tip-offs of impending trouble. Thailand and South Korea, for instance, refused to disclose last year how much their foreign currency reserves had dwindled -- so investors would not know how vulnerable they were to attacks by currency speculators.
"The most powerful source of discipline we have around the world," he said, "is the power of the markets."
But Mr. Rubin's proposals are bound to meet objections around the globe, and he acknowledged today that it would take years before many of them were in place. Already, several nations are resisting Washington's efforts for American-style rules of disclosure and regulation; in recent weeks some members of the International Monetary Fund have even blocked publication of a recently completed study by the fund's staff about the causes of the Asian crisis.
In making his proposals today, Mr. Rubin seemed to be aiming his message at several audiences: world leaders, investors who Mr. Rubin suggested were not suffering heavy enough losses for ill-judged investments, and Congress. His efforts to convince Congress to provide $18 billion in additional financing for the Monetary Fund has run into heavy opposition. Some Republicans say they regard the fund as a menace to the world economy, and others insist that it become far more open -- and publicly critical of some of its member countries -- in return for American support.
Today Michel Camdessus, the director general of the I.M.F., shot back at Congressional critics who have denounced his institution as a huge bureaucracy of overpaid economists who dictate economic strategies to countries around the world. At a news conference, Mr. Camdessus argued that the fund is "the most magnificent bureaucracy in the world."
"I do not apologize at all," said Mr. Camdessus, whom the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, recently called a "Socialist from France" who should not be running the fund. "I am proud to be here."
In Congress the argument over the future of the I.M.F. has become wrapped up in abortion politics, the debate over paying arrears to the United Nations, and other unrelated issues. What is largely forgotten is how to avoid financial shocks that sweep around the globe faster than they did even a decade ago.
The Clinton Administration began raising that issue after the collapse of the Mexican economy in late 1994, and there have been modest efforts to strengthen international rules about what kind of data countries and companies should disclose. But none of that information was sufficient to provide a tip-off of the impending collapse in Asia.
It is possible that none could. Financial collapses are like tornadoes; forecasters can find evidence of atmospheric disturbance and predict that a twister will appear, but rarely can they say exactly when and where. Mr. Rubin's initiative seems aimed at breaking up the storm clouds before they turn into something more dangerous, by giving the markets better warning signs.
But Mr. Rubin acknowledged today that many big investors ignored the warnings altogether. Before trouble struck in Asia last year, he said, the "lack of data meant that no one had a true understanding of this buildup of economic vulnerabilities." But he also said many international investors -- including major banks and brokerage houses -- did not assemble "the appropriate expertise and and knowledge" about the risks of the markets where they were investing.
Perhaps the most controversial issue Mr. Rubin raised is whether Washington should prohibit foreign banks from operating in the United States if their home countries fail to supervise their activities. This has already happened in half-secrecy; the Federal Reserve, for example, has deflected efforts by banks in China and Mexico to operate in the United States.
After his speech today, however, Mr. Rubin said that he was simply "raising a subject for discussion," and that he did not know if the United States would decide to move ahead with such regulations on its own.
He also said today that he expected that he would remain in his post "for some time to come." One of the members of President Clinton's Cabinet who has often been mentioned as a potential successor to Mr. Rubin as Treasury Secretary, Franklin D. Raines, resigned today as director of the Office of Management and Budget to take the top post at Fannie Mae, the Federally chartered mortgage institution.

HEADLINE: Budget Director Quits to Head Fannie Mae

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
Franklin D. Raines, an architect of the balanced-budget agreement and a supporter of the Clinton Administration's plan to reserve budget surpluses until Social Security's future is secure, said today that he was stepping down as the White House budget director to become chief executive of Fannie Mae.
Mr. Raines, 49, will have served as director of the Office of Management and Budget for less than two years before returning to Fannie Mae, the nation's largest provider of home-mortgage financing. He served as vice chairman from 1991 to 1996. 
 The O.M.B. director's salary is $151,500 a year. In 1997, the current chairman of Fannie Mae, James A. Johnson, received compensation totalling about $7 million, company officials said.
When Mr. Raines assumed the budget post in September 1996, the Federal budget deficit was $107.5 billion. He said today that the budget surplus for the current fiscal year, ending on Sept. 30, would be more than the $18 billion estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. He would not be more specific, but many private economists have predicted that the surplus would exceed $40 billion, if current economic conditions hold until fall.
Mr. Raines said in an interview that he had expected to remain in the Administration for the duration of Mr. Clinton's second term, but the lure of running one of the world's largest financial institutions was too great.
Mr. Raines said that when Mr. Johnson unexpectedly told him that he was leaving the chairmanship at the end of the year, he had to readjust his thinking.
"This is sooner than I ever thought of leaving," Mr. Raines said. "This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I wanted to stay in Government for the Social Security debate, but my real life's ambition is to run a major company, and you only get asked a very few times to run a company like this one."
He said that he could have stayed in the Government to become the White House chief of staff, or perhaps even Treasury Secretary, but that he could not pass up the chance to run the 33rd largest corporation in America.
Before President Clinton left Washington today for a forum on race relations in Houston, he formally announced Mr. Raines's departure, which takes effect on May 21.
"He has earned the trust of Democratic and Republican members of Congress alike," the President said of his budget chief.
The President also declared today that he intended to nominate Jacob J. Lew, currently the deputy budget director, to move into Mr. Raines's position. Mr. Lew, 42, has been a White House policy aide and associate director of O.M.B. for legislative affairs. His nomination requires Senate confirmation.
Mr. Lew served as a senior adviser to the late Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and as executive director of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.
He was Mr. O'Neill's chief policy adviser on Social Security the last time the Government tackled the nation's largest entitlement program, in 1983. He will again have a chance to frame the restructuring of the system as Congress and the Administration debate Social Security's future over the next two years.
Mr. Johnson's planned departure from Fannie Mae is a major development in its own right. He has presided over a period of unrivaled growth at the lending institution. Its assets rose to more than $400 billion during his tenure, from $133 billion in 1991, when he became chief executive.
Mr. Johnson plans to remain at Fannie Mae through 1999 as chairman of the executive committee.

HEADLINE: Foiled Drug Pursuit of a Mexican Bares a System Rife With Graft

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON and CRAIG PYES 

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico

 BODY:
For nearly a decade, the United States Government has been trying to prosecute a Mexican multimillionaire who is accused of running a cartel that smuggled tons of cocaine into California several years ago.
When American drug agents raided one of his warehouses, it was the largest single drug bust in history and it remains so today. American agents thought it was an open and shut case against the suspect, Rafael Munoz Talavera, because several traffickers who were arrested after the drug seizure identified him as their leader. 
 But despite two trials, one conviction, and what American prosecutors say is overwhelming evidence against him, Mr. Munoz is free. Mexican and American authorities say he is directing a violent campaign to seize control of a major part of the Mexican drug trade.
Neither Government has ever publicly explained the collapse of the lengthy effort to convict Mr. Munoz. But a history of the investigation, based on interviews with law enforcement officials, judges who tried Mr. Munoz, and an examination of documents, shows a Mexican criminal justice system in chaos, rife with corruption and mismanagement.
In the first trial, the police and prosecutors, who were later accused of accepting bribes from the drug cartel that officials say was run by Mr. Munoz, steered a watered-down package of evidence to a friendly judge. A second trial, bolstered by stronger evidence from investigators in the United States, ended in a conviction. But a Mexican appeals court freed Mr. Munoz, ruling that he had been illegally tried twice for the same crime.
During the trials, Mr. Munoz was lodged in comfortable suites in Mexican federal prisons, including one with a bar.
"We knew he was going to walk from the date of his arrest," said an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "In Mexico the guy with the biggest pocket book always wins."
Now Mr. Munoz has been reported back in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Tex., and American prosecutors are working to assemble yet another case against him.
Mr. Munoz did not respond to requests, left at his Juarez restaurant, to discuss his legal fight. But in December, in a newspaper advertisement, he denied any involvement in drug trafficking and described himself as a "simple and hard-working man." The lawyer who defended him in his seven-year legal battle, Sergio Roldan Ramos, was slain in Ciudad Juarez last October. Mr. Roldan's partners and other lawyers who have worked for Mr. Munoz did not respond to requests for interviews.
Mr. Munoz's release, and criminal comeback, dramatize the legal crisis threatening Mexico's modernization. The economy has opened up and opposition political parties are finding a voice. But criminal syndicates are casting a widening shadow and the justice system is riddled with graft and incompetence, mired in archaic procedures and shielded from accountability.
Mexicans hold every element involved in disrepute, from the police and prosecutors to judges and jailers. A 1996 United Nations survey asked Mexicans how much confidence they had in their judicial system and 80 percent responded "little" or "none," the worst showing of any Latin American country.
"We have a justice system immersed in the routine violation of every basic principle," said Eduardo Lopez Betancourt, a law professor at the national university. "Nothing is respected. Prosecutors rig evidence and judges sell verdicts according to the highest bidder, without delay, favoring every kind of criminal from drug traffickers to car thieves."
Confronted with this crisis, American prosecutors routinely press to extradite traffickers for trial in United States courts. Although the extradition of Mexicans is constitutionally barred, officials in Washington say that Mexico has recently vowed to honor future extradition requests. Still, the United States Government has never successfully extradited a major Mexican drug dealer.
Four years ago, President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico replaced the entire Supreme Court and set up a Judicial Council to attack corruption. By requiring competitive examinations, the reform cleaned up the system of judicial appointments, based on cronyism. But otherwise the council has been timid.
Mario Melgar, a council member, said that of 1,538 complaints filed against federal judges, only 8 had been forwarded to prosecutors. Not one Mexican judge has been punished for accepting payments from traffickers, he said.
"I don't see any way to know if a judge receives a bribe," Mr. Melgar said. "It's practically impossible."
 
The Justice System
Bribes Can Blind Judges to Crime
Many of the forces that foiled the prosecution of Mr. Munoz are embedded in the nation's justice system.
*Graft is considered rampant. In the Munoz case, only the police and a prosecutor were accused in American testimony of corruption, but many judges are also suspect. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the United States Congress, told a committee in March that a specially vetted Mexican police unit fighting organized crime trusts only one of Mexico's 500 federal judges and magistrates to authorize wiretaps without tipping off the suspects.
*Judges allow thousands of fugitives to avoid arrest. The police commander who led the arrest of Mr. Munoz was later charged with taking bribes from the drug cartel. But he was never arrested because he obtained an amparo, or writ, barring his detention. For thousands of dollars, corrupt officials and accused traffickers can easily buy an amparo, amounting to what one American official likened to a "Get-out-of-jail-free card."
*Court papers are secret, inhibiting accountability and independent scrutiny. Officials at the five Mexican courts that heard the various stages of Mr. Munoz's case refused to allow reporters to read the trial record, citing laws that keep documents from scholars and journalists.
*The system is poorly managed. The judge in the second trial of Mr. Munoz found him guilty, only to be reversed on appeal because he was tried twice on the same charges. Communications are so poor that the judge said in an interview that he had never even heard of the previous trial.
*The Mexican Attorney General's office was in such disorder that 10 successive federal attorneys were assigned to oversee the second, 30-month, trial of Mr. Munoz. Some were on the job just weeks. Few stayed long enough even to read the thousands of pages of documents.
 
The Suspect
A Huge Drug Hoard Spotlights Mexicans
Until late 1989, Mr. Munoz, who is 45, was known in Juarez as a sober, even taciturn, restaurateur from a leading local family. Agents for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration were suspicious of a $3 million estate he had built in El Paso, but he was not known as a major trafficker.
"There was information on him, but not anything where you hit the button and lights go off," one American official said.
Then drug agents received a tip about suspicious comings and goings at a warehouse in the Los Angeles suburb of Sylmar. They obtained a search warrant, sliced off a $5 padlock, and discovered 36 wooden pallets stacked with boxes of cocaine. The hoard, weighing 21.4 tons, was the size of two school buses.
Ledgers showed that billions of dollars of cocaine -- hundreds of tons -- had passed through the warehouse. The seizure caused what the the American Embassy in Mexico described in a cable as "an earthquake" that redefined Washington's understanding of the drug war by highlighting the growing role of Mexican smugglers.
Not only was it clear that Mexican smugglers were significant new players, but a dozen traffickers arrested at Sylmar identified Mr. Munoz as their leader.
"We knew the dope came from Munoz Talavera," said James P. Walsh, the assistant United States attorney who supervised the investigation. As a result, the clamor for Mr. Munoz's detention became intense.
Five weeks later, Mexico's Federal Police arrested him in a dingy Ciudad Juarez hotel in possession of several rifles and handguns. The police said they had seized a small bag of cocaine during a raid on one of his houses. He was initially arraigned on charges of drug possession and weapons violations, which were broadened to include drug trafficking. Mexican prosecutors announced triumphantly that he was facing 60 years in jail.
But his case went before a judge with a reputation for leniency.
From the beginning, the circumstances of Mr. Munoz's arrest aroused suspicions among American officials that the prosecution was rigged.
First, the authorities announced his arrest in advance, inviting reporters to film him as policemen escorted him handcuffed out of the hotel. Then the hotel manager said that the room in which Mr. Munoz was arrested had been rented not by Mr. Munoz, but by the police a week earlier.
"This was one of those deals that appeared to be prearranged," said a Texas lawyer involved in related proceedings who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "There was pressure on the Mexican Government to do something, and so they did something. Why arrest him in a hotel? It smacked that he made an appointment with the authorities so they wouldn't arrest him in front of his children."
Later, more disturbing information emerged. Two Mexican officials involved in the arrest and trial of Mr. Munoz were accused in American court testimony of receiving huge bribes from his drug organization.
The police officer who orchestrated Mr. Munoz's arrest and assembled the initial evidence was Elias Ramirez Ruiz, the powerful Federal Police commander in Chihuahua, the state in which Ciudad Juarez is situated. Javier Coello Trejo was the Mexican Deputy Attorney General, based in Mexico City, who channeled evidence received from American officials to Mexican prosecutors in Ciudad Juarez and supervised the Munoz case.
Late in 1990, even before Mr. Munoz's first trial ended, Mr. Ramirez and Mr. Coello were driven from office by a barrage of corruption charges. Since the resignation of Mr. Coello, several witnesses in at least three Federal trials in Texas have detailed how he received suitcases of cash from the Ciudad Juarez and other drug cartels.
Mexican press reports accused Mr. Ramirez of staging several phony cocaine seizures as window dressing for Mexico's antidrug effort. And two years later, Mr. Ramirez was charged with narcotics smuggling and racketeering. Federal prosecutors sought his arrest, but he obtained an amparo from a judge and has never been detained.
 
The First Trial
Extradition Is Foiled By a 'Masquerade'
A year ago in a Houston courtroom, Cesar Dominguez Becerra, a former police officer who worked for Mr. Ramirez in Ciudad Juarez at the time of Mr. Munoz's arrest and trial, testified that both Mr. Ramirez and Mr. Coello were working with Mr. Munoz's organization. Mr. Dominguez was asked to describe his duties.
"Sometimes it was to pick up money, and on other occasions it was to pick up drugs," he testified. "Sometimes it was to help with the sacks that we got off the planes."
"Did you also do police work?" he was asked by Jesse Rodriguez, an assistant United States attorney.
"Sometimes," Mr. Dominguez said.
"On whose orders were you operating?" Mr. Rodriguez asked.
"Elias Ramirez Ruiz," he said.
Later Mr. Dominguez testified that he had personally delivered bundles of cash from the cartel to Mr. Coello.
"Where did you deliver this money to Mr. Coello Trejo?" he was asked.
"Sometimes in the Federal Police office itself," he said.
In an interview, Mr. Coello denied that he had accepted drug bribes, saying "no trafficker has ever paid me one cent." He scoffed at assertions that American officials suspected him of corruption, reeling off names of American agents with whom he had worked closely, and expressed outrage at accusations that he and his prosecutors had sabotaged the case against Mr. Munoz.
"Why say that only prosecutors are corrupt?" Mr. Coello asked. "Don't you think some judges are corrupt too?"
Mr. Ramirez did not respond to interview requests made to him through his Ciudad Juarez lawyer, Francisco Pena Gonzalez.
Mexican and United States officials said that American evidence in the Sylmar investigation was channeled to Mexico for use against Mr. Munoz, although what was provided has never been made public.
Recently, however, a Mexican official who took part directly in the first prosecution of Mr. Munoz described the Government's management of the case as a deliberate farce.
"It was a masquerade," the official said. "It was arranged ahead of time. They orchestrated a trial in Mexico so that Munoz Talavera couldn't be extradited to the United States" for prosecution.
The official said that while the charges linked Mr. Munoz to the drugs seized at Sylmar, the evidence presented in the first trial failed to prove the tie.
"The idea was not to present strong evidence," the official said.
A second official on the Mexican Attorney General's staff who has studied the Munoz case also acknowledged its weakness. The reason, he said, was that American officials became so suspicious of Mr. Coello's ties to the cartel that they broke off cooperation. The United States Justice Department, however, has refused to discuss the proceedings.
Judge Librado Fuerte Chavez, who presided over the first trial, acquitted Mr. Munoz of all charges in January 1991. Mr. Munoz's release illustrated the blatant corruption surrounding the justice sytem in another way. The Mexican authorities had seized several Munoz properties, including two ranches and a mansion. During the trial, prosecutors and their families had squatted in the homes. With the acquittal, the judge had to order them out.
A year later, a grand jury in El Paso indicted Mr. Munoz on trafficking and money-laundering charges, and American authorities later requested his extradition. The Mexican police, acting on a tip from the Drug Enforcement Administration, re-arrested him in September 1992 in Tijuana.
Instead of delivering Mr. Munoz to United States authorities, however, Mexico mounted a new trial, again on Sylmar-related charges, this time before a Federal judge in Sonora, the state south of Arizona. The second trial lasted nearly three years.
Two assistant United States attorneys and a team of Drug Enforcement Administration agents helped gather evidence, prepare testimony, and translate documents. Half a dozen American officials traveled to Sonora to testify.
 
Street Wars
Rivalry Threatens 'A Real Blood Bath'
But it was a waste of time. Although the second judge found Mr. Munoz guilty in 1995 and sentenced him to 24 years in jail, an appelate tribunal overturned the conviction, ruling that Mr. Munoz had already been tried and acquitted in Ciudad Juarez on the same charges.
Freed from prison, Mr. Munoz returned to Ciudad Juarez, but another trafficker, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, had taken control of the cartel based there. Mr. Munoz seemed for a time to administer his restaurant quietly. But when Mr. Carrillo died last year, Mr. Munoz moved into action, officials from both countries said.
Francisco Barrio Terrazas, the Governor of Chihuahua, said in an interview that Mr. Munoz forged an alliance with exceptionally violent traffickers from Tijuana, hoping to seize control of the Ciudad Juarez drug trade from Mr. Carrillo's followers. Months of narcotics killings have followed. One grisly slaughter that Mr. Barrio attributed to Mr. Munoz and his Tijuana henchmen came last August when gunmen sprayed a Ciudad Juarez restaurant with gunfire, killing six.
In recent weeks, Mr. Munoz has appeared to retreat from Ciudad Juarez, a Mexican official said. But Thomas L. Kennedy, the D.E.A.'s special agent in charge in El Paso, recently told an Austin television station, KTBC, that he expected the street wars between Mr. Munoz and his rivals to continue. "It's liable to end up in a crescendo of violence, a real blood bath, before somebody backs down," Mr. Kennedy said.

HEADLINE: AT&T Data Network Fails And Commerce Takes a Hit

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
From Monday afternoon until yesterday afternoon, companies and consumers across the United States were given an unsettling lesson in just how dependent on vast computer networks the commerce of everyday life has become.
A few million people found that their credit cards were useless and automated teller machines at banks were dead because a national high-speed data network of the AT&T Corporation had crashed. The network breakdown did not affect the conventional or cellular telephone service of customers of AT&T. Nor did it interrupt Internet access. But the flow of data for transactions involving credit cards, bank accounts, travel reservations and the like were seriously disrupted. 
 AT&T is the nation's largest supplier of data network services to companies. The data network was restored to nearly normal operation by yesterday afternoon, but its collapse was the worst such failure ever, industry experts agreed. They said it was the data network equivalent of the breakdown of AT&T's long-distance switching system in January 1990, when about half of the nation's long-distance calls ended in busy signals or recorded messages for nine hours.
"This sort of thing is going to happen infrequently, but more and more in the future," said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a technology research firm. "And it makes you realize how vital to the lifeblood of the economy these complex computer networks have become."
Mr. Anderson had firsthand experience with the problem. In a telephone interview yesterday afternoon, he said he had just emerged from a Tower Records store in San Jose, Calif., where there had been a long line of frustrated customers, whose credit card transactions could not be processed. "I had cash, so it was great for me," Mr. Anderson said. "I went straight to the front of the line."
The impact of the network breakdown was uneven. Some businesses and institutions noticed slowdowns. These included Northwest Airlines, in its processing of reservations, and the American Red Cross, in the tracking of its blood supply. At the Wells Fargo Bank the automated teller machines at 1,023 branches in California went dead for several hours, but 520 other branches in the state were unaffected.
By late yesterday, Wells Fargo had enlisted the help of MCI Communications, Roseville Telephone and 3Com to hastily patch together a backup network.
"We've never had a failure like this before, but we were able to restore service in about seven hours," said Sherry Nash, Wells Fargo's senior vice president in charge of data networks.
There is no way to estimate just how much business was lost nationwide because of the data network breakdown. But the losses are likely to be big, since thousands of companies were affected and many of those do business in hundreds or thousands of locations.
Tele-Communications Inc., a leading cable-television system based in Denver, was one of the few companies that had estimated its losses by last night. Rex Mammel, a network administrator, calculated them at as much as $5 million. The losses, he said, resulted from the inability of TCI representatives who field requests for pay-per-view services, installation and repairs at 500 offices to log in to the company's central data base to get access to billing information or to process orders.
The AT&T network that went down is known as a frame relay network -- named for the method it uses to handle data at high speeds. The data packets are sent almost instantaneously over fiber optic telecommunications lines and complex switches nationwide.
AT&T's frame relay network has 145 switching hubs, or nodes. The company executives said yesterday that the exact cause of the breakdown had not been determined. But one executive said that the problem began with a data transmission between two hubs on the network -- one in Albany and another in Cambridge, Mass. The problem cascaded uncontrollably to the other hubs in the network, for some as-yet-undetermined reason.
Frank Ianna, AT&T's vice president for network and computer services, said it would probably take two to three days to pinpoint the precise cause of the breakdown. He said the cause was most likely "some combination of hardware and software" failure.
In a conference call yesterday, C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman of AT&T, told reporters, "Frankly, these outages have let our customers down, and I want to apologize to each and every one of them."
Until the cause of the network breakdown is found and solved, Mr. Armstrong said, AT&T frame relay customers will not be charged. For AT&T, frame relay services are a $1- billion-a-year business, growing at more than 30 percent annually.
Indeed, throughout the telecommunications industry, data transmission services -- far more than voice services -- are the high-growth business for the future.
And as these networks grow and handle more traffic, industry experts predict, all the suppliers will inevitably experience breakdowns.

HEADLINE: The Waiting Game

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
For the last few years, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has assumed the role of an expectant suitor, twirling a corsage in his hands and waiting for George M. Steinbrenner 3d to appear at the door with an answer to the overriding question:
Will the Yankees' owner keep his team in the Bronx, demand that a new stadium be built in Manhattan, or move to some meadow in New Jersey? 
 Mr. Steinbrenner has played coy with so many others -- including two previous New York City Mayors, two New York governors and three New Jersey governors -- and has demurred so often that many have lost patience. But not the lifelong Yankee fan named Giuliani; he knows that if the Yankees leave the city under his watch, the future will remember less the dramatic reductions in crime and more the loss of a beloved baseball team.
And so Mr. Giuliani has sat, eager to please, awaiting word.
"The Yankees have been a cherished institution in this town for many decades," said Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro. "It's worth a little patience and a lot of effort to keep them here."
But now, the crash of a chunk of steel and concrete from the aged ballpark's rafters Monday afternoon may drastically change the prolonged flirtation between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Steinbrenner, and the Mayor may soon face the prospect of having to persuade the city that it has to build a new stadium. A person involved in the Yankees' strategic planning said yesterday that Mr. Steinbrenner was intent on leaving the Bronx once his city lease expires in 2002, and saw the chunk that fell from the ceiling as a convenient sign from the heavens.
The insider, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said team officials believe that the 75-year-old stadium is not worth refurbishing. It would cost as much as $850 million to provide the amenities that the team says are needed -- the luxury suites, the additional parking, the connection to the Metro North railroad line -- and that money, team officials feel, could be better spent elsewhere.
Namely, the West Side of Manhattan.
There, the Yankees could enjoy the flow of fans that have boosted revenues for other teams with new stadiums -- like the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians.
In truth, Mr. Steinbrenner has favored leaving the Bronx for many years. He has practiced the curious marketing strategy of describing the stadium's neighborhood as unsafe to visitors and impractical for cars, and ignored evidence that on game days the area is flooded with police officers and is about the safest in the city. He has also been largely unreceptive to talk of building a new stadium near the old one, which would salvage some historic connection between the team and the Bronx.
If indeed Mr. Steinbrenner plans to deliver an ultimatum to the city, then Mr. Giuliani will be faced with one of his greatest challenges as Mayor.
He knows that New Jersey business leaders are often seen in the owner's box at Yankee Stadium, and that a private consortium could come up with a tantalizing package for Mr. Steinbrenner. Some officials dismiss the New Jersey option as nothing more than a bargaining ruse. If that is so, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman played along yesterday by saying that if Mr. Steinbrenner expressed interest, she would welcome the Yankees "with open arms" and provide them with various economic incentives.
"There are all sorts of places we could point to that would lend themselves to that kind of a facility," she said. "We have some excellent sites, well within the reach of the current New York fan."
The Mayor also knows that like himself, most city residents want the Yankees to remain in the Bronx. Even though Mr. Steinbrenner describes the borough as being somewhere in New England, a subway trip from midtown Manhattan to the stadium takes only 20 minutes. But the Mayor has signaled that the only hope for the Bronx is a new stadium.
"The question with the Yankees is where, not whether, they're going to have a new baseball field," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday. "They should have a new baseball field. And before this incident occurred, the justification for that was economic."
Given Mr. Steinbrenner's apparent distaste for the Bronx, the Mayor has one final, controversial option: to help finance the construction of a stadium on a concrete platform over rail beds along the Hudson River, between 30th and 33d Streets. Unfortunately, when the Mayor announced this option two years ago, he did so without first gathering the support of the Pataki administration, various West Side politicians and other affected parties.
Now, if the Manhattan plan is the only option for keeping the Yankees in New York, the Mayor has to counter the opposition of community boards and environmentalists west of Sixth Avenue. He also would have to persuade the city to see beyond the $1 billion cost and recognize the larger picture -- of families strolling down glamorous Eighth Avenue toward the House That Steinbrenner Wanted and Giuliani Built.
For now, the Mayor and his aides are deflecting any potential criticism by blaming Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, for creating an environment so hostile that Mr. Steinbrenner could be forgiven for wanting to leave. "His inflammatory rhetoric and personal insults of the Yankee owner cannot possibly help keeping the Yankees in the Bronx," Mr. Mastro said. "It's an unbelievable approach."
Mr. Ferrer disagreed, and continued to taunt Mr. Giuliani for trying to placate a businessman who has maligned his borough for so long. Here is his simple solution to negotiations that have become so complicated:
"Let's repair what needs to be repaired, jump-start these talks, and forget about these plans for the West Side," he said. "Let's finally come to grips with the reality of the situation."

HEADLINE: American Airlines' Chief To Step Down

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Robert L. Crandall, the combative chief of American Airlines who helped develop many of the modern airline industry's most significant innovations, including frequent-flier programs and sophisticated computer reservation systems, will retire as chairman and chief executive next month, an executive close to the company said yesterday.
Mr. Crandall, 62, will announce his decision at a board meeting today, the executive said, and will leave his post in mid-May. He will be succeeded by Donald J. Carty, who is the airline's president and has been Mr. Crandall's heir apparent since he was named to that post in 1995. A spokesman for American declined to comment. 
 While Mr. Crandall was expected to retire within the next few years, his decision to do so now still came as a surprise.
But analysts said that even though he was so closely identified with the airline, his early departure would not have a significant effect on the carrier, which, along with other airlines, is enjoying a fourth straight year of record passenger traffic and profits.
The shares of the AMR Corporation, the airline's parent, have risen sharply during that time, closing yesterday at a 52-week high of $147.25, up $3.3125 from Monday.
"AMR has the deepest management pool in the industry," said Brian Harris, an airline analyst at Lehman Brothers. "To that extent, it is well positioned to absorb a significant management change."
But American Airlines without Mr. Crandall is hard for many followers of the industry to imagine. His intensity saw American Airlines through one of the industry's most tumultuous periods, after deregulation in 1978. Many of the best-known carriers -- Braniff, Eastern and Pan Am among them -- did not survive the shakeout.
A fearsome, chain-smoking workaholic with slicked-back hair and a gravelly voice, Mr. Crandall was the definition of a demanding executive. He scheduled meetings at 5 A.M. and was known for comparing the airline industry to war.
Indeed, his combative nature extended to the airline's relationship with its unions. There were several strikes under Mr. Crandall's watch. The most recent, last year, involved the pilots' union. That strike, which threatened the nation's travel system over the busy Presidents' Day weekend, was halted by President Clinton minutes after it started.
In 1993, the airline's flight attendants went on a five-day strike, also before a busy holiday period -- this time, Thanksgiving. And as in the later strike, President Clinton played a key role, nudging both sides toward a settlement.
But Mr. Crandall also leaves a legacy of innovations in the airline industry. Since he joined the airline in 1973 -- he took over as president in 1980 and became chairman and chief executive in 1985 -- American's innovations have ranged from frequent-flier mileage to computer reservation systems to sophisticated software for setting fares. When discount carriers started appearing in the wake of deregulation, American's reservation system gave it an edge in the battle for market share.
AMR sold a minority stake in the reservation system, called Sabre, to the public in an initial offering in 1996.
More recently, the airline has entered into a broad alliance with British Airways, a plan that is still awaiting regulatory action. And in February it announced an alliance with Japan Airlines that gave American a much stronger presence in Asia.
There have been strategic miscues, too.
In 1992, his effort to get the industry to adopt a simplified fare structure -- called value pricing -- to streamline the Byzantine system that evolved in the wake of deregulation ended in failure. Competitors, instead of following American's example, upped the ante in a series of fare wars that deepened the industry's heavy losses over the next few years before its recent recovery.
American ranks alongside United as one of the biggest United States commercial airlines, serving 349 destinations with 3,700 daily departures using a fleet of more than 850 aircraft.
Like other carriers, it has benefited enormously in recent years from a strong economy, rising demand for travel and lower fuel prices. Its parent company's 1997 earnings excluding one-time items totaled $972 million, up nearly 14 percent from $854 million the year before.
Mr. Crandall joined American in 1973 as senior vice president for finance and later was named head of the airline's marketing operations.
Last year, he received a base salary of $790,000, up from $750,000 the previous year, according to a company filing last month. Those figures did not include his bonus, which was $851,250 in 1996 but had not been determined for last year as of the time of the filing. He also received large grants of stock options in each year.
His retirement leaves only Herb Kelleher, the chairman and chief executive of Southwest Airlines, and Stephen Wolf, the chairman and chief executive of U S Airways, as the industry's remaining larger-than-life executives.
In an interview last year, Mr. Crandall hinted that he might not stay at American until the normal retirement age.
"I have no immediate plan to retire, but I probably won't stay until I'm 65," he said at the time. "There will be a graceful time to leave."

HEADLINE: Should Social Security Be Fairer?;
Remove the Salary Cap

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is astounding that in all the debates about fixing Social Security (Economic Scene, April 9) we have yet to hear a simple solution: remove the salary cap of $68,400 for paying Social Security taxes. The contribution of 6.2 percent amounts to $4,240.80. This amount represents 4.7 percent of a $90,000 salary and 3.9 percent of a $110,000 salary. It is not difficult to observe that such a cap is regressive.

HEADLINE: Albany Lawmakers Pass Budget Only 2 Weeks Beyond Deadline

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 14

 BODY:
Breaking with its traditions of closed-door negotiations and budgets that are finished months after the deadline, the State Legislature today produced an election-year spending plan that provides far more money than the Governor had sought for state colleges, public education, child care and environmental programs.
The Legislature finished the budget for the 1999 fiscal year only two weeks after the previous fiscal year ended, a striking contrast to the 18 weeks beyond the deadline that the negotiations took last year and the 15 weeks the year before. In fact, the last time that the Legislature finished a budget this early was in 1993. 
 But the budget, the most generous in a decade, still requires the approval of Gov. George E. Pataki, who was largely excluded from this year's negotiations after rank-and-file members of both houses of the Legislature held public budget talks for the first time ever. In past years, the budget was the product of secret three-way negotiations among the Governor and the leaders of the State Senate and the Assembly.
"We have changed the budget process this year so that we will never, ever return to the old ways," said Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, who in previous years helped keep a tight rein on budget talks.
Over the last two weeks, the Legislature had passed two of the eight bills that comprise the state budget. Today, it passed the other six bills.
Mr. Pataki said nothing about the budget today, but he has repeatedly warned that he was prepared to veto all or parts of any budget that spent more than the budget he proposed in January. But the situation creates something of an election-year quandary for Mr. Pataki. He must choose between accepting a budget that spends far more than his own and vetoing a host of popular programs as he seeks re-election.
His main rivals in the Legislature, the Democrats who control the Assembly, have said they would not try to override any vetoes that he makes, suggesting that they would be happy to let him take the political heat for cutting cherished programs.
This afternoon, the Governor's office released a terse one-page statement saying that administration officials would have nothing to say until they had completed a full review of the Legislature's budget. "We will not comment on any specific aspect of the package until this overall budget analysis is complete," Robert L. King, the Governor's budget director, said in the statement.
Despite spending increases totaling more than half a billion dollars, legislative leaders from both major parties insisted that their budget does not spend more than the $71.6 billion budget that the Governor proposed in January. That is possible, they contend, because his budget greatly overestimated the cost of welfare and health care expenses by hundreds of millions of dollars.
Even so, the budget passed today, which legislative leaders estimated to total $71.46 million, clearly exceeds the spending targets in many categories in Mr. Pataki's original proposal. The budget increases spending on schools by $960 million, to about $11.9 billion, an 8 percent increase over the preceding year. Over all, the Legislature's plan calls for $400 million more for schools than the Governor proposed. New York City stands to receive more than $4 billion for its schools.
The plan also provides an additional $500 million for school construction and repair projects that would begin as early as April of next year. That would be on top of the nearly $900 million a year that was included in the Governor's original budget.
The plan was hailed as a victory by an assortment of educational groups, from the teachers' union to school board members and administrators. "If ever there was a year to make education a funding priority, this was it," said Alan B. Lubin, president of New York State United Teachers. "Legislative leaders have shown tremendous leadership in directing resources to public schools, which are facing daunting challenges."
The Legislature also provided significantly more money than the Governor had sought for child care. The legislative plan triples the amount that Mr. Pataki sought for child care, to more than $200 million. The bulk of the money would be spent to subsidize free slots in child care for low- and moderate-income families.
The plan also provides $20 million to finance after-school programs for schoolchildren, and an additional $100 million for public colleges and universities. And it calls for the state to issue $25 million in bonds to build day care centers across the state.
"This budget will help kids and families all over New York," said Michael Kink, the legislative coordinator for the Children's Defense Fund. "All of our kids will benefit from these much-needed improvements."
The plan also includes about $40 million that the Governor did not seek to replace dirty coal furnaces in some schools and clean up hazardous waste sites and municipal drinking-water systems.
The budget passed today does include many of the Governor's original proposals, including the acceleration of a scheduled property tax cut, only for the low-income elderly, at a cost of $537 million. It also includes an array of tax cuts that the Governor did not seek, costing the state $743 million by the year 2002 when fully in effect. The bulk of them are business taxes, the largest being a drop in the top corporate income tax rate to 7 1/2 percent from 9 percent.
The budget package also includes a slew of tax cuts for individuals, including an expansion of the earned-income tax credit for poor and middle-income families and an increase in the child care tax credit at a cost of $50 million to the state.
But the Legislature rebuffed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's request to eliminate the sales tax for clothing. Instead, it eliminated the tax for clothing items that cost $110 or less.
Fiscally conservative groups warned that the Legislature's plan would create huge fiscal problems for the state in the coming years because it assumes that the state will continue to benefit from an upswing in the economy that is largely driven by the boom on Wall Street.
They also criticized the Legislature's decision to borrow an additional $200 million to pay for a variety of programs, including $40 million to build apartments for homeless mentally ill people in New York. They said the borrowing was irresponsible and would add to the already huge debt load of $34 billion.
"It's clear that the legislators don't know what to do with taxpayer money other than to spend it as fast as they can," said Brian Backstrom, vice president of Change-NY, an anti-tax group. "Despite all the posturing, the spending additions in this budget spell only fiscal disaster. They have locked in long-term spending and long-term debt based on a one-time upturn in the economy."

HEADLINE: The City by the Bay Holds Its Collective Breath

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 14

 BODY:
For almost three decades the BankAmerica Corporation's 52-story headquarters has been a dominating presence on this city's skyline, but in the aftermath of the bank's planned $60 billion merger with the Nationsbank Corporation many people here are wondering if that presence will fade to a shadow.
Word that the largest bank merger in history might remove a financial institution intertwined with San Francisco's rich history dating to the 1906 earthquake has rocked the city. 
 Reports that the merger might cost 5,000 to 8,000 jobs nationally were interpreted here to mean that San Francisco was particularly vulnerable. The bank's middle-management jobs are obvious candidates for relocation from San Francisco, one of the nation's most expensive cities, to Nationsbank's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., where the cost of living is much lower.
Still, today nobody could state with authority what the actual job impact of the merger would be.
When he was awakened with the news Monday morning, Mayor Willie Brown called the deal an "economic disaster" for San Francisco. By the afternoon, however, after speaking with the BankAmerica chairman, David A. Coulter, the Mayor had changed his mind and suggested to reporters that there was a potential for new jobs.
The combined bank's vision as it was announced is a formidable power with twin centers, in which Charlotte will be the headquarters and San Francisco will serve as the hub of an expanding international presence. Indeed, Mr. Coulter said he planned to remain in San Francisco, and most analysts consider him the leading candidate to succeed Hugh L. McColl Jr., who will become the merged banks' chairman.
However, many San Franciscans view the city's almost century-long relationship with the bank as intricate and intimate, and the symbolic departure of its headquarters to the East Coast was cause for alarm.
Indeed, the bank's founder, A. P. Giannini, had twin visions of creating a bank that was national in scale but attentive to the needs of the "little people," reflecting San Francisco's blue-collar roots.
"In one sense he'd be thrilled and in an another sense he'd be spinning in his grave," said Warren Hellman, chairman of Hellman & Friedman, a private equity fund and a descendant of the family that created the Wells Fargo Bank, BankAmerica's main California rival.
Indeed, the city has been transformed from its origins as a seaport and manufacturing town at the turn of the century into the financial center of the Pacific Rim.
But San Francisco has maintained a love affair with the image of Mr. Giannini setting up his bank outside on a rough-hewn desk in the ruins of the 1906 earthquake and fire to help finance the rebuilding of the city.
The banker took that passion to finance the state's agricultural, movie and oil businesses in the first half of the century.
"When grandpa started the bank he went up and down California's Central Valley telling the farmers, 'Put your money in my bank and you'll make money,' " said Virginia Hammerness, who is Mr. Giannini's granddaughter.
The merger represented a betrayal of Mr. Giannini's dream, she said. "They sure sold out San Francisco," she said. "I'm hung up on loyalty and there isn't any here."
A number of the city's leaders expressed similar concerns about losing a powerful financial institution and corporate citizen -- BankAmerica contributed $5 million to San Francisco organizations in 1997. The bank has been a significant contributor in areas from the American Conservatory Theater to the city's welfare-to-work program, from financing projects ranging from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Hetch Hetchy water project.
"I'm pessimistic," said Michael Yaki, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. "I'm worried that those decisions will be relocated to Charlotte and have an impact on the health of our civic and social institutions."
BankAmerica's magnet effect has created a financial climate that will be difficult to duplicate, he said.
"Their corporate headquarters has meant mega-jobs and mega-deals and has made the city a financially hip place to be," he said. "That's something you can't replace."
Despite San Francisco's anxiety over BankAmerica's future, its relationship with the bank has in recent years become more strained. The main reason is a whistle-blower lawsuit brought by more than 250 cities and the State of California accusing the bank of defrauding the public by taking more than $1 billion from Government bank accounts to pay for salaries, consultants and other expenses.
"It was like finding out that your best friend has been cheating with your wife," the deputy city attorney, Marc Slavin, said. He attributed the change to a modern economy in which corporations lose touch with their home communities.
"It's a symptom of the globalization of the economy," he said.
That fact struck home directly with Tom Lieser, the executive director of the University of Los Angeles at California Anderson Forecast, a regional economic forecasting group. As a teen-ager in 1956, Mr. Lieser opened a passbook savings account with Home Federal Savings in Tulsa, Okla. On Monday, after that bank was merged for the sixth time, Mr. Lieser's account was finally taken over by BankAmerica.
"It's a microcosm of what's happened in this industry," he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 17, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about the impact of a planned merger between BankAmerica and Nationsbank on BankAmerica's home, San Francisco, misstated the university affiliation of Tom Lieser, an economic forecaster who was quoted on such consolidation. It is the University of California at Los Angeles (not the University of Los Angeles at California).

Dreams, and Now Hope, Among the Ruins

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
EXPOSED steel girders stand out rudely against the sky, rusted reminders of what were once finely detailed brownstones. On the same block, the interiors of prime examples of High Victorian architecture are mostly gone. The evening light shines through Gothic windows missing their glass.
For 17 years, residents of the Mount Morris Park neighborhood in Harlem have lived with the eerie block facing their park -- the block they call "the Ruins." No one passing would dream that these derelict brownstones -- seized in the 1960's by the state for an urban renewal project, which never happened -- were once the centerpiece of the neighborhood's landmark district. 
But now the renters and homeowners -- a hearty group of urban pioneers who fought to restore this block and the blocks around it -- say they are finally starting to imagine their world with the Ruins reclaimed.
"We've had so many disappointments that 'hope' is not the word," said Conrad Neblett, 42, an actor who has lived there for seven and a half years. "But there's a light I begin to see at the end of the tunnel. It doesn't matter what politician did what. The time is right."
A number of significant projects are coming to Mount Morris, a half-square-mile area loosely bordered by Park Avenue, 125th Street, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 116th Street. In this neighborhood -- where beauty ignores the blight next door -- incomes, rents and house prices are rising. Middle-class professionals, who came to the more pristine Hamilton Heights blocks to the north in search of a mansion, are buying the cheaper brownstones here, "the finest brownstones in the city," said Karen Ansis, a director at the New York Landmarks Conservancy.
Nobody knows how Mount Morris Park -- officially renamed Marcus Garvey Park in 1973, although the neighborhood still goes by Mount Morris -- got its name. It was originally conceived as one of Manhattan's little squares, said Andrew S. Dolkart, an architectural historian. Wherever the "Morris" came from, the "Mount" seems obvious: there is a huge craggy rock ledge in the middle of the park.
The area to the west of the park -- where the grandest brownstones stand -- was one of the first in Harlem to be developed for housing after the Els came in; the rows along Mount Morris Park West were constructed around 1885. White Protestants came first, Mr. Dolkart wrote, followed by Eastern European Jews and, in the 20's, African-Americans.
Now, there is a feeling among the residents of Mount Morris that all of Harlem is being rediscovered: Disney is coming to Harlem to be part of an entertainment megamall; Radio Shack and Home Depot are imminent. This, as one local resident said, is "the second Harlem Renaissance."
It could also be the renaissance of Mount Morris.
Last week, Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, announced a $4.65 million grant that will help to build 119 three-family row houses, near Marcus Garvey Park, for low- and moderate-income residents. The state will match that with $3 million; $7 million more will come from the city and $31 million from private developers.
Another public-private development, Anchor Partnership Plaza, will create 600 co-op apartments -- including penthouses -- for buyers with varied incomes. Beneath these co-ops will be a retail complex with tenants like the Gap and Starbucks.
But the most exciting report, Mount Morris pioneers say, is that all but one of the 10 state-owned houses that make up the Ruins will be transformed, turning the eyesore into 34 luxury condominiums.
This week, in an interview, a spokesman for Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, confirmed that the Ruins project is going forward. The development team for the $6 million renewal has been chosen, he said, and a ground breaking is scheduled for this fall.
"Mr. Gargano saw the Ruins as a betrayal in that community," said Randy Daniels, the senior vice president in charge of economic revitalization for Empire.
Neighborhood residents say that despite their initial skepticism, they believe the Ruins will once again become homes. "We've been very vocal at every step," said Kellyn Tillers, 35, who represents the Mount Morris Park Community Improvement Association in talks about the fate of the Ruins.
"I believe it will happen," she said, sitting with members of the group in the spacious third-floor apartment she rents in a brownstone on West 121st Street.
"It will happen because the people here were pioneers," she said. "They put down roots that finally ripened. The people moving here -- that's why the developers are rushing in here now."
DR. JOAN DAWSON, who runs the federally financed Desegregation Assistance Center, based at New York University, bought her house on Malcolm X Boulevard in 1983. "We've seen organizations sort of 'spot develop,' where one house is renovated but another is abandoned," she said. "So, before the renovation is finished, the rest of the block is in a state of blight. The attempts they made, at best, weren't working."
In the Mount Morris area, the rate of home ownership is one of the lowest in the city, which itself has one of the lowest in the country: 6.5 percent in Mount Morris, compared with 29 percent citywide, compared with 48 percent nationally.
"We all wanted to see home ownership increase," said Steven Brown, the vice president of the New York City Housing Partnership, the nonprofit agency that, along with the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development, is spearheading both the federally sponsored new housing and Partnership Plaza, as well as many of the area's rehabilitation projects.
Dr. Dawson, 61, who rents out part of her grand Queen Anne-style house at the corner of 122d Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, credits the recent improvements in Mount Morris to the Republican Administrations of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki. Others credit the booming economy and the Clinton Administration.
"There is an aliveness now," she said. "Harlem has lived with a myth that everything is terrible and that there is no middle class up here. But as people venture up here for our annual house tour -- those house tours have done a lot -- they see the beauty."
To Secretary Cuomo, it was the sheer number of new home-ownership development and retail projects that clinched the decision to award the community the $4.65 million. Like Dr. Dawson, he had seen too many single-house renovations, followed by a double or triple abandonment.
"I'm a big believer in critical mass," he said. "If you have a distressed neighborhood, and you do something very small, it doesn't turn around the dynamic."
The Federal money for the new construction is being directed at vacant land created during the 1960's urban renewal. It will be used primarily to reduce the income necessary to qualify to buy the houses: from $32,000 to $25,000 a year, with an upper limit of $70,000.
With the subsidies, the three-family houses will sell for about $230,000. Under the plan, the buyers will live in one apartment and rent out the other two: two-bedroom apartments will rent for $900 to $1,200 a month.
The first of the three-section development, the 135-unit Shabazz Gardens, is scheduled for a ground breaking next month. Madison Park Homes, the next phase, will follow.
Maple Court, sponsored by nearby North General Hospital and built in 1995, served as a catalyst, and now a co-op development called Maple Plaza is going up next door.
"That was a real issue, the market for home ownership, particularly co-ops, in this part of Harlem," said Richard T. Roberts, the Commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Now, there is no longer a question: his department has helped to renovate 1,365 houses in the Mount Morris area -- all sold.
Anchor Plaza, the housing and retail development, will be located at the site of the 116th Street outdoor vendors' market. When the plaza is built, merchants will move to a more permanent souk across the street.
While Shabazz Gardens will incorporate Islamic symbols in its design (a sponsor is the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz mosque), longtime residents of Mount Morris want to see more of the late 19th century.
And these residents are not afraid of making their feelings known. "I am optimistic, but cautiously," said Patricia Pates Eaton, the founder of the Mount Morris community association, who owns an elegant neo-Grec town house facing the park.
Mrs. Eaton was here in 1981 when the state wanted to build a mental health center on the site of three brownstones along Mount Morris Park West. The community stopped the project -- but by then the three brownstones had been demolished.
Three years later, the state Corrections Department turned No. 10 Mount Morris Park West into a minimum security women's prison. In 1990, the feisty residents stopped yet another state plan: to expand the prison to the vacant but still-standing row houses to the south.
"I was here when they ripped off the facades to put in the mental health center -- that was one of the catalysts that really united us," she said. "The coming of the jail brought us into a marriage. We just couldn't believe in our entire landmark block they would put a jail!"
Now, the residents will turn their attention to getting rid of the prison at No. 10. A study prepared for Chase Bank by the New School for Social Research and City College, called "Rethinking the Ruins," discusses a proposal for luxury condominiums in Nos. 1 through 9 Mount Morris Park West. It also suggests new uses for No. 10 -- including a bed and breakfast.
The plans are all intriguing, the neighbors say. Yet, as they point out, they have been excited before: dreams have drifted around the place for decades. "When I see somebody actually dig a hole in the ground, then I'll believe it," Mrs. Eaton said. "When I see some dirt dug up, then I'll say, 'Gee whiz, they are getting busy.' "
The annual Mount Morris house tour will include 10 houses, among them Mrs. Eaton's, on June 14, 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. For information: (212) 369-4241.

HEADLINE: Innovative New Baton Keeps A School's Faculty Aquiver;
Still, Indiana's Dean Emphasizes Grace Notes In Adjusting a Venerable Institution's Themes

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Ind.

 BODY:
Accounts differ slightly, as they inevitably will in a highly politicized academic setting. But the tale, basically, is this:
When David G. Woods arrived on the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington last July as dean of the School of Music, after six years as dean of the College of Fine Arts at the University of Oklahoma, the Indiana University Opera Theater was presenting "Oklahoma!" and the producers decided to herald his arrival by having him take the stage on horseback at the end of the show. 
 It was not a white horse that he rode in on, evidently. (A few malcontents encountered on a recent visit to the campus said it looked more like a mangy pony.) By all accounts, the beast relieved itself onstage with a thud, somewhat undercutting the desired symbolism.
Mr. Woods, suave and affable, can afford to laugh about the incident now. In assuming control of the vast and influential school and beginning to put his own stamp on it, he seems to have won over most skeptics on the faculty (the curmudgeonly cellist Janos Starker being a notable exception).
Yet Mr. Woods's biggest challenges lie ahead: not least, establishing himself and maintaining the institution's standing on a national and even an international stage despite a graying faculty. The Indiana University School of Music has long been central to the life of classical music in this country, training great numbers of students at a high level and boasting alumni in virtually every major American orchestra and opera company as well the ranks of noted soloists.
"It's like reaching the top of a mountain," Mr. Woods said of his position, apologizing for the triteness of the metaphor. But it seemed less trite as Mr. Woods, who is an experienced mountaineer, continued: "You pull yourself up by your arms, and you're taking in a spectacular view, but at the same time you're gasping for breath in the thin air."
As dean, Mr. Woods succeeds not one legend but two: Wilfred C. Bain, who lifted the school to national prominence from 1947 to 1973, and Charles H. Webb, who consolidated that position over the next 24 years.
At 56, Mr. Woods cannot hope to rival their quarter-century tenures, since he (alone among the school's faculty members and administrators) is required by university regulations to retire at 65. But his term promises to be no less eventful, for the school finds itself at a problematic juncture.
The famous violin teacher Josef Gingold died three years ago, and other faculty members are elderly. Some music professionals throughout Indiana have questioned whether the school has done enough in recent years to attract young stars.
In 1994, the school was ranked No. 1 (in a tie with the Juilliard School of New York and the Eastman School of Rochester) for the quality of a master's degree in music in U.S. News & World Report's guide to the top American graduate schools. In 1997, Indiana slipped to No. 2 (in a tie with Juilliard, behind Eastman by a 10th of a percentage point, a shift that registered resoundingly on the school's sensitive Richter scale). The School of Music is often referred to as the jewel in the university's crown (except, perhaps, by fans of Bobby Knight's basketball Hoosiers). A first-time visitor to the campus could not help but be struck by the range of activity, from a vibrant jazz program, directed by David Baker, to an ambitious dance program, directed by Virginia Cesbron.
"It's the best school of ballet in the country," said Jeremy Collins, who interrupted his thriving career as a soloist at American Ballet Theater to study dance and chemistry (as a premedical student) in Bloomington.
But a preoccupation with sheer size also seems widespread. "Five Hundred Third Program of the 1997-98 Season" proclaimed the program sheet for a concert by the University Orchestra, the least experienced of the school's five orchestras. The season total will be more than 1,000 concerts, including opera performances every weekend.
The school has a $30 million annual budget and 1,738 students (981 graduate, 757 undergraduate), in contrast to Juilliard's $39 million and 810 students, including dance, and Eastman's $18 million and 730 students.The Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, at the other extreme, has a $6 million budget for 166 students.
"There is a pride in being large," Mr. Woods acknowledged. "But it comes out of a feeling that we need to be that big to produce all that we're producing."
Still, there is to be a reduction in the number of students next year to about 1,680, aimed at optimizing the ratio between students and teachers.
The faculty has 150 members, many of whom are prominent performers. These include not only veterans like Mr. Starker, the pianist Menahem Pressler, the horn player Myron Bloom and the soprano Martina Arroyo but also younger stars like the choral director Paul Hillier, the pianist Edward Auer, the trumpeter Stephen Burns and the bassoonist Kim Walker.
Yet it has always been difficult to attract top performers with thriving careers to Bloomington, which is remote from the world's musical capitals. (The closest major airport is in Indianapolis, 50 miles to the north.) And in recent years, economic trends have compounded the difficulty.
Mr. Webb, the former dean, who still lives in Bloomington, offered a vivid example. Gingold was the concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell when the university hired him in 1960, paying him approximately what he was earning in the orchestra. William Preucil, the current concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, Mr. Webb estimated, is making twice what the university could offer.
Typically, Mr. Webb said, a full professor makes $70,000 and can add $15,000 by teaching in summer. The top salary is about $110,000 a year. Mr. Preucil earned $206,000 from the Cleveland Orchestra in the fiscal year 1995-96, according to the orchestra's latest filing to the Internal Revenue Service, a public document.
Faculty members are in theory given only 15 days' leave a semester to pursue performance opportunities elsewhere. "It opens your eyes when you hear that," said Santiago Rodriguez, a concert pianist who teaches at the University of Maryland and declined an offer to teach at Indiana. His reasons included a generous counteroffer from Maryland, allowing liberal absences.
 
Performing Teachers Seen as a Benefit
"Obviously, you have to be around much of the time, and you don't abuse this privilege," he said. "But it benefits the university to have its teachers perform a lot. I first heard of Indiana University not because of the School of Music itself but because that's where Janos Starker and Menahem Pressler were."
In fact, several faculty members said, Indiana applies the 15-day limit loosely. Yet Mr. Woods allowed that still greater latitude may be required to attract top performers.
As an example of the sort of performer he wants, he cited Carter Brey, who became principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic in 1996. But would Mr. Brey be able to keep his Philharmonic position?
"His residence could be here, and he could work in New York," Mr. Woods said. "We could work out a professional arrangement."
Mr. Webb, who expresses support for his successor on most other issues, bristled at this notion and the extended absences it would entail. "That would be a real change in philosophy," he said. "I firmly believe that systematic study is the key to long-term progress, and that requires faculty members to live in Bloomington."
Mr. Pressler, who had just returned from two weeks of performances in Europe and who, as a member of the search committee that chose Mr. Woods, is generally a firm supporter, agreed.
"That's absolutely unrealistic," he said. "It would be a complete change. You have to be here to go to meetings, to have influence, to be active in the governing of the school."
In Mr. Brey's case, evidently, it is all academic. He has not been contacted by anyone at the university, he said. "I hate to disappoint them," he added, "but I have more than enough to do."
The school's traditions are a sensitive issue for Mr. Woods. Yet change appears, in at least some vague sense, to have been part of his mandate. The faculty seems to have been unanimous in wanting someone hired from outside the university. However beloved Mr. Webb had been, the consensus was that it was time for a change after a half-century of similarity if not sameness.
But there the unanimity ended. Performers dominate the faculty, which also includes composers, musicologists, music theoreticians and music educators, and many felt that the new dean should be primarily a performer, like Mr. Webb, who plays piano and organ. Mr. Woods plays saxophone, but his professional activity (like Bain's) has centered on music education.
"He is a very nice man," said Mr. Starker, who opposed the choice of Mr. Woods and is still grudging in praising him. "Of the finalists, he was definitely the best," Mr. Starker said. "But some, like myself, wanted a performing musician and were violently opposed to the way the choice was made. Ultimately his success or failure will depend on his hiring of future faculty members."
Others cite additional criteria. In a university, a town and an area where blacks are few, only 32 students in the School of Music are black. Mr. Baker, the director of the jazz program and a black; Ms. Arroyo, and others say they are tired of waiting for action on this front. "I've been ready to leave," Mr. Baker said. "The appearance of the new dean is an opportunity. I'll give it a year, and if it looks as though he's making progress, I may stay longer."
Mr. Woods's initiatives to date have been in other areas. He has negotiated a "distance learning" program with the Royal Academy of Music in London, so that courses can be exchanged with live audio and visual hookups.
 
Hometown Recitals Foster Audiences
He has also established a series of hometown recitals. All graduating seniors who are from Indiana (about a quarter of the undergraduates) are encouraged to present their commencement recitals not only on campus but also, as conquering heroes, in their hometowns.
Here, in trying to foster new audiences and a closer relationship with the public at large, Mr. Woods is modestly but imaginatively addressing one facet of the crisis said to afflict the classical-music world today. He seems to have no illusions, however, that he can solve such cosmic issues, or even those closer to home, singlehandedly.
"I've argued in budget meetings that this is the best school of music in the world, and it needs to have the best salaries," he said. "We can't be just the name Indiana University anymore."
Where is a white horse when you need one?

HEADLINE: Commerce Secretary Seeks Compromise on Encryption

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's attempts to control encryption technology have been a failure and are forcing American software makers to concede ground to foreign competitors, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said today.
Mr. Daley's remarks, made in a speech here to the high-technology industry, were the strongest indication yet that the Administration was seriously considering parting ways with Louis Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other law enforcement and spy agencies over the issue of how data should be scrambled. 
 "We are headed down a lose-lose path, and we have to get back to win-win," Mr. Daley said. He blamed both industry and law enforcement officials for the failed policy, saying that the two sides had failed to find a reasonable compromise between the need to monitor the activities of criminals and the need to offer consumers strong security for on-line transactions.
The purpose of his speech today was to release the Commerce Department's first comprehensive report on the impact of electronic commerce on the nation's economy. The report shows that information technology, including business on the Internet, is growing twice as fast as the overall economy, employing some 7.4 million workers at salaries 64 percent above the national average.
But while the report was full of impressive numbers and glowing predictions for the future, Mr. Daley said that strong encryption and a solid encryption policy were essential if electronic commerce was to realize its full potential.
Mr. Daley's blunt comments marked the first public acknowledgment that the Clinton Administration's encryption policy had failed. And his remarks echoed what the industry has contended for years -- that foreign companies are fast taking over the high-demand market for products that protect the privacy of communications.
The software industry is currently prohibited from exporting strong encryption programs, which scramble data in ways that make it difficult or impossible for unauthorized people -- including law enforcement agencies -- to decode. Such software is essential to electronic commerce, which requires that credit card information and other private data be encrypted when products are ordered on the Internet.
The software industry has long argued that the export rules put American companies at a great disadvantage relative to foreign competitors not under such restrictions. Mr. Freeh and the National Security Agency argue that the threat of terrorists and other criminals scrambling data to thwart law enforcement is so great that the export restrictions should be removed only if the police are given keys to unlock encrypted data.
At the end of 1997, Mr. Daley said, an estimated 656 encryption products were being produced in 29 countries outside the United States. Products from Germany, Ireland, Canada, Israel and Britain can compete with anything made domestically, he said, and can meet the needs of the world's computer networks.
"Our policy, ironically, encourages the growth of foreign producers at the same time it retards growth here," Mr. Daley said. He called for a sincere dialogue between industry and law enforcement, but stopped short of saying that the Administration would withdraw its support of the F.B.I. and N.S.A. position.
"There are solutions out there," Mr. Daley said. "Solutions that would meet some of law enforcement's needs without compromising the concerns of the privacy and business communities. But I fear our search has thus far been more symbolic than sincere.
"The cost of our failure will be high. The ultimate result will be foreign dominance of the market. This means a loss of jobs here, and products that do not meet either our law-enforcement or national security needs."
Mr. Daley declined to offer examples of what the Administration might be willing to give up to reach an agreement.
Industry officials, however, said there was no room for compromise.
"People want complete privacy," Peter F. McCloskey of the Electronic Industries Alliance said.
Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, said that companies were willing to continue discussions with the Administration, but he asserted that Government officials "think compromise is something in the middle; sometimes compromise is found outside of the box."
Mr. Miller said that the solution needed to be a technical one, perhaps one that gave law enforcement better training and equipment to crack encrypted criminal communications without requiring that everyone hand over spare keys to their computer files.
"Law enforcement has legitimate concerns," Mr. Harris said. "What we disagree with is their demand for unlimited access."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Few see bank consolidation as a harbinger of doomsday.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHILE the timing was dramatic, the news this week of two gigantic bank mergers shocked few economists who specialize in financial markets.
"This is the beginning of the catch-up game," explained Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Alexandria, Va. Legislation has prevented the creation of a dozen megabanks, he says, which would exist alongside hundreds or thousands of smaller independent ones. 
 Nor were economists wringing their hands last week over the competitive effect of what promises to be a rapid consolidation of the banking industry as Nationsbank seeks to merge with BankAmerica and Banc One seeks a union with First Chicago NBD. "There's just no way a bank can carve out a dominant position in the national market," argued George Benston, an economist at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Atlanta.
What qualms they had concerned the ability of the monster banks with one-size-fits-all lending policies to serve small businesses efficiently. But even the skeptics are hard pressed to come up with scary situations. "So long as entry into banking is relatively easy," said Lawrence White at New York University's Stern School of Business, "the niche players should sustain the small-loan market".
There is a sense of historical inevitability about bank consolidation. Every other developed economy has nationwide banking, with brand names and branches as ubiquitous as, say, Exxon gas stations in America. And while it is possible to find economists with serious worries about the integration of financial services as diverse as deposit-taking and the underwriting of casualty insurance a la Citcorp-Travelers, prohibitions against interstate branch banking have long been viewed by economists as a crude form of protectionism. "If the Supreme Court had simply ruled in the 19th century that the interstate commerce clause applied to banking, we would have gone the way of the rest of the world," Mr. Ely argues.
That said, there is still disagreement over the potential efficiencies in moving from a world of $30 billion regional banks to one of $300 billion national banks. The merged entities may get some mileage from closing branches, integrating computer systems and combining specialized services -- for example, financing trade with Latin America. But there is "extreme skepticism" among researchers that the cost saving will offset the inherent inefficiencies of running larger corporations, said Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve who teaches at Princeton University.
By the same token, it is only natural to worry that consolidation will lead to less competition and higher prices for banking services. Mr. Bentson flatly dismisses the notion, arguing that the effective level of competition will rise in most areas as banks buy into new markets through mergers.
Mr. White is a bit more circumspect. Large commercial customers, he agrees, have nothing to fear. Indeed, in an era when corporations have the option of selling commercial paper through securities markets and investing loose cash in a variety of interest-paying instruments, banks are struggling to stay in the game.
The packaging and reselling of mortgages, car loans and credit card debt has also created a secondary market for the bulk of consumer loans. No local bank can exercise monopoly power on mortgage rates if mortgage brokers can operate with little or no capital by selling the loans they make to Fannie Mae. No bank can jack up credit card interest rates without worrying its customers will take advantage of the next offer in the mail to consolidate their debt at a much lower introductory rate.
Mr. White's one area of concern is loans to small businesses. While most big banks welcome small-business customers, they are inclined to play by the numbers, mechanistically evaluating creditworthiness the way they evaluate risk on consumer credit. Hence businesses in unusual circumstances may not find a sympathetic ear.
But in a marketplace with thousands of independent banks, Mr. White concedes that potentially profitable niches tend to be filled. And with entry into banking relatively easy -- 188 new banks were chartered last year -- worries about the access of small businesses to credit seem overblown.
Are there real advantages to supersize in banking? Look closely at past decisions to merge, the cynics say, and all too often the key factor was the boss's wish to command more ink in Fortune or to trade the executive Learjet for a Gulfstream V.
But it is not the job of regulators to second-guess the motives in this latest round of merger mania, Mr. Blinder suggests. As long as industry consolidation threatens neither the competitiveness nor the stability of banking -- which they apparently don't -- this is a matter for the stockholders.

HEADLINE: New Projects Seek to Revive Battered Oklahoma City

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, April 15

 BODY:
For many, this city evokes the image of a dying child pulled from a smoldering ruin.
Even before a bomb destroyed the Federal Building here three years ago, killing 168 people, injuring hundreds and wrecking or damaging 300 other buildings, Oklahoma City had suffered. It was whipsawed by the collapse of the oil and gas industry in the 1980's, beaten by competitors in the race for new industry and had little to offer in the way of entertainment. 
 When people from Oklahoma City and the surrounding area went looking for fun, they had to drive more than three hours to Dallas.
But on Thursday the city will begin to offer a more hopeful image and a new set of memories as it opens a minor league baseball stadium, the first in a series of major projects to rebuild and refashion downtown.
Residents hope the developments will help them put the hard past behind them, said Bill Jeffries, a 39-year-old cement salesman. "This is a rebuilding, a new future," Mr. Jeffries said this week as he sat in Crabtown, one of several restaurants that have opened in recent years in Bricktown, an area of turn-of-the-century warehouses seven blocks southeast of the bomb site.
Jim Brewer, a local property owner involved in developing the area, said: "You can't just dwell on the past forever. You've got to get on with your life."
The Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark, with a seating capacity of 16,000, will be the home of the Oklahoma Redhawks, a class AAA affiliate of the Texas Rangers.
Eight other public projects are scheduled to be built in and around downtown by 2001, including a canal and walkway, and a trolley system. And the city's convention center will be renovated. A five-year, 1-cent sales tax passed in 1993, two years before the bombing on April 19, 1995, will raise about $300 million to pay for the projects.
At the same time, private investors are planning to build two hotels and a 26-screen theater near the ball park.
A foundation is raising $24 million in public and private money to build a memorial at the bomb site, and the Government is planning to relocate Federal offices in a new low-rise campus covering three blocks.
Many buildings near the site still have plywood over their windows. But others have been updated in an area that was once dotted with dilapidated structures.
The city now has about 100 corporations scouting it, three times the number in years past, said W. Andrew Burke, senior vice president for economic development at the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce.
No one here will say that the worldwide attention that Oklahoma City received immediately after the bombing is a cause for the city's revival. The economy across the country is booming, much of the planning for the projects began before the bombing and a chamber of commerce advertising campaign has helped raise the city's profile.
But Charles E. Nelson, chairman of Bank One, Oklahoma, said that amid the carnage, America saw Oklahoma City residents pull together. "I think the bombing provided some credibility for the message of what Oklahoma City is all about," Mr. Nelson said, "that it is a community that works and works well."
Ron Norick, who left office this week after 11 years as Mayor, agreed, saying, "After the bombing, everyone knows that people here are hard-working and family-oriented."

HEADLINE: Audrey Freedman Dies at 68; Specialized in Labor Issues

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Audrey Freedman, an economist who specialized in labor issues while working for the United States Government and in the private sector, died on Sunday in Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 68 and lived in Jackson Heights, Queens.
The cause of death was leukemia, her husband said. 
 Mrs. Freedman, who was born in Cleveland and graduated from Wellesley College, is credited with coining the term "contingent work force" to describe the army of part-time and temporary workers who are employed only for particular projects. She stressed the role of such jobs in enhancing a worker's skills and according business the flexibility necessary for raising the nation's productivity.
Mrs. Freedman also analyzed and explained the economic effects of "pattern bargaining," in which union contracts at one company set the pattern for agreements with other companies in the same industry.
From 1958 to 1973, Mrs. Freedman was a supervising economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, studying productivity. She was a staff member of the Cost of Living Council, the agency established to control prices in the early 1970's, during the Nixon Administration, and she represented the public members of the Pay Board as the liaison between the business and labor members.
In the 1980's, Mrs. Freedman joined the the Conference Board, a business research group, and later became a labor economics consultant and served on the board of Manpower Inc., the largest temporary-help service. At her death she was a member of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' business research advisory council, which she led last year.
Mrs. Freedman championed the cause of women in the workplace.
For example, in an Op-Ed article published in The New York Times in July 1989 -- replying to an article in The Harvard Business Review, which argued that it is more expensive for corporations to hire women than men, because women often divide their time between baby and career. Mrs. Freedman replied that the cost analysis that went into that equation was gender-biased.
Far more costly drains on corporate productivity, Mrs. Freedman wrote, are alcohol, drug abuse and corporate fraud -- practices found far more often among males than among females. "Another heavy but ignored cost of employing men," she asserted, "is their greater inclination to engage in destructive struggles for control. Corporate takeover battles waste billions of dollars in capital energy." Citing the union-management struggle over Eastern Airlines (which ended in the airline's liquidation 18 months later) she wrote, "Jobs are lost, capital is wasted, equipment unused and a service is being destroyed."
In parting, Mrs. Freedman wrote, "My modest suggestion is that corporations reconsider their easy acceptance of the proposition that it is more costly to employ women than men." Almost as arresting as her arguments is that the 800-word article was virtually bereft of statistics.
Mrs. Freedman is survived by her husband, Monroe Freedman, the Lichtenstein Distinguished Professor of Legal Ethics at Hofstra University; two daughters, Sarah Izquierdo of Miami Beach and Alice Korngold of Cleveland; two sons, Caleb, of Miami Beach and Judah, of Forest Hills, Queens, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Latin American Agenda

 BODY:
The Summit of the Americas in Chile later this week finds both Latin America and its relationship with the United States in far better health than in the recent past. Except for Cuba, which was barred from the summit, all the nations are nominally democracies. On most issues the mistrust and even hostility that once characterized Washington's relations with Latin nations have been replaced by cooperation. Still, Latin America has enjoyed a wave of elected civilian leadership twice before in this century. Insuring that this one lasts requires deepening democracy and extending the benefits of growth to the poor. There is more Washington can do on both counts.
While Washington's free-market policies have produced export-led growth, there are more poor people than ever before in Latin America. Economic inequality, already the worst in the world, is rising. Measures to fight poverty, especially through more widespread access to education, are prominent on the summit's agenda, and that of the Clinton Administration. But they are too small and scattered to be effective. Latin American budgets need to emphasize health and education, which in turn require improved tax collection. The Clinton Administration can help by promoting this agenda as vigorously as it promotes free trade. 
 Almost every Latin American nation now elects its leaders, but many of those leaders control the judiciary, muzzle the press, harass critics and restrict labor unions. The Clinton Administration is right to make press freedom a priority, and should work for an effective and independent judiciary as well. The regional training center for judges that Washington supports is useful, but pressure to respect judicial independence is more important.
The end of the cold war has brought a welcome shift away from Washington's blind support of repressive militaries and toward initiatives that train civilian leaders in defense issues and build relationships with them. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration's mistaken enthusiasm for using Latin armies to combat cocaine could reverse this positive change. President Clinton should reimpose a ban on selling high-tech weapons to Latin America. The decision to lift the 20-year ban last year, taken partly to please arms manufacturers, could spark an arms race and divert money from social spending that is so urgently needed throughout Latin America.

HEADLINE: Rise in Inventories Is Biggest in Five Months

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Inventories of goods jumped six-tenths of a percent in February, the biggest increase in five months, the Commerce Department reported today.
A buildup of unsold goods can herald an economic slowdown, but in this case economists were not concerned. Business sales also posted a strong rise, eight-tenths of a percent, for the best gain in three months. 
 And the ratio of inventory to sales, at 1.37, remained near its historic low of 1.36. That means it would take 1.37 months at the current seasonally adjusted monthly sales level of $770 billion to exhaust the $1.05 trillion in inventories.
Lynn Reaser, an economist at the Nationsbank Corporation in Jacksonville, Fla., attributed part of the buildup to stockpiling of Asian goods by wholesalers and manufacturers that are buying products made cheap by that region's currency crises.
Wholesale inventories shot up 1.1 percent in February. They rose five-tenths of a percent at factories and one-tenth of a percent at retailers.
Sales were strongest at the factory level, up 1.2 percent. They rose seven-tenths of a percent at retailers and five-tenths of a percent at wholesalers.
However, some of the sales were "borrowed" from the spring. Mild temperatures associated with the El Nino ocean current caused some consumers to make purchases they would normally have delayed.
In fact, an advance report on March retail sales, issued on Tuesday, showed that receipts slipped one-tenth of a percent.

HEADLINE: Statehouse Journal;
A Wisp of Scandal, but Nothing More

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, April 15

 BODY:
Below the gilded dome of Colorado's Capitol, it was business as usual for Gov. Roy Romer this week, signing bills, vetoing a tax cut and endorsing Democratic candidates for statewide offices.
Today's normalcy contrasts with the furor that followed the news conference 10 weeks ago when Governor Romer, who has been married for 45 years, admitted to maintaining a "very affectionate relationship" with a female aide. The story briefly flared across the nation's television screens and then disappeared with the kind of totality that must inspire envy in President Clinton, a political confidant of the Governor. 
 "It just hasn't had any effect," said State Senator Ken Chlouber, a Republican who faces the apparently hopeless task of rounding up enough Democratic defectors to override the Governor's veto of the tax cut.
Senator Chlouber, who sported ostrich-skin cowboy boots and a cougar-claw clasp for his string tie, added: "His private life is not any of my business, or of anybody else's. That's pretty much a Western attitude."
One week after Mr. Romer's news conference on Feb. 6, about 250 people gathered on the Capitol's granite steps to wave protest signs, including one reading, "Real Men are Real Moral."
But, by the end of February, local newspapers and the Governor's office reported a sharply diminished flow of angry mail about what some called "Roamin' Roy Romer." Early in March, a telephone poll of residents in the Denver area showed that the Governor's "favorability" rating had not budged from the January pre-news-conference level, 54 percent. His job-approval rating in March was 68 percent. The job-approval question was not asked in January.
"This was a pretty short scandal in terms of media life," said Floyd Ciruli, whose polling company, Ciruli Associates, conducted both polls.
In the only major change, the March poll detected a rise of 11 percentage points in the Governor's "unfavorable" rating, largely from disenchanted women, Republicans and the elderly. In contrast, his rating increased slightly among young people and men.
In a sign of the return to normal, Mike Rosen, one of Denver's leading talk show hosts, said he expected to see the Governor back at his studio next month for what had long been a monthly call-in program.
"We haven't seen him since the press conference," said Mr. Rosen, whose show is on KOA. "He's got to get past this one session, and then it will be ancient history."
In an interview this week at the Capitol, Governor Romer, who has a second job as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, preferred to talk about his legislative projects. Referring to the controversy over his relationship, which was disclosed by a conservative magazine, Mr. Romer said tersely, "That is behind me."
Overshadowing the flareup over the Governor's love life, at least for many here at the Statehouse, is his pending retirement because of term limits.
When Mr. Romer steps down next January at the age of 70, his departure from state office will mark the end of a generation of Democratic politicians who have dominated Colorado politics for almost a quarter century, when Mr. Romer started working as chief of staff to the newly elected Governor, Richard Lamm.
Mr. Lamm belonged to a political generation first elected in the 1970's that put a Democratic face on Colorado politics, particularly at the national level: Patricia Schroeder in the House of Representatives; Timothy E. Wirth, first in the House and then the Senate; Gary Hart in the Senate and Federico F. Pena first as Denver's Mayor and then in the Clinton Cabinet. Mr. Lamm and Mr. Romer each served three terms, allowing the Democrats to hold on to the governor's office for an unbroken 24 years.
But behind this high-profile Democratic facade, Colorado had been turning Republican. Over the last decade, registered Republicans surpassed registered Democrats, and today, Republicans have a 16 percent edge, 115,000 registered voters. Republicans account for about two-thirds of the commissioners in the state's 63 counties. Republicans control both houses of the state Legislature and six of the eight Congressional seats.
Now, for the first time in decades, Republicans believe they have a chance to win two new prizes: the governor's office and the Second Congressional District, in Boulder.
"The giants among Colorado Democrats are past," said State Treasurer Bill Owens, who is the leading Republican candidate for governor. "Colorado has moved from a battleground state to an almost dominant Republican state."
Dick Wadhams, manager of the Owens campaign, agreed, saying, "Nineteen ninety-eight could be looked upon as the year that really ended the era that began in 1974."
In his office across a marble hallway from the Governor's office, Mr. Owens predicted that last February's controversy over Mr. Romer's personal life would undermine his endorsement of the leading Democrat in the governor's race, Lieut. Gov. Gail Schoettler.
"It takes a little of the bloom off the argument that we need to continue the Romer legacy," Mr. Owens said. "After 24 years of Dick Lamm and Roy Romer, it is time for a change."
The Governor prefers to believe that his legacy will be a strong economy in which unemployment dropped by half and Denver real estate prices doubled.
Holding down two full-time jobs, Mr. Romer is known locally for being more of a workaholic than a sexaholic. In fact, at one White House function last year, he was seated next to Martha Stewart, the ubiquitous homemaking guru. After a brief pause, he politely inquired what she did for a living.

HEADLINE: Pennzoil and Quaker State Plan a Two-Stage Merger

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 15

 BODY:
Pennzoil and Quaker State, striving to endow motor oil with the clean cachet of toothpaste and detergent, announced plans today to combine into a new, dominant force in the sale and manufacture of automotive lubricants, waxes and additives.
The companies, already first and second in the nation's motor oil market, would together have a 36 percent share. In their two-stage plan, Pennzoil would spin its motor oil operations, Jiffy-Lube chain and related businesses into a new public company, yet unnamed. That company would then merge with the Quaker State Corporation in a stock swap, but their brand names would remain distinct. 
 The company formed by the merger would have sales of more than $3 billion and a likely market value of at least $1.5 billion. "It's going to be to car owners what Procter & Gamble is to households," said James L. Pate, Pennzoil's chief executive. Pennzoil itself would remain an independent petroleum exploration and production company.
For Pennzoil, the deal could help compensate shareholders dismayed by its rejection last year of a hostile, $4.2 billion takeover bid from Union Pacific Resources.
Mr. Pate denied that hard feelings from that offer, approved by shareholders in a nonbinding vote, had pressured Pennzoil into the Quaker State combination. "This has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the U.P.R. situation," he said. He and Herbert M. Baum, Quaker State's chief executive, had been discussing a deal for two years, Mr. Pate said.
The companies expect total annual savings of $95 million to $125 million. They also expect to cut some jobs.
Analysts agreed that Pennzoil and Quaker State would see some economies, but doubted whether they would improve their market share or product prices. "They should have taken the $84 a share from Union Pacific Resources," said Frederick P. Leuffer, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. "That's the bottom line."
Pennzoil shares gained $3, or 4.5 percent, to $69.8125. Quaker State, however, fell $3.6875, or 16 percent, to $19.8125. after having risen sharply for several weeks on rumors of its possible sale.
The deal was praised by one of Pennzoil's most critical investors, Guy Wyser-Pratte, a New York money manager who successfully pressured the company to lower its takeover defenses earlier this month. said: "Right as they turned down a big fat offer from Union Pacific Resources, they went and did something else." They're to be commended. A lot of other companies just let shareholders croak."
Pennzoil and Quaker State executives have been disappointed by investors' refusal to award their companies the lofty stock prices and earnings ratios accorded the makers of sweeter-smelling consumer products. Both companies are diversifying beyond motor oils, where Pennzoil has 21.5 percent of the market to Quaker State's 14.5 percent. Though these lubricants will account for about two-thirds of the new company's sales, it will also have brands including Blue Coral and Classic car waxes, Slick 50 and Gumout fuel additives and the Fix-a-Flat tire inflater. Like Pennzoil, the new company will be based in Houston, with Mr. Pate as its chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Baum as vice chairman. Mr. Baum, a former Campbell Soup executive hired to shake up the company in 1993, moved it from Oil City, Pa., to the Dallas suburbs two years later.
The companies said they envisioned no objections from Federal antitrust authorities, who had no comment today. In such cases, however, regulators consider not only national but also local market share, which, for these companies, is significantly higher in some cities.
For each share they hold, Pennzoil investors would also receive a share in the new company, while Quaker State investors would receive .82 share in the new company for every share they hold.

HEADLINE: An Aviation Innovator Departs

 BODY:
Robert Crandall of American Airlines, who is expected to retire next month, always believed he knew exactly what was right for the airline industry and never hesitated to challenge anyone who disagreed. But he also recognized, to the great benefit of his shareholders, when to junk nostrums that circumstances proved false.
Mr. Crandall knew that deregulation would be disastrous for his industry. But after the Carter Administration withdrew the regulatory safety blanket, he brilliantly constructed a complex hub-and-spoke system that brought passengers the steeply lower fares and vastly better flight schedules economists had predicted. Mr. Crandall also knew that sophisticated mathematics could maximize profit by tailoring different prices to different types of passengers. But when that approach grew too complicated, he adopted a simplified system and challenged his competitors to go along with his good idea. When they refused, setting off a destructive price war, he quickly let it drop and returned to a complex fare structure. 
 Mr. Crandall demonstrated that competition was good for consumers. But when upstart airlines grabbed his customers, he devised frequent-flier miles, an ingenious strategy that tied travelers to large airlines like American even when rivals were offering lower fares. Mr. Crandall knew that code sharing -- the practice by which two airlines would sell tickets on each other's connecting flights under the name of a single carrier -- was misleading because it fooled customers into believing they had booked a seamless flight. Yet when Mr. Crandall looked around and saw his competitors pairing up, he pounced, proposing a vast code-sharing arrangement with British Airways. If approved, it will help lock in American's dominant position at London's coveted Heathrow Airport.
With his background in finance, Mr. Crandall taught his colleagues about the vulnerability of an industry saddled with mammoth fixed costs -- an unoccupied seat represents unrecoverable revenue but no reduction in costs -- to pilot strikes and other business holdups. When he announced his retirement yesterday, his airline also boasted of record high profits and a management team ready to take over that would be the envy of other airlines. It was a precisely timed departure from a smart, combative leader and a nimble learner who left his mark on a turbulent sector of the American economy.

HEADLINE: TRACK AND FIELD;
Kenyan Runners in the U.S. Find Bitter Taste of Success

BYLINE: By MARC BLOOM 

 BODY:
At the 1997 Bolder Boulder, one of the country's top distance races, Kenyan men captured six of the first eight places. The year before, 8 of the top 10 finishers were Kenyan men.
Demoralized by the Kenyans' dominance, and frustrated that the talented, but taciturn, runners from the African country were perceived as marketing liabilities by the Colorado race's corporate sponsors, the race's organizers decided something had to be done. 
 This year, then, only three runners from Kenya, and three each from other other foreign countries, can compete, while Americans will be allowed unlimited entries. So although the Kenyans may still sweep the top three places next month, the race has been altered to give Americans a greater shot at some of the $32,000 in prize money. Indeed, any American finishing in the top five will earn double the normal cash prize.
"We hope to level the playing field," said Bill Reef, the director of next month's Boulder race. "It's our country, our event, our money. American sponsors want American winners, or at least Americans among the top finishers."
To the Kenyan runners, the change is the latest example of a broader campaign in recent years aimed at excluding foreign runners -- especially elite Kenyan runners -- from fully open competitions and thus limiting their fairly won earnings. To them, the effort is racist, against the spirit of competition and, in the end, tantamount to surrender by American sports officials who are, in effect, conceding that American runners have no chance against the world's best.
The efforts at limiting the presence of Kenyans, and with it the money they are making, has taken a variety of forms. Last summer, the George Sheehan five-mile race in Red Bank, N.J., used a team running format that excluded Kenyans. The Gate River Run 15-kilometer race in Jacksonville, Fla., and the Pittsburgh Marathon now award prize money only to Americans. The Gasparilla Distance Classic 15-kilometer race in Tampa, Fla., without a male American winner since 1989, recently announced that it would stop giving prize money.
The growing hostility toward foreign competitors has disillusioned runners like Godfrey Kiprotich, 31, whose racing earnings support his family of 10. Reached by telephone in the Rift Valley in Kenya, where he was preparing for New York's 10-kilometer Twosome in Central Park on April 25, Kiprotich said: "Last year, I won a race and got $2,500. The first American, far behind me, got $5,000. How can the American be motivated to run better?"
American distance runners, once a world force, are divided about the wisdom of excluding foreign runners or reducing their prizes. But no one disputes the reality at the heart of the debate: the scores of Kenyans who run for money in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are just too good.
"The current crop of Kenyans are the best distance runners the world has ever seen," said Keith Brantly, a 1996 American Olympic marathoner, who earlier this month finished ninth behind eight Kenyans in the Nortel Cherry Blossom 10-mile race in Washington. "They are not only slaughtering the Americans; they are slaughtering everybody."
 
Pick Any Distance, And a Kenyan Wins
The victory by a Kenyan, Simon Rono, at the Cherry Blossom race on April 5 gave Kenyans their sixth men's victory in eight races on the 1997-98 Professional Road Racing Circuit, which has 13 events and awards a total of $379,000 in men's prize money. Kenyans own the top 7 places and 12 of the top 14 in the overall standing. No American is in the top 25.
And the domination by Kenyans extends across all distance running, from road races to cross-country to marathons. Last year, Kenyan men swept the Boston, New York City and Honolulu marathons. In the Boston Marathon next Monday, the previous champions Moses Tanui and Cosmas Ndeti are favored to give Kenyan men their eighth straight title.
But while Kenyans have also won road races and marathons in Europe, Asia and South America -- Paul Tergat of Kenya won a half-marathon in Milan, Italy, earlier this month -- there are no preferences given to runners from the host countries. Runners from Morocco, Mexico, Italy and elsewhere also triumph.
Kenyan success, traced to Kip Keino's first Olympic gold medal in Mexico City in 1968, stems in part from youngsters running many miles a day to school, a nutritious diet, the benefits of living at high altitude and no diversions from other sports. Kenyan superiority is not as great among women, where Americans such as the three-time world cross-country champion Lynn Jennings are consistent winners. Kenyan women, held back by cultural tradition, have come late to competition.
Kenyan men's domination, which has intensified in recent years, has already had a big impact on the sport in the United States. Indeed, it has contributed to the formation of two different American circuits. One is the Professional Road Racing Circuit, of which Boulder has been a part, and which offers prize money to all runners, but draws few Americans. The other is the USA Circuit, which awards prize money almost exclusively to Americans and draws few foreigners.
American runners and some race directors argue that the Kenyans have had the effect of an invading army, depriving young American runners of earning a living and fully developing their talent. The Kenyans come to America for brief periods, returning to their homeland with sums that go a long way in a nation with a per capita annual income of $280.
The consequences have been serious, they say, with the Kenyans effectively overtaking an American sporting institution intended, for some, to display American talent, promote corporate sponsors, and provide post-collegiate runners with a viable transition into a professional running career.
"It's pointless for me to run on the pro circuit," said Mike Mykytok, 27, of Ramsey, N.J., the United States 10,000-meter champion in track and field. "With all the Kenyans, I could set a personal best time, still only place 12th and win $200."
In response, road racing events have increasingly switched to the USA Circuit, where the prize money is awarded only to American racers.There are nine events scheduled for the USA Circuit in 1998, with total prize money of $175,000.
And many of those races that have remained on the Professional Road Racing Circuit have begun giving bonuses to Americans for a top 10 finish or awarding money to top Americans no matter how they run. At last summer's Harvard Pilgrim Falmouth Road Race on Cape Cod, Mykytok earned a $4,000 bonus as the first American, despite placing 11th.
 
Creating Opportunities For American Runners
The format in Boulder, seen as another attempt to deal with the Kenyans, was endorsed by USA Track & Field, the sport's national governing body, last month.
"We're not limiting opportunities for foreigners but creating opportunities for Americans," said Craig Masback, executive director of USA Track & Field. "A team battle seems to line up with what people like about the Olympics. Even if people don't know who the athletes are, it gives them a rooting interest."
The strategies for limiting the impact of the Kenyans, however, have produced protests -- from agents who represent the Kenyans to American athletes offended by what seems a corruption of true competition. "They are rewarding American mediocrity," Tom Radcliffe of Kim McDonald International Management, an agency that represents many Kenyan runners, said of Boulder's format.
Julia Emmons, director of the Peachtree Road Race 10-kilometer run in Atlanta on July 4, criticized Boulder's method of helping Americans. "Protecting American runners only leads to weaker and weaker performances," Emmons said. "There's something deeply wrong with the American system. We haven't produced a champion since Alberto Salazar in the early 80's. We're a laughingstock."
And Don Kardong, president of the Road Runners Clubs of America and a former Olympic marathoner, said the team racing concept, whatever it might do to offset a Kenyan presence, would not make Americans more formidable competitors.
"What we really need to be doing," Kardong said, "is going to the root of the problem, which is how to develop top American runners."
For race organizers in Boulder and elsewhere, the problems the Kenyans present go beyond their success. Organizers have complained that they do not satisfy the public relations demands of the events, which include interviews with the news media and appearances.
Reef, the director of the 38,000-runner Boulder race, said: "Journalists were saying to us, 'Look, we don't have a story on Bolder Boulder anymore. We don't know who the Kenyans are. They can't talk to us.' I blame the agents. They have done a terrible marketing job, and people are just fed up."
 
Mixed Feelings As Policies Change
Mike Sandrock, a sportswriter for The Boulder Daily Camera, said that many Colorado journalists who did not follow running were unable to communicate with the Kenyans and get a story. "At last year's press conference," Sandrock said, "reporters would ask questions like, 'How did the race go?' and the Kenyans would give one-word answers."
When in 1994 Kenyan success became too much for organizers at the Gate River 15-kilometer run in Jacksonville, the event became the first to limit prizes to Americans. "It made a lot of sense," said Colleen Clarson, a spokeswoman for Gate Petroleum, the race's leading sponsor. "There was a lot of patriotism to help Americans for the Olympics. That fervor has grown."
Doug Alred, the director of the Jacksonville race, said the post-race performance of Todd Williams, the American winner of the race last month, favorably contrasted with the impassive responses of previous Kenyan winners.
"At the end of a TV interview shown throughout the state," Alred said, "Todd said, 'I love Jacksonville, and I love Gate!' "
Another nearby event, the Gasparilla Distance Classic 15-kilometer run in Tampa with 13,000 participants and NationsBank as chief sponsor, will no longer award prize money beginning in 1999. Race officials said they wanted to earmark that money to charities.
But Brantly, the last American to win Gasparilla in 1989, suggested otherwise. "The area is steeped in attitudes of the Old South," said Brantly, who lives in Fort Lauderdale. "Do you think if a white American runner had won the last few years, they'd be cutting prize money?"
Agents for the Kenyans charge race directors and the news media with being insensitive to the culture shock felt by Kenyans new to this country. Lisa Buster, who manages a roster of 15 Kenyans based in the Philadelphia area, said Kenyan runners, in fact, often conducted popular clinics at the races. And Mark Wetmore, the agent for Hezron Otwori, the 22-year-old Kenyan who won last year's race in Boulder and the $10,000 prize, said Otwori would run again. He was less sure whether he would satisfy the frustrated organizers.
"Hezron's a nice, friendly guy," Wetmore said. "But he doesn't pick up a microphone and do standup."
American runners, caught between their own economic needs and a real desire for maximum competition, are unsure what is best.
"It's getting harder and harder to win money," said Mykytok, who won roughly $25,000 racing last year. "In one race I ran last year, the prize money went five deep and they brought in 10 Kenyans."
Brantly said: "The same nameless, faceless athletes continue to win. No one can identify with them. We're talking about road racing's survival."

HEADLINE: Congress Investigating Sales of Satellite Technology to China

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Several Congressional committees are investigating whether the Administration's policy of exporting space satellite technology to China has helped China and other countries to develop and use nuclear missiles.
The inquiries come after recent articles in The New York Times disclosing a Pentagon finding that the reliability of China's nuclear missiles was significantly advanced in 1996 after scientists working for American space satellite companies provided Beijing with expertise on guidance systems. The technology needed to put a commercial satellite in orbit is similar to that which guides a long-range nuclear missile to its target. 
"I'm not blaming China," said Senator Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican. "We're talking about our own Government policy-makers responsible for the transfer of this technology, and this case is a glaring example."
President Clinton, after being lobbied by leading American aerospace executives who were also major campaign donors, made it easier for them to export satellites. But Administration officials say they kept strict safeguards in place to protect against the risks inherent in transferring sensitive technology -- equipment or expertise -- that may have military applications.
Mr. Cochran is the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services. He said the panel would look at the 1996 China case in future hearings.
The case involves scientists from Loral Space and Communications and Hughes Electronics who helped the Chinese figure out what went wrong when a Chinese rocket carrying a Loral satellite exploded.
Both companies have said their employees acted properly.
Loral's president and chief operating officer, Gregory Clark, said at a meeting in Tokyo today that Loral's employees "did not divulge any information that was inappropriate," Reuters reported.
A criminal investigation, prompted by the Pentagon study, is examining whether the companies violated laws governing the export of military-related exports, officials said.
The Joint Economic Committee will investigate the case for coming hearings on the economic impact of the transfer to China of sensitive technology, an aide said today.
A member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, has asked the committee to review the Pentagon study and analyze the national security implications, according to an aide.
Ms. Pelosi, a critic of the President's China policy, said she was particularly upset with Mr. Clinton's decision in February to approve the export to China of a Loral satellite despite the objections of the Justice Department. She felt the Presidential waiver undercut any possible prosecution.
"It is ironic that the President issued this special waiver saying it was in our national interest, at the same time the Chinese were planning to sell weapons-of-mass-destruction technology to Iran, in spite of signing another agreement not to do so in October 1997," she said.
There are powerful conflicts in the debate. The end of the cold war is a golden opportunity to sell American technology abroad.
But the most coveted American technology can be difficult to control because it has dual uses and the controls are only as good as the weakest link. China has shared some missile technology with rogue nations like Iran.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Trying to Defuse a Growing Russia-Latvia Confrontation

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
The United States has been working quietly with other nations to defuse a growing confrontation between Russia and Latvia that threatens to damage Washington's already fraying relationship with Moscow.
The Latvian Cabinet today agreed on important changes in its citizenship laws to answer Russian contentions that Latvia mistreats Russians who live there, senior American officials said. The legislation, which is subject to approval by Parliament, would grant citizenship to all children born in Latvia after Aug. 21, 1991, and would make it easier for Russian-speakers to become naturalized. 
 Administration officials have grown increasingly concerned over Moscow's "bullying rhetoric and tactics against Latvia," including threats of economic sanctions, an official said. Washington sees the crisis as an important test of the charter Mr. Clinton signed here on Jan. 16 with the Baltic nations, which regained their independence when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said sanctions would be counterproductive. "The two countries should work out their problems through diplomatic channels," he said.
The Russians have said they would take steps, including asking for the immediate repayment of debts -- which Riga disputes -- and cutting off some shipments of oil to Latvia.
The underlying fear, Latvian officials say, is that if the Russians can get away with Soviet-style tactics against Latvia without a significant response from the United States or Europe, they will try it on others.
Since a demonstration by a few thousand Russian-speaking residents of Latvia was broken up by the police on March 3, Moscow has compared Latvia to Pol Pot's Cambodia.
The State Secretary of the Latvian Foreign Ministry, Maris Riekstins, who is in Washington to discuss the matter, says bashing Latvia "is unfortunately the one issue that has managed to unite Russia's Government, Parliament and media."
So far, Washington has tried "quiet diplomacy," with President Clinton writing the Latvian President, Guntis Ulmanis, on April 10, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright writing a sharply worded letter to Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov that was delivered today.
In her letter, Ms. Albright said Washington was concerned about the dangerous trend of rising tensions between Russia and Latvia and warned against the use of sanctions.
The Americans, the Nordic nations and Britain, as the current President of the European Union, have all protested to Moscow, the officials said.
Today's proposed changes by the Latvian Cabinet, encouraged by Western officials and recommended by the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, may be enough to promote a dialogue between Moscow and Riga and calm matters down, the officials said.
Among the changes will be the abolition of a system of age restrictions on the number of people allowed to apply for naturalization. About 688,000 of those living in Latvia now do not have Latvian citizenship, including 450,000 ethnic Russians.
Moscow says Latvia is discriminating against non-citizens, while Latvian officials say that Russian speakers have been slow to apply for naturalization, and that more than 95 percent of those who do apply have been able to pass Latvian language and history tests required for citizenship.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Thai Troubles Drive a Dynasty To Sell Its Crown Jewel Bank

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
Photos of the Thai King adorn the walls of most local companies and homes. But at the Wanglee Company, that honor is reserved for the sage, sepia-toned likeness of Tan Siew-Wang, forefather of one of Thailand's most famous business clans.
Mr. Tan sailed to Thailand from southern China more than 130 years ago, and he died early this century. But his portrait is not all that remains. The family dynasty he started, known by the Thai-Chinese name Wanglee, is now in its fifth generation. With interests that span manufacturing, agriculture, real estate and banking, the Wanglees are as well known here today as the Carnegies or the Rockefellers were in America a century ago. 
 They have kept their sprawling empire intact through loyalty to Mr. Tan's conservative business philosophy, the canon of which can be summed up in four words: Thou shalt not sell. The Wanglees still own every parcel of land Mr. Tan bought, and they have never offered outsiders large stakes in their companies.
"What belonged to our family 100 years ago still belongs to us," says Vuttichai Wanglee, a fourth-generation heir and managing director of Wanglee, which still uses the riverside trading house where Mr. Tan worked. "It is our culture not to risk what great-grandfather built."
This all-in-the-family rule has served the Wanglees well through several wars, the Japanese occupation and a dozen military coups. But it will not survive Asian financial crisis.
Faced with an ultimatum by the Thai central bank to raise fresh capital, the Wanglees are reluctantly preparing to sell a controlling stake in Nakornthon Bank, the family's crown jewel, for a fraction of the price it would have brought a year ago. "Our ancestors could never have imagined that it would come to this," said Thamnu Wanglee, the bank's president, slowly shaking his head. "But they also could never have imagined such a crisis."
The sale will do more than embarrass a member of the Thai business aristocracy. The collapse of Asian financial markets has struck a blow -- a fatal one, some economists say -- at perhaps the most outstanding feature of Thai business: the domination by a few wealthy Chinese families, and the cozy network that nurtures them.
As in Indonesia, Chinese represent a small fraction of the Thai population, but straddle every line of business. Nowhere is that as true as in banking. Twelve of the 15 commercial banks are Chinese family operations. The Wanglees' Nakornthon Bank is relatively small, with about $2 billion in assets. But shareholdings in even the largest banks, led by Bangkok Bank and the Thai Farmers Bank, are structured to insure family control.
Even in diverse family empires, banks are the prized possession. Thailand has not granted a new full-service banking license in 40 years, creating a family-directed plutocracy of 15 that rivals the Finance Ministry in their power. "Owning a bank is one step removed from royalty," a longtime banker here said.
But today, many blame that insular system for the nation's financial trouble. Family banks often make loans based on relationships -- so-called name lending -- giving more weight to a company patriarch's reputation, and the collateral he offers, than to business plans and cash flow. Critics say such practices allowed Thai companies to rack up too much debt and pumped air into real estate and stock market bubbles.
The Thai Government is determined to change the system, clearing a path for Western banks in this long-cloistered market. The International Monetary Fund has made an overhaul a central condition of its $17.2 billion bailout package.
The changes are already striking. The central bank has nationalized four banks this year, wiping out founding-family shares. Two other banks have fallen into foreign hands, one to the Dutch banking giant ABN Amro, and the other to the Singapore Development Bank. The rest are scrambling to raise funds in a way that insures long-term family control, but few see that as likely for more than one or two of them.
"The era of family banking is over," said Amaret Sila-on, head of a Government body overseeing disposal of bad bank assets. "Whether the families like it or not, Thailand now needs professionals at the helm."
The Wanglees customized their businesses to avoid just such a fate. Mr. Tan, the founding father, insisted on self-sufficiency. He bought land along the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok so that his company could handle rice and silk cargo ships on its own jetties. To this day, it owns more than half a square mile of prime riverside property. Wanglee rice mills also sat on Wanglee land.
In his final days, Mr. Tan established the Wanglee Company as a perpetual corporation, making all his descendants -- there are about 200 today -- equal shareholders, the better to prevent infighting that might splinter the company.
As if to stress continuity, the Wanglee Company remains where it was a century ago, on a pier by the river. The tarmac is made of cobblestones shipped from China as ballast on silk ships. Inside, vault-like teak doors and wood-cage cashier windows have been faithfully maintained. A Chinese scribe on the payroll drafts handwritten company reports for relatives living in China.
Big business decisions are said to be communal. A foreigner whose company had a joint venture with a Wanglee-run firm said that on his arrival in Bangkok he was introduced to 10 elders of the family, most of whom had no real links to his business. "I felt like an ambassador being introduced at court," he said.
Still practicing primogeniture, the oldest member of the oldest generation serves as family umpire. Sukit Wanglee, 68, the de facto headman who also serves as chairman of the family's agricultural trading company, calls regular Sunday meetings at a Wanglee compound in downtown Bangkok, a green oasis walled off from the city center.
The bank was founded in this conservative tradition. When it was registered in 1933, Thailand had only one other commercial bank. And the Wanglee Bank, as it was called then, had modest ambitions. It financed the family's exports and took deposits from relatives and a coterie of Chinese friends.
When the family sought to expand the bank's horizons in the 1970's, it changed the name to the more generic Nakornthon and entered a seven-year alliance with Citibank. The American bank installed credit and accounting systems, while Wanglees remained in control.
The family sends its future executives to train abroad. Vorawee Wanglee, the bank's current chief executive, studied at Duke University and worked at the Bank of New York and Citibank before returning to the fold. Thamnu, the president, spent 15 years climbing the corporate ladder at Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank before joining Nakornthon.
The bank just moved into a plush new head office, a chrome-and-glass tower with duplex executive floors decorated in desert hues, blond wood and frosted glass. But following tradition, the tower was built on a spot where Mr. Vorawee's branch of the family once lived.
None of that innate caution, it turns out, prepared the Wanglees for Thailand's financial trouble. A few weeks after the baht was driven off its peg to the United States dollar last July, the bank's main clients -- almost half in manufacturing -- began delaying loan payments, Mr. Vorawee said in an interview.
"We have tried to be patient, to work with them on restructuring," he said. "But the situation keeps getting worse."
It did not help that the bank's most promising client turned out to be its biggest burden. Nakornthon cultivated a relationship with the Thai-Chinese businessman Charn Asawachoke, founder of a high-flying chip maker, Alphatec Electronics. But Alphatec is now on the verge of bankruptcy, with Mr. Charn facing suits charging misappropriation of company funds. Mr. Thamnu, reflecting Nakornthon's standing as key lender, was appointed chairman of the ill-fated semiconductor company after shareholders ousted Mr. Charn.
Other failures have piled up. Once, only a tiny percentage of the bank's loyal clients failed to pay back loans on time. Now, the percentage of nonperforming loans has risen into the high teens. Some analysts expect that it will soon reach a third of the bank's loan portfolio, a level considered crippling.
Amid general bloodletting on the Thai stock exchange, the market has savaged Nakornthon. The bank would have commanded a purchase price of about $600 million early in 1996. Today, shares trade at one-tenth that level. The value of the Wanglee's controlling stake, estimated around 40 percent, has tumbled in tandem.
But the body blow came from Thailand's central bank. After years of loose regulation, it has required local banks to begin adhering to the most stringent international accounting standards. The terms, like capital adequacy and accrual periods, are technical, but the results for the Wanglees are personal: The standards require that they put up capital in excess of their current stake in the bank, or risk losing it.
Late last year, the Wanglees moved to shore up control. Sukit Wanglee, acting as family head though he has no direct bank role, called emergency meetings. The elders prevailed on relatives in Thailand, Hong Kong, Canada and the United States to contribute the equivalent of $17 million to keep the bank in family hands.
No sooner had the money been raised than it turned out to be woefully inadequate: The central bank made it known that it would require compliance with even tougher accounting standards sooner rather than later, forcing Nakornthon and other banks to raise more capital than they expected in less time.
However congenial by nature, the Wanglees do not disguise their contempt for the Government's actions. "I do not oppose the new rules in principle," Mr. Thamnu said. "But when they push all these new requirements on us all at once, well, you are simply pushing all the Thai banks into foreign hands."
When it became clear that the family needed to raise more money, Mr. Sukit called a new meeting. According to people present, the majority agreed that it was not prudent to invest any more in the bank. The decision made a sale inevitable.
"My feeling was that we should not sell off other businesses to support just one business," Mr. Sukit said. He hinted at a subtle difference of opinion with some other family members, saying that his heart was in farming, not banking. "In this kind of crisis, we should return to our roots," he said.
To save face during their first sale of a family business, the Wanglees are seeking a trusted foreign partner who will keep Mr. Vorawee and Mr. Thamnu as top executives. But many analysts doubt that the Wanglees will remain in management past a transition period.
Most family members say they are resigned to the sale. "It is a loss of face," Mr. Vorawee said. "But wouldn't it be an even bigger loss of face if the bank were confiscated by the Government?"
Mr. Thamnu concurs, arguing that international competition and free capital flows are drawing the curtain on Thai-style relationship banking. "If we put up lots of fresh money," he said, "we can survive for a year to two -- but that's all."
But for Mr. Vuttichai, keeper of the family flame at the old Wanglee headquarters, the bank sale is nothing to be proud of. "You have to wonder where we will stand among our friends, when something we have held in the family so long goes," he said.
Mr. Vuttichai recently organized the family's Ching Ming ceremony, on the Chinese holiday to remember ancestors. Almost no one came. "They said the traffic is bad, too busy to come," he said. "But really, I think people have lost interest."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Group of 7 Has Words but No Action for Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Finance ministers and the heads of the central banks of the world's largest industrialized nations said today that the yen had fallen too far as Japan struggles to pull out of its worst financial straits in years.
But in a daylong meeting, the ministers offered little explicit help to Tokyo in bolstering the yen, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the United States was not retreating from its view that a strong dollar is in America's best interest. 
 "I continue to support a strong dollar," he said, carefully stepping around the question of how the yen could rise in value without the dollar falling.
The dollar, which had been weakening against the yen before Mr. Rubin spoke, stabilized afterward. In Asian trading early Thursday, the dollar rose to 131.05 yen from 129.36 yen in New York late on Wednesday.
Mr. Rubin's comments appeared to have been interpreted on foreign exchange markets as a sign that while the yen may be allowed to rise modestly, the United States will not let the dollar decline much against the yen.
That was also the message last week, when Mr. Rubin said he welcomed Japan's intervention in the currency markets to bolster the yen but made clear that the United States did not spend a penny to do the same.
Once again today, the Group of Seven nations pressed Japan to do more to improve its economic prospects. In a discussion that went on longer than expected, participants in the meeting said they were unimpressed by the presentation made by Japan's new Finance Minister, Hikaru Matsunaga, about a $75 billion stimulus package that Japan announced last week.
"The world still hasn't seen the details," Mr. Rubin said this evening, doing little to hide his disappointment in Mr. Matsunaga's repetition in private of vague plans released last week. "The final proof will be whether it affects the economy."
A communique issued by the Group of Seven tonight said: "The challenges facing Japan are serious and have intensified in recent months. What is crucial is to implement quickly a strong program of effective fiscal measures and structural reforms."
While that wording seems benign, in the arcane language of finance ministers it represents a public reprimand -- in this case that the Japanese Government, having neglected serious economic problems for years, no longer has the luxury of time to stop a downward spiral of its economy, the world's second largest.
"Japan got itself into this problem," one senior American official said last week, "and it's going to have to get itself out."
The yen's value has become an embarrassing indicator of the country's weakness and its dim prospects for imminent recovery. While Japanese industry benefits from a weak yen -- because it makes the country's exports less expensive and thus more competitive abroad -- Japanese officials are clearly concerned that the slide has gone too far.
They also know that a weak currency is a political hazard. The weak yen has kept Japan from importing more goods from Southeast Asia, which is struggling to overcome its own crisis. That has created considerable tension with its neighbors. And the flood of Japanese imports coming into the United States, fueled by the weak yen, is greatly increasing the size of Japan's trade surplus with the United States. American officials have warned that the widening trade gap could reignite a political outcry on Capitol Hill.
As soon as today's meeting was over, the participants were already putting their distinctive spin on its conclusions, hoping to influence the markets to their advantage.
For example, Japan's Vice Minister of Finance, Eisuke Sakakibara, noted that considerable time was spent on the question of whether stock markets around the world, particularly in the United States, had gone too high. And he told a news conference that the Group of Seven's statement suggested that the seven countries -- Japan, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Italy -- could decide to intervene in the currency markets simultaneously to drive up the value of the yen.
Mr. Sakakibara, regarded as one of Japan's most powerful financial officials, said that the communique "is indicating the possibility of coordinated intervention." He clearly hopes the possibility of such action will dissuade investors from betting on further yen weakness.
But at a news conference at the Treasury this evening, Mr. Rubin said coordinated intervention in the markets was not discussed.
The meeting came after weeks of tension between Washington and Tokyo over Japan's economic strategy. The Japanese Government has been reluctant to run up huge budget deficits to bolster the economy, because Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto came to office promising austerity and balanced budgets.
But the pressure became too great last week and he announced a plan -- though it lacked critical details and seemed to include billions in spending on real estate and other transactions that have little chance of spurring economic activity. While Mr. Hashimoto announced tax cuts, they were relatively small and may be temporary.
Even top Japanese officials who attended today's meeting said in private that they were still uncertain what shape the plan would take.
But Mr. Rubin insisted that the meeting today did not include much heated criticism of Japan.
"Heated?" he said. "These are finance ministers and central bankers. Our idea of heated is somebody has an extra glass of water. I wouldn't call it heated."

HEADLINE: Talking Business With: Fran Reiter;
Head of Tourism Unit Sees Plenty of Room for Growth

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Deputy Mayor and campaign manager, Fran Reiter earned a reputation as a smart, aggressive lieutenant who got things done. A lifelong New Yorker and alumna of the public schools, Ms. Reiter can talk a blue streak about the greatness of New York City.
But Ms. Reiter's bulldozing style has caused some problems. She clashed with some of the other deputy mayors in her years at City Hall. And she angered community leaders at times. In 1996, for example, neighborhood organizations and politicians in Harlem blamed her for holding up their federally financed empowerment zone there by refusing to cede greater control of the zone's board of governors to New York State. 
 She was named president and chief executive of the Convention and Visitors Bureau in December, after a little arm-twisting by Mayor Giuliani, but business and civic leaders applauded the appointment. As head of the city's official tourism marketing agency, Ms. Reiter leads a private nonprofit group with more than 1,100 members. Its mission is to bolster an industry that employs 131,000 people and funnels $18 billion a year into the city's economy. Half of its $7.5 million budget is provided by the city, while the other half comes from members. LISA W. FODERARO
 
Q. You're taking over the Convention and Visitors Bureau at a time when tourism is at an all-time high. Can anything be done to push the numbers even higher or has New York City reached its maximum potential?
A. We haven't come close to reaching the kind of visitor levels we'd like to see.
Right now, we're suffering from a shortage of hotel rooms. There are more people who want to come to New York than we can sometimes accommodate. What we're very happy about is that between now and the year 2000 we expect to have another 5,000 hotel rooms in New York City. Most of them are slated to be moderate-priced, which is really where the shortage is.
Having said all that, there are still times of the year, like January and parts of February, when tourism numbers aren't nearly as high as we'd like. This year February was better because of the N.B.A. All-Star game. That's a perfect example of the kind of thing we're trying to do to encourage visitors during times of the year when they otherwise might not be here.
Q. In the recession of the early 1990's, a number of hotel developers were hurt as projects conceived in the 1980's opened as tourism sagged. Are you concerned that there are too many hotel plans on the drawing board?
A. No, I'm not. Economic downturns are cyclical. What we don't want to see repeat itself is this industry's inability to withstand those downturns.
Some of that downturn is due to economic downturns not here in the city but in other places around the world. Over the next year or two, we expect to see fewer people coming from Japan and other countries in Asia, and we have to make up for that somewhere. You can do it by always being alert to where the emerging markets are. Brazil is an example. You will see increasing numbers of tourists coming from Brazil and other parts of South America.
Q. What are some of the ways in which you're going to sell New York beyond public relations, brochures and advertising?
A. Well, that's actually a big part of what you need to do. In the last couple of years, there have been some limited advertising campaigns. But they haven't been global. Starting in 1999, we are planning to do some major print campaigns in valuable markets to New York City around the world.
We're also doing a major promotion in London this June called "The New York Experience." We will do it in Frankfurt as well. We are taking what is best about New York and are literally going to re-create it in venues in those cities -- four of the great restaurants in New York, entertainment from Broadway and exhibits from cultural institutions. In essence, we're going to entertain the travel industry. Why those two cities? They're the two largest feeder markets of tourists in New York City in all of Europe.
Q. Business leaders and government officials say the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center can't handle the largest conventions. What do you think should happen there and how should the bureau be involved?
A. The one thing everybody agrees on: it's too small. And it is totally inadequate in a particular way, and that is with respect to conference space. The only way to hold a decent sized conference is to put it on the exhibition floor, and that's not a good use.
So it needs to be bigger. But how much bigger? How should it expand? The state has come up with a plan. We've taken a look at it. There are aspects of it that look right. There are also land use issues that are very complicated. Coming out of government, I understand how hard it is to move three blocks anywhere in New York. So I think the role we can play is being the honest broker between a lot of competing interests that exist around the Javits Center.
Q. You have said that you would like the bureau to take over bookings at the Javits Center. Why?
A. It's the long-term bookings that I would like the Convention and Visitors Bureau to play a much more active role in.
Different kinds of events reap different benefits for the city. An event like the auto show is the most extreme example of one that has very little economic impact. Why? Because most of the people who attend it live in the city. The Convention Center is booked. But the hotels aren't. The restaurants aren't. Which doesn't mean you don't do them. You just don't want to do too many of them. It's a balance that we're looking for.
Q. The bureau's focus is understandably on Manhattan. But what are you doing to promote the other boroughs to tourists?
A. The single biggest challenge that we have is getting people to leave Manhattan to experience the fabulous things going on in the rest of the city.
It's important to get people knowledgeable about institutions in New York before they arrive here. If we can get them excited about the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens or the Brooklyn Museum, they're less likely to be put off by the fact that they need to take a subway to get there. I'm going to be meeting with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to talk about how we can get visitors used to the idea of using the Metrocard on the subway or bus.
We need to bring institutions in other boroughs together with tour operators to make them part of tour packages. There are some great things going on in Harlem, for example, and we can replicate that kind of historical and cultural tourism in other neighborhoods of the city.

HEADLINE: As Idaho Booms, Prisons Fill And Spending on Poor Lags

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho

 BODY:
Come to fast-growing Idaho, the people behind the prosperous new economy here like to say, and you will find a nearly crime-free state with no visible poor people.
With little patience for investing in social welfare or giving criminals time off for good behavior, state leaders here have charted a course that fits Idaho's political personality. And if they are filling up prisons at an exceedingly high rate while reducing welfare rolls to an astonishing level, that is the plan and goal. 
 But beneath the sheen of the Gem State are statistics that no one is bragging about. Some social historians say Idaho is in danger of becoming another Mississippi, which consistently ranks near the bottom of states in spending for children, education and the poor.
Over the last three and a half years, Idaho has reduced its welfare rolls by 77 percent, the steepest cut in the nation. Only South Dakota spends less per capita on child welfare. But by a huge margin, Idaho's proportion of abused or neglected children leads the nation.
Crime is low, but prisons are filling faster than ever. Idaho locks up people for crimes that most states do not even consider felonies. Among the states, its rate of incarceration is growing faster than all but two. Its prisons are filling so quickly that Idaho has to fly people out of state to find cells for them.
Experts caution against making connections too directly between low public investment in children and in the poor and high rates of abuse, neglect and incarceration. But they say the trends in Idaho bear watching by other states that have reduced spending on basic welfare and education needs of poor children while pouring dollars into new prisons.
"Idaho has effectively made itself the worst place in the nation to be poor," said John Cook, the research director at Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition policy. A recent study by the center ranked Idaho as the state whose policies were most likely to worsen the economic condition of the poor.
People on both sides of the political spectrum say that what is happening in the nation's most Republican state is the consequence of its relatively recent move toward one-party rule. In a state where Democrats may have been lulled into complacency by 24 years of Democratic governors, there is only a single, statewide Democratic officeholder, the controller. In the Legislature, there are only 16 Democrats among the 105 members of the House and Senate.
"This is the problem with living in a monarchy," said the editor of Boise Magazine, Alan Minskoff. "The monarchy is tough on the poor, it's tough on education, it's tough on the environment. It loves prisons. In order to have some balance, you need two political parties."
Idaho's Governor, Phil Batt, is a Republican who generally supports the course his state has chosen. The poor who leave Idaho's welfare rolls have more self-esteem, he said.
But Governor Batt, who considers himself as conservative as any mainstream Republican, has recently warned that perhaps the state is being too hard on children and the poor, and too quick to put people in prison. He cannot explain his state's high rate of child abuse and neglect, which is more than three times the national average. And he says he is perplexed by the huge drop in the welfare rolls, as well as by recent studies that show reading levels falling for grade-school pupils.
"Food bank usage has gone up, no doubt about it," Mr. Batt said. "And we are deeply concerned about child abuse in this state."
On the welfare drop, he said it was too early to draw conclusions, but he suggested that Idaho's two-year limit on benefits might be too harsh.
Idaho is something of a statistical anomaly. It is much more rural than the rest of the United States, though its economy has gone from one based on agriculture and natural resources to one, especially in the south, built around high technology. Its small population -- 1.2 million -- is 95 percent white. It has a deep-seated distrust of the Federal Government, and a tradition of self-reliance. An often heard refrain is that Idaho is what the United States used to be.
But Idaho's isolation, and its homogeneous political and racial makeup, is hurting the state, Stephen Lyons wrote in a recent essay in High Country News, a Western weekly. "That isolation has led to xenophobia, a fear of strangers or, perhaps more precisely, a fear of anyone not white," Mr. Lyons wrote.
Others say that Idaho is more tolerant than it is portrayed outside the state, but that it could use a second strong political party.
A retired state Supreme Court Justice, Bob Huntley, just announced that he would run for governor as a Democrat this year. His main reason, Mr. Huntley said, was the lack of a two-party system.
But beyond political philosophies, some experts say that Idaho, in limiting welfare benefits while expanding prisons, is simply making a bad investment for taxpayers. The state spends only $17 per person on overall child welfare. It spends five times that much on each prisoner.
"There are good reasons for building prisons," said Professor Robert Marsh, chairman of the Department of Criminal Justice at Boise State University, "but our one solution to everything -- drugs, alcohol abuse, minor offenses -- is prison, and that is simply not cost-effective."
In 1996, the last full year for figures, 78 percent of those Idaho sent to prison were nonviolent offenders -- more than 50 percent higher than the national average. Yet Idaho's overall crime rate ranks it in the lower fifth among states.
Idaho's prison population, at more than 4,000, has grown tenfold in the last 25 years. Simple drug possession, writing a bad check, drunken driving and driving without a valid license can land a person in prison, though the Governor just signed a bill that raised the thresholds for those felonies.
In addition, 10 years ago Idaho became one of the few states to eliminate parole for good behavior. "The average time served now, for any crime, doubled in 10 years from 22 months to about 44 months," Professor Marsh said.
The state is now spending $200 million to build a new, privately operated prison for 1,250 inmates. Its spending for the poor totals only about $15 million a year, at the bottom among all states.
Welfare payments are no more than $276 a month for a family, regardless of size, and there is a lifetime limit of two years for receiving aid. Some critics say the predominant attitude toward the poor is punitive. Some of those who used be on welfare certainly feel stigmatized.
"I find myself sometimes going for days without food so my kids can eat," said Krista Ziebart, an epileptic mother of two from the Boise area. Ms. Ziebart lost her welfare benefits when Idaho became one of only three states that count Social Security disability payments as income that would disqualify someone from welfare.
Ms. Ziebart is one of hundreds of people in Idaho who have left the welfare rolls, but have not necessarily been lifted out of poverty. Though they are uncertain, state officials attribute the drop to the new time limit of two years and a host of new requirements.
"A lot of these families that the state kicked off welfare have had to move in with other families or relatives, so it's not unusual now to find 9 to 12 people living in a single trailer," said Mikey Krajcer, director of the Hunger Action Network, a private nonprofit agency that works with the poor here.
A number of researchers and educators from Idaho have joined national critics in arguing that the state's investment in welfare and early child education is too low.
One recent study, financed by the state, found that nearly 60 percent of fourth graders were reading at a level below their grade. Another survey echoed national studies in establishing a direct link between failing grades for poor children by the fourth grade and the likelihood that the children will commit crimes as a juvenile or young adult.
"The message our state seems to be sending is that if you're going to be a kid, don't be a kid in Idaho," said Robert Barr, dean of the College of Education at Boise State.
"I have tried to convey to the state Legislature the most chilling information that I've ever seen," Dean Barr said in a interview. "If a child is poor, is held back at least once and is not reading at grade level, you can predict with better than 90 percent success that the child will never graduate from high school and may end being a burden on the system, in prison or elsewhere."
Earlier this year, the Legislature turned away Federal money that would have provided health insurance for more than 10,000 poor children, at only a small cost to the state.
After a furor, and lobbying by Governor Batt, some of the Federal money was restored last month, but not the full amount to which the state was entitled. State budget writers said they did not want to become dependent on Federal largess.
"Idaho is rock-solid, good families," Dean Barr said. "Unfortunately, people are very suspicious of Government schools or Government help."
They have become even more suspicious in recent years, as Idaho lost its Democratic office holders. The party's decline can be traced to the disappearance of its strong union base in the north, where minimum-wage service workers have replaced industrial labor. The last Democratic power in the state was Cecil Andrus, a four-term Governor until 1994.
A decade-long surge of newcomers, primarily from California, also changed the state's politics. Most experts now think that the new residents were fleeing more racially and politically diverse states, and are perhaps more conservative than many Idaho natives.
Governor Batt said there would seem to be ample jobs for the poor.
Asked why they could not get jobs, some mothers with families who have been forced off welfare said it was too hard to live on the minimum wage while trying to take care of young children.
What is more, some Idaho officials have indicated they do not want too many well-paying jobs to come to the state, because it would raise wages for others. Last year, the president of the Boise Area Chamber of Commerce, Jay Clemens, said he opposed a company's plan to bring 500 jobs to the area because it could "unrealistically drive up wages."
The state has a strong private welfare tradition through the Mormon church, to which about a third of Idaho's population belongs. But the church welfare system generally applies only to Mormons.
If you are poor and non-Mormon, there are few places to go, said some people here. "They just want us to disappear," said Sherry Meschler, a disabled mother of three who lost her welfare benefits last year.

In Wildwood, Bets Are Still On Gambling

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: WILDWOOD, N.J.

 BODY:
FRED WAGER is getting impatient with all the nattering naysayers. As Mayor of this great little resort, he promised to give tourist-chomping Atlantic City a poke in the eye. He told voters he would try to bring a casino here, and, three years later, by golly, that's just what he's going to do.
The statistics that help fight the good fight against the snickering politicians, not to mention the press, gush out. "Three to one," Mr. Wager says. "Three to one, the voters said yes to a casino. I mean, we got 26 percent unemployment! Kids graduate from high school and have to move away. Twenty six percent unemployment! We got no jobs for them." 
 These, of course, are the same grave statistics Mr. Wager trotted out three years ago when he brought Chief Larry Snake of the Delaware Tribe of Anadarko, Okla., to town to declare a city parking lot sacred ancestral land. Wildwood, once the wildest Jersey Shore resort of them all, had fallen as Atlantic City's boomed, and the Delaware Indians were going to help bring it back. The city would deed the parking lot to the Delawares, who would open a casino that would stanch the flow of tourists who bypass Wildwood for the gambling mecca 30 miles to the north.
But while the politicians thought they had ridiculed this idea out of existence, Fred Wager and Wildwood (pop.: 5,000) may get the last laugh.
WILDWOOD, which looks like it's in mothballs nine months of the year, is in the process of settling a lawsuit recently filed by the Delaware tribe that claims the city as ancestral land. But Jeffrey April, a lawyer for the tribe, says the litigation is simply designed to expedite a casino.
Negotiations are under way to settle the land claim by giving the tribe the two-acre parking lot the city had originally proposed for a casino, or a tract of similar size. The tribe would then ask the Federal Government to place the land in trust, creating in effect a mini-reservation.
And then: Bingo! The Delawares would be able to open a high-stakes bingo hall on their "reservation" without having to get state clearance.
The sneaky plan sidesteps the approval process the tribe would have to go through with the state for a full-fledged casino with slot machines and baccarat tables. Since the Governor has already said that casinos outside of Atlantic City are not an option, this provides the only way for Wildwood to open the casino it has decided is its best bet for the future.
While it may sound like a cockamamie scheme, it wouldn't be the first time an Indian gambling hall has opened without state approval. And while a high-stakes bingo hall, which has some card games and lottery-style ticket games, could hardly hold its own against a Caesars or Trump Plaza, its proponents see it as a start.
MR. APRIL said that it was quite possible that the Delawares would be able to obtain a full casino license without state approval by petitioning the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Congress is considering an amendment to the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would allow the Bureau or the attorney general to approve complete casinos when tribes and states can't agree on a compact.
So this old seashore hangout may have a casino one block from its fabled boardwalk after all. Obviously, it is desperate for something.
The city's other big scheme, to bring back the tourists by promoting its large cache of motels with plastic palm trees and neon signs, may be more inventive and less of a gamble. Wildwood has other attributes, too: some of the most interesting, old-fashioned amusements on five piers, and clean water where dolphins and whales are known to romp. But these, apparently, are minor, fair-weather assets.
Right now, Wildwood looks like the victim of a brush fire, boarded and empty. The other day, a pedestrian mall in the heart of downtown was being used by boys practicing tricks on their bikes. Of the more than 100 pubs in town, only a few are open.
One is Phil and Eddie's, which is next to the parking lot where the new casino might stand. The manager, who would not give her name, sounded about as hopeful for a new casino as everyone else, despite the drawbacks of gambling. "Listen," she said. "It couldn't be worse here than it is now."

HEADLINE: State Legislature Approves $950 Million Increase in Spending for Education

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 15

 BODY:
In what is by far the steepest spending increase in this election-year state budget, the Legislature has approved raising the allocation for public schools to $11.9 billion, a $950 million increase over last year.
Lawmakers are crowing about the unprecedented level of aid that would flow into their districts, saying it will provide everything from computers to property tax relief. If Gov. George E. Pataki does not veto any of the school spending, state aid to local districts will have risen 14 percent in just two years. 
 But the recent increases do not make up for years of cutbacks during the last recession. When adjusted for inflation and increased school enrollment, the education aid proposed for fiscal year 1999 is more than 4 percent lower than it was a decade ago. That fact, obscured by talk among legislators of a historic new commitment to education, underscores just how shaky the state's finances were in the early 1990's, and how aggressively Mr. Pataki sought to cut education spending early in his term.
"We fell way behind in education spending and we're just now catching up," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is the chairman of the Assembly Education Committee. "Nobody can deny that the state contribution to education had to get much higher."
The budget passed Tuesday by the State Legislature pays about 42 percent of the total cost of public education in New York State, up from 39 percent in 1994, the year Mr. Pataki was elected. It contains $11 billion in general operating aid for the state's 4,000 public schools, an increase of $740 million over last year. More than 100 of the state's 730 school districts are to receive a total of $67 million for prekindergarten classes as part of a multiyear agreement that also provides money for building repairs, full-day kindergarten and technology.
The budget also authorizes $500 million for a school construction program, $200 million of which is to go to repair and build schools in New York City. That investment comes five months after voters rejected a bond act that would have provided $2.4 billion for statewide school construction.
But in an effort to keep overall state spending below the $71.6 billion proposed by the Governor, the Legislature will not make the money available until the start of the next fiscal year, in April 1999. The delay is also an acknowledgment that districts cannot plan how to use so much money in time for the coming school year.
Although the Legislature's education budget is about $430 million higher than what Mr. Pataki proposed, lawmakers said they did not think the Governor would veto any school spending in an election year. For one thing, they said, the money was more carefully focused on specific programs than in the past.
"This was not a case of taking a lot of money and throwing it against a wall to see how much will stick," Mr. Sanders said. "It would be politically foolish and substantively indefensible for the Governor to veto any piece of this spending."
Under the Legislature's spending plan, New York City's school system, which has 37 percent of the state's public school students, will receive an increase in state aid of more than $300 million, bringing its total to more than $4 billion. The budget also calls for the city to receive more than $30 million for new prekindergarten classes, enough to double the enrollment in the program to 24,000 pupils. But Steven Allinger, a lobbyist for the New York City Board of Education, said the city would first have to find the space for dozens of new classrooms.
"Providing additional money specifically for prekindergarten was extremely important for us," Mr. Allinger said. "But it will be a great challenge securing the extra seats."
As the state spends substantially more on education this year, local districts will be spending less of their own money, which is raised primarily through property taxes.
The districts will be reducing their contributions to the pension fund for teachers by a total of $200 million because the fund's investments in the stock market did exceptionally well last year.
Mr. Pataki, who has remained silent on the budget so far, has 10 days to decide whether to veto any parts of it.
A veto on education spending could anger not only voters but also powerful teacher unions, which have enough money and numbers to exert considerable influence over this year's gubernatorial campaign.
While Mr. Pataki wanted to eliminate a spending category known as Teacher Support Aid, which helps poor urban districts pay teachers' salaries, the Legislature's budget not only retains that category but also increases spending on the program, to $77.5 million from $67.5 million. It also adds $10 million for Teacher Centers, which help schools develop new instructional methods.
Richard P. Mills, the State Education Commissioner, said a steep increase was necessary this year to help school districts meet new curriculum standards adopted by the State Board of Regents last year. The budget includes $82 million specifically for programs to help the state's 2.8 million schoolchildren meet the new standards. Mr. Mills said schools could spend the money on reading programs, tutoring, teacher training and curriculum changes.
"There has been a tremendous effort across the state to meet a very clear set of expectations," he said. "Now here is a budget that invests very heavily in that work. The expectations are clear, the resources are here, so now it's time to press on."

HEADLINE: Need Engineers? Try Paying Them

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, April 14) quotes T. J. Rodgers, the founder of Cypress Semiconductor, as saying that every high-tech engineer he can employ (even if a foreigner) can generate five local jobs. This is a succinct expression of job creation in a global marketplace. Foreign examples abound. Citizens of European Union countries can live and work in any other member country, allowing European companies to reconcile European manpower across country borders. 
 Nokia, the Finnish cellular phone company, has expanded its operation to Britain to take advantage of a freer economy that uses the lingua franca of high tech. Another example is finance workers in London and the business they generate for hotels, pubs and construction. If labor protectionism returned to Britain and other European workers were sent home, the British working in the support industries would see a return to 11 percent unemployment.

HEADLINE: The Road Ford's Taken;
Auto Maker Places Biggest Bet Yet on the Behemoths

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
After years of cranking out low-profit heavy-truck tractors through a maze of conveyor belts and robot welders covering more than 100 acres here, North America's largest auto factory has a new product. And it is beginning to earn a fortune for the Ford Motor Company.
When Ford sold its heavy-truck business to Daimler-Benz A.G. last year, the company began building Super Duty pickups here instead. The profitable new pickups, which are taller than Michael Jordan, with front seats that are nearly four feet off the ground, have been an instant hit since they went on sale in February. To keep them selling, and the profits rolling, Ford has brought in a thousand workers from unprofitable car factories in Ohio and has just begun operating the factory here around the clock. 
 "This truck plant has gone from producing low-volume, low-margin vehicles to much higher-volume and certainly much higher-margin vehicles," Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's president of worldwide automotive operations, told thousands of cheering workers recently after driving one of the first big pickups off the assembly line.
Ford is betting more and more on its stars -- ever-bigger vehicles that turn ever-bigger profits -- and turning its focus away from what was once its heart and soul, even scrapping some passenger car models.
"I think much more of the quality of the sales than the number of wheels we drive across the curb," said Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, using an industry phrase for the number of new vehicles leaving dealerships.
This is a radical departure in Detroit, where auto makers have traditionally kept selling every model possible to squeeze out the last ounce of market share. The General Motors Corporation has stuck valiantly to this costly strategy, keeping alive dozens of slow-selling cars.
Ford's strategy carries risks. If gasoline prices rise or the sport utility mania fizzles, cars might become popular again, hurting auto makers like Ford and the Chrysler Corporation that have bet their futures on light trucks. Federal safety regulators have strongly criticized the industry in the last two months for producing bigger, taller light trucks that inflict far more damage during crashes, and the industry may be hurt if new rules are issued.
Environmentalists and some Federal regulators also want manufacturers to improve the average fuel efficiency of their light trucks. That could crimp sales of the biggest and most profitable gas-guzzlers, which barely manage double-digit gas mileage, but would be less likely to affect the Super Duty, which is so big that it is now exempt from fuel-economy rules.
"It's these luxury trucks that are carrying the profits around here, and everybody's holding their breath for whether that will fall apart," said Ronald Harbour, a Detroit-area industry consultant.
Ford is betting that sport utility vehicles and pickups will stay popular, that any regulatory changes will be gradual and that gas prices will not rise much. Mr. Trotman predicts "an extended period of low at-the-pump prices."
A string of successes like the Super Duty, the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator -- combined with sharp cost reductions across the board -- have produced steeply rising profits and a soaring stock price for Ford. Its net earnings rose 56 percent last year, to a record $6.92 billion, the fourth-highest of any American corporation, trailing only Exxon, General Electric and Intel. After years as a laggard, Ford's stock has more than doubled in 12 months. The shares closed on Wednesday at $49.875.
All the big auto makers, of course, have cashed in on the public's insatiable demand for pickups and sport utilities, but Ford has zeroed in on this trend most decisively. Just in the last year, it has jettisoned its heavy-truck business and dumped a half-dozen unprofitable cars, including the Thunderbird, Probe and Aspire; another, the Lincoln Mark VIII, will go out of production this summer.
Yet Ford has held on to its 25 percent market share in the United States, with sales of larger vehicles taking up the slack.
Some buyers of canceled models appear to have switched to the Mustang, whose sales were 42 percent higher in this year's first quarter than a year earlier. The Mustang makes money because its strong brand name allows Ford to charge a premium for the car.
Wall Street is delighted by all this. "Ford's running the business better and management is more interested in maximizing shareholder value," said John A. Casesa, an analyst at Schroder & Company.
Ford has been No. 2 in the Big Three for half a century, but the gap by which it has trailed G.M. is narrowing as G.M. continues to struggle.
Neither auto maker earns much in Europe, although the introduction of sleek small cars like the Ka have made Ford's operations there more profitable than G.M.'s for the first time in years. In Latin America, sales of Ford's popular new small cars have been affected relatively little by the recession in Brazil. And in the crumbling economies of Southeast Asia, Ford has been proved right after building a small, but expandable, factory in Thailand, while G.M. has found itself stuck with a huge operation.
Ford's success shows how an industrial giant can lift profits even in a flat market. With G.M. and most Japanese auto makers spinning their wheels, Ford has a cash hoard of more than $20 billion. And while rebates and other incentives on cars and light trucks have been growing, Ford has cut costs even faster.
The company's success has surprised Wall Street, especially because Ford has achieved big cost savings while laying off only a few workers. It sold 4.4 percent more vehicles last year, while its costs rose only four-tenths of 1 percent. If its costs had increased in line with vehicles produced, after-tax profits would have dipped slightly. Instead, they rose by $2.47 billion. Ford estimated that if the number and type of vehicles produced had stayed the same, automotive costs would have dropped $3 billion.
Some analysts have attributed as much as half of the falling costs per vehicle to lower commodity prices. The price of rubber for tires, for example, has dropped by a third because the currency of Thailand, a big rubber producer, has plunged.
But John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said commodity price shifts were a tiny factor. Ford, he said, buys a lot of parts under long-term contracts not directly linked to raw-material prices.
Mr. Devine and other Ford executives attributed the savings to greater budget discipline and streamlined manufacturing. Under the variously designed sheet metal, more and more Ford models share just a few common engines, transmissions, suspensions and underbodies. "It's just amazing how a few million here and a few million there adds up to serious numbers," Mr. Trotman said.
Just two years ago, many on Wall Street and in the financial media were questioning whether Ford had designed new models, including sport utilities and pickups, so luxurious that few Americans could afford them. The main evidence lay in weak sales of the Taurus sedan, which rose $1,000 in price when Ford redesigned it in 1995 and which has since lost its leadership in midsize car sales to the Toyota Camry.
But big, high-priced vehicles have turned into the hottest segment of the market. Despite price tags of $30,000 to $40,000 or more, Ford's light trucks now account for almost three-fifths of the company's domestic sales. Its most expensive sport utilities, the huge Expedition and the similar Lincoln Navigator, have also been its most profitable, with the Navigator nearly outselling the once-popular Lincoln Continental and Mark VIII combined.
While auto makers do not release profits by model, analysts estimate that Ford is earning a pretax profit of $2.2 billion on annual sales of $9 billion worth of Expeditions and Navigators. And Scott Merlis, an automotive investment banker, predicted that the new Super Duty would add more than $600 million a year to Ford's pretax profits.
Ford faced criticism from efficiency experts two years ago for installing costly features like overhead-cam engines in the F-150 pickup and its offspring, the Expedition and Navigator. But customers have been flocking to the upscale behemoths, while G.M. has accumulated large supplies of unsold Chevrolet Suburbans, a slightly larger model with a less sophisticated design.
"It's really remarkable how in this market, a few good models can make such a difference," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz, a New York investment bank. "The Expedition was a brilliant stroke of genius -- it makes a fortune."
When environmental questions arose last year about the contribution these vehicles make to urban smog, Ford's sophisticated engines helped make it the only large auto maker able to promise that its full range of sport utilities would be roughly as clean as cars by this fall. And while Federal regulators are examining the dangers that these oversize vehicles pose to other drivers, Ford also appears to be further along than its rivals in working on solutions, announcing, for example, that it would offer side air bags in all its cars within three years.
Ford's shift from low-profit cars to high-profit sport utilities has also insulated it from Asian competition. While the dollar has soared against the Japanese yen and Korean won, making it far cheaper for foreign auto makers to import vehicles to the United States, overseas production of full-size pickups and sport utilities is negligible. High taxes have driven up the price of gasoline to $4 or $5 a gallon in most industrialized countries, so the main market for huge vehicles is the United States.
"We don't compete head to head with Japanese imports on a large piece of our production," Mr. Trotman said. Japanese auto makers also seem to have shown restraint in cutting prices on their cars, perhaps because of concerns about a political backlash in the United States.
Ford also has a big advantage in competing with G.M., its primary domestic rival.
G.M. has suffered a series of crippling strikes in the last four years and appears close to another big strike this spring. Ford has not suffered a strike at a single factory in more than a decade. It has also been allowed considerable flexibility by the United Automobile Workers to move workers around.
Ford's success has been partly the result of continuity of management: Peter J. Pestillo, an executive vice president, has overseen the company's labor policy since 1980 and is close to the U.A.W.'s leadership. But Ford also continues to benefit from sharp cuts in staffing that Mr. Pestillo negotiated with the union in the early 1980's, when Ford was struggling for survival.
Despite all this, Ford has some serious vulnerabilities. Few of its car models other than the Mustang have produced much enthusiasm in the marketplace. That could prove to be a serious problem if gas prices rise or if sport utilities go out of favor.
Profits slipped last year at the Ford Motor Credit Company, which provides auto loans and leases, when cars coming off lease could not be sold for as much as expected. And after five years of strong sales, the nation's driveways are so full of late-model vehicles that any economic slowdown could prompt millions of families to defer their next trips to dealerships. Mr. Trotman said that while Ford was well positioned to weather a recession, whether it would remain profitable in a downturn would depend on how deeply its rivals discounted prices.
Yet over all, Ford is prospering. Most analysts predict -- and, in an interview, Mr. Trotman agreed -- that Ford's earnings will be up again in the latest quarter, the eighth straight year-to-year rise.
Ford's strength has also benefited the 4,600 workers at the Super Duty factory here, who earn at least $19.50 an hour. They are already speculating on the styling of the world's largest sport utility vehicle, which Ford plans to build here next year. It will be nearly two feet longer than the Expedition and will use the underbody and other features of the Super Duty pickup.
The employees are also looking forward to a lot of overtime pay. "It's hard work," said Kenny France, a 28-year-old worker on the line, "but the money's the best."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Shades of Meaning From a Black Modernist

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
In the sacred, all-white pantheon of first generation Abstract Expressionists, the name of Norman Lewis (1909-1979) is not enshrined. A black artist who was based in Harlem, he is hard to find in chronicles of the New York School. Nor did he appear in the defining photograph of the group, identified as the Irascibles, that ran in Life Magazine on Jan. 15, 1951, and included the usual suspects: Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, et al., along with one female painter, Hedda Sterne.
Yet for a good while Lewis was a presence among them; close friends with Reinhardt and others. He showed his work at important museums and expositions; he got grants from prestigious foundations, he was represented, from 1946 to 1964, by the well-regarded Marian Willard Gallery. But as the luster of Abstract Expressionism dimmed in the 60's, his own reputation faded. "Norman Lewis: Black Paintings, 1946-1977," at the Studio Museum in Harlem, is part of an ongoing attempt to restore his work from near oblivion to public and historical attention. 
 Presenting some 60 oils and works on paper, the show moves from Lewis's beginnings as an Abstract Expressionist in the mid-1940's to his last endeavors, paintings that reflect his interest in the phenomena of nature. Like many exhibitions that expose a broad range of work, this one is uneven. There are wonderful things in it, for instance, "Metropolitan Crowd" of 1946, a dense, rhythmical all-over web of multicolored linearities on a black field that, strobelike, seems to track the movements of city pedestrians. Another gem is "Woman," a small but dynamic oil from 1948 -- a time when de Kooning was wrestling with his "Women" series -- in which sharp, jazzy geometric forms in red and beige meld exuberantly with the painting's black ground. But curatorial zeal has kept in too many weaker works, particularly his muddy "Atmospherics" of the 1950's.
Why, since Lewis was known primarily as a colorist, does the selection of paintings here focus on black? It's complicated. Like his colleagues in the first-generation New York School, Lewis did not approve of art as a forum for political statements. With Abstract Expressionisism, he had turned away from the prevailing Social Realism movement of the 1930's toward more esthetic adventures: exploring the potential of color, line, gesture, form. To him, as to the others, the most meaningful "message" a work could convey was the glorious act of painting itself.
Yet Lewis was by no means unaware of social issues; on the contrary, along with most of his artist friends, he leaned to the left. And he was deeply concerned with the battle for black equality. During the civil rights struggles of the 1960's, that concern got into his work. Black-and-white paintings like "America the Beautiful" from around 1960, and the 1961 "Klu Klux" mock the boobyish activities of Klansmen. But this was really the only time after the early 1940's that polemics -- however mild -- appeared directly in his paintings.
Aside from these, like his white artist friends, Lewis produced many paintings in which black was the prevailing hue. He used it, as they did, not only as a credo of modernism, but for the richness of shade and tone it offered. (Black-dominated works by Pollock, de Kooning, Motherwell, Kline, Reinhardt and Robert Rauschenberg are included in the show to provide historical context.) Lewis valued black, he said, as a way of "arousing other colors," and traced his interest in it to a painting he had made of rhododendrons, using the dark pigment to "convey the form." He added, "Just manipulating the paint was exciting to me."
But in their catalogue essays, the show's organizers -- Ann Eden Gibson, associate professor in the department of art at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Jorge Daniel Veneciano, curator of exhibitions at the Studio Museum -- present labored arguments to the effect that even in paintings other than the "Klansmen" compositions, black served Lewis as a metaphor for the African-American experience, allowing him to make political and social references without specifics.
One example, cited by Mr. Veneciano: the 1948 painting "Tenement." A vertical rectangle of black, on which occurs a random arrangement of tiny multicolored rectangles, it strikingly represents the facade of an apartment building at night. There is no word from the artist about his ambitions for this simple, almost celebratory composition. But Mr. Veneciano deduces that Lewis's choice of the word "tenement" is "loaded with social and economic insinuations." While the painting "cannot be considered a critique of certain New York City living conditions," he allows, it can also be seen as "emblematic of such a critique." The title gives the painting a relationship to "a socially articulated issue." Such freighted post-mortems do little to bolster the work's importance.
As for the show itself, it is divided into several areas, Postwar Abstractions, Rituals and Atmospherics, with subplots in each division. Linearity and a kind of nighttime light (Lewis enjoyed the dark and liked to keep wee-morning hours) dominate the early postwar paintings. The nervous calligraphic line of Mark Tobey, a gallery mate of Lewis's, seems to have affected some, including the impressive "Metropolitan Crowd" mentioned above. And so has the work of the Afro-Cuban painter Wifredo Lam, at least in "Untitled" of 1949. Reminiscent of Lam's Surrealist-influenced jungle paintings, the jostling vertical elements of "Untitled," suggesting attenuated human figures, radiate light and color that shade into dense greenish-black forest at the painting's perimeters.
The "Ritual" paintings translate Lewis's interest in street people and musicians into stylized groups of tiny figures involved in varied, sometimes dancelike movements around and across the canvas expanse. Besides the Klan paintings, a powerful example -- also in black and white -- is "Processional" of 1964, in which a crowd of calligraphic figures marches militantly in a broad, hard-edged band across an all-black field. Protesters, warriors, civil-rights marchers, whatever, they make a striking apparition.
In the 1970's, the decade of his death, Lewis's work seems to take on new vigor, especially in paintings like the spare, Minimalist "No. 2" of 1973, an all-black abstraction randomly scored with thin, vertical lines of white, and "Blue and Boogie" of 1974, a knockout of a painting in which a dynamic whir of bright blue patches -- like a Coney Island Cyclone ride -- animates an all-black field. Similar whorls, strung together across an otherwise empty black canvas, are used as wave forms in a group of energetic paintings that relate to the sea.
Was Lewis really in a league with the powerfully inventive major Abstract Expressionists, as his supporters suggest? Based on this presentation, with all the strengths and weaknesses it exposes, one would have to say no. But the exhibition should help to re-establish a place for him in the arbitrary, market-driven annals of 20th-century American art. Lewis does not deserve to be cast aside, and this show compels attention.
"Norman Lewis: Black Paintings, 1946-1977" is at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, through Sept. 20.

Big ESPN Deal Means Certain Cable Rate Hike

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
When ESPN decided that it had to acquire the entire Sunday night National Football League package that it used to split with TNT, it elected to escalate its annual rights fee from $131 million to $600 million.
How would ESPN pay for $469 million a year in added costs? Certainly, more games mean more advertising to sell. Being able to market an 18-game schedule, not just the final 9 games, might provide additional sales incentives. 
 But in a conference call with reporters on Jan. 14, Steve Bornstein, the ESPN president, seemed to assure cable subscribers that they would be spared major increases. The increase would be "modest," only "a range of a few pennies" more than was paid for the shared ESPN-TNT package, he said.
Although he was not specific at the time, Rosa Gatti, a spokeswoman for ESPN, said Bornstein was referring to the first year.
But given the new model ESPN has erected, it was hardly surprising this week to see the The Wall Street Journal and Variety report that ESPN will hike its rates 20 percent on Aug. 1, and it wants 20 percent annual increases through 2006.
Much of that would very likely be passed on to consumers.
Gatti would not confirm the Aug. 1 increase and denied that other subsequent increases had been established. "Anything else would be speculation," she said.
But one major cable operator, who asked for anonymity, said, "It's 20 percent now and forever. We're being handed this to eat. Their rationale is we'll get more commercial time and we should get a giveback from TNT."
Greg Hughes, a TNT spokesman, said: "Why should we underwrite ESPN's outrageous overpaying for the N.F.L.?"
TNT has increased costs of its own, doubling its National Basketball Association fees and adding other programming.
Yes, it makes sense for ESPN to charge more for the full package. It only charged for half before.
ESPN anticipated buying the formerly shared property in deals made with cable systems in 1994.
But those deals were signed when there was no idea ESPN would pay $600 million a year -- $50 million more than Fox and ABC paid to retain their packages.
"We're troubled by this," said Lela Cocoros, a spokeswoman for Tele-Communications, the giant cable system owner. "The N.F.L. deal is excessive."
"There's an impression that sports rights fees are going out of bounds but nobody has the guts to do anything about it," said Dick Aurelio, an executive with Time Warner, which owns a 1.1 million-subscriber system in New York City.
When TNT bowed out of the bidding in January to keep half of the package, it did so because it would not drastically alter its economic model with cable systems.
ESPN is the most expensive basic cable service, costing an average 62 cents per subscriber, according to Paul Kagan Associates, the media analysis firm.
Gatti said ESPN offers enormous value, and will try to offset any possible rate increases by offering cable systems more advertising time to sell than was available on the combined ESPN-TNT games; oodles of commercial time to sell on its ESPN and ESPN2 studio shows, and further incentives being discussed.
But the cable operator who asked for anonymity, said:
"The N.F.L. is more valuable to ESPN than it is to us. Having more commercial time doesn't create one new advertiser for me or increase the budgets of existing advertisers. What will happen is local advertisers will have to pay higher rates from us."
He added: "How did cable end up having to pay the most money for the least valuable games? Sunday night games are like the last on the list."
Well, it's obvious: Paul Maguire has joined ESPN's telecasts. Surely he's worth a rate increase, isn't he?
Gatti noted any increase is for all of ESPN, not just the N.F.L. games. But no other sport on ESPN is costing three or four times more than in the past.
 
Seifert's New Job
 George Seifert didn't coach last season after leaving the San Francisco 49ers and won't coach this year either, having agreed yesterday to a multiyear contract to become CBS's third studio analyst for the revived "N.F.L. Today."
"I go into this with the idea that this will be my profession," Seifert said.
"I've been described as professorial, but I'm very passionate about the sport and the emotional insights I've developed."
Did he say professorial? Bill Walsh, Seifert's predecessor as the 49ers coach, was dubbed "The Professor" during his disappointing stint as a game analyst for NBC.
At least Seifert has one wacky entry on his resume Walsh lacks: singing in a karaoke bar in a Visa commercial.
"If you saw that, then you know I have a zany side," Seifert said.
Sean McManus, the CBS Sports president, had targeted Seifert and Mike Ditka, the New Orleans coach and former NBC studio grizzly, for the show.
"Mike was on our list but he made it clear he wanted to stay in New Orleans," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Securities Post Gain On the Strength of the Dollar

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of United States Treasury securities posted gains for the third consecutive day yesterday on the strength of the dollar and a report that suggested that manufacturing was slowing, easing concern that inflation could accelerate.
The 30-year bond rose 4/32, to a price of 103 19/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.87 percent, from 5.88 percent on Wednesday. 
 The market took comfort from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's regional report on manufacturing, which suggested that activity was slowing. The index of economic activity fell to 13.4 from a revised 16.1 in March, while the index of new orders dropped to 16.6 from 18.8. And the prices paid index, viewed as a gauge of inflation, dropped to 6.6 from 12.
Other data released yesterday provided mixed signals on the economy, and investors largely ignored them. Housing starts fell slightly during March, for example, but still remained strong. And first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell sharply last week, dropping by 22,000, to 289,000, but that number may have been artificially held down by the fact that it was a holiday week.
Market participants have been taking some of their cues from the dollar, with bond prices up when it rises and weaker when it declines. Overnight yesterday, the dollar regained some of the ground that it had lost in recent days, rebounding after central bankers and finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations opted not to signal a joint effort to support the sagging Japanese yen.
A stronger dollar makes assets denominated in it, like Treasury securities, more attractive.
But even with market-friendly numbers, investors may still be concerned that the Bank of Japan might take action on its own to keep the yen from sliding too low.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Fell in March, But Not Much

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
Starts of new homes fell less than expected in March after having risen strongly during previous months, the Government reported today, while the number of people collecting unemployment benefit checks at the start of April fell to nearly a nine-year low.
"This is an economy still on a roll," Tim O'Neill, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal in Toronto, said. 
 The Commerce Department said housing starts declined 2.8 percent last month, to 1.59 million units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. That was just the first decline since November and still left starts at their second-highest level since January 1989. Housing starts had risen 5.8 percent in February.
Analysts had expected a larger decline during March because construction activity in January and February was bolstered by unseasonably warm temperatures.
"Housing is still being driven by low interest rates, full employment and very good levels of consumer confidence," said Robert J. Strudler, chairman and chief executive of the U.S. Homes Corporation in Houston. "Put those three things together and you have a superb housing market."
Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said, "The continued strength in home building will reverberate throughout the economy, lifting the fortunes of everyone from builders, bankers and realtors to carpet, furniture and appliance makers."
In another report today, the Labor Department said the number of people on the unemployment benefit rolls decreased by 55,000 in the week ended April 4, to 2.12 million, the lowest level since the week ended July 1, 1989. The department also said that first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 22,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 289,000, the lowest level since the week ended July 26. The number might have been held down by the Good Friday and Passover holidays, which could have prevented some discharged workers from seeking benefits, analysts said.
Nonetheless, "the labor market is still humming," said James Padinha, an economist at Briefing.com in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

HEADLINE: Roger Murray 2d, 86, Economist Who Was an Adviser to Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
Roger F. Murray 2d, an economist whose financial acumen made him a frequent adviser to members of Congress and business leaders during the 1950's and 60's, died on Monday at his home in Wolfeboro, N.H. He was 86.
The cause was cardiac arrest, according to the Lord Funeral Home in Wolfeboro. 
 As a vice president of the Bankers Trust Company and later a business professor at Columbia University, Mr. Murray helped untangle some of America's most frustrating problems. In 1962, Mr. Murray, an originator of the individual retirement account concept, worked for passage of the Keogh Act, which enabled self-employed people to have tax-deferred pension accounts.
Some of Mr. Murray's other opinions were particularly forward thinking. In 1952, he warned banks to pursue aggressive equity portfolios, noting that "timing wasn't everything" when trading stocks. That same year, he opposed a plan by Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, to tax executive stock options, contending that salaries were not enough to lure executives away from established companies. Stock options remain a vital part of executive compensation to this day.
Roger Franklin Murray 2d was born on Oct. 11, 1911, and grew up in Manhattan on West 95th Street. He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., in 1928 and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale in 1932. Mr. Murray then earned M.B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration. In 1934, he married the former Agnes M. McDede of Jersey City.
Mr. Murray had wanted to join J. P. Morgan & Company, but a family friend who was a Morgan executive warned him that the company was retrenching and that advancement was likely to be slow. Mr. Murray joined Bankers Trust instead.
At Bankers Trust, Mr. Murray quickly found his specialty in investment strategy. In 1956, he carried that specialty to Columbia University, where he retired in 1965.
Besides his wife, Mr. Murray is survived by his son, Roger F. Murray 3d, and a daughter-in-law, Linda T. Murray, all of Wolfeboro; three grandchildren, and a sister, Mary M. Westcote of Glen Ridge, N.J.

HEADLINE: Pork-Barrel Spending Alive and Well in Albany, Report Says

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 16

 BODY:
They advertised it as the end of back-room deals and furtive agreements between powerful politicians. This year, legislators conceived the state spending plan in public meetings, opening the wonder of budget-making for all to see.
But still there were deals: There was $2,000 for the drum and bugle corps of the Bronx Youth Sports Club. And $18,000 to build a playing field for the Lady Lumberjacks softball team at North Tonawanda High School. Chautauqua County will get $150,000 for a methane digester, otherwise known as an electricity generator fueled by cow manure. And so it is spent, hundreds of millions of dollars in "member items," otherwise known as old-fashioned pork. 
 According to a report issued today by an antitax group called Change-NY, lawmakers approved more than 5,000 pet projects, at a cost of $350 million -- up from last year's $175 million.
No one here was particularly surprised by such legislative largesse, coming as it does in a year when legislators are up for re-election, the economy is healthy and the state is awash in cash. But while the open process was supposed to hold lawmakers more accountable for their spending practices, fiscal conservatives said that when it came to pork-barrel spending, it had the opposite effect.
"Unfortunately, involving more legislators meant involving more spending," said Brian Backstrom, vice president of Change-NY. "This open process took the form of everyone getting together, thinking of as many projects of possible and deciding to fund them all."
Despite their reputation, many member items provide an economic shot in the arm for communities of all sizes. Most listed in Change-NY's report are for libraries, schools, fire departments, arts programs and centers for the elderly. But even spending that appears to have only honorable intentions often has purely political roots.
Take the $100,000 to teach students around the state about the Irish potato famine. The Legislature passed a law in 1996 requiring social studies curriculums to include a modern historical view that the famine resulted not just from a blighted potato harvest but also from Britain's policy of exporting other crops that could have kept its Irish colonial subjects alive. The legislation was sponsored by Assemblyman Joseph Crowley, who represents a largely Irish section of Queens and whose constituents may well remember his effort on Election Day.
Several community groups and local government agencies contacted today said they had not been expecting the money the Legislature decided to give them, and had no idea what it would be used for. For instance, Chuck Cornell, executive assistant to the Chautauqua County Executive, did not know what a methane digester was or why the county needed one.
"I could spend all afternoon trying to figure out why we're receiving it," he said. "Someone will have to get back to you."
That someone turned out to be Assemblyman William L. Parment, a Democrat from Ashville, who explained that a dairy farmer in Clymer had written him asking for state funds to purchase a methane digester so he could reduce the amount of cow manure polluting the water and soil around his farm. If the system works, it might be expanded to dairy farms across the state to curb pollution, said Mr. Parment, who added that he did not know the farmer receiving the grant.
"He's just a constituent who wrote to me and said, 'Hey, I've got a problem,' " Mr. Parment said. "We just want to show this is an effective way of managing manure."
But if budget negotiations remain open to the public, and especially if the economy slows, the public might start protesting pork-barrel spending, Mr. Backstrom of Change-NY said. Before that can happen, legislators need to be far more forthcoming about which member items they want to include, long before they pass a budget, he said.
"Legislators still believe that the more bacon they deliver, the more they will be loved," he said. "But the average taxpayer is sick of that thinking. It wasn't evident in the brief open process that took place this year. But it will become apparent in the coming years, when there won't be enough money to go around."
As it turns out, legislators spent less on pork last year than Change-NY expected, Mr. Backstrom said. The group had predicted that pork-barrel spending would reach a record $600 million in 1997-98, including $450 million set aside by Gov. George E. Pataki and the leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led Assembly for community projects of their choosing. But none of the $450 million, which was to be raised through borrowing, was spent. Mr. Pataki has the power to veto member items, but he may be loath to do so in a year when he and all the legislators are up for election.
Legislators defended the member items included in this election-year budget, saying it was by no means frivolous to spend $10,000 on road signs that would lure tourists to the National Warplane Museum at the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport, for example, or $3,000 on a surveillance camera for a park in Athens.
Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, said the antitax group was being unreasonable. "I think they were critical of the Governor's original budget, too, so they were never happy," said Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan. "The fact is that the economic plan that was put out to meet the needs of the people is consistent with the needs of the state."
Mr. Parment, the Assemblyman responsible for the methane digester, agreed, saying he did not understand why fiscal conservatives assailed member items year after year. His items include $25,000 for three public libraries and $15,000 for basketball courts in his district, projects that are "pretty mundane" but important to the average citizen, he said. "I don't know why my items always show up on their list," he said. "It's not like this stuff is exotic, like palm trees swaying in the breeze."

The Change-NY report lists 5,000 spending items worth $350 million that it considers "pork barrel" -- pet projects added by legislators that were not requested by the Governor. Some examples:
 
Money to increase purses at Saratoga race track -- $7,000,000

Deceased firefighter's monument -- 225,000

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Developer Plans to Build Rental Apartments in Historic Chelsea

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
For nearly three decades the Getty gas station stood on the southeast corner of 20th Street and 10th Avenue in Chelsea. But now a Manhattan developer who has leased the land is advancing plans to build a rental apartment building on the site.
The plan is to construct an eight-story building with up to 70 one- and two-bedroom apartments, ranging in size from 500 to 750 square feet, on the first seven stories. Two penthouse units, each with 1,000 square feet, would share the eighth floor, and the ground floor would provide 10,000 square feet of retail space. 
 The developer, Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation, secured a 99-year lease on the site at 460 West 20th Street last month and started razing the gas station two weeks ago.
The $10 million project marks the company's entry into the Manhattan housing market. It owns three million square feet of commercial properties in the Northeast and the Southwest, including one million in the metropolitan New York region, said Ben Ashkenazy, president of the company.
"The market is demanding and justifying new housing and this is the best underutilized corner in Chelsea," Mr. Ashkenazy said, noting that the site is in a primarily residential neighborhood and is two blocks from the Chelsea Piers recreation complex. He said the company would use its own money to start the project and then seek bank financing.
Monthly rents at the building are expected to average $35 a square foot, or $1,750 for a one-bedroom apartment and $2,625 for a two-bedroom.
The rental market is "extremely tight" in Chelsea, said Evie C. Scocos, rental manager of the Bellmarc Brokerage in Manhattan. Her firm puts the vacancy rate at about 1 percent. The scarce supply pushed rental prices up by 10 percent over the last year, she said.
Monthly rents in comparable buildings with units of similar sizes range from $1,850 to $2,000 for one-bedroom apartments, and from $2,300 to $2,600 for two-bedroom units, Ms. Scocos said.
The current zoning does not include specific height restrictions for a building at the site.
But because the property is in the Chelsea Historic District, which encompasses parts of West 20th, 21st, 22d and 23d Streets between 8th and 10th Avenues, any new buildings must receive a certificate of "appropriateness" from the Landmarks Preservation Commission. That means, among other things, that the facade and scale of proposed buildings must complement those of neighboring buildings.
The area includes the Gothic-style General Theological Seminary, an Oxford-like oasis set on a block bounded by 9th and 10th Avenues and 20th and 21st Streets. The land for the seminary was donated by Clement Clarke Moore, a theologian who is the author of "A Visit from St. Nicholas" and is considered Chelsea's founding father. In the 1830's, he reluctantly began developing the estate his grandfather had bought 50 years earlier and had named Chelsea.
Opposite the seminary is the Greek Revival Cushman Row group of town houses at 406-418 West 20th Street, which were completed in 1840. On the westernmost corner of that block is the gas station site.
To further preserve the neighborhood the local Community Board 4 devised a plan, which was adopted two years ago by the City Planning Commission and City Council as an advisory document to guide development in the area. The plan, among other things, limits the height of new buildings in certain areas of Chelsea. The height of new buildings in most areas in or near the historic district, for example, would be a maximum of seven stories, said Edward Kirkland, chairman of the Chelsea Preservation and Planning Committee of Community Board 4.
The city is now preparing zoning changes to carry out the plan. The zoning proposal then must undergo a review during which the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposal and the City Planning Commission and the City Council can adopt the changes.
Mr. Kirkland said the 20th Street site was important to the historic district. "The gas station was likely to be replaced," he said. "But we were hoping that wouldn't happen until the plan was in place, insuring that a new building would conform with the neighborhood's historic scale."
Though Mr. Kirkland has not seen Mr. Ashkenazy's plan, he said the building as proposed appeared to be higher than the community board and nearby residents would like.
Five months ago the company submitted a plan for a nine-story building, which the staff of the Landmarks commission recommended be reworked "to be more appropriate," given the buildings nearby.
The new plan lowers the height by one story and Mr. Ashkenazy said the project could still work economically by eliminating the penthouse floor and having a seven-story building.
Though the building's final design has yet to be determined, Mr. Ashkenazy said it would be done "with the existing and new zoning in mind and would fit into the neighborhood." He said he expected to present the new plan to the Landmarks commission in the next two months and to start construction in the fall, with completion a year later.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Heavily Laden Black Chips;
Empowerment Deals Thrive In South Africa, but Sniping And Skepticism Mount

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
When does a "black empowerment deal" truly empower blacks? And when is it just another example of what Jimmy Manye calls "the Irish coffee problem" -- blacks on the bottom, whites on top, with a sprinkling of black faces like cinnamon on the foam to lend respectability?
These are some of the hardest questions in South African business today. 
 Black empowerment is the rage in the private sector and the law in the public sector. In the last four years, so many empowerment deals have been struck that blacks now control 28 companies worth a total of more than $13 billion, about 6 percent of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, according to Business Map, a consultancy that tracks business trends.
In general, blacks and whites are surprised and pleased that it has gone so well. The leading "black chip" companies outperformed the Johannesburg Stock Exchange last year.
But there is growing dissatisfaction with mega-deals that enrich only a few fortunate and well-placed blacks. That came to the fore in January with the collapse of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments Ltd., one of the country's oldest mining houses.
The sale of the company by the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa to the African Mining Group, headed by Mzi Khumalo, was hailed as a historic moment -- the first time a black man gained control of part of the mining industry. But a falling gold price and Mr. Khumalo's mismanagement so shattered the mining company that it is being broken up and sold off. And critics are saying that Mr. Khumalo, who effectively owned less than 1 percent of JCI's shares, was really a front for white mining executives and bankers who wanted to own a valuable Anglo American spinoff that had been reserved for black buyers.
By contrast, the earlier sale of another Anglo American division, Johnnic, is considered an empowerment success. Cyril Ramaphosa, the former secretary general of the African National Congress and head of the mine workers' union, is the new chairman, and the company is doing well. Hundreds of thousands of black union members are shareholders through their pension funds, and tens of thousands of black small investors were recruited, too. Johnnic has interests in newspapers, automobile plants, beverages and other industries, and the subsidiaries are under pressure to show affirmative action results.
More recently, the head of the broadcasting authority that just awarded Midi TV a license to start the first privately owned free television channel said Midi's 80 percent ownership by black groups had given it the edge. The chairwoman of Midi is Nomazizi Mtoshotshisa -- who, coincidentally, was once married to Mr. Ramaphosa -- and its owners include the pension funds of the mine workers', metal workers' and textile workers' unions, the black chamber of commerce and bodies representing youths and the disabled. Midi also has a powerful foreign backer: Time Warner Inc., which owns 20 percent.
Midi had six rivals for the television license. A recent race for casino licenses drew 23 bidders. Most of these bids for Government licenses are similar: each inevitably has a black spokesman, at least a small group of black investors and a huge local or foreign backer. Cynics sneer that in some cases the blacks are merely window dressing.
Both the private sector, through the Black Management Forum headed by Mr. Manye (pronounced MAHN-yeh), and the Government are inventing ways to test the legitimacy of such bids.
This country has about 33 million nonwhites, counting those formerly classified as African, colored or Indian. All are now, in empowerment jargon, P.D.I.'s -- "previously disadvantaged individuals." And all, when it is politically advantageous to do so, call themselves "black." Most are poor and know little about the stock market. A few are talented entrepreneurs or well-connected politicians in a position to take repeated rides on the empowerment juggernaut. And a few are simply opportunists willing to, in effect, sell their skins to unscrupulous white business executives.
Some white-run companies are taking advantage of empowerment either to qualify for minority contracts or to buy political good will.
"We're sick and tired of companies who do what they want and call it empowerment," Mr. Manye said. "We're going to make it our business to investigate these deals."
As Phinda Madi, the author of "Black Economic Empowerment in the New South Africa," put it, some companies think that having a minority black stake and "a well-known black personality with struggle credentials" as chairman will "serve as protection against the transformation barbarians at the gate."
"It is an open secret," he added, "that some organizations with dreadful industrial relations track records get into empowerment deals as a labor relations shield. The new chairman becomes the fire-eater, the magician to calm the marauding masses on the shop floor."
As more and more black empowerment consortiums -- with names like African Harvest, Kuyasa Mining and Dynamo Investments -- have emerged to compete for the attention of lenders, skepticism has set in. Jenny Cargill, director of Business Map, says bankers and executives are questioning exactly what constitutes "black empowerment."
"One can't belittle black ownership -- it's important," Ms. Cargill said. "But it's usually been achieved with very high debt levels. All the dividends go back to the institutions that backed the deal. Now the companies need to get scrutinized more on their internal policies -- management training, affirmative action. There are these enormous glass ceilings over black staff."
Even in companies owned by the early black consortiums, affirmative action may go slowly. New Africa Investments Ltd., formed in 1994 by President Nelson Mandela's physician, Dr. Nthato Motlana, owns African Merchant Bank, "which is still a very white institution," Ms. Cargill said.
Paradoxically, the company with the best reputation for bringing along black middle managers is South African Breweries, which has white executives and no significant black shareholding.
Mr. Manye wants to create a sort of Black Empowerment Seal of Approval. He is gathering a council of executives, union leaders, church leaders and others to write a checklist by which to measure proposed deals that say they are black-empowerment exercises. It will probably include these provisions:
*How much equity will blacks have?
*How much management control will blacks have?
*Do the blacks named as managers actually have management skills?
*How much training will blacks get?
*Once trained, will they be promoted?
*What will the company do for the poor and for small black businesses?
*Are the assets for sale actually worth the price?
*Do the white partners have the same plans for the company as the black ones do?
The Black Management Forum, which is not rich, expects deal makers to pay to have their proposals investigated. Then, he said, "if you get our stamp of approval, you'll be in good shape." He added, "Nobody will be able to doubt it's black empowerment."
In the public sector, the process is already being formalized by law.
Edward Lalumbe, the legal adviser to the Gauteng Gambling and Betting Board, in the province that includes Johannesburg, had to sort through the 23 long applications for casino licenses. By law, each had to have a black empowerment component. But all were backed by big investors, some by South African companies like Anglo American or the Stocks and Stocks real estate development company, some by Malaysian or other foreign investors. The Black Management Forum, not entirely a disinterested observer, was itself a partner in some of the bids, he noted.
If an applicant said it had a large percentage of black shareholders, the board's auditors would look into who the lenders and the casino manager were. If the projected loan interest or management fees were so large that the shareholders would not see dividends for years, the auditors would question the sincerity of the deal.
Applicants tried different tacks. Some promised to meet quotas for hiring black croupiers, pit bosses and managers. Others promised to buy supplies from black businesses, hire black contractors for construction or set up trusts to lend money to small black businesses. One promised to build a stadium nearby and train black athletes.
For the winners of the four licenses awarded, those promises will become conditions of their licenses. "Our inspectors will check up on them," Mr. Lalumbe said. "If they don't do what they promised, they'll pay penalties or have their license withdrawn."
To spread ownership down to small black investors, many empowerment deals now try to do what Midi TV did: bring in the pension funds of traditionally black unions like the miners and food industry workers. Some approach church groups, women's groups and other organizations and ask them to flog shares to their members.
And two events are in the works that should markedly increase black share ownership in South African society.
The first is that the country's two biggest life insurers, Old Mutual and Sanlam, with combined assets of almost $70 billion, have announced plans to demutualize and list on the stock exchange. All their policyholders, many of whom are black, will automatically become shareholders.
The second is that the Government, which is slowly selling off assets like the national phone company, national airline and the like, will set aside 10 percent of the shares in each deal for small black investors.

HEADLINE: Bank Mergers Pose Challenge To Regulators

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
With a sudden flood of multibillion-dollar bank mergers rapidly changing the financial landscape, some legislators have begun to wonder how well equipped banking regulators are to supervise the new corporate giants.
As the new behemoths adopt the guise of enormous vending machines, spitting out everything from credit cards and savings accounts to insurance, stocks and bonds, the regulatory network that oversees them is splintered among several powerful and turf-conscious Federal agencies that often butt heads when it comes to deciding who is in charge. Those turf wars are only magnified when mergers heat up in an industry like banking. 
 Even so, many bankers and regulators consider a fragmented regulatory system a safeguard against the possible closed-mindedness of one, all-powerful financial chieftain. But short of creating a super-regulator -- an idea that has repeatedly foundered in Congress over the last few decades anyhow -- there are still those who think that the wave of mergers requires some changes in how regulatory agencies oversee financial services concerns, particularly banks.
Yesterday, Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, said he would hold hearings April 29 to address, in part, the regulatory challenges posed by the merger boom.
"The financial firms involved in the recently announced mega-mergers are well-respected companies that are acting under current law and regulation," Representative Leach said. "A critical question that the committee will want to address is whether legislation is needed to insure that management and regulators are equipped to prudently administer and supervise institutions of such dimensions."
The challenges facing the nation's banking supervisors are about to grow far more complex than they were in the earlier, bygone era of plain-vanilla banking, largely because of the ramifications of one event -- the merger agreement struck early last week between Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc.
That merger aims to create a new company, Citigroup Inc., that would stand like a financial colossus astride such varied businesses as banking, insurance underwriting and stock brokerage. Insurance powers are the new fly in the ointment when it comes to bank regulation. Banks are permitted to sell insurance, but most cannot underwrite policies. Citicorp is one of a handful of banks that can underwrite life insurance and annuities, but it is still forbidden to underwrite risky property and casualty insurance indefinitely without dispensation from the Federal Reserve.
As that clock begins ticking after the Citigroup merger takes effect, it is likely that other banks will test the insurance waters as well, forcing Federal banking regulators to don yet another hat -- that of the insurance analyst. Banks are also expanding more aggressively into other new activities, such as the sale or underwriting of stocks, making the regulatory web even more complex.
The officials primarily responsible for keeping tabs on banks include the Federal Reserve, which oversees bank holding companies, has great sway in determining whether major banks can pursue new lines of business, has final approval over mergers, and opens and closes the money supply spigot; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which charters national banks and examines their books; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which guarantees the deposits of its member banks, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, which charters and examines savings and loan companies.
There is no single Federal insurance regulator. Rather, there are individual insurance regulators in each of the 50 states. Since so many commercial banks have also moved into investment banking and brokerage businesses, the Securities and Exchange Commission gets to play its regulatory role in the banking industry as well. To date, the derivatives business has been only loosely regulated, despite banks' heavy involvement in trading those complex financial hybrids in a booming international market. Exactly which Government agency has primary authority for regulating derivatives is still a matter of debate, as the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are engaged in a turf war over those powers.
What all of this means is that the types of risks major banks are undertaking as they pursue new lines of business are far different and more complicated than ever, yet there is a snarl of regulators assessing those risks. Moreover, the current regulatory brew produces a hodgepodge of rules that can make for some odd inconsistencies in the way big banks in the same markets operate.
"It has always seemed bizarre to me that our financial system is subject to four separate Federal regulatory agencies for banking," said Robert Tortoriello, a lawyer with the New York firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. "There are four separate supervisors who don't say the same thing on every issue for every bank."
For example, the Comptroller permits subsidiaries of national banks to underwrite municipal bonds, while the Fed forbids state-chartered banks to do the same thing. National banks are forbidden to own real estate investments under the Comptroller's guidelines, while the F.D.I.C. permits some state-chartered banks to own investment property.
One outcome of all of this is that banks regularly shop new business ideas to different regulators in the hope that one agency will sign off on something another opposes. And many regulators think that is a healthy thing for the economy.
"It's been fundamental to the history, development, and strength of the U.S. banking system to have nationally chartered banks and state-chartered banks with different powers," said Julie Williams, the Acting Comptroller of the Currency. "What it has produced over the years is innovation at the state and national levels."
To be sure, no one is arguing that every merger of the last several days is cause for regulatory alarm. A pair of huge merger agreements on Monday, between the BankAmerica Corporation and the Nationsbank Corporation and the Banc One Corporation and the First Chicago NBD Corporation, were noteworthy for their unusual size, but they are just much larger versions of mergers that have been going on for several years as banks attempt to expand their national or regional reach.
"I don't see why some of these big bank mergers would require a change in the regulatory scheme," said H. Rodgin Cohen, a lawyer specializing in banking law with Sullivan & Cromwell. "There are no antitrust issues here with the big mergers, and Federal regulators have already been moving expeditiously to address mergers of great size in the banking industry."
But the Citicorp merger with Travelers is a unique event in the financial world and it is the main reason some legislators want to readdress the contentious issue of regulatory reform.
Although so many new financial activities are now being swept under the banking umbrella, it is unlikely that it will result in any mega-mergers among Federal regulatory bodies. A bill sponsored by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and introduced in February of last year, seeks to create a commission that would merely coordinate the activities of disparate agencies. But the fact that Senator D'Amato's idea has not caught fire in Congress illustrates how little enthusiasm there is for giving any overarching supervisory powers to one body.
Merging the operations of big bank supervisors has not sat well with the heads of any of the regulatory agencies currently overseeing banking. Some of this has to do with a desire to protect administrative turf. Yet many, including bankers themselves, see diffuse regulatory powers as a boon to the banking industry. One of the chief proponents of this view is the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.
"A consolidated single regulator would deprive our regulatory structure of what the board considers to be the current invaluable restraint on any one regulator conducting inflexible, excessively rigid policies," Mr. Greenspan said in 1994, when the idea of a super-regulator was floated unsuccessfully in Congress. "The dual banking system and multiple Federal regulators have facilitated diversity, inventiveness and flexibility in our banking system, so important to a market economy subject to rapid change. A single Federal regulator would effectively end the dual banking system."
Legislation intended to overhaul banking laws was recently withdrawn in the House of Representatives, but is to be reintroduced shortly. It calls for clearly breaking down regulatory authority by function. In that plan, the S.E.C. would get first crack at regulating securities activities by banks, insurance czars in each state would oversee insurance operations and so forth. The bill also tilts in favor of the Federal Reserve as the principal regulator of banking activities.
Representative Leach said he saw that bill as a potential model for how regulatory snags might be resolved, although he acknowledged that the Comptroller was unlikely to defer to the Fed as a first among equals when it comes to banking regulation.
"The question with the Citicorp merger with Travelers is how it fits within the current construct of the law," Representative Leach said. "You need a precise locus of responsibility for overseeing each of the parts."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Foreigners Buy Korea Stock but Not Companies

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
While foreigners have been buying South Korean bonds and pouring cash into the country's resurgent stock market, direct foreign investment in Korean companies remains sluggish.
Since the nation flirted with default on its international loans in December, only two outright acquisitions of South Korean companies by foreigners have been confirmed: BASF's purchase of the Daesung group's lysine business for $600 million last month, and the impending acquisition of Samsung Heavy Industries' construction equipment unit by Volvo for $765 million. 
 While foreign investors complain about sketchy accounting and legal barriers, many of the negotiations under way here are bogged down over the fundamental issue of price. Even acutely troubled Korean companies are expensive, their ability to survive bolstered by easy availability of capital.
South Korean banks, saddled themselves with bulging nonperforming loan portfolios, are finding ways to prop up favored corporations that are technically insolvent, and the result, in the eyes of many foreign investors, is that valuations are unrealistically high.
"There are lots of active negotiations and due diligence going on, but all are running into the very significant difference between buyers' and sellers' perceptions of value," said Gary L. Clinton, co-chairman of the foreign investment committee at the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea. He noted that many of the deals coming to fruition now began before the country was forced to go the International Monetary Fund for financial help.
To be sure, many foreign companies have moved to protect their stakes in joint-venture operations by buying out their partners.
Intel has pledged $1 billion to help support small and midsized companies in the computer business.
And foreign investors purchased the bulk of $4 billion of South Korean Government bonds that sold recently at far lower rates than even optimistic analysts had expected.
Foreigners are largely responsible for the rise in the Korean stock index, a more liquid form of investment than direct acquisition of companies.
But the fire sale that many investors anticipated has not developed, at least not yet. The Government has moved swiftly to eliminate regulations on foreign investment, and officials from President Kim Dae Jung on down have devoted themselves to selling corporate South Korea to the rest of the world.
The country does need investment. "There are no domestic sources of capital available on remotely the scale that's needed," said Wilbur Ross, senior managing director of Rothschild Inc. in New York and adviser to the Halla group, one of South Korea's troubled conglomerates.
In an effort to prop up companies that in many cases were its best customers, Korean banks have been providing financing to weak corporations at below-market rates, a practice euphemistically labeled "cooperative financing." It takes different forms, ranging from outright new loans to rolling over existing debt at lower interest rates.
Often the beneficiaries of such largess have debts outweighing their equity by four times or more, an astounding level by Western standards.
Critics say that this practice further imperils the already shaky banking system and deters the foreign investment South Korea desperately needs. "This is retrogression in the financial system," said Stephen E. Marvin, research chief at the Ssangyong Investment and Securities Company. "And it is the financial system that is most vulnerable at this point because the financial system is highly exposed to large numbers of companies with huge amounts of debt and no way to service it. Let's face it, these cooperative loans are gone; they're never going to be paid back."
Take the Hanwha group, South Korea's ninth-largest conglomerate, which is struggling to restructure itself, so far to little avail. "The most difficult part of restructuring is implementation," said Lee Jae Moo, head of strategic planning at Hanwha. "This is taking a long time, longer than we expected."
Hanwha has put a number of its businesses -- petroleum-refining operations and gasoline stations, a precision ball-bearing machinery company and some real estate holdings -- on the market. The ball-bearing company is being examined by prospective buyers, and the energy businesses have attracted several interested parties despite a debt-to-equity ratio of 10 to one.
Hanwha's banks have extended cooperative financing twice since December to keep it afloat. The energy business relies on short-term commercial paper to purchase oil imports, and making payments was difficult in the period immediately after South Korea went to the I.M.F. for loans, Mr. Lee said.
All told, at current exchange rates, Hanwha has received $286 million in additional financing at preferential market rates, and its bankers have rolled over $244 million in debt. Over all, the company has a debt-to-equity ratio of seven to one
No wonder, then, that Hanwha must work hard to sell its assets: It has to get very high prices if it is ever to pay off its bankers.
Hanwha's desire for a high price for its energy businesses, despite the debt-to-equity ratio, has already driven away Royal Dutch/Shell, reportedly one of the contenders along with Caltex and Total, according to bankers.
"That kind of financing isn't great news," said Harry Van Dyke, head of Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions business in Asia and adviser to the Daesung group. "It means less pressure on companies to rationalize their businesses."
President Kim has called for an end to cooperative financing, but Lee Chul Hwan, a director in the Economic Policy Bureau of the Finance Ministry, said there was probably no legal way to prevent banks from making whatever loans they chose. "We agree that it only delays reorganization," he said of the practice. "We're working to set some limits."
Business is fighting those efforts. Lee Yong Hwan, executive director of the Federation of Korean Industries, compared ailing companies like Kia, Halla and Hanbo to the Chrysler Corporation, which Washington bailed out in 1979 because it was deemed too big to be allowed to fail.
"The consequences of loans to insolvent companies should be left to market principles," he said. "The decision to extend cooperative financing is a decision reached between a bank and its client company, and so should not be stopped."
South Korea's bankers insist that such preferential treatment is given only after careful consideration of a client's future prospects. "The extension of cooperative financing always comes with a strong demand for restructuring," said Lee Seok Woo, assistant director of loans and loan evaluation at the Hanil Bank, Hanwha's lead bank, and the only banker willing to discuss the practice for the record. "If we see no positive results, then we stop providing cooperative financing and allow a company to go bankrupt," he said.
But if that were to happen too often, it would bring down the banking system, he said, adding, "We are taking such measures because if we allow insolvent companies to go bankrupt, this will lead to too many nonperforming loans."
On the other hand, said Rhee Namuh, chief of research at Samsung Securities: "If banks were willing to take the hit, it would make debt restructuring much easier and invigorate the whole liquidation cycle. But so far, though, restructuring has been very disappointing, especially in terms of the reform of banking practices, which is crucial."
Paradoxically, those companies that do not receive cooperative financing seem to be restructuring the most quickly. The Daesung group, which sold its lysine manufacturing operations to BASF, had to put its golden egg on the market to survive, but it was rewarded when a bidding war broke out and the price ended up at a remarkable 2.8 times revenue.
The lysine business represented one-fifth of Daesung's revenue, but its sale will lower the group's debt level to 2.5 times equity compared with four times equity before.
"The few firms that have cut their prices and agreed to terms that they wouldn't have considered realistic a year ago stand to reap the greatest benefits," said Richard Samuelson, executive director of SBC Warburg Dillon Read in Seoul. "They're going to end up getting the higher prices in the long run and be in better shape to go forward faster."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Earnings Setbacks and Asia Fears Send the Dow Sliding

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Disappointing earnings from the drug maker Merck, a reversal among technology stocks and a wisp of trouble in Asia helped send the stock market lower yesterday.
The crash of the stock of the Cendant Corporation after it announced that accounting irregularities would force it to restate earnings also helped pull the broader market lower. Cendant, which owns or controls brands that include Avis, Howard Johnson and Coldwell Banker, tumbled 16 9/16, or 46 percent, to 19 1/16. 
 "The trend is positive, but we will continue to see this volatility because there is so much uncertainty" about the immediate outlook, said George Cohen, a principal at Cohen, Klingenstein & Marks, a money manager.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which set a new high Wednesday, fell 85.70 points, to 9,076.57, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 11.15 points, to 1,108.17. The Nasdaq index, which also hit a new high Wednesday, finished down 5.02 points at 1,858.24.
Overnight, stocks in Asia fell sharply, led by a 2.9 percent drop in South Korea and a 2.6 percent fall in Japan. The finance ministers of the Group of Seven nations meeting in Washington indicated that they would not move to support the weak yen, saying that it is the Japanese Government's job to get the economy moving again. In South Korea, labor tensions rose as workers threatened a strike at Kia Motors, a bankrupt auto maker.
While the outlook for Asia -- and its impact on the American economy and corporate earnings -- has been better than had been expected several months ago, the market declines were a reminder that there could still be trouble ahead.
Stocks were also pressured by Merck & Company, which announced before the market opened that its first-quarter earnings rose 95 cents a diluted share, just below the estimates of analysts. Considering how much some drug stocks have rallied this year, the underperformance led to a selloff. Merck fell 4 1/16, to 119 7/16. Johnson & Johnson, which just met analysts' expectations when it reported earnings Tuesday, dropped 1 9/16, to 70. Eli Lilly was off 1 1/2, to 63 1/4, and Warner-Lambert fell 1 15/16, to 168 13/16.
The only major drug stock that rallied was Pfizer, up 3 1/8, to 100 11/16. Pfizer has jumped 35 percent this year on optimism about its new impotence drug, Viagra.
Technology stocks had risen sharply Wednesday. But yesterday, even after the surprisingly strong earnings from Apple Computer, a lot of big technology stocks fell.
One negative factor in the Apple report may have hurt: its revenue was down 12 percent, meaning that all the strong earnings came from cost-cutting and better profit margins. But some analysts feel that it is getting harder to improve results this way, given the price cutting in the industry and the pressures on wages. This means sales are the way to higher profits, and Apple and other computer companies still face problems on this front.
Intel, which reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday but said the second-quarter outlook is not strong, fell for the second day, finishing at 74 3/8, down 1/2. Amgen fell 2 1/8, to 53 13/16, and Cisco Systems, which rose sharply Wednesday, slipped 1/2, to 70 3/16. Microsoft was down early in the day but rallied to close up 5/16 at 91 11/16.
Ford rallied at the opening, after reporting record earnings that were better than expected. But it then slipped, a fall that may have been spurred by its announcement that it had no immediate plans to repurchase more stock, a maneuver popular with investors. It fell 3/16, to 49 11/16. The companies involved in the three big financial mergers announced over the last two weeks all fell again, led by BankAmerica, down 3.4 percent, and Nationsbank, down 3.1 percent. J. P. Morgan, which hit a 52-week high Wednesday on speculation that it might merge, dropped 3.9 percent.
On the positive side, Internet stocks surged. Excite jumped 8 1/8, to 91 1/8, before reporting that its losses had narrowed during the first quarter.
Oil company stocks shot higher as the price of crude oil moved up sharply for the second day. Exxon, up 1 5/8, to 70 5/16; Chevron, up 3 11/16, to 83 3/4, and Mobil, up 1 5/8, to 77 1/8, gave both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 their biggest lifts.
So far, 149 companies in the S.& P. 500 have reported quarterly earnings. Of the total, 50 percent have reported a positive earnings surprise, below the range of 55 percent to 65 percent of the last two years, accorrding to I.B.E.S., a firm that tracks analysts' estimates.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Threatens to Oppose Kennedy Rail Link

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced yesterday that it had awarded a contract of nearly $1 billion to build a long-delayed rail line linking Kennedy International Airport to nearby subways and trains. But hours after the announcement, the Giuliani administration warned in a blunt statement that the city had not yet formally approved the plan.
The total $1.5 billion project, a scaled-down version of what has been a long-frustrated dream of city planners, would for the first time link the airport by rail to Manhattan and other points. The Port Authority said yesterday that it planned to break ground on the light-rail line within months and have it running in phases in 2002 and 2003, but such hopes were immediately tempered by the city's reaction to the annoucement. 
 "This project cannot begin until a final agreement is reached with the city," Anthony P. Coles, a senior aide to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said in a statement. "A final agreement has not been reached and by making this announcement prematurely the Port Authority, once again, is placing its own priorities over the priorities of New York City."
Administration officials said they wanted explicit written assurances that the city would not end up paying $200 million in construction costs that are not covered by an airline passenger tax. The city also wants to be sure that the Port Authority will carry out a planned study of a separate link to La Guardia Airport.
The Mayor had originally favored a far more ambitious plan to provide a rail link from Manhattan to Kennedy that would not require passengers to change trains in Jamaica, Queens. He finally eased that stance last year, but has continued to take a tough line in negotiating with the Port Authority, which he has long accused of favoring New Jersey over New York. The Giuliani administration has also vowed to seize control of New York's airports from the Port Authority.
If the Mayor chose to, he could stall the project through the city's land use review process. Before the light rail project can begin, it must gain approval from the City Council and the city Planning Commission, a majority of whose members the Mayor appoints.
Port Authority officials announced the awarding of the $930 million construction contract during an elaborate news conference in which they presented miniature models of the train and showed renderings of the futuristic light rail cars traveling in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway. The construction contract and a $105 million, five-year contract to run and maintain the line was awarded to a team of companies: Skanska USA, the American division of a Swedish heavy construction company; the Bombardier Transit Corporation, a Quebec train manufacturer, and the Perini Corporation of Framingham, Mass., a construction company.
The line, officials said, would allow for rail trips between Pennsylvania Station and Kennedy Airport that would take only 45 minutes and involve one transfer. The trip from Manhattan to Kennedy can now take more than two hours by car or bus, or subway and bus, along sometimes congested routes.
The dispute was just one in a series of instances in which the Mayor has taken issue with projects backed by the state.
Last summer, Mayor Giuliani said he would block the sale of the Coliseum site in Manhattan only days before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was to announce the selection of a developer.
The Mayor has also turned a deaf ear to the state's $750 million proposal to expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
"Obviously, there are disagreements between the city and the state," Charles A. Gargano, the state's Commissioner of Economic Development, said yesterday. "There is no question these things have to be worked out. But it's hard to understand the criticism about spending $1.5 billion on light rail to Kennedy Airport."
The current disagreement stems from a crucial ruling by the Federal Aviation Administration in February. In an advancement for the plan, the agency ruled that $1.3 billion of the project could be paid for mainly through revenue from a $3 charge already added to every ticket sold for flights from Kennedy. But the Federal agency ruled that the ticket fees could not be used to cover as much as $200 million in project expenses.
A Giuliani administration official said the city would not give final approval to the project until it had been guaranteed it would not have to pay the additional $200 million.
"We have to make sure that if there is a shortfall, the city is not liable for it," the official said.
The stance was one in a series of tough negotiating positions the Giuliani administration has taken.
The city and the state were close to an agreement last June, but it fell apart when the Mayor learned that the Port Authority planned to deduct its $300 million share of the construction cost from the rent it pays the city on the airports, effectively passing on the cost to the city.
During later negotiations in September, the city refused to approve a $23 billion plan for Federal transportation aid, stopping the flow of Federal money for hundreds of projects in New York State and the city. The state eventually agreed to provide the $300 million shortfall and finance a $100 million study of a direct subway line between Manhattan and La Guardia Airport.
The 8.4-mile project is about one-fourth the price of a proposed 22-mile railway linking Manhattan, Kennedy and La Guardia airports that was deemed too costly in 1995, one of 20 previous proposals that have stalled over the last three decades.
Officials have long said that easier access to Kennedy is one of the region's most pressing transportation needs.
Port Authority officials said that under the plan a two-mile rail line would link Kennedy's nine terminals to each other. A 3.4-mile line would link the terminals to parking lots, rental car agencies and the Howard Beach subway station. A three-mile elevated line running up the center of the Van Wyck Expressway would link the airport at Jamaica Station in Queens to the Long Island Rail Road, the E, J and Z subway lines and the bus lines.
Port Authority officials said the shuttle around the airport would be free and other prices were not set.
Karen Antion, the Port Authority's chief technology officer, said the new rail system would attract anxious passengers by allowing them to avoid erratic traffic congestion. "Even if it's a fairly quick trip," she said, "it's more important that it be reliable, that you know how long it will take you."
Port Authority officials said a big part of the potential ridership in the new system would be Kennedy employees. People working at the airport make up about half of the people traveling to and from the airport each day, they said.
Currently one million of the 18 to 20 million passengers who travel to and from Kennedy each year use the subway to arrive there, according to Patty Clark, airport access program manager for the Port Authority. She said that Port Authority officials project that four million people will use the subway and train for travel to Kennedy during the new system's first year.
The plan still faces hurdles. The Air Transport Association, the trade association of the major airlines, vowed to pursue a lawsuit it has filed in Federal District Court in Washington questioning the F.A.A. ruling that $1.2 billion in passenger taxes could be used for the project.
Critics of the plan, who include dozens of Queens community groups opposed to the Jamaica station link, say it is a glorified version of the failed "train to the plane" express subway that was abandoned in 1990 because of low ridership. Lugging heavy luggage into subway stations and making transfers, one of the main complaints of the train to plane, are part of the new system.

HEADLINE: Warsaw Journal;
Trying to Make the Twain of East and West Meet

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, April 10

 BODY:
Bronislaw Geremek, the Foreign Minister of Poland, is an ineffably polite man and a practiced listener. But there are occasions that try his patience.
After hearing some platitudes over a copious lunch from his counterpart in neighboring Belarus about how the authoritarian Government there held no political prisoners, Mr. Geremek, a dissident during Poland's Communist era, replied crisply, "That's what they used to say in Poland when I was in prison and being called a hooligan who spied for the United States." 
 Such passion in public is unusual in the highly scripted world of foreign ministers. But in many respects -- for instance, as a Jew in a country that during the 20th century has shown little tolerance toward Jews, and as a distinguished historian -- Mr. Geremek is different from his well-rehearsed colleagues who dominate diplomacy in Europe.
Appointed last fall by the new Solidarity-based Government, Mr. Geremek, 66, is Poland's public face at a critical juncture: as the deal to join NATO is all but done, and negotiations on what promises to be a tortuous path to the European Union are just beginning. As Poland seeks to anchor itself in the West -- to regain "our natural place," Mr. Geremek says -- it must foster relations with its old foe, Russia.
In short, Poland is trying a delicate balancing act as it strives, with its 40 million population and spirited 6 percent annual growth, to become a mid-size European power.
On its western border, relations with Germany are close to "a miracle," says Mr. Geremek, who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II. His father died at Auschwitz, and many of his relatives, he said, were also killed at the death camp.
"I'm astonished in the change of attitude of Polish society toward Germany," Mr. Geremek said during a conversation at the Foreign Ministry here. Surveys show that Poles feel steadily less threatened by Germany, even as they remain uneasy about the territorial designs of Russia. For Mr. Geremek, the reconciliation with Germany has been a personal journey, as well.
"I couldn't imagine I would become a defender of Polish-German rapprochement and that I would receive the Karls Prize," he said, referring to a prestigious award he will receive next month in Germany. "With my biography I could not forget the war. I had to learn how deep was the sense of responsibility of Germany society for the last war. I will never forget the past, but I think it is a closed chapter."
With Russia it is not so easy. First, there is Poland's membership in NATO. On his first visit to Moscow as Foreign Minister, Mr. Geremek said he found the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, sincere. "He said: 'You have to understand we are not glad about the enlargement of NATO. But we know it will happen. Just don't ask us to be happy about it.' "
Then there is the question of Poland's eastern border; once Poland becomes a member of the European Union, this will become the frontier between Western Europe and the former Soviet Union. As a price of admission to the European Union, Western Europe is demanding that Poland create strict controls on its 1,000-mile-plus border, through which hundreds of thousands of Russians, Ukrainians and Belarussians pour monthly.
In Germany and France, some argue that by wanting to join the European Union but still maintain warm trading ties with Russia, Poland wants to have its cake and eat it, too. "The European Union has quite good cake by having Poland," said Mr. Geremek, forever the Polish patriot.
But aware that Western Europe still needs to be convinced that Poland can manage its borders, Poland has introduced paid visas for some visitors from the east. In essence, though, Mr. Geremek is in favor of openness.
"I don't think at the end of the 20th century we should think in terms of closed borders and repressive means," he said. "One can't create barbed wire; that period is over. I'm a former dissident, and I can't forget that for us, the possibility of going abroad and getting a visa easily means freedom."
After escaping the Warsaw ghetto at age 11 with his mother, Mr. Geremek spent the last two years of the war in western Poland under the protection of a Christian man who later became his mother's husband. He returned to Warsaw and graduated in history from the university and took postgraduate studies at the Sorbonne in the late 1950's.
He speaks impeccable French and is treated like a national treasure when he arrives in Paris. One of the reasons, perhaps, is that his specialty as a historian is medieval France. His postdoctoral thesis was on prostitutes and outcasts in medieval Paris, a subject that he warmed to, he said, because it dealt with the weak and the poor.
In 1968, when the Communist Party ran an anti-Jewish campaign and many of the remaining 30,000 Jews in Poland emigrated, Mr. Geremek stayed put. He never considered leaving. "It's my country," he said. "If I don't like the policy in my country, I have to change it."
Later that year the Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia, and Mr. Geremek left the Communist Party. "That was the last chapter of the illusion that Communism can have a human face," he said.
When the Solidarity trade union movement coalesced around the shipyard worker Lech Walesa, Mr. Geremek became one of a handful of intellectuals who devised a strategy to outwit the regime. During martial law, he was interned for a year.
In the last few months, Mr. Geremek has been out of Poland more than at home, visiting hot spots as chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the 55-nation group that includes the United States and works on conflict prevention and resolution. He flies, with only a modest retinue, in the Polish Foreign Ministry's small jet. This month he was in Central Asia, in part because as a leader who feels his country was kept outside the pale of normalcy for too long, he believes that smaller nations must be heard from.
But overwhelmingly, his eye is on the main chance for Poland, and there his sense of Realpolitik far outweighs his patience. He is not a Pollyanna who believes that Poland will be part of the union by the millennium. But waiting until 2010, as has been suggested, is out of the question.
"If the expansion of the European Union is to be a factor of stability, it should happen in the next three or four years," he said. "In 10 or 12 years, anything can happen."

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Latin America to 'Be Patient' on Free Trade

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, April 16

 BODY:
President Clinton pleaded with the leaders of Latin America today to be patient with the United States as it conducts a painful internal political debate over the merits of free trade throughout the hemisphere.
Mr. Clinton, in Chile for a Latin American summit meeting dedicated to creating a hemispheric duty-free shop from the Yukon to Tierra del Fuego, felt compelled to explain Congress's refusal last fall to grant him unlimited trade negotiation authority, known as "fast track." 
 In a speech to an international business audience here today, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that he had so far failed to persuade a majority in Congress of the benefits of free trade with the other nations of the hemisphere. The United States currently has a free-trade pact with Mexico and Canada.
Mr. Clinton said that ultimately the United States would not walk away from the "colossal opportunity" presented by the so-called Free Trade Area of the Americas, which is supposed to be in place by 2005.
Mr. Clinton quoted Winston Churchill, who said, "The United States invariably does the right thing, after having exhausted every other alternative."
The President said: "So be patient with us. So just stay with us. We'll get there."
Mr. Clinton's remarks set the tone for this visit, which American officials said marks a maturation of the United States' relations with its neighbors, which have veered over the decades from military intervention to not-always-benign neglect. By opening the trip with an explanation and implied apology, Mr. Clinton hoped to establish a dialogue of equals, officials said.
Mr. Clinton said he would continue to press for approval of fast-track authority, under which Congress can approve or reject proposed trade treaties negotiated by Mr. Clinton, but cannot amend them. The Presidential authority is considered crucial to achieve trade breakthroughs because other countries will be reluctant to negotiate trade deals with the United States if they feel Congress will change the terms after an agreement is reached.
A bill granting Mr. Clinton fast-track authority was withdrawn last November after Democrats in Congress said they were not persuaded that the trade deals the President is proposing would provide adequate protection for workers and the environment.
The start of the complex seven-year trade negotiations is the centerpiece of the President's four-day visit to Chile.
The first two days of the trip are dedicated to a state visit to Chile and talks with President Eduardo Frei. This weekend, 34 of the 35 countries of the hemisphere, with the exception of Cuba, which was not invited, will convene in a hemispheric summit meeting to celebrate the spread of democracy and an era of exceptional economic expansion.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Frei, at a joint appearance today, announced that they would work together to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming. They also announced cooperative efforts on education, disaster preparedness and anti-drug programs.
Mr. Clinton is to speak to a joint meeting of the Chilean legislature on Friday. To the relief of American officials, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a lifetime member of the Senate, signaled today that he would not be present. American officials had feared that the appearance of the 82-year-old general, who led an authoritarian regime here from 1973 through 1990, would be a distraction from Mr. Clinton's message of hope, growth and democratic development in Latin America.
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said Mr. Clinton would not alter his remarks on democracy and human rights, whether General Pinochet was in the audience or not. The operative theory of the trip appears to be that meeting and talking, even if with only modest achievements, are in themselves important benchmarks in the march toward hemispheric economic and political integration.
The official line is that the President does not need fast track to begin the negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas, to which the democratic nations of the region committed themselves at the first modern Latin American summit meeting, in Miami in December 1994.
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said Washington had arranged the talks in its own interest, setting out their terms at the beginning, and had assured itself the co-chairmanship of the talks at the end stage of the negotiations five years from now.
In a briefing before leaving Washington, she brushed off concerns that in the interim Latin American nations will bypass the United States and form regional trade groups that will create economic ties with Europe and Asia and put American exporters at a disadvantage.
Ms. Barshefsky said those regional trade deals are not "an overly positive development" for the United States. But she said the Latin American nations would ultimately have to accommodate United States trade terms if they want unrestricted access to the immense American market for goods and services.

HEADLINE: A Rare Fish From Southeast Asia Is the Focus of a Smuggling Inquiry

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
Goldfish they aren't. Up to 36 inches long and with silvery bodies and colorful fins, the endangered dragon fish from Southeast Asia are prized for their exotic elegance -- not to mention their good luck, according to the Chinese.
So it was a bit more than curious when about 80 of them were found hidden in a warehouse atop a garment factory in Brooklyn and in shipping crates in Port Elizabeth, N.J. 
 But Federal investigators say this was no conservation effort. Rather, they announced yesterday, an employee of a Chinatown aquarium shop was selling the rare fish on the black market to collectors for up to $6,000 each.
On Wednesday, the authorities arrested the man, Zhi Lin Chen, saying they had uncovered a smuggling operation in which dozens of the fish were being imported in cartons labeled as containing goldfish and red-tail gouramies. The undercover investigation shed light on the little-known and lucrative trade in the dragon fish, otherwise known as the Asian arowana.
"It is probably the most expensive aquarium fish sold on the black market in the United States," said Dr. Dennis A. Thoney, general curator at the Aquarium for Wildlife Conservation in Brooklyn, who was asked by the investigating agency, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to identify the dragon fish.
Now, Dr. Thoney said, about 30 of the confiscated fish are in large storage tanks in the aquarium, on Coney Island, until they can find new homes in other public aquariums once the Government closes its case.
Mr. Chen, 36, of Brooklyn was charged with one count of trafficking in an endangered species. He was released on $100,000 bond in Federal District Court in Manhattan, and if convicted, he could receive up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, prosecutors said.
Mr. Chen could not be reached for comment yesterday. It was unclear from court records whether he owned the Chinatown shop, 38 Aquarium, at 371 Broome Street. At the brightly lighted shop, where large goldfish swam in a tank in the window, an employee said he was not available.
His lawyer, Philip L. Weinstein, refused to comment, except to acknowledge that the charge was unusual. "It's obviously not a case that comes along very frequently," he said.
This fish tale began last fall, when Fish and Wildlife Service agents began investigating the trafficking in Asian arowana, said an affidavit filed in court.
The valuable fish is nearly extinct in the wild, although it is bred widely in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia, said Dr. Carl J. Ferraris, an ichthyologist at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco whose specialty includes fish from Southeast Asia.
Dr. Ferraris said the arowana are bred for their color strains, and those with gold and red fins and scales bring the highest prices.
"They look very, very elegant," Dr. Ferraris said, "and they swim slowly and make a very stately presence."
During the Government investigation, agents found 59 arowana hidden inside 3 of 15 cartons that were shipped to Port Elizabeth on Oct. 8, the affidavit said.
The shipment was supposed to contain 472 goldfish and 72 red-tail gouramies from a fish farm in Malaysia and was addressed to 38 Aquarium.
Each of the arowanas was individually packed inside two plastic bags, while most of the goldfish and gouramies were dead or in poor condition, the affidavit said. It said another shipment, containing nine more of the rare fish, arrived the next day.
When undercover agents visited 38 Aquarium in November, they met with a man they now say was Mr. Chen. They asked him whether they could purchase Asian arowana and were given a price of $1,000 to $6,000 each, the affidavit said.
On April 2, they returned to the shop and were taken by Mr. Chen to a garment factory on 63d Street in Brooklyn.
There, they found numerous fish tanks and pools, containing about a dozen arowana, on the second floor, the affidavit said.
The document said the agents paid a total of $2,500 for two fish, one ruby red and one red-tailed gold.
The fish were later examined by Dr. Thoney, who confirmed that they were endangered.
Yesterday, at the factory where the fish were found, dozens of workers could be seen at sewing machines.
Asked whether there were any fish tanks in the building, a manager said: "This is a factory. There are no fish tanks."

HEADLINE: Racial Divide Found on Information Highway

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
At a time when the Clinton Administration is promoting the Internet as an engine of commerce and a tool of democracy, a new study has found that black Americans are far less likely to use the global computer network than are whites.
The sharp racial divide is especially evident among households below the median income. The study, to be published today in the journal Science, found that in households with annual incomes below $40,000, whites were six times as likely as blacks to have used the World Wide Web in the week before the household was called for the survey. 
 Lower-income white households were also twice as likely to own a home computer as were black households.
The study documents concerns that the recent exponential growth of the Internet might worsen the nation's existing social and economic gaps. Once a decidedly optional tool for entertainment or the occasional research foray, the Web is seen as fast becoming a crucial mechanism for communication, business and education. And while it is no surprise that Americans with lower incomes are less likely to own a computer, the study highlights for the first time what are the racial disparities in who has access to digital technology.
Internet access is hardly the most pressing issue facing the the disadvantaged. Its benefits in the classroom and elsewhere are still the subject of debate. And some black business leaders predict that racial parity on the Web is not far away.
But Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of management at the Vanderbilt University and an author of the study, said the schism reflected in the report could have troubling social consequences.
"If you want to be a fully functional member of society, you're going to have to have access to the Internet," Ms. Hoffman said. "Anybody poor is in trouble here. But if you're poor and black, you're really in trouble with respect to access."
Among blacks with incomes over $40,000, home computer ownership is roughly equal to that of whites of comparable incomes, the study found, and blacks were even more likely than whites to have access to the Internet at work. Among households of all income levels, 44.3 percent of whites own a home computer compared with 29 percent of blacks.
But because only about one-third of black households have incomes over $40,000, compared with about two-thirds of white households, the numbers reflect that computer access is in effect restricted to a narrow segment of blacks who are achieving at very high levels relative to whites.
For example, Ms. Hoffman and her co-author, Thomas P. Novak, found that blacks at higher income levels have had more education, are younger and are more likely to be working in computer-related jobs than whites with similar incomes.
Perhaps the most striking finding of the study is the racial disparity in home computer ownership among high school and college students.
The authors found that while 73 percent of white students had access to a computer at home, only 32 percent of black students had access to one. Even after adjusting for household income, the gap remained significant.
Moreover, white students without a computer at home were more than twice as likely as black students to have used the Web in the six-month period before they were surveyed and more than three times as likely to have used the Web in the week before they were surveyed. Ms. Hoffman said the report showed the importance of providing Internet access for blacks at places like libraries and community centers.
The study's results were based on data provided by Nielsen Media Research in a telephone survey conducted from December 1996 through January 1997. No information was provided on the margin of error in the survey.
The quantification of such stark incongruities comes at a time when President Clinton has repeatedly called for the wiring of the nation's schools and libraries and Vice President Al Gore has extolled the virtues of the Internet as a forum for public discourse. This week, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley released a report celebrating the impact of the information revolution on the Unites States economy.
But with Internet traffic doubling every 100 days, it appears that for the moment, at least, the majority of blacks are being left behind. At the time of the study, 25 million Americans had used the Web in the previous week, according to a recent survey by Nielsen Media Research. Less than 6 percent of those are black, although blacks account for 12 percent of the population.
"Income isn't the only impediment; there's something else going on," said Larry Irving, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce who oversees a $20 million project that finances technology demonstration projects in poor communities. "There is more content by, for and about the African-American community on the Net than there is in probably any other medium, but I don't think that's known. There's still a mythology that this isn't for us, that this is for scientists or upper income people or for geeks."
One problem, Mr. Irving said, is that schools and communities with high minority populations are much less likely than predominantly white districts to provide Internet access.
"We risk a further widening of the gap between the haves and the have-nots," said B. Keith Fulton, director of technology programs and policy for the National Urban League. As we move into the information age, you need more than reading, writing and arithmetic to participate in our society. You need information literacy, and if African-Americans don't have it, that's a serious problem."
But E. David Ellington, a founder of NetNoir, a leading Web site about black culture and issues, predicted that the inequalities would be ironed out in time.
"The vast majority of white people aren't on line yet either," Mr. Ellington said. "I'm not panicking that black folks are a little bit slower and haven't found this to be as relevant in their lives yet. I know from my own experience that black people are getting on line in droves."
Mr. Ellington said there was evidence that lower-income blacks are also beginning to find their way onto the Net.
Computer prices are dropping, and nearly twice as many blacks as whites said they planned to purchase a home computer in the next six months. Still, the survey results indicate that price is not the only barrier to black use of the Internet.
"One of the things it looks like we have here are some solid, up-to-date statistics that paint a more comprehensive picture than we've understood in the bast," said Andrew Blau, director of communications policy at the Benton Foundation, a Washington group that studies the social impact of technology. "It's not one that offers anybody easy relief, but having a better understanding of the nature of the problem is the first step toward devising a solution."

HEADLINE: U.N. REPORT SEES NO IRAQI PROGRESS ON WEAPONS ISSUE

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 16

 BODY:
A report by the United Nations chief arms inspector has concluded that Iraq is no closer to meeting the requirements for the lifting of sanctions than it was last fall, when Baghdad began to disrupt efforts to locate and destroy its remaining weapons of mass destruction.
The evidence in the report of Iraq's failure to provide any new information on its weapons, coupled with a new outburst of defiance today from Baghdad, raises once again the prospect of confrontation between Iraq and the United States, which has twice threatened military action against Iraq for impeding weapons inspections. 
 The report, by Richard Butler, chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, was turned over to Secretary General Kofi Annan on Wednesday and is likely to go to the Security Council by the weekend.
It follows six months of crisis that culminated when Mr. Annan made an emergency mission to Baghdad in February to restrain President Saddam Hussein from gutting the arms-inspection process. It apparently concludes that virtually no progress in verifying disarmament has been made. The Council will use the report, which has not been made public, as a basis for deciding by the end of this month whether to ease the tough economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions are reviewed every six months.
Today in Baghdad, the Iraqis unexpectedly stepped up pressure to have the sanctions lifted, a move many diplomats here did not expect in earnest until the next sanctions review in October.
"The time has come for lifting the embargo completely and comprehensively," said a statement by both the Revolutionary Command Council, Mr. Hussein's inner cabinet, and the President's Baath Party.
The statement, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, warned of a new crisis if the sanctions continued. It said that only "those of ill intentions" wanted the embargo to continue and would be held responsible for "the sin of the deaths of our people."
"Only they, if they oppose the lifting of the sanctions, will bear in addition to the burden of previous crises the burden of a new crisis and what harm may hit our people," the statement said.
For nearly six months, an Iraqi threat to stop cooperating with the United Nations and end all inspections in May has hovered over the commission. Baghdad's new warning revives fears that Iraq will break the promise it gave to Mr. Annan in February not to set any deadlines for a formal end to inspections. Asked about the Iraqi threat today, Mr. Annan said he had received no official information that Baghdad had changed its position on compliance.
As many diplomats expected, however, Iraq indicated in the statement that it intended to use the inspections of eight presidential properties in recent weeks to prove that those who thought that weapons or their components would be found there have been proved wrong.
United Nations inspectors have regarded those inspections as preliminary visits to make the point that no buildings will be considered off-limits and to survey the sites for possible future inspections.
In Washington, James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said in an interview that while it was important to have examined the previously off-limits presidential sites, they were not the core issue. The problem remains, he said, that Iraq has not adequately accounted for a range of weapons of mass destruction -- biological, chemical and nuclear -- and missile systems to deliver them.
"We need to bear in mind that even if the inspections of the palaces went reasonably well, that is not the issue," Mr. Rubin said. "The issue is whether Iraq will ever come clean about what they imported and what they destroyed, so that the U.N. can clarify the huge gap between what they think is in Iraq and what Iraq says it can prove has been destroyed.
"This issue is about positive compliance, about coming forward with information that will eliminate the ambiguities that involve huge amounts of material that could make huge amounts of biological and chemical weapons."
The Butler report follows technical surveys that left questions about Iraqi compliance in biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs. Diplomats and inspectors of presidential sites in Iraq say they found buildings stripped of all equipment and even furniture.
"It was clearly apparent that all sites had undergone extensive evacuation," a separate report by the leader of the arms inspectors who visited the eight sites said this week. "In all the sites outside of Baghdad, for example, there were no documents and no computers."
That report, by Charles Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of the disarmament commission, also said that in Baghdad the Republican Palace, Mr. Hussein's official residence, had been evacuated.
Inspectors and diplomats who visited the sites were almost literally boxed in by Government "minders" who at times outnumbered inspectors by six or seven to one, a participant in the inspections said. The group moved in huge convoys from place to place, with plenty of notice to Iraqi officials.
Some inspectors and diplomats were stunned by the opulence of the presidential palaces, which one visitor described as "beyond ostentation." Imported marble, Persian carpets and big-screen television sets defined some rooms that by one estimate must have cost millions of dollars to furnish.
Mr. Hussein, who over 20 years has lavished billions of dollars on projects of self-glorification, according to a former Iraqi minister now in exile in Europe, had meanwhile limited or prohibited imports of essential civilian goods until last year. He had used the lack of food and medicines as propaganda against the United States and others who have voted to maintain tight sanctions.
The Iraqi claims are gaining resonance in the West, where relief groups are forming to aid Iraqis and oppose the sanctions, blaming the embargo rather than Iraqi policies for the deaths and malnutrition in Iraq linked to the restrictions.
Iraq is also making headway in its campaign to get United Nations approval to expand its oil-production capacity under the plan that allows the Government to export oil to buy goods to reduce civilian shortages. In a report to the Security Council on Wednesday, the Secretary General recommended that Iraq be allowed to import $300 million in equipment to upgrade its oil wells and pipelines. Mr. Annan based his recommendation on a survey made by a team of independent oil experts working for the Dutch company Saybolt.
The Security Council recently raised the limit on Iraqi oil exports to $5.2 billion over six months, more than double the $2 billion in oil that Iraq had been able to sell until this year. Even factoring in fluctuating oil prices, the Saybolt experts concluded, Iraq would not be able to pump $5 billion worth of oil with its dilapidated equipment.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Change Inflation Index To Repair Bias

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
The Government is making changes in its chief inflation index to better reflect how Americans actually shop -- cutting back when something costs too much, switching from name brands, buying at outlets instead of department stores.
The switch, which will start with the price report for January, should shave roughly 0.2 percentage points off the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, which last year hit an 11-year low of 1.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said today. 
 And that will cost Americans about $1.2 billion a year, since the C.P.I. is used to adjust federal tax brackets for inflation and served serves as the base for annual increases in benefits for 80 million Social Security recipients, veterans, federal retirees and their survivors and food stamp and school lunch beneficiaries.
The change announced today is the latest in a series of adjustments announced over the past few years to make the C.P.I. more truly reflect the actual rise in the cost of living.
Next year, 61 percent of the CPI will be adjusted using a statistical technique called a "geometric mean estimator," the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. It is designed to account for what economists call "substitution bias."
That is the term for the common-sense observation that, faced with a price increase for California strawberries, for example, a shopper might purchase Florida strawberries instead, or blueberries, or buy one pint instead of two pints.
Currently, "the index does not reflect the fact that consumers can and do, to some degree, insulate themselves from the impact of higher prices by adjusting their spending to favor relatively lower-priced goods and services,"' the agency said.
However, large parts of the index will continue to be estimated under the currently used technique because it is difficult for consumers to adjust their purchase of doctors' and hospital fees, for instance, or housing, or cable television service.

HEADLINE: Black Mayors Protest Being the Focus of a Federal Housing Inquiry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
A decision by the Administration's chief housing investigator to examine Federal housing and economic development programs in three cities has touched off protests from black mayors around the country, some of whom have called the move racially motivated.
It has even provoked criticism from Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, whose efforts to weed out waste and corruption from Federal housing programs have not progressed fast enough to suit some members of Congress. 
 This year, the housing department's inspector general, an Administration appointee who reports directly to Congress, selected Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco as targets of the Urban Fraud Initiative, a $9.2 million investigation financed by Congress.
The effort was born out of concern among Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill that public housing officials in larger cities might be misspending money that the cities receive through Federal housing and economic development programs.
But in making the selection, the inspector general chose cities with Democratic black mayors and black housing chiefs, overlooking much larger cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia, which have larger housing departments and white mayors.
"We are furious about this," Emanuel Cleaver, the Mayor of Kansas City, Mo., and president of the bipartisan National Conference of Black Mayors, said today from the group's annual conference in New Orleans. "We don't believe it is accidental that the targets are Democrats, and I don't think we are naive enough to believe that skin color was not a factor."
Susan Gaffney, the inspector general, denied that politics or race played any role in her choice. But she declined to say more until "everything is pinned down."
Her action has not only struck a nerve with the Mayors of two of the targeted cities -- Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore and Marc Morial of New Orleans -- and senior housing department officials. It has also rattled the delicate relationship between the housing department and big cities trying to solve the complex problems of providing decent housing for low-income people.
The mayors and housing officials say that targeting cities with black mayors for an investigation that could take three years would stifle efforts to improve housing in those cities and would create a perception that blacks and other minorities are incapable of operating agencies free of waste and corruption.
"I have serious misgivings about this effort," Mr. Cuomo said. "We have 900 cities in this nation. Of most importance is whether the selection method is grounded in facts and data so that it cannot be attacked as arbitrary or political."
Or, as Ms. Gaffney's most vocal critic among the three mayors suggested, racial.
"Race as an issue is involved here," Mr. Schmoke said. "It may be secondary. But I just don't understand why the largest housing authorities in cities with white mayors get a pass."
The idea for an investigation grew out of a 1995 visit by Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California, to the Desire Homes in New Orleans, once regarded as one of the worst public housing projects in the country for neglect caused by mismanagement of money. Mr. Lewis, chairman of the housing subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, said he returned to Washington with a central question: How widespread are problems of fraud and corruption among public housing around the country?
Convinced that oversight policies under Mr. Cuomo were insufficient, Mr. Lewis's subcommittee set aside money for Ms. Gaffney to develop a program using auditors and Federal investigators to examine how big cities were spending Federal housing money and managing the programs.
"We wanted to make sure that taxpayer dollars designed to provide assistance to the poorest of the poor get to the people they are intended to help," Mr. Lewis said this week.
While conceding that his experience in New Orleans might have persuaded Ms. Gaffney to include that city, Mr. Lewis said neither he nor the subcommittee played any role in suggesting suggested Baltimore or San Francisco. He also defended Ms. Gaffney against accusations of racial motivation, saying, "There is little doubt in my mind she has no racial bones in her body."
He said, no final determination had been made as to which cities would be investigated, asserting that Ms. Gaffney's selections were "recommendations" and that the subcommittee might consider other cities.
While Mr. Cleaver said mayors at the conference were "smoking mad" about the issue, it was Mr. Schmoke who suggested that race might have been a factor in Ms. Gaffney's selections. In a letter this week to President Clinton, Mr. Schmoke said he was "particularly concerned that all three cities are led by African-American officials" and that the absence of apparent objective criteria for selection by Ms. Gaffney raised questions about Mr. Clinton's notion of "one America."
Beyond race as a motive, Mr. Schmoke, Mr. Morial and Mr. Cleaver expressed concerns that Ms. Gaffney's selections reflected the desire of Republican lawmakers to discredit Democratic housing programs, a charge Mr. Lewis strongly denied.
Mr. Morial said: "I'm outraged and offended. This smells, looks, walks, talks and acts like a blatant partisan effort. Willie, Kurt and I are very high-profile Mayors, and this is just another political fishing trip."
He was referring to Mayor Willie L. Brown of San Francisco, whose spokeswoman said he "welcomes an audit and anything that shows us ways to be more efficient."

BRITISH AIRWAYS ALTERS ORDERS FOR BOEING JETS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
British Airways P.L.C. will replace some of its orders for Boeing 747 jetliners with an order for 11 smaller aircraft worth $1.1 billion. The carrier said yesterday that it was adding five Boeing 777 jets and six 757's to its backlog of orders with the Seattle-based Boeing Company. The carrier said it planned to cancel an order for four of the 420-seat 747's. The changes will leave it with smaller planes, cutting its vulnerability to possible losses from the Asian economic crisis. British Airways will use the 280-seat 777's to replace eight larger McDonnell Douglas DC-10's. The new aircraft will enter service in 1999.
