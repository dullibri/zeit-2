HEADLINE: What Rick Santorum Wrought

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: The former senator has suspended his campaign, but he has left a deep, indelible impression on the Republican party and the electoral prospects of Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
Rick Santorum is a party crasher.
He has helped crash the Republican Party into a wall of public resentment. He suspended his campaign this week, but not before doing incalculable damage to the Republican brand and to the party's presumptive nominee, Mitt Romney.
For months, Santorum became the favored face of the most conservative faction of the party, the one person who gave them a viable chance at resisting Romney.
Santorum surged by dragging the debate so far to the right he couldn't see the middle with a telescope. The base dropped all pretense of moderation or even modernity and followed Santorum down a slippery path that led to a political abyss of social regression. The rest of America watched in stunned disbelief and was left to wonder: Was this the rise of some sort of "Judeo-Christian Shariah" movement, as the political comedian Dean Obeidallah pointed out on CNN.com? 
Instead of small government and fiscal conservatism, Santorum overwhelmingly promoted - and the public overwhelmingly focused on - his apparent obsession with sex and religion.
He argued that allowing women to use contraception to control when they got pregnant - one of the foremost decisions a woman can make about her body, her health and her and her family's economic security - was morally wrong.
Santorum opposed abortion even in cases of rape and incest, saying that women should be forced to carry those pregnancies to term and just accept the "horribly created gift" and "make the best of a bad situation."
Santorum not only adamantly opposed same-sex marriage, saying that he would support a constitutional amendment banning it, he went so far as to say that gay people who had legally married under the laws of their states would have their marriages rendered "invalid."
But he didn't stop there. Santorum expressed other outlandish, head-scratching views on many more issues that seemed to cement his position as a man out of step with a modern America.
He slammed the president's promotion of self-improvement through higher education as snobbery although he himself has bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees.
He suggested that women might be too emotional to serve on combat missions:
I do have concerns about women in frontline combat. I think that can be a very compromising situation where - where people naturally may do things that may not be in the interests of the mission because of other types of emotions that are involved.
And of course he denies climate change, calling climate science "political science," and remarking: "The dangers of carbon dioxide? Tell that to a plant, how dangerous carbon dioxide is."
I could go on, but it's all just too exhausting and depressing.
At the same time, Santorum continuously chipped away at Romney as a dishonest man and a weak conservative, as well as the worst candidate to run against President Obama.
The shift in the debate, which Santorum helped create, and his withering attacks on the front-runner forced Romney to move further right than was politically prudent.
As a result, Romney is now weaker than any post-primary party nominee in recent political history. According to an analysis of CNN polling data stretching back to 1996, compiled by Zeke Miller of BuzzFeed, Romney is the only presidential nominee to emerge from the primaries with a net negative favorability rating.
A Washington Post/ABC News poll last week also painted a troublesome portrait for Romney this fall. In a head-to-head matchup, Obama beat Romney by seven points. But some of the trends among specific constituencies were even more troubling. As the Post pointed out:
If a Romney-Obama matchup were held today, registered voters would divide 51 percent for the president to 44 percent for the former Massachusetts governor. That is similar to the edge Obama held in a Post-ABC poll in February; the two were more evenly matched in March. A wide gender gap underlies the current state of the race. Romney is up eight percentage points among male voters but trails by 19 among women.
Furthermore, the newspaper noted:
In addition to his big lead among women - Obama won that demographic by 13 points in 2008 - the president is moving to secure other key elements of his winning coalition. As he did four years ago, he has overwhelming support from African-Americans - 90 percent back his re-election effort - and he has a big lead among those ages 18 to 29.
Santorum has left a wake of destruction for Romney and the Republicans that many Americans won't soon forget. As we turn to the general election, if Romney can't count on electoral excitement, he must hope for electoral amnesia - and he has Santorum to thank for much of that.
(Exit Santorum, stage far, far right.)

HEADLINE: Romney's 'Empathy Gap'

BYLINE: JOHN SIDES


HIGHLIGHT: Polls show Mitt Romney well behind President Obama on the empathy scale, but that might not matter come November: voters' perceptions of candidates as people are not necessarily consequential to presidential election outcomes. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has an empathy problem. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll finds that 49 percent of respondents think that President Obama "better understands the economic problems people in this country are having." Only 37 percent believe that Mr. Romney does. This echoes a finding from my own research: in a January YouGov poll, 51 percent said they believed that the phrase "cares about people like me" describes President Obama well, while 41 percent said that about Mr. Romney. And in a later poll, the empathy gap widened, with only 33 percent saying they believed that Mr. Romney cared about people like them. Perceptions of empathy are also correlated with whether people currently favor Mr. Romney or Mr. Obama.
But is the empathy gap the central obstacle to Mr. Romney's campaign? Some commentators suggest that it is. On Tuesday, Chris Cilliza and Aaron Blake of The Washington Post said:
In our mind, tracking how the two candidates perform on this question between now and November is the single best measure (or at least one of them) of how the race will turn out. Romney must - - close the empathy gap to win this fall.
This view is predicated on a belief that Americans vote based on their perceptions of the candidates as people:
Presidential elections are rarely won and lost on policy. Voters instead tend to choose the person they most want to be president based on who they like. And that feeling is heavily influenced by which of the candidates they believe best understands their hopes and dreams.
Political science research presents a far more qualified view, however.
In reality, Republicans win all the time closing the empathy gap. This is because Democratic candidates are generally perceived as more empathetic -- more likely to "care about people like me" -- than Republican candidates, regardless of who wins. Ronald Reagan in 1984, George H. W. Bush in 1988 and George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 were all perceived as less empathetic than their Democratic opponents. Danny Hayes, a political scientist, has shown that political parties come to "own" certain traits just like they "own" certain issues, and empathy is a "Democratic" trait. (By contrast, Republicans own "leadership," at least in recent presidential races.) To be sure, Mr. Hayes shows that candidates benefit when voters come to view them favorably on trait dimensions that their party does own. This might give Mr. Romney an incentive to feel some voters' pain. Indeed, in February, Rick Santorum was, counter to stereotype, perceived as no less empathetic than Mr. Obama, so perhaps Mr. Romney could shift perceptions in his favor. But history shows that perceived empathy is no requirement for victory.
More generally, voters' perceptions of candidates as people are not necessarily consequential to presidential election outcomes. In part, this is because perceptions of candidates are more a consequence than a cause of voting. Rather than objectively evaluate the candidates' personal qualities, many if not most voters simply profess to like the candidate running in their preferred party and dislike the other party's candidate. For example, according to my analysis of YouGov polls, 83 percent of Democrats view Mr. Obama as empathetic, but only 14 percent see Mr. Romney this way. Republicans have the opposite view: 82 percent view Mr. Romney as empathetic, but only 25 percent see Mr. Obama this way. Like most perceptions of candidates, perceptions of their traits are rife with partisan bias.
Furthermore, perceptions of candidates' personalities aren't necessarily consequential because there are many potential trait dimensions on which voters could evaluate candidates -- honesty, leadership, empathy -- and across these different dimensions, voters' assessments may not help any one candidate. A candidate's empathy advantage could be offset by a leadership disadvantage. Thus, the total effect of these trait perceptions on the election's outcome would be small. This is exactly what the political scientist Larry Bartels found in a study of the presidential elections from 1980 to 2000. He wanted to know how these elections might have turned out if perceptions of the candidates' traits had differed. So he simulated hypothetical elections -- one in which the two candidates' advantages and disadvantages on every trait dimension were erased. In other words, he made all the gaps -- empathy and otherwise -- disappear. What happened?
Not much. Across the six elections, the average change in the election's outcome was 1.6 points. In no single election, except perhaps 2000's, was the shift large enough to affect the outcome. In many elections, the results ran explicitly counter to the prevailing narratives of the campaign. Mr. Bartels is worth quoting in full here:
Ronald Reagan, the "great communicator" and consummate actor, had a net advantage of only 1 percentage point over Jimmy Carter in 1980 and a net advantage of less than 1 percentage point over Walter Mondale in 1984. Michael Dukakis, widely regarded as cold and politically inept, appears here to have been the only Democratic presidential candidate to enjoy a more favorable personal image than his Republican opponent. And Bill Clinton, a "once-in-a-lifetime political performer," appears to have had the personal image of any presidential candidate in recent American history, at least as measured by the impact of trait assessments on electoral outcomes.
These small effects make sense if trait assessments are shaped by more fundamental political predispositions, like party identification, which themselves are the real movers of vote choice, and if a candidate's advantages on some dimensions are offset by disadvantages on others.
So does that mean that Mr. Romney can just give up and accept his empathy gap? Maybe, maybe not. But the answer will certainly depend on how he is perceived on other dimensions relative to Mr. Obama -- to say nothing of the many other factors that may prove more consequential in November. For example, voters' assessments of the economy have improved but are hardly positive. Mr. Romney may be able to argue successfully that economic conditions under President Obama haven't been good and aren't improving fast enough. And all the empathy in the world probably won't help Mr. Obama win if there's a double-dip recession.
In general, be wary of any claim that there is a single path to victory, particularly if that path involves a candidate's personality.

HEADLINE: Strong Earnings Help Shares Rise After 5 Days of Losses

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
An encouraging start to earnings season helped stocks rebound on Wednesday from five days of losses.
Companies linked with economic growth led the way higher as their recently beaten-down prices made them attractive to bargain hunters. The Standard & Poor's financial sector index rose 1.6 percent. Bank of America gained 3.8 percent, to $8.86. 
Alcoa, which reported a surprise first-quarter profit after the close of trading on Tuesday, rose 6.2 percent, to $9.90. Alcoa's results eased concerns about a weak earnings season.
''Expectations have been running very low, so the optimistic start to earnings season is a very welcome sign,'' said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago. ''That said, we're going to get a broad sense of how industries are faring this week, and we may trade sideways until we get that.''
Google, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are among those scheduled to report this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 89.46 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 12,805.39. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.12 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,368.71. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 25.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,016.46.
On Tuesday, the S.& P. 500 had its largest daily percentage decline in four months.
The economy grew moderately in late winter, although rising gas prices began to worry producers and consumers, the Federal Reserve said in its latest ''Beige Book'' summary of national activity. The assessment had little impact on equities.
The rally in stocks hurt demand for Treasury securities, as did remarks by a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, Benoit Coeure. He said on Wednesday that the bank still had the Securities Market Program in place, allowing it to buy the debt of euro zone nations should the need arise. Mr. Coeure's comments helped ease concern over Europe's debt crisis.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 99 22/32, and the yield rose to 2.04 percent from 1.99 percent late Tuesday.
Owens-Illinois rose 6.9 percent to $23.52, a day after it forecast a 35 percent increase in first-quarter profit.
In contrast, Nokia fell 15.7 percent to $4.24 after warning that its phone business would post losses in the first two quarters this year as it struggles to revamp its product line.

HEADLINE: Economy Continues to Recover Modestly, Fed Reports

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The nation's economy kept growing moderately in the late winter months, but rising energy prices were beginning to worry manufacturers and retailers across the country, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
''Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts indicated that the economy continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace from mid-February through late March,'' the central bank said in its latest beige book survey of economic activity.
Positive signs included stronger manufacturing activity, steady hiring and improved retail business in much of the country, the Fed said. But overlying that was a sense of concern that costlier energy and rising gasoline prices were a threat. 
''While the near-term outlook for household spending was encouraging, contacts in several districts expressed concerns that rising gas prices could limit discretionary spending in the months to come,'' it added.
The report, based on data collected before April 2, comes from business contacts in each of the 12 districts that have regional Federal Reserve banks.
Its description of growth at a ''modest to moderate pace'' was unchanged from the summary issued at the end of February. But coming after last week's government report showing only 120,000 jobs created in March, the fewest since October, it sounded a bit more upbeat about the job market.
''Hiring was steady or showed a modest increase across many districts,'' the Fed's beige book said. ''Difficulty finding qualified workers, especially for high-skilled positions, was frequently reported.''
Fed policy makers will use the information to assess the economy when they meet April 23 and 24 to consider whether to make adjustments in their monetary policy.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Dennis P. Lockhart, a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said Wednesday that he would be ''somewhat reticent to consider another round of quantitative easing'' at this time.
The beige book's caution about rising energy prices seemed to be borne out in separate Labor Department data showing that imported petroleum costs were still on the rise. March import prices climbed by the most in nearly a year on sharply higher petroleum costs, the department said. Imported petroleum prices alone increased 4.3 percent, the biggest gain since April 2011.
Those increases helped drive overall import prices up 1.3 percent for the biggest monthly gain since April 2011, the Labor Department said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected import prices to rise 0.8 percent last month. February's data was revised to show a 0.1 percent decline instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent increase.
The data underscores the size of the price shock Americans feel when they refuel their cars.
There are ample signs that higher gasoline prices are weighing on the nation's economy, still burdened by high unemployment and a soft housing sector after the 2007-9 recession.
Applications for home mortgages fell last week despite a drop in the average interest rate for 30-year mortgages, the Mortgage Bankers Association said in a separate report on Wednesday.
The Labor Department report showed that export prices rose 0.8 percent last month, above analysts' expectations for a 0.4 percent gain. Export prices increased 0.4 percent in February.
The Labor Department is scheduled to release data on Thursday that is expected to show tame price pressures at a wholesale level. Economists estimate that producer prices, excluding those from the volatile food and energy sector, rose 0.2 percent in March.

HEADLINE: Treasury Faulted in Effort to Relieve Homeowners

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A fund to support homeowners in the communities hit hardest by the collapse of the housing bubble has disbursed just 3 percent of its budget and aided only 30,640 homeowners in the two years since its creation, according to a report released on Thursday by a federal watchdog office.
The Hardest Hit Fund, which was created in the spring of 2010, grants money to state housing finance agencies for efforts to help families that are facing foreclosure. It has ''experienced significant delay'' because of ''a lack of comprehensive planning'' by the Treasury Department and limited participation by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the large mortgage servicers, said the report by the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
''TARP wasn't supposed to be just a bank bailout,'' said Christy L. Romero, the special inspector general for TARP, in an interview. ''It was specifically designed with the goal of helping homeowners, and our concern is that that goal may not be met.''
As of the end of 2011, the Hardest Hit Fund had spent $217.4 million out of its $7.6 billion budget, the report found. The program is intended to reach homeowners who are unemployed, or living in areas with high unemployment rates or steeply falling home values.
The report is just the latest to criticize the Obama administration's efforts to relieve homeowners battered by the nationwide drop in housing prices and the broader recession. The office of the special inspector general has repeatedly criticized Treasury's management of the Home Affordable Modification Program, Washington's main initiative to prevent foreclosures.
The Treasury Department had estimated that the program would reach three million to four million homeowners. It has aided fewer than a million, though the program has been completing more and more permanent modifications recently.
The report on the Hardest Hit Fund was requested by Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
It cited a lack of planning and leadership by the Treasury Department as the reason so little money has been spent. The special inspector general said that Treasury had not set clear measures for the number of homeowners to be reached, and when.
The report also argued that the federal government had not used its significant influence over large mortgage servicers and Fannie and Freddie to induce them to participate in the state-devised and state-managed initiatives.
The Hardest Hit Fund ''is a TARP Program, and Treasury is the steward over TARP,'' the report says.
The Treasury Department sought to rebut the criticism of its management of the Hardest Hit Fund, saying that the states' programs had taken considerable time to set up and that the programs had started reaching more homeowners in recent months.
''This report misses the mark by not acknowledging the hard work of participating states and the innovative ways they are preventing foreclosures in their local communities,'' Timothy G. Massad, the assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement.
''The Hardest Hit Fund is helping states address some of the most difficult problems caused by the housing crisis in ways that suit local conditions and have already kept tens of thousands of families in their homes,'' Mr. Massad added.
The Hardest Hit Fund allocates money to states for programs to help homeowners. To receive money, states were to meet certain conditions: a 20 percent decline in house prices, a high proportion of the state population living in counties with an unemployment rate above 12 percent or an unemployment rate above the national average.
Eighteen states, including California, Nevada and Florida, as well as the District of Columbia received money and built programs to help local homeowners. Treasury signed off on programs that reduced the mortgage principal of underwater homeowners; reduced or paid off second liens, like home equity lines of credit; aided unemployed homeowners; and helped people losing their homes.
But Fannie and Freddie, which back many American mortgages, directed servicers to participate in a small subset of programs, like those providing mortgage assistance for the unemployed.
And states lacked a way to force the large mortgage servicers to engage with the programs. An official for Florida's home finance agency told the special inspector general, ''The $1 billion has been a nice carrot to use for servicers in Florida, but there is no stick with the carrot to force servicers to participate.''
Thus, many of the state initiatives financed by the Hardest Hit Fund have failed to reach significant numbers of homeowners thus far. In New Jersey, for instance, just 54 households had benefited as of the end of 2011. In California, where 48,422 houses received a foreclosure notice in February alone, the program has aided just 4,357 homeowners.
Programs financed by the Hardest Hit Fund have been ramping up recently in some states. In Michigan, for instance, the number of participants climbed 40 percent during the fourth quarter of 2011, and the amount of money disbursed increased by half. Nearly 97 percent of the early beneficiaries continued to own their homes a year after receiving assistance.
The Treasury Department said that the states were better tailoring the programs for their homeowners' needs and reaching more of them.
''The states can change their programs,'' said Ms. Romero, the special inspector general. ''So it's not too late for the states to figure out how to use these funds. That's the dynamic nature of the program, and that's what needs to happen.''

HEADLINE: Death Comes to the Vacant Lots of North Tulsa

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
TULSA, Okla. -- In the minutes after a shooting spree left three of their neighbors dead and two others wounded, several residents told the police everything they had seen and heard. But only several. Abandoned properties hold no witnesses.
In the largely black neighborhoods of north Tulsa where the shootings took place, dozens of homes and businesses surrounding the four locations of the attacks are empty. 
There are houses with plywood covering the windows on the street where Bobby Clark, 54, was shot and killed nearly two hours past midnight on Good Friday. On the streets to the south of where another victim, Dannaer Fields, 49, was found dead, there are vacant houses that have burned and partly collapsed in arson fires. And on Peoria Avenue to the north there is the largely abandoned 8.3-acre McLain Village shopping center, a shell of what it was when built in 1962.
At murder scenes in other cities, people often gather for candlelight vigils. At the intersection where Mr. Clark was shot, there was another sort of gathering on Tuesday: a neighbor, Jimmy Landrum, brought out his lawn-care equipment to cut the overgrown grass at a curbside memorial, because nobody lives at the corner house where people have been leaving stuffed animals.
The killings last Friday -- attacks that neighbors and community leaders believe were racially motivated -- have shocked people around the country. But for many residents in the struggling neighborhoods where the shootings unfolded, nothing is shocking. Residents said they heard gunshots at night and police helicopters overhead.
''I'm not a bit surprised at any of the violence,'' said Melissa Wilcox, 52, one of a small number of white residents in the area, who lives across the street from a vacant house that was set ablaze and destroyed in two separate arson fires last month. ''Nothing surprises me here. A good day surprises me here.''
The authorities said the two men arrested in the shootings -- Jacob C. England, 19, and Alvin L. Watts, 32 -- drove through a three-square-mile area of north Tulsa in a white pickup truck from roughly 1 a.m. to 2 a.m., randomly shooting pedestrians and residents they stopped to ask for directions. Their five victims were black. Mr. Watts is white, and Mr. England is an American Indian who has also described himself as white. Though the men have confessed to the shootings, according to a police spokesman and court documents, police officials and prosecutors said that they had not yet established a motive and that it was too early to say if the shootings were racially motivated.
The attacks occurred the day after the two-year anniversary of the death of Mr. England's father, Carl. The elder Mr. England was shot and killed on April 5, 2010, at a public housing apartment complex near the scene of the shootings, and the man who was a person of interest in the case, Pernell Jefferson, is black. The Tulsa County District Attorney's Office declined to file homicide charges against Mr. Jefferson, ruling that he was justified in using deadly force in self-defense under Oklahoma law.
Several hours before the first shooting, Mr. England used a racial epithet to describe Mr. Jefferson on his Facebook page, and appeared to be having difficulty coping with his father's death and the suicide of his fiancee, Sheran Hart Wilde. ''It's hard not to go off,'' he wrote.
In the neighborhoods where the shootings occurred, about six miles from downtown Tulsa, the streets twist and turn with both a rural and an urban feel. It is not unusual to see a man working under a car or a man riding a horse. Retirees work on the front yards of the homes where they have lived for decades.
But much of the area has been hard hit by crime, drugs, poverty, unemployment and commercial abandonment. The median income is $25,000 to $30,000, and there are nearly 1,000 abandoned homes and businesses in the two City Council districts that make up north Tulsa, city officials estimate. Though there are signs that the area has started making a turn-around -- with new construction under way -- many of the streets seem at once built up and burnt down, with well-maintained churches and schools, and abandoned gas stations and burned homes that languish.
Fires have a tragic legacy here: In 1921, north Tulsa was the site of race riots, in which a mob of white Tulsans burned and destroyed a black neighborhood and killed residents. The death toll was estimated in a state report at 100 to 300. The neighborhood where the riot occurred, Greenwood, is a few miles from the site of the shootings.
''In the days of old, before the 1921 race riots, north Tulsa was a flourishing community,'' said Jack Henderson, a city councilman who represents the district where all the victims were shot. ''It was called the black Wall Street. We had multimillionaires, black millionaires that would actually have to loan money to some of the rich oil people.
''We went from that to the race riot and a lot of the community was lost. We've come a real long way from the 1921 race riot, but the city has been a city of some racial divide for a long time. Nothing like it was back in 1921, but there has always been some level of tension, racial tension.''
Black residents said that before Mr. England and Mr. Watts were arrested, there was widespread fear and anger and the potential of vigilante justice. ''One guy, I heard him say he went and purchased a gun, because he was going to make sure that no white truck was going to pull up on him,'' Mr. Landrum said.
Mr. England may not have known the shooting victims, but he was familiar with the neighborhoods he and Mr. Watts drove through that night. Tulsa, a city of 392,000, can have the feel of a small town, and the black areas of north Tulsa, where many of the city's 62,000 African-Americans live, can feel even smaller still.
White and black residents said that they knew Mr. England, his father or other relatives, and that Mr. England and his family had ties to the area and to the complex where his father was killed, the Comanche Park Apartments.
''Jake was a good kid,'' said Anthony Thompson, 46, who is black and who said he knew Mr. England years ago. ''That's why I couldn't understand it. I think he was influenced, because he was raised up among blacks.''

HEADLINE: Philippines and China In a Standoff at Sea

BYLINE: By FLOYD WHALEY; Bree Feng contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
MANILA -- Philippine and Chinese officials on Wednesday called for a diplomatic solution to a naval standoff in the South China Sea, while insisting that they would defend their territorial claims in the region.
''If the Philippines is challenged, we are prepared to secure our sovereignty,'' Albert F. del Rosario, the Philippine foreign secretary, said at a news conference as a Philippine frigate and two Chinese ships positioned themselves near disputed islands in the South China Sea. The Chinese Embassy in Manila issued a statement reaffirming its claim to sovereignty over the islands and said that the Philippine Navy was harassing its fishing vessels in the area.
The standoff comes at a time of increasing assertiveness by China in its claims to the South China Sea waters around the Philippines. The dispute intensified after the Philippines announced in February that it would invite foreign energy companies to explore for oil and gas in the waters west of Palawan Province, and adjacent to the Spratly Islands. 
The Philippines, an ally of the United States, has become a particular target of China's anger in the South China Sea disputes. Some analysts speculate that Beijing's harsher tone could be a tit-for-tat after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stood on the deck of an American warship last November in Manila Bay and reaffirmed the military alliance between the Philippines and the United States.
Mrs. Clinton referred to an area of the South China Sea as the West Philippine Sea -- a name used by the Philippines but not other nations -- a point that irritated the Chinese.
In a demonstration of how exploration of oil and gas is a crucial aspect of the South China Sea territorial disputes, American and Philippine naval exercises this month will include one that involves retaking a hijacked oil rig, according to the Philippine military. The current naval standoff began Sunday when Philippine surveillance aircraft spotted eight Chinese fishing boats near Scarborough Shoal, an outcropping of rocks 124 nautical miles west of Luzon Island in the Philippines. The shoal, which is called Panatag in the Philippines and Huangyan in China, is claimed by both countries.
The Philippine Navy sent the Gregorio del Pilar, a 378-foot patrol frigate that was formerly an American Coast Guard cutter. The ship arrived early Tuesday and found the boats anchored inside the horseshoe-shaped shoal, according to Vice Adm. Alexander P. Pama.
''At about 7:20 in the morning, the boarding team started to conduct a board, search and seizure on the first Chinese fishing vessel and found large amounts of corals, sizable quantities of giant clams and live sharks in its compartments,'' Admiral Pama told reporters on Wednesday, adding that the other Chinese boats carried similar sea resources that he said were illegal to harvest.
On Tuesday afternoon, two Chinese surveillance ships, identified by Philippine officials as Zhonggou Haijian 75 and Zhonggou Haijian 84, took positions at the mouth of the lagoon within the shoal, blocking the Philippine Navy vessel's access to the fishing boats inside.
One of the Chinese ships radioed the Philippine ship and said that the area was Chinese territory and that the Philippine Navy should withdraw. The Philippine captain responded that the shoal was his country's territory. As of late Wednesday, the vessels remained in position.
In its statement, the Chinese Embassy said the fishing boats were in the lagoon seeking shelter from a storm when ''a Philippine Naval gunboat blocked the entrance of the lagoon, and sent 12 Philippine soldiers, 6 of which armed, into the lagoon and harassed the Chinese fishermen.''
It went on to say that the embassy had contacted the Philippine government and ''reiterated China's sovereignty over Huangyan Island, urged the Philippine side to stop immediately their illegal activities and leave this area.''
Scarborough Shoal, which sits amid rich fishing grounds, has been a point of contention for more than a decade between China and the Philippines. Fishermen from both countries have had previous confrontations with opposing naval vessels.
The Philippines claims the area as part of its 200-mile exclusive economic zone, while China says that the area was mapped as Chinese territory as early as the 13th century. The shoal lies north of the Spratly Islands, which are also claimed by China, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations.
In Beijing last week, a Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated that China had ''indisputable sovereignty'' over the Spratly Islands and their adjacent waters, and ''resolutely'' opposed actions by other countries that ''damage China's sovereignty.''
In an article published online this week, a Chinese Army officer accused the Philippines of trying to use American power to intimidate China. The officer, Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan, warned that China might reconsider its planned $50 billion investments in the Philippines.
Last week, at a summit meeting of Southeast Asian leaders, China strongly opposed an effort by the Philippines and Vietnam to draft a regional code of conduct to resolve the territorial disagreements.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a naval standoff between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea described incorrectly the location of the Philippine island of Luzon and Scarborough Shoal, which is claimed by both countries and is near where Philippine surveillance aircraft spotted eight Chinese fishing boats on Sunday, leading to the standoff. The shoal is 124 nautical miles west of Luzon, not east.

HEADLINE: Report Says a Crop Subsidy Cap Could Save Billions

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The federal government could save about $1 billion a year by reducing the subsidies it pays to large farmers to cover much of the cost of their crop insurance, according to a report by Congressional auditors due to be released on Thursday.
The report raised the prospect of the government's capping the amount that farmers receive at $40,000 a year, much as the government caps payments in other farm programs. Any move to limit the subsidy, however, is likely to be opposed by rural lawmakers, who say the program provides a safety net for agriculture. 
The report, by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, was requested by Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, as part of his efforts to cut government spending.
Under the federal crop insurance program, farmers can buy insurance policies that cover poor yields, declines in prices or both. The insurance is obtained through private companies, but the federal government pays about 62 percent of the premiums, plus administrative expenses.
The crop insurance subsidy, according to the G.A.O. report, ballooned to $7.3 billion last year from $951 million in 2000, or about $1.2 billion adjusted for inflation. A Congressional Budget Office study cited in the report estimates that the premium subsidy will cost $39 billion from 2012 to 2016, about $7.8 billion a year.
Unlike other farm programs that have income or payment limits, crop insurance payments have no such restrictions, so farmers can get millions in subsidies regardless of their income. The G.A.O. said a cap last year would have affected about 4 percent of farmers in the program, who accounted for about a third of the premium subsidies and were mostly associated with large farms.
''High premium subsidies have hurt small and beginning farmers because the subsidies themselves have distorted the market,'' Mr. Coburn said. ''For instance, high subsidies have artificially increased the value of land and have created other barriers to entry and expansion.''
Craig Cox, vice president for agriculture and natural resources at the Environmental Working Group, a research group in Washington, said the report's findings were startling.
''This has huge implications for the farm bill now under consideration,'' Mr. Cox said about a major agriculture policy measure taking shape. He said the government had moved ''from a system of direct payments to farmers where there are income restrictions and payment caps to a world without any restrictions on how much you can get in these insurance subsidies.''
''This means more subsidies going to large farmers and more cost to the taxpayers,'' he added.
Agriculture interests say they oppose any changes to the crop insurance program.
''We think it works just fine,'' said Steve Wellman, president of the American Soybean Association. ''We are certainly willing to do our fair share to help reduce spending, and we are doing that in other areas, like eliminating direct payments. But it doesn't make sense to make changes to a program that has been successful and critical to farming operations.''
Farm programs, including crop insurance, have come under scrutiny with increasing pressure to reduce the federal deficit and with farm income at record levels. The Agriculture Department estimates that net farm income was a record $101 billion last year, according to the G.A.O report. In addition, the report said, the department's data shows that farmers' top five years in income over the past three decades have occurred since 2004.
President Obama and many Republicans, including Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who leads the Budget Committee, have proposed changes in the crop insurance program, including limiting payments or lowering the amounts that the government covers in premiums.
But lawmakers on the House and Senate Agriculture Committees are opposed to any adjustments in the crop insurance program. The chairwoman of the Senate committee, Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, whose panel is working on the 2012 farm bill, said she disagreed with proposals to change crop insurance. The House committee chairman, Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, was more direct in his opposition. Mr. Lucas said that any crop insurance cuts would ''threaten the integrity of the program itself.''

HEADLINE: Wealthy Group Seeks to Reform Election Giving

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- An unusual and well-heeled coalition, trying to tap public anger over the flood of money into politics, is pushing to enact a public financing system for elections in New York State.
The backers include media moguls -- Barry Diller and Chris Hughes, a founder of Facebook -- as well as investment bankers, unions, MoveOn.org, the restaurateur Danny Meyer and the philanthropist David Rockefeller Sr.
They say New York, which they call a symbol of institutionalized corruption, could become a national model for the effort to free elections from the grip of big money. The campaign will start next week with mailings to the constituents of four state senators. 
For years, government watchdog groups have pressed unsuccessfully for public financing of elections. Leaders of the coalition say the Citizens United ruling and the role of ''super PACs'' in the presidential race have made campaign finance a more broadly understood and urgent issue.
''Right now people are feeling a little bit helpless about super PACs and how to get money out of the system at the federal level,'' said Sean Eldridge, Mr. Hughes's fiance, who runs an investment fund and is a leader of the effort. ''An opportunity to pass campaign finance reform in New York is an opportunity for people to do something -- to actually be able to pass a bill, to make progress.''
The coalition, called New York Leadership for Accountable Government, is notable for its diversity and its well-known names: its roster includes Jonathan Soros, the son of the philanthropist George Soros; Jerome Kohlberg, a co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company; and several former elected officials, including Mayor Edward I. Koch.
The group is also supported by the Committee for Economic Development, a nonpartisan public-policy group backed by executives from dozens of Fortune 500 companies. The committee is holding meetings in New York this month to encourage business leaders to join the coalition.
Many of the executives involved have given generously to candidates in the past.
''With this effort, you have people who are big donors, who are involved with the campaign system, saying: 'You know what, this doesn't make sense. This isn't what democracy is supposed to be about,' '' said David L. Calone, a venture capitalist based on Long Island who has raised money for Democratic candidates.
New York's campaign finance system is among the least restrictive in the nation, with individuals permitted to give up to $60,800 to candidates running for statewide office. The median cap among states that limit contributions is $5,000 for candidates for governor, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The proposal the coalition is pushing would be modeled after the system that New York City adopted in 1988: in return for abiding by limits on their spending, city candidates can receive $6 in public funds for each of the first $175 city residents donate.
The group sees the successful campaign to pass same-sex marriage in New York as a blueprint for its effort. Like same-sex marriage, public financing has been embraced in the past by the Democratic-led State Assembly, but blocked by the Republican State Senate.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's response will be pivotal: Mr. Cuomo ran for governor on a platform that included enacting public financing, and in his State of the State address in January, he promised to push for it in the legislative session this year. But he has not pressed the issue since then, and he has raised prodigious amounts of money under the existing rules.
Asked at a news conference last month if he still planned to pursue public financing, Mr. Cuomo responded, ''Yes.'' He did not elaborate, and a spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday.
Coalition leaders said they were prepared to spend more than $1 million promoting public financing, but they acknowledged that it could take beyond this legislative session to persuade lawmakers to embrace their proposal.
The issue could be sensitive for Mr. Cuomo. Some liberal leaders and government reform groups are unhappy that Mr. Cuomo broke his promise to veto redistricting maps drawn by incumbent lawmakers, and they are hoping that the governor will make campaign finance his next big cause.
National groups are also getting involved. MoveOn.org, for instance, is planning to e-mail its members next week to rally them in support of the cause.
''Our New York members will be watching to see if Governor Cuomo shows leadership on the issue,'' said Justin Ruben, MoveOn's executive director.
The campaign will get under way as lawmakers return from a two-week recess next Tuesday.
At the outset, the Public Campaign Action Fund, a group based in Washington that supports public financing, is paying for direct mail advertising to target four Republican senators who some advocates believe could be receptive to the proposal: Martin J. Golden of Brooklyn, Gregory R. Ball of Putnam County, Roy J. McDonald of Saratoga County and Mark J. Grisanti of Buffalo. Voters in each senator's district will soon receive a mailer featuring a photograph of the State Capitol awash in $100 bills and declaring, ''It's time Albany put voters before big-monied corporate lobbyists.''
Asked about the irony of wealthy donors pledging money to an effort to get big money out of elections, Mr. Eldridge responded: ''Creating legislative reform is expensive, particularly on an issue like this where the resistance we'd get from special interest groups would be tremendous.'' Educating the public and organizing voters, he said, ''requires resources, and that requires money, and there's no shame in that.''
Advocates of public financing say the system frees politicians to spend more time focusing on the issues and interacting with constituents, rather than dialing for contributions from special interests. They also believe it encourages competition for electoral offices.
''It's a double victory,'' said Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., chief counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. ''You have lower amounts of money that can be given, and No. 2, ordinary people become engaged in political campaigns and candidates change their approach to campaigning.''
Given the state's shaky finances, however, anything that requires new spending of taxpayer dollars also tends to draw scrutiny. ''The taxpayers have enough on their backs as it is,'' said Michael R. Long, chairman of the state's Conservative Party.
''If Mike Long wants to run for office, why should the taxpayer have to pay for my campaign?'' Mr. Long asked. ''Let the taxpayers donate their own personal money to candidates they want to donate to.''

8 P.M. (TCM) STARRING LIZA MINNELLI Turner Classic Movies pays tribute to Ms. Minnelli with four films, starting with ''Arthur'' (1981), in which she plays a screwball waitress from Queens pursued by a perpetually drunk Manhattan millionaire (Dudley Moore, above with Ms. Minnelli) who must marry a debutante or lose his inheritance. In the documentary ''Private Screenings: Liza Minnelli,'' at 10, she speaks with Robert Osborne about growing up in Hollywood. The movie lineup resumes at 11 with Martin Scorsese's ''New York, New York'' (1977), in which she's a nightclub singer, with Robert De Niro as a saxophonist. And in Alan J. Pakula's ''Sterile Cuckoo'' (1969), at 2 a.m., she and Wendell Burton play misfit, mismatched college students in love; the film earned Ms. Minnelli the first of her two Oscar nominations. At 4 she also appears in the final scene of ''In the Good Old Summertime'' (1949) with her mother, Judy Garland. 
3:30 P.M. (Ovation) THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE (2002) Thandie Newton steps into the Audrey Hepburn role as a new wife who returns to her Paris apartment to break it off with her art-dealing husband, Charlie, only to find the place ransacked, in this remake from Jonathan Demme of the 1963 comic thriller ''Charade.'' And soon she discovers that no one, and nothing, is as is seems. Mark Wahlberg, in the role originated by Cary Grant, portrays the charming stranger eager to be of assistance; Tim Robbins is the man at the United States Embassy she turns to for help. The sensual, butter-voiced Ms. Newton is ''so good that when she's on screen, the movie works -- or at least you think it does,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''It's a spot-specific case of alchemy.'' The film will be rebroadcast at 5:45.
5:15 P.M. (Sundance) THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN (2010) An unemployed young woman (Emilie Dequenne) who lives with her distant mother (Catherine Deneuve, below right with Ms. Dequenne) in the Paris suburbs, pretends to be the victim of an anti-Semitic attack after a relationship with a thuggish athlete (Nicolas Duvauchelle) sours. This drama from Andre Techine was based on a real-life case involving Marie-Leonie Leblanc, a 23-year-old who claimed in 2004 that she had been the victim of an anti-Semitic attack by six men of North African and African origin on a train outside Paris. The French president at the time, Jacques Chirac, condemned the attack, and the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, urged French Jews to leave for Israel to ''escape the wildest anti-Semitism.'' Then the woman admitted that she had lied. Manohla Dargis, reviewing the film in The Times, wrote: ''Mr. Techine isn't pretending that he understands what people do. But by showing us what they do, the flowers they pick and the people they love, he makes us notice them more intently.''
7 P.M. (MSG) STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS The Ottawa Senators face the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Pregame coverage begins at 6.
8 P.M. (NBC) COMMUNITY Britta (Gillian Jacobs, below) asks the study group for help in staying away from her old flame Blade (Kirk Fox), who has returned to town with a carnival. In ''30 Rock,'' at 8:30, Liz (Tina Fey) encourages Jack (Alec Baldwin) to share his feelings with his hospitalized mother (Elaine Stritch). In ''The Office,'' at 9, Robert California (James Spader) makes the Scranton, Pa., employees host a welcome party for Nellie (Catherine Tate), and the party planners try to sabotage it. And in ''Up All Night,'' at 9:30, Reagan (Christina Applegate) loses her engagement ring, prompting Chris (Will Arnett) to propose in a way he wasn't able to before.
10 P.M. (Discovery) THE RESURRECTION TOMB MYSTERY The filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici and James D. Tabor, a professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, examine inscriptions on relics found in the Patio Tomb in Jerusalem, which sits 200 feet from what is known as the Jesus Family Tomb. Among the inscriptions is a depiction of Jonah being spit out by a whale. This documentary is based on the men's new book, ''The Jesus Discovery.''

HEADLINE: The Wages of Ideology

 BODY:
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is struggling to fight off a determined effort to replace him in an extraordinary recall election scheduled for June 5. The original reason more than 900,000 Wisconsinites signed petitions to get him out of office was his signature on a bill that stripped most public employees of their collective bargaining rights. But, every few weeks, Mr. Walker provides new grounds for becoming the third American governor to be removed by his own electorate.
The most recent came last week, when he signed the repeal of a 2009 law allowing the victims of wage discrimination to pursue damages in state court, which is generally easier than filing a federal complaint. The principal reason for the original law was to narrow a significant gap in compensation between men and women. At the time the law was passed, women earned an average of 75 cents for every $1 men earned; by 2010, after the law was passed, the average for women had edged up to about 78 cents. 
By closing off this important avenue to state courts to women, Mr. Walker was acceding to the lobbying demands of business groups, including hotel and restaurant trade groups that employ large numbers of women in low-paying jobs and do not wish their wage scale to be challenged in court. (He called it a ''gravy train'' for trial lawyers.) That's the kind of thing he's been doing since he took office in 2011, and it's an important reason why he was warmly embraced during the Wisconsin presidential primary last month by Mitt Romney, who won that state.
''I applaud your governor,'' said Mr. Romney, who also called him a ''hero'' and a ''man of courage.'' Mr. Romney's campaign has its own problems with issues of pay equity. On Wednesday morning, his staff could not answer a simple question about whether Mr. Romney supports the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first federal law signed by President Obama, in 2009, which makes it easier for women to sue for pay discrimination.
A few hours later, the Romney campaign put out a bland statement saying he supports pay equity and ''is not looking to change current law.'' But many elements of the Republican Party are eagerly looking to change the law. If Mr. Romney is elected and a Republican-led Congress presents him with a bill overturning the Ledbetter act, would he sign it, following the path of his hero, Mr. Walker? That question went unanswered, just as the campaign never said whether it supported Mr. Walker's repeal.
The Romney campaign sent out several statements on Wednesday from Republican women making the misleading claim that women had been disproportionately hurt by Mr. Obama's economic policies. That concern lacks credibility, considering that several of those women voted against the Ledbetter act, including Representatives Mary Bono Mack and Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
Mr. Romney has also said he wants to ''get rid of'' Planned Parenthood, just as Mr. Walker ended state financing for nine Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin last year. Mr. Romney's disregard for the welfare and leading concerns of women is costing the presumptive Republican nominee support among women.
He may try to roll back these positions toward the center for the general election this fall, but voters should be skeptical. As Mr. Walker's actions show, they are at the core of Republican ideology.

HEADLINE: Fed May Extend Support Past 2014, Official Says

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said Wednesday that the lackluster trajectory of the economic recovery might require the Fed to continue its efforts to bolster growth even beyond the end of 2014.
In a speech in Manhattan, Ms. Yellen offered a rejoinder to recent remarks by other Fed officials and investors warning that the Fed would need to raise interest rates well before the end of 2014 to prevent an increase in the rate of inflation. 
She indicated that the Fed's leadership, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, remained firmly committed to the central bank's efforts to suppress interest rates and reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers.
''I anticipate that the U.S. economy will continue to recover only gradually and that labor market slack will remain substantial for a number of years to come,'' Ms. Yellen said, according to an advance copy of her prepared remarks.
She said that by some measures the Fed was not doing enough.
''In effect there has been a significant shortfall in the overall amount of monetary policy stimulus since early 2009'' relative to those standards, she said in the speech, delivered to the Money Marketeers club of New York University.
She did not call for a new round of stimulus, however, arguing instead that the shortfall might provide justification for extending current efforts.
The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and it has sought to further reduce long-term interest rates through the purchase of more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. It said last fall that it planned to maintain both of those policies until at least late 2014.
As the economy has shown signs of faster growth in recent months, some have warned that the Fed was in danger of pushing growth past a sustainable level.
Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said this week that the Fed might need to begin raising rates by the end of this year.
But Mr. Kocherlakota and his allies form a distinct minority on the Fed's policy-making board, the Federal Open Market Committee. Ms. Yellen, by contrast, hews much closer to the views of Mr. Bernanke, who leads the majority.
Her speech offered an unusually transparent account of how she is balancing various factors in making her decisions about monetary policy.
She said that one economic model used by the Fed suggested that interest rates should be held near zero until late 2015. While others have suggested an earlier increase might be appropriate, she said there still might be reasons to wait, including the insufficiency of current policy and the risk that the economic recovery might falter.
Ms. Yellen was careful to note that the Fed's decisions would depend on actual economic conditions. If growth were faster than expected, it might become necessary to retreat; if slower, it might become necessary for the Fed to do more.
Her frank account is part of the Fed's commitment to increased transparency, but it also reflects the central bank's current dependence on effective communication. The longer the Fed can convince investors that it will maintain its current policies, the longer interest rates will rest at their current, historically low levels.
The Fed could convince investors, as it has until now, by continually expanding its stimulus campaign.
But Ms. Yellen said nothing about doing more, reflecting the reality that the Fed was unlikely to announce new measures unless the economy faltered. And in the absence of new measures, the Fed's effectiveness rests on the quality of its oratory.

HEADLINE: Santorum Out, Evangelicals Edge Closer to Romney, but Warily

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Rick Santorum had been the last best hope of Christian conservatives who opposed Mitt Romney, derided by many as a ''Massachusetts moderate.'' Now, facing the abrupt end of Mr. Santorum's presidential bid, some evangelical leaders have begun to rally behind Mr. Romney, saying their shared hostility toward President Obama will be a powerful force for uniting the party in November.
In one sign of coalescing support from Christian conservatives, the National Organization for Marriage, a leading opponent of same-sex marriage, endorsed Mr. Romney on Wednesday morning. The group called Mr. Romney a ''true champion'' and said that Mr. Obama ''has done virtually everything in his power to undermine the institution of marriage.''
But the whole-hearted support of evangelicals, who accounted for nearly one-fourth of all ballots cast in recent presidential elections, will not come without conditions, some leaders warned. During the bitterly fought Republican primary campaign, many conservatives questioned the depth of Mr. Romney's opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and government spending. They say that to win the presidency, Mr. Romney may need a fired-up base to produce a large evangelical turnout in swing states like Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. 
If Mr. Romney is to generate more excitement and sacrifice from Christian conservatives, he must ''demonstrate a genuine and solid commitment to the core values issues,'' said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian advocacy group. Mr. Perkins said Mr. Santorum had vaulted into conservative favor because ''he passionately articulated the connection between America's financial greatness and its moral and cultural wholeness'' and recognized that ''the economy and the family are indivisible.''
''Intensity is going to be a big problem for Mitt Romney,'' Mr. Perkins said in an interview, comparing an obligatory vote for Mr. Romney, to avoid the alternative of Mr. Obama, to ''eating your vegetables.''
Mr. Romney, a range of evangelical leaders said, must not waver in his support for conservative principles if he hopes to tap the energies of Christian conservatives in the general campaign.
But he also needs independent votes to win, said Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist and founder of North Star Opinion Research in Alexandria, Va. So Mr. Romney must deftly walk a political tightrope, keeping the focus on economic issues with broad appeal, Mr. Ayres said.
Mr. Romney's aides are exasperated by the skepticism, because he has formally checked the right conservative boxes, pledging opposition to same-sex marriage, strong support for Israel and the military budget, and embracing the stringent fiscal proposals of Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, a Tea Party favorite. But his inconsistent history on social issues, in particular, leads some to question whether he would carry through as president.
Gary L. Bauer, the president of American Values, a Christian advocacy group, had been one of Mr. Santorum's most visible supporters because, he said in an interview, Mr. Santorum best personified the Reagan legacy of fiscal and social conservatism and a strong defense. Still, he is not reluctant to shift his allegiance now, though with a warning.
''Going to the general election, I will do everything I can for Governor Romney,'' he said.
''But his campaign has got to make it easy for me to help them,'' he added, ''and not make it hard by being tempted to pull back on conservative issues.''
Evangelicals were excited last August when Rick Perry, the Texas governor, entered the race, but he soon fizzled after poor debate performances. More than 100 Christian leaders met last January on a Texas ranch to seek a consensus candidate. Most cast their lot with Mr. Santorum, but some stayed loyal to Newt Gingrich, resulting in a divided evangelical vote in subsequent primaries.
Now, many evangelical leaders reject the conventional wisdom that Mr. Romney, after steering to the right to gain the nomination, must tack toward the center to win in November. They point to Senator John McCain's loss in 2008, when social conservatives were lukewarm about his candidacy and voted in modest numbers, and argue that in many important states, Republicans will need a higher evangelical turnout, like that seen in the 2010 Congressional elections, to win.
Conservatives will be scrutinizing Mr. Romney's every word and gesture in the months ahead, especially signals like his choice of vice-presidential candidate; they mention Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Representative Ryan, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio or even Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and Baptist pastor, as reassuring choices.
Mr. Romney's own campaign officials and conservative supporters reject any suggestion of altering course for the general election. They argue that Mr. Romney's positions on core issues are solid and that Mr. Romney does not face a serious dilemma as he tries to attract both conservatives and independent voters. By stressing the overriding issues of the economy and debt and Mr. Obama's economic failures, in this view, he can appeal to both groups at once.
Mr. Bauer also noted that in parts of the country, independent voters include many blue-collar workers who are most concerned about jobs but also share conservative values on abortion and marriage.
Peter Flaherty, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, said Tuesday in an interview that if Mr. Romney secured the nomination, he would reach out to conservatives who had opposed him, nurturing ties. ''We are going to sit down with everybody involved with the other candidates' campaigns,'' he said.
Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a Christian legal group, and a supporter of Mr. Romney, said the ''stark contrast'' between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama in their visions of America would energize evangelicals as well as attract independent voters.
''I think Governor Romney just needs to stay true to himself, to continue articulating his positions on the economy and the Middle East,'' Mr. Sekulow said.
But some conservative Christian leaders, even as they say they will of course vote for the Republican candidate, remain guarded about Mr. Romney. Steve Scheffler, president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, complained that in Iowa, where Mr. Santorum's surprise showing in the January caucuses thrust him into the limelight, Mr. Romney's campaign had so far made no effort to reach out to evangelicals.
The presidential race is likely to be truly competitive, Mr. Scheffler said, in about a dozen states, including Iowa, and the Republicans will need to motivate people to volunteer at calling centers and put up signs. ''I don't think there's much room for error,'' he said, ''and for them not to be having these conversations with us has been baffling.''
''I hope it changes, because they're going to need Iowa,'' Mr. Scheffler said.

HEADLINE: Romney Taking Steps to Narrow His Gender Gap

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and TRIP GABRIEL; Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Confessore, Alison Kopicki, Michael D. Shear, and Catherine Rampell.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney moved Wednesday to confront one of his most vexing general election problems -- how to narrow the gender gap he faces against President Obama -- but his campaign immediately found itself squeezed between its intensifying efforts to appeal to women and its need to avoid alienating conservatives.
Female voters have emerged as one of Mr. Romney's largest vulnerabilities. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this week showed that women preferred Mr. Obama to Mr. Romney by 19 percentage points, and an earlier Gallup/USA Today poll of voters in 12 key swing states showed Mr. Obama leading over all, buoyed by independents and women -- two critical voting blocs.
Now, in the face of mounting attacks from Democrats and the Obama campaign, Mr. Romney is taking steps to address that gender gap head on. In the past week, his campaign has devised a three-pronged strategy, which it finalized Tuesday night, advisers familiar with the internal discussions said. They will try to debunk the notion that Mr. Romney's policies have hurt women, turn the criticism back on Mr. Obama and outline how they believe women have suffered under his administration, and brand those issues in a memorable way. 
But the campaign stumbled Wednesday just as it was rolling out its new focus: top Romney policy aides, questioned on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act signed by Mr. Obama, which makes it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases, seemed uncertain of how to respond when a reporter asked about Mr. Romney's position on it during a campaign conference call.
While the campaign later released a statement saying Mr. Romney supports pay equity, the law is opposed by conservatives whom Mr. Romney is trying to rally for the general election. The Democrats, meanwhile, seized the opportunity to e-mail news releases citing Ms. Ledbetter's ''shocked and disappointed'' reaction.
As the Romney campaign shifts to the general election, his aides will reintroduce him to voters, warming up his image by emphasizing his role as a devoted father and husband. Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, has already made several Web videos that feature her reminiscences, along with gauzy family photos; voters are likely to see more of these. Mrs. Romney will also increase her campaign appearances; she has already begun to talk about how women tell her they care deeply about the economy, where the campaign wants to keep its focus. Polls showed that as the Republican primary campaign dragged on, Mr. Romney began losing support with women, who may have been put off by the contest's focus on social issues like Planned Parenthood, immigration and contraception.
''Women voters are pocketbook voters, and the highest casualties of President Obama's failures on the economy have been among women,'' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts. ''Governor Romney has a good record on women's issues. When he was in office, he was judged to have the best record of all governors in hiring women into senior positions.''
On the campaign trail on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Romney began highlighting how under Mr. Obama, women have suffered disproportionate job losses, repeatedly citing the figure of 92.3 percent, which he said was women's share of all the jobs lost since the president's inauguration in January 2009.
The net number of jobs held by women has in fact fallen by 683,000 since Mr. Obama's inauguration, while those held by men have fallen by 57,000. But the statistic is misleading for several reasons. For one, while women have lost many jobs in the past three years, men lost far more jobs during the recession which officially started in December 2007, as men are disproportionately employed in industries sensitive to early swings in the business cycle, like manufacturing and construction.
But as the Romney campaign began aggressively fighting for women's votes, the Obama campaign was simultaneously preparing to make sure voters hear about every conservative stance -- especially those involving women's issues -- that Mr. Romney took during his party's bruising primary race. On Wednesday, they released a ''greatest hits'' video featuring some of his oft-repeated comments -- ''Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that'' -- that will surely be repeated by his opponents as he tries to appeal to swing voters in November.
''Women are the majority of the electorate, and they believe that Mitt Romney doesn't understand them and doesn't even care to try,'' said Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager of Mr. Obama's re-election team. ''He's absolutely right that women care about the economy, but that begs the question: Why did he skew his policies against them, and why did he spend so much time playing to the right wing by committing to get rid of Planned Parenthood and giving employers the right to deny women contraceptive coverage?''
In addition to focusing on the economy, Romney advisers said they would also play up the strong professional relationships Mr. Romney has had with women, including from his time as governor. They are considering both ads and testimonials from women -- including minorities -- who worked with him in the Statehouse, and have already started rolling out female surrogates to vouch for his record on women's issues.
But Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said Mr. Romney's statement about pay equity was potentially troubling to conservatives who were already worried about Mr. Romney being sympathetic to issues like the Ledbetter Act.
''It depends on if he was being Clintonian and saying something that can be interpreted in multiple ways, because every free market person will say they're in favor of equal pay,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''But the suspicion among free market people is that Romney won't contest the left's framing and narrative on this issue.''
Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney ''super PAC,'' is preparing to run positive ads reintroducing Mr. Romney to the electorate. If necessary, they will also run ads attacking Mr. Obama's record with women, mirroring the argument that Mr. Romney and his staff unveiled on the trail this week. Brandishing a glossy graphic in Hartford on Wednesday, Mr. Romney spoke at a women-owned business for the second straight day and cited a series of statistics that he said showed how Mr. Obama's economic policies have had a devastating impact on women.
''I was disappointed by listening to the president as he said, 'Oh, Republicans are waging a war on women,' '' Mr. Romney said at Alpha Graphics, a woman-owned commercial printing business. ''The real war on women is being waged by the president's failed economic policies.''
In the coming days, the Romney campaign plans to lay out more details about the ''real'' war on women, especially as it relates to Mr. Romney's favorite topic -- jobs and the economy. The issue of energy, for instance, could be used to talk about how rising gas prices will affect soccer moms who need to drop their children at practice, or commute to work.
''The point we're trying to make is that women should know exactly what this administration has done and what's happened to women in the workplace under this president's leadership,'' said Lanhee Chen, Mr. Romney's policy director. ''There is something unique about this recession that has hammered women in the work force.''

HEADLINE: It's More Than Lunch

 BODY:
When the leaders of India and Pakistan got together for lunch on Sunday in New Delhi there were no dramatic breakthroughs. But given their countries' combustible history -- and the ever present danger of even worse -- the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state in seven years was another small sign of progress. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India and President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan both deserve credit for their sensible, workmanlike effort over the past year to improve relations between the two nuclear rivals. 
After the 2008 Mumbai attacks by Pakistani-based extremists, abetted by the army, there were fears that things could spin out of control. India showed admirable restraint in not retaliating, but Pakistan has failed to bring the terrorists to justice. India still agreed to resume a dialogue on a broad range of issues last year. Cabinet ministers and civil servants from both sides now regularly exchange visits. To build real trust, military and intelligence officials must join in.
They have made the most progress on increasing economic cooperation. India and Pakistan do more trade with Britain than with each other, but they are modernizing the handling of goods at borders, easing visa restrictions and talking about oil pipelines and linking electric grids.
They have much more to talk seriously about, including a joint stake in a stable Afghanistan and the disputed region of Kashmir. A calamity last week at the Siachen Glacier -- more than 100 Pakistan soldiers were killed in an avalanche -- highlights the need for both sides to bring their troops home from that remote border.
There can be no real reconciliation with India until Pakistan prosecutes those responsible for the Mumbai attack, which killed more than 160 people. Last week, the United States put up a $10 million reward for the capture of Pakistani militant Hafiz Saeed, who is accused of being the mastermind and lives openly in Lahore. There have been no significant attacks on Indian territory by Pakistani terrorists since Mumbai. Whether that is luck or the result of government policy in Islamabad is unclear. Either way, those responsible for Mumbai must stand trial for their crimes. President Zardari has invited Prime Minister Singh to Pakistan this year, and we hope he goes. Both leaders are politically constrained and may not be able to deliver bold peace moves. But if they keep pursuing incremental steps, they may yet build a peace.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Limits Federal Law Used in Goldman Programmer Case

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
A federal appeals court has restricted the use of a national law cited in federal prosecutors' efforts to convict a former Goldman Sachs programmer accused of illegally downloading computer code from his onetime employer.
In an opinion released on Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the former employee, Sergey Aleynikov, had not violated the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 or federal stolen property laws. The opinion elaborates on the February decision by a three-judge panel of the appeals court to overturn Mr. Aleynikov's conviction, a reversal that dealt a blow to one of the most prominent federal prosecutions of corporate espionage in recent years.
''This is a case where the facts didn't fit the federal statute,'' said William H. Devaney, a partner at the law firm Venable and a former federal prosecutor. ''I wouldn't be surprised at all to see an attempt to amend the statutes in Congress to cover fact patterns like the one presented in this case.'' 
Mr. Aleynikov was arrested nearly three years ago, after Goldman accused him of downloading code for its high-speed computerized trading operations.
The highly paid programmer, who had accepted a job at a software company catering to other trading firms, uploaded critical source code to an overseas server in his final days. By doing so, he was able to circumvent the bank's security system.
Mr. Aleynikov was convicted in December 2010.
The appeal centered on whether his actions constituted a crime under the Economic Espionage Act. Prosecutors argued that Goldman's high-frequency trading system was produced for interstate commerce, while Mr. Aleynikov's lawyers countered that it was meant for internal use.
Writing for the appeals court, Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs, who presided over the February appeals hearing, agreed with the defense. While conceding that Goldman's code was ''highly valuable,'' he said the investment bank's trading program was never intended to be sold. That fell short of the interstate commerce requirements of the Economic Espionage Act, according to the appeals court's reading of the statute.
Because the high-frequency trading system ''was not designed to enter or pass in commerce, or to make something that does, Aleynikov's theft of source code relating to that system was not an offense'' under the Economic Espionage Act, Judge Jacobs wrote in the opinion.
''This is a complete repudiation of a prosecution that should never have been brought,'' Kevin H. Marino, a lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, said in a telephone interview. ''The principal lesson to be drawn from this is that the business of prosecuting criminal cases ought to be left to the executive branch, not the hands of a powerful private party like Goldman Sachs.''
The judge also found that while Mr. Aleynikov had taken code and uploaded it to his own computers, he had not actually taken a physical object - and therefore had not violated the letter of federal law. That he later transferred the code to a thumb drive still did not make his actions a federal crime.
''We decline to stretch or update statutory words of plain and ordinary meaning in order to better accommodate the digital age,'' Judge Jacobs wrote.
In a separate opinion, Judge Guido Calabresi said that while he agreed with the court's analysis, it was hard for him ''to conclude that Congress, in this law, actually meant to exempt the kind of behavior in which Aleynikov engaged.'' Judge Calabresi said he hoped Congress would return to the issue and clarify what it meant to make criminal under the Economic Espionage Act.
A spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment.
Appeals Court Opinion on Sergey Aleynikov
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: April 11, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this post misidentified the federal law cited in the case against Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer. It is the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, not the Electronic Espionage Act.

HEADLINE: Signs Europe Bending on Airline Carbon Fee

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The European Union has been under fire over a measure that requires foreign airlines to abide by a new system to fight greenhouse gas emissions. Now an Indian official has warned the dispute could disrupt wider climate-change talks. 

 BODY:
ISTANBUL - The European Union, heading for a trade war over a new toll on the greenhouse gas emissions of international airlines using European airspace, has been warned that the measure could wreck the prospects for global action on climate change.
In the latest assault on a measure that came into force on Jan. 1, Jayanthi Natarajan, India's environment minister, said Wednesday that the E.U.'s Emissions Trading System, which requires airlines to buy carbon permits to cover excess emissions, was a "deal-breaker" in the context of international efforts to curb global warming.
"For the environment ministry, for me, it is a deal-breaker because you simply cannot bring this into climate change discourse and disguise unilateral trade measures under climate change," she said.
The Union introduced the measure because it lost patience with the slow pace of progress within the 191-member International Civil Aviation Organization to introduce a worldwide system. With carbon dioxide from airplanes accounting for about 3 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, Europe's legislators decided that action was overdue.
European officials insist the impact on airfares is minimal: for a trans-Atlantic flight, it's the price of a cup of coffee. But if airlines do not have credits to cover their emissions, they would face fines and could ultimately be banned from using European airports.
My colleague James Kanter has pointed out that some airlines opposed to the new E.U. rule could actually make money out of it by selling spare greenhouse gas credits to others who exceeded their quotas.
The measure has nevertheless unleashed a furious reaction from governments and airlines outside the Union. And there are now signs that European resolve is cracking as political leaders come under pressure from their own airlines and airplane makers.
India has joined China in banning its airlines from submitting to the E.U. rules and more than 20 countries, including the United States and Russia, oppose the carbon levy as a unilateral measure that may violate international trade rules. 
A group of U.S. airlines recently dropped a private lawsuit against the European Union in favor of letting Washington deal with the issue. Airlines for America, the U.S. industry group, said opposition to the E.U. law had grown so much that governments should now take the lead.
Connie Hedegaard, the E.U.'s climate action commissioner, told The Financial Times last month that the threat of a trade war would not force the alliance to back down. "You can't threaten a trade war just because you don't like European legislation," she said.
Since then, however, Franois Fillon, the French prime minister, called last week on the European Commission in Brussels to defuse the dispute by finding a solution acceptable to all sides.
Like other leaders of the main European economies, he has been under pressure from domestic airlines and manufacturers concerned about the impact of a wider trade war. China has already retaliated by suspending an order for $14 billion-worth of passenger jets from Airbus.
The French-based company and six leading European airlines wrote to European government leaders last month asking them to exempt airlines from the carbon emissions rule or risk further sanctions that could damage European industry.
India's warning that the dispute could hamper already slow-moving action on global warming will come as a further blow to climate change activists. Ms. Natarajan held out against a climate change deal at the last talks in Durban, South Africa, in December before eventually agreeing on a compromise to cut global carbon emissions.
There are indications, however, that the Union might be prepared to back down in return for global measures that would suit Europe's climate change agenda.
Airlines will not be asked to put up cash for carbon permits for another year, leaving time for a compromise to be worked out.
In a reply to Mr. Fillon, Jos Manuel Barroso, the European Commission's president, hinted that the E.U. might be prepared to drop the new rules if it could make progress toward a global deal on airline emissions. "We continue to work in pursuit of an international solution through the International Civil Aviation Organization," he said.

HEADLINE: Safety Second (Wonkish)

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's mainly lack of investment opportunities. 

 BODY:
The "safe asset shortage" meme has been gathering force lately, and is now the theme of a report from the IMF (pdf). The idea is that low long-term interest rates for the United States, the UK, and basically every country with its own currency that doesn't have large foreign-currency debts reflect the desperate search of investors for something safe to buy.
So, can I express some skepticism? I don't think this is wrong, exactly, but I suspect that the search for safety is a distinctly secondary factor here. Surely the main point is that the major economies seem likely to remain depressed for a long time, and that as a result short-term interest rates are likely to stay low for a long time too -- which means that long rates, which largely reflect expected short rates, are low right now.
Consider, as you always should in these times, the example of Japan. Here's 15 years of 10-year interest rates:
That's an extraordinarily low rate for a very long time -- a low rate that persisted, by the way, despite downgrades from rating agencies and a more or less continual flow of claims that Japanese debt problems were going to come home to roost any day now. So what explains this? Safe assets didn't seem to be in short supply in, say, 2005, when investors believed in the virtues of toxic waste. But the key point about Japan is that anyone who bought and held those bonds made money, because short rates were close to zero throughout.
I guess my point is that the "safe asset" meme seems to imply that there's some kind of market aberration in the high prices (and low yields) of bonds, that investors are willing to lose money because they're frightened. But most of what we're seeing just reflects a perceived lack of good investment opportunities.

HEADLINE: Parsing a Fed Official's Speech

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Janet L. Yellen indicates that even if growth accelerates well beyond the Fed's expectations, it would make sense to maintain the central bank's current policies for several years. 

 BODY:
A person is driving 60 miles an hour, three hours from home. A passenger starts shouting, "Slow down! You're going to miss the house!" The driver responds, "I'll slow down when we get close."
That was the message the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, delivered in a Wednesday night speech that should be required reading for anyone trying to parse the Fed's plans.
Rephrased in the language of central banking: Recent signs of stronger growth have not affected the Fed's intention to hold interest rates near zero through late 2014, at least, because it will still take a long time to recover from the financial crisis. Indeed, as I wrote in my article about the speech, Ms. Yellen said the hole is so deep that the Fed may need to continue its stimulus campaign beyond the end of 2014.
Why is this important? The Fed appears to be concerned that every sign of increased growth is being treated as evidence that it's time for policy makers to retreat from their efforts to increase growth. The message of Ms. Yellen's speech is that the pace of growth could accelerate well beyond the Fed's expectations, and it would still make sense for the Fed to maintain its current policies for the next several years.

This chart, one of the slides that accompanied the speech, shows how quickly unemployment might fall if the Fed's basic economic forecast understates actual job growth. The Fed calculates a 70 percent probability that the unemployment rate will fall in the gray area. As Ms. Yellen noted, that leaves only a very small chance that unemployment will fall below 6 percent by 2014.
"Labor market slack at present is so large that even a very large and favorable forecast error would not change the conclusion that slack will likely remain substantial for quite some time," Ms. Yellen said.
In other words: Hey! Everyone settle down! We're not raising rates this year.

HEADLINE: On Astronauts, NASA, and Climate Concerns

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: NASA astronauts, like the rest of us, are divided on the significance of global warming. 

 BODY:
The folks whose mission or job is to amplify doubt about the significance of greenhouse gases have made much of a recent letter from 49 former NASA astronauts, engineers, scientists and others to the agency's administrator, Charles Bolden, Jr.
The letter, widely cast as signifying a "rebellion," complains about the agency's "unbridled advocacy of CO2 being the major cause of climate change." A clear focus is the research center run by the agency's star climatologist, James E. Hansen, who has variously been hailed and attacked for becoming a prominent campaigner against coal and oil use.
So is this a rebellion? Read on for my views and those of a fine Houston-based science writer as well as Russell Schweickart, an Apollo-era astronaut who epitomizes the right stuff and offers what I consider a near-perfect view of this episode. 
Eric Berger of the Houston Chronicle has weighed in with an excellent post on the letter, noting that none of the complainants are climate scientists; that NASA's position as an agency reflects the brunt of science pointing to a human-heated planet; and that the personal stances of high-profile NASA scientists, Hansen, for instance, are indeed likely to damage the agency's credibility in the eyes of a public divided on global warming. But the agency's rules on public engagement expressly allow NASA personnel to state their personal views. (The policy was updated by the George W. Bush administration after evidence emerged that political appointees were trying to stifle agency scientists' statements on climate science.)
Berger's piece has prompted me to consider creating a new post category here at Dot Earth called "What He Said" because it so completely echoes what I would write. (I've haven't weighed in until now because I've been working overtime helping students edit this year's Pace University documentary, "Battle Behind the Bottle," which is about the link between the stopper in your wine bottle and cork forests in Portugal.) 
Here's the note I received from Russell Schweickart after I alerted him about the letter (he was unaware of it): 
As you know, this is a subject which I feel has become so "religified" (having been converted to religious belief (personally created word) on both sides of the issue, that I assiduously avoid it altogether. I am not a climatologist (nor a meteorologist) and have no real scientific qualifications to comment on the substance of the debate.
And I suspect that the same goes for most of the signatories of this letter. And I suspect it would also apply equally to another poll, if one were to care to take it, of the hypothetical signatories to an analogous letter congratulating NASA for taking a courageous stand and urging it to speak even more strongly.
As you know Andy, this is a complex issue indeed. My personal policy is to reasonably minimize my carbon footprint, on the precautionary principle, not because I know CO2 is responsible for the apparent global temperature increase. But I would also opt not to "break the bank" in minimizing societal CO2 production. We're going to have to adapt to a warming world and I think more effort ought to be put into looking into rational strategies to that end.
But those are all very modest thoughts compared with the "religiously" held beliefs of the pro/anti human-caused-climate-change advocates.
To my knowledge most of the signatories on this letter are in fact engineers (or former engineers). Some are (or were) scientists But none, to my limited knowledge, are what I would consider qualified climatologists. AND they have every right to state and argue for their opinion, and I fully support their right on that score.
My view is that NASA's past and current personnel likely reflect the cultural and academic backgrounds of the nation's educated elite in other arenas associated with engineering, government and science. 
So it's utterly unremarkable to find 49 people, including astronauts and engineers, who would publicly reject James Hansen's view of the dangers posed by unabated emissions of carbon dioxide, or the Obama administration's approach to the space agency's research programs, news releases and other forms of public output on climate, which is markedly different than that of the last Bush administration. 
After all, if you can find a physics Nobel laureate to suit your climate views, why wouldn't you be able to find an astronaut, as well? 
For more on the normal nature of these deep divisions, even among highly educated people, please explore the work compiled at the Cultural Cognition Web site maintained by Dan Kahan of Yale and others, as well as the Global Warming's Six Americas project of Yale and George Mason University.
It may not be pretty. It may not be convenient. It may not be productive. But this how public discourse is waged in America.

HEADLINE: No, I'm the Narrator

BYLINE: JAMI ATTENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: A writer's ex-boyfriend starts his own blog. 

 BODY:
When I broke up with my boyfriend almost four years ago, he started a blog about me. This was a reversal of our entire relationship. I had always been the documenter, and he made guest appearances, or sometimes starred, in what I created. 
When we first started dating, I posted photos of him on my blog. Friends of mine knew who he was long before they met him. Here we were in the laundromat, or on the roof of my building. Here was our first New Year's Eve kiss, and the first holiday party we threw together. I wrote an essay for a women's magazine about our early courtship. Weeks before we were supposed to move in together, I wrote a delighted post detailing how he had flown in and surprised me at a reading I was giving in Chicago, inviting his parents as well. 
He was an artist, and seemed comfortable being part of my creative project. It was all so perfect. So clickable. 
But the minute we moved in together it was instantly awful. There was this strange sensation of always being surprised by each other's presence, as if we had forgotten the other person existed, or at least that we lived together. We had moved in together too quickly, I realize that now. A rookie mistake; neither of us had ever lived with anyone else before. We started dining separately, we made professional decisions without mentioning them to each other and we even bought furniture for the apartment without asking the other person's opinion. And then there were no more pictures of him on the blog, just oblique references to our fights. By the time I left, heading cross-country to Portland for the summer, I was already emotionally gone.
It took a few weeks for me to realize that he had started the site. I discovered it because he linked to my site with the phrase, "For Jami." I had told him that he would have to move out of the apartment when I got back in the fall, and there, on his blog, was a picture of the view of the Williamsburg Bridge from our window with a sign that read, "She left. I stayed. This is my vacation home." Videos and photos and notes and links to songs followed, some abstract, some explicit. 
I freaked out. I was six months out from publishing my third book, and I was terrified someone would find the site and write about it. (I was deluded, of course: I was not even remotely well-known enough for anyone to actually care about my personal life.) But it felt somehow threatening. I had no idea what he was going to say next; I refreshed daily, in horror, waiting for that moment he would reveal a dirty secret. More frightening was that I felt he had wrested control of the narrative from me. Now he was the one telling our story. By linking to my name, making it specifically about me, it was, at least in some small way, a power move. 
More than one friend wondered why I didn't ask him to take it down. I told them all I had no right to. I had documented our relationship so extensively - and continued to in a small way after we broke up, references here and there in essays and blog posts - that it would have been totally hypocritical for me to insist that he stop. He was a visual artist and he was expressing himself, just as I expressed myself with my words. It is an obviously pretentious thing to say, but yes, he was entitled to his process.
Besides, I started to realize there was nothing to be horrified about - it was all one long love letter to me. Creating the blog might have been his grasp at taking control of our story, but it was also his attempt to speak to me in my language, or on my platform anyway. A picture of him on the roof of our building with an umbrella subtitled "dreaming of you in the rain with me." A link to a Patsy Cline song. Sweet, corny, heartbreaking stuff. John Cusack holding a stereo above his head stuff. As much as it scared me, it touched me too. All the things I had once adored about him - his creativity, his sincerity - were on display.
As time went on, I moved in and (mostly) out of relationships. Throughout my late 30s it's been divorced man after divorced man after divorced man - each involvement more depressing than the last. (There should be a legal waiting period for newly divorced people to start dating, much as one has to wait in order to buy a gun.) Slowly I began to like that the blog still existed. 
He updated less and less often, but every once in a while, every month, and then every few months, something new would appear, and I knew that I was on his mind. It was comforting to know that somewhere in the world - one month in New Orleans, another in Oakland - someone still cared about me.
I am not one of those people who string their exes along. Instead I run and hide, under the covers, behind my computer screen, on opposite coasts of the country. But I found myself wanting to see him. The relationship was unfinished, even if by all logic it should have been over by then. I thought, if we saw each other, we could seal things, or at least I would gain some sense of control. But I once biked by him on the street and, when I tapped him on the shoulder because he was wearing headphones, he looked horrified to see me again. Another time we met for a drink in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and it ended with a shouting match on the street. Ever since, he has successfully blown me off with vague excuses and dramatic location changes, beating me so thoroughly at my own game that I think he might have invented a new one entirely. 
Last spring, however, I insisted we meet. I texted him furiously; I e-mailed him; and then, in a wild torrent of emotions, its provenance not quite known to me, I told him that he needed to take my name off the blog. He agreed, and it was gone the next day.
But still he would not see me. And I am sorry for it, because I miss knowing him.
 Even so, I am glad I asked him to take my name off the blog. I don't think it had anything to do with my pride or reputation anymore. There are no secrets on the Internet, and anyway what was it but a collection of love notes? It's just that once he had removed my name, I could look at it with some distance. These days, the blog is just an occasional picture: a fading sunset, an early morning train to work, a chalk sketch of a flower on concrete. Without my name attached, it is just a document of where he has been and what he has seen. Without my name attached, it is just a blog that exists in the universe, created by someone I used to know. 
I recently e-mailed to tell him I was going to write about the blog. It will be four years this summer that the blog has been alive on the Internet - the statute of limitations is over, and besides, I told him because I thought he might want to take it down. He only replied "O.K.," and when I checked the blog a few days later, certain he would have pulled it from the Web, he had, instead, updated it. There was a picture of an old man, a sign bearing the name of his barbershop behind him. I Googled it. The barbershop was in Chicago. And now I knew where he was that week. And that he had gotten a haircut. 
Maybe, when I check in a month from now, I will know something else about him. A song he heard, a bridge he crossed, a window he looked out through at a long stretch of land.

HEADLINE: Are Elections Too Much Like Musical Chairs?

BYLINE: LARRY M. BARTELS


HIGHLIGHT: Bizarrely, economic growth in the second quarter of a presidential election year appears to be especially significant in determining who wins. 

 BODY:
Economic conditions alter the outcomes of presidential elections, but economic conditions during certain time periods matter much more than others. Economic voters are short-sighted, it turns out, and their myopia makes American electoral accountability surprisingly haphazard.
Sixty years of political history suggest that income growth in the months leading up to Election Day has a strong, consistent impact on the incumbent party's re-election prospects - what happens in the rest of a president's term is mostly irrelevant. If the last 15 presidential elections are a reliable guide, income growth between now and Nov. 6 will matter more to voters than how the economy has fared through President Obama's first 39 months in the White House.
In 2004, Louis Uchitelle, an economics reporter for The Times, likened this pattern to a children's game of musical chairs: "If the economy is flourishing in the final weeks of a campaign, when the music stops, the incumbent is likely to be re-elected." Unfortunately, Uchitelle's metaphor seems apt. Income growth rates fluctuate substantially, and more or less randomly, from month to month. In other words, whether the economy happens to flourish or lag in the months just before an election is hardly more meaningful than whether Jacob or Jenny happens to be closer to the last empty chair. It is a bizarre way to pick the leader of the free world.
The following chart summarizes the results of a statistical analysis relating presidential election outcomes since 1952 to changes in real disposable personal income per capita during each president's term. It shows how the incumbent party's popular vote margin has varied with income growth in each three-month quarter, from the quarter in which a president was inaugurated (Q1) to the quarter of the subsequent presidential election (Q16). The analysis also takes into account how long the incumbent party has held the White House, because incumbent vote margins tend to decline by 6 or 7 percentage points with each additional term.
This analysis suggests that an additional percentage point of real income growth in the second quarter of a presidential election year increases the incumbent party's expected popular vote margin by more than 5 percentage points. In President Obama's case, this three-month period began April 1. Income growth in the rest of the election year also seems to matter, though the effect is somewhat smaller, about 3 or 4 percentage points for every additional percentage point of growth.
Income growth earlier in the president's term seems to have little or no impact on the election outcome. In fact, income growth in the first year of a president's term probably reduces his expected vote margin, perhaps because voters make some allowance at election time for the good or bad economic conditions a president has inherited. If this "inheritance" effect manifests itself in 2012, it may provide a significant boost to Obama's re-election chances, since real income growth in 2009 was the worst by far in the past 60 years.
Is there any reason to suppose that income growth in the months leading up to an election is an especially good measure of a president's overall economic performance or a reliable predictor of how things will go if he is re-elected? Not really. For example, real incomes grew by an unremarkable 0.5 percent per quarter through the first three years of Ronald Reagan's first term, but the income growth rate nearly tripled in 1984, averaging 1.4 percent per quarter. Reagan ran a feel-good campaign - "It's morning again in America" - and was re-elected in a landslide. About three-fourths of his 18-point popular vote margin was probably attributable to that extra election-year income growth. But if voters thought they were voting for sustained prosperity, they were mistaken. Income growth in Reagan's second term averaged an unremarkable 0.5 percent per quarter, just as it had been before the 1984 boom.
It is hardly surprising that voters' moods and their assessments of the incumbent president are strongly colored by current economic conditions. From the standpoint of good government, however, their myopic focus on current conditions seems quite counter-productive. On one hand, myopic economic voting provides little electoral incentive for presidents to generate income growth through most of their terms, and a perverse incentive to artificially boost election-year growth with tax cuts and other gimmicks. On the other hand, myopic economic voting seems unlikely to contribute to post-election prosperity, since income growth between now and Election Day will shed little real light on whether the economy would fare better over the next four years under Obama or Mitt Romney.
Some observers doubt whether presidents can do much to affect income growth anyway. Aren't global recessions, oil price shocks and the monetary policies of the Fed much more important economic factors? If presidential policies don't matter, then it is fruitless to reward or punish the incumbent for income growth at any point in his term. But if a president's policies do matter, as I believe they do, then voters would do better to weigh consistent differences in the parties' economic performance over long periods of time. Let's leave the musical chairs for birthday parties.

HEADLINE: How the Banks Endangered Medicare

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Banks' out-of-control risk-taking and the government's failure to rein them in created many problems, which critics of government spending are now using as an excuse to attack Medicare, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The world's largest banks have been accused of many things in recent years, including taking excessive risk in the run-up to 2008, doing great damage to the American economy by blowing themselves up and then working hard to resist any sensible notions of financial reform. 
All of this is true, but it misses what is likely to be the most profound negative impact of the banks' behavior on most Americans. The banks' actions led directly to an increase in government debt, which in turn has made the reduction of that debt by "cutting runaway spending" a centerpiece of the Republican presidential campaign to date.
As a result of this pressure, Medicare now stands on the brink of being eliminated as a viable form of social insurance. Yet the executives who lead these banks - and the politicians with whom they work closely - will not be held accountable this election season.
How is this possible?

The economic mechanism through which a bank-led financial crisis has a broader adverse fiscal impact is straightforward. The recession that deepened sharply in 2008 implied a deep loss of tax revenue, mostly because people lost their jobs. Lower revenue means larger government deficits, particularly when the government also provides unemployment insurance, so spending also goes up. (In comparison, the Bush stimulus of 2008 and the Obama stimulus of 2009 added relatively little to the cumulative additional total debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office.)
This deficit implies a surge in government annual borrowing and in its stock of debt. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the total increase in federal government debt because of the severe financial crisis will end up around 50 percent of gross domestic product. Let's call that $7.5 trillion in today's money (our G.D.P. per year is currently around $15 trillion).
Here's how that calculation works. In January 2008, when almost no one expected a financial disaster, the C.B.O. forecast that by 2018 federal government debt would be just over 20 percent of G.D.P. Once the severity of the problems brought on by the credit contraction after the collapse of Lehman in September 2008 became clear, the C.B.O. redid this medium-range forecast - now taking a view on what debt would be after a difficult economic recovery to trend growth. 
In its forecast of August 2009, the C.B.O. expected that debt would reach nearly 70 percent of G.D.P. in 2018. The change in this C.B.O. forecast for 2018 - to 70 percent of G.D.P. from 20 percent - is the likely total fiscal impact of the 2008 crisis and deep recession. 
To be clear, there was already a potential fiscal issue looming in the distance, in the 2020s and beyond - with the retirement of the baby boomers, increase in life expectancy and, most of all, our collective failure to control health care spending. 
But until 2008 we had time to deal with this - and gradual solutions seemed most likely, preferably including ways to control the growth of health care spending more broadly across the economy.
But the perception of a "fiscal crisis" brought the longer-run budget issues forward in time and the jump in government debt created a sense of panic in some quarters, so measures to "fix" the budget in a drastic fashion are now on the front burner in Washington. 
Ironically, although the main reason for the recent increase in public debt was the financial crisis, brought on by extreme deregulation, the situation has strengthened the hand of people who want, above all, to cut spending.
Medicare had been in the sights of conservatives for some time, but providing health care for Americans at age 65 is a very popular program, and with good reason. Before Medicare was created, it was very hard for people in their 70s, 80s and 90s to buy health insurance. If Medicare in its present form were ended, the adverse impact on older Americans with limited resources, including almost everyone who is not very wealthy, would be significant.
Yet that is what those committed to reducing the size of government and its programs are prepared to do. Whether they can convert this popular theme in the Republican primaries into political momentum that carries through the general election and gives the G.O.P. the presidency and control of Congress remains to be seen. 
It is not surprising that Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, is suggesting that we radically alter Medicare over the next decade or so, turning it, as The New York Times reported, "into a subsidized set of private insurance plans, with the option of buying into the existing fee-for-service program."
"The annual growth of those subsidies would be capped just above economic growth, well below the current health care inflation rate," The Times said. 
(For details of how this would happen, see this commentary by my colleague James Kwak, drawing on the analysis of the C.B.O.) 
The surprise should be that his proposal is being so warmly welcomed by many people who see themselves as centrists in American politics; in the past they would have been more skeptical. 
It does not have to be this way. Social insurance programs like Medicare can be kept in place at the same time as the federal budget is brought under control. To be sure, we need to adjust Medicare's terms and some features of how it operates, but moderate and gradual changes would be sufficient, along with returning tax rates to where they were in the mid-1990s, as Professor Kwak and I discuss in our new book.
Few people want to engage with this issue in a substantive way. The right is focused on not raising tax revenue. The left wants to protect Medicare and Social Security but for the most part does not discuss the details of how this can be done while limiting debt relative to G.D.P. over the next two decades. 
This is a tactical mistake, opening those on the left to charges of fiscal irresponsibility. In fact, it was the administration of George W. Bush that oversaw big tax cuts, two foreign wars and a runaway banking system.
Part of the problem is that the Obama administration saved the failing big banks in 2009 and then defended them against being broken up in 2010 - the president's top advisers consistently asserted that we needed highly leveraged and very large financial institutions, irrespective of the damage they cause. 
It will be very hard for the president to change his narrative at this point.
And it may be too late; many in the center have become enamored of Mr. Ryan, who also appeals to the Republican base and may even become Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate. Certainly his ideas are likely to become a prominent part of the Republican platform for the general election.
In financial crises, it is people at the bottom of income distribution who end up being hurt; most of the rich do fine. When I made this point in "The Quiet Coup" in April 2009, some commentators shrugged off the comparison of the United States and emerging markets that had experienced crises, such as Russia or Indonesia or Brazil. 
Surely, they argued, the United States had a much stronger democracy. But while the precise mechanism differs across countries, the link from financial elite misbehavior to squeezing the lower half of society is present everywhere. In the United States, it most likely will take the form of ending Medicare in its present form. 
To many people, the financial crisis of 2008 seems but a distant memory. If you kept your job or found another, you might feel that the adverse consequences are behind you.
That would be a mistake. The worst is yet to come. When you are 85 and cannot afford decent health care, think about the banks.

HEADLINE: BrightSource Energy Withdraws I.P.O.

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The solar power company BrightSource Energy, facing tough market conditions for renewable energy projects, has withdrawn its initial public offering. 

 BODY:
The solar power company BrightSource Energy withdrew its initial public offering late on Wednesday, citing tough market conditions.
BrightSource, which continues to build solar power installations, including one in the Mojave Desert, had been expected to raise roughly $180 million from an I.P.O.
The news comes at a tough time for renewable energy companies. 
The United States and European countries have pulled back on financial support for wind, solar and other alternative energy sources as they look to reduce government debt.
Global clean energy investment fell to $27 billion in the first three months of 2012, a 22 percent decline from the period a year earlier, according to statistics from the market analysis firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 
So-called green energy companies raised a mere $601 million from the public markets worldwide in the first quarter, an 87 percent drop from the period a year earlier.
"While we received significant interest from potential investors, the continued market and economic volatility are not optimal conditions for an I.P.O.," BrightSource's chief executive, John M. Woolard, said in a statement. "As a company, we've consistently made decisions in the best interest of our shareholders, employees and customers, and we will continue to do so."
The company, based in Oakland, Calif., has received backing from a number of prominent investors, including Google.
BrightSource won a $1.6 billion loan guarantee last year from the United States Energy Department to help reduce the financing costs of its solar power projects. BrightSource has a number of contracts to sell electricity to large utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric, according to a company statement.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
In Bonobos, Nordstrom Finds the Perfect Fit Online | When Andy Dunn helped start Bonobos five years ago, he wanted to shake up the retail industry with a men's wear brand exclusively sold online.
Now Mr. Dunn, 33, is embracing the brick-and-mortar model, striking a partnership with Nordstrom, the 111-year-old department store. It is a symbiotic deal. Bonobos will get $16.4 million in cash and more than 100 stores to sell its clothes, while Nordstrom will gain expertise on e-mail marketing and online branding.
As consumers grow increasingly comfortable online, price-wise and technology-focused, established brick-and-mortar players and fledgling e-commerce sites are finding they need each other.
With sales under pressure, traditional retailers, which have struggled to establish a unique online identity, are trying to tap into the innovative, fast-paced start-up mentality. At the other end of the spectrum, young Internet companies, facing fierce competition and the limits of their growth, are warming to deals with industry giants that have substantial resources and significant distribution outlets.

HEADLINE: It's More Than Lunch

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A workmanlike effort by India and Pakistan to improve bi-lateral relations. 

 BODY:
"When the leaders of India and Pakistan got together for lunch on Sunday in New Delhi there were no dramatic breakthroughs," an editorial in The New York Times said. "But given their countries' combustible history - and the ever present danger of even worse - the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state in seven years was another small sign of progress." 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India and President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan "both deserve credit for their sensible, workmanlike effort over the past year to improve relations between the two nuclear rivals," the editorial says. 
After the 2008 Mumbai attacks by Pakistani-based extremists, "India showed admirable restraint in not retaliating," but "Pakistan has failed to bring the terrorists to justice," the editorial says. "India still agreed to resume a dialogue on a broad range of issues last year." 
"Cabinet ministers and civil servants from both sides now regularly exchange visits," but, "to build real trust, military and intelligence officials must join in," the editorial says. 
They have made the most progress on increasing economic cooperation. India and Pakistan do more trade with Britain than with each other, but they are modernizing the handling of goods at borders, easing visa restrictions and talking about oil pipelines and linking electric grids.
They have much more to talk seriously about, including a joint stake in a stable Afghanistan and the disputed region of Kashmir. A calamity last week at the Siachen Glacier - more than 100 Pakistan soldiers were killed in an avalanche - highlights the need for both sides to bring their troops home from that remote border.
"There can be no real reconciliation with India until Pakistan prosecutes those responsible for the Mumbai attack, which killed more than 160 people," the editorial says.

HEADLINE: Democratic Strategist Apologizes for Ann Romney Comment

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Ann Romney said that "my career choice was to be a mother" and added that people needed to "respect choices that women make." 

 BODY:
Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com
2:14 p.m. | Updated Hilary Rosen apologized Thursday afternoon for what she said were "poorly chosen" words - she said that Ann Romney had "never worked a day in her life" - but said the debate that had ensued over her comments had sparked a "faux war against stay-at-home moms."
"I apologize to Ann Romney and anyone else who was offended," Ms. Rosen said in a statement issued by her firm. "Let's declare peace in this phony war and go back to focus on the substance."
Ms. Rosen said she was trying to respond to Mitt Romney's "poor record on the plight of women's financial struggles." And she said that "as a partner in a firm full of women who work outside of the home as well as stay-at-home mothers, all with plenty of children, gender equality is not a talking point for me. It is an issue I live every day."
Mrs. Romney had responded earlier on Thursday to Ms. Rosen, a Democratic strategist, saying that "my career choice was to be a mother" and adding that people need to "respect choices that women make."
Pushing back against the comment, she added: "She should have come to my house when those five boys were causing so much trouble. It wasn't so easy."
The remarks from Mrs. Romney on Fox News on Thursday morning escalated a political back-and-forth that has quickly morphed into a broader cultural conversation about the role of women in the workplace.
Ms. Rosen's initial comments on CNN on Wednesday night questioned Mrs. Romney's ability to relate to financial struggles of women who have little choice but to work full time while they raise children. Ms. Rosen continued to press that case on Twitter, in an online column and in television appearances in the following hours.
"This is not about Ann Romney," Ms. Rosen said on CNN. "This is about the waitress at a diner someplace in Nevada who has two kids whose day-care funding is being cut off because of the Romney-Ryan budget and she doesn't know what to do."
She added: "This isn't about whether Ann Romney or I or other women of some means can afford to make a choice to stay home and raise kids. Most women in America, let's face it, don't have that choice."
In response, Mrs. Romney insisted that "I know what it's like to struggle." 
"Maybe I haven't struggled as much financially as some people have," she said. "I can tell you and promise you that I've had struggles in my life." 
Ms. Rosen is a managing director at the political consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker, one of whose founders, Anita Dunn, was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama and, this year, to the Democratic National Committee.
Officials at the Democratic Party said that its current contract with the firm was primarily with Ms. Dunn, and that Ms. Rosen had no formal role on the account. They acknowledged that she had attended some meetings, including with the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, but only on an informal basis.
They also acknowledged that Ms. Rosen, a prominent Democrat in Washington who regularly appears at social functions attended by strategists of both parties, had been a visitor to the White House on various occasions. But they said those visits were either for policy announcements and social events attended by large audiences or for occasional smaller sessions that the White House holds with party allies who are frequently on point-counterpoint television round tables with Republicans.
Ms. Rosen is a political analyst with CNN and cannot act as a paid consultant to a political party or presidential campaign as such.
The public debate between Ms. Rosen and Mrs. Romney echoes beyond the campaign trail, where women regularly struggle with questions of how to balance work outside the home, their family responsibilities and the emotional responses that accompany any choice they make.
The first lady, Michele Obama, weighed in Thursday morning on Twitter, writing that "every mother works hard, and every woman deserves to be respected."
But the conversation is playing out in the context of the coming general election campaign between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama, in which both campaigns see their political fortunes intertwined with the conclusions reached by independent women in swing states across the country.
Campaign strategists for Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama appeared to view the public debate as a moment with potentially serious impact on the battle for the White House. A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney lashed out at Ms. Rosen on Thursday.
"Not only was this Obama confidante wrong to attack a mother who chooses to stay home, so many women have lost their jobs under the Obama economy, they don't even have that choice," said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Obama's top political advisers moved rapidly late Wednesday to distance the president from Ms. Rosen.
Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, wrote on Twitter:
I could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly. Her comments were wrong and family should be off limits. She should apologize.
- Jim Messina (@Messina2012)12 Apr 12
David Axelrod, another top strategist, said in a Twitter message that he was "also disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney. They were inappropriate and offensive."
Just as quickly, Mr. Romney's campaign signed Mrs. Romney up on Twitter, where she offered her : 
I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.
- Ann Romney (@AnnDRomney)12 Apr 12
The comment by Ms. Rosen on CNN came at the end of a day in which Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney had engaged in an intense volley of charges about which man's policies would be better for women in America. Mr. Romney is trailing badly among women in public opinion surveys.
On Wednesday, Mr. Romney's advisers gave Democrats an opening after fumbling a reporter's question on whether Mr. Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Democrats pounced, forcing the Republican campaign to insist that Mr. Romney supported equal pay. 
But Ms. Rosen's comments threatened to undermine any progress Mr. Obama's campaign had made on Wednesday.
The comments lit up Twitter, where users began intensely debating Ms. Rosen's remarks, with many accusing her of failing to respect the work that women do at the home. But as midnight approached, Ms. Rosen was not backing down.
In response to Mrs. Romney's first Twitter message, Ms. Rosen 
@AnnDRomney I am raising children too. But most young American women HAVE to BOTH earn a living AND raise children. You know that don't u?
- Hilary Rosen (@hilaryr)12 Apr 12
And then she added: 
@AnnDRomney Please know, I admire you. But your husband shouldn't say you are his expert on women and the economy. #HeNeedsMore
- Hilary Rosen (@hilaryr)12 Apr 12
And then, in a on The Huffington Post, Ms. Rosen wrote a long defense of her comments, accusing critics of "faux anger" aimed at scoring political points.
"I don't need lectures from the R.N.C. on supporting women and fighting to increase opportunities for women; I've been doing it my whole career," Ms. Rosen wrote. "If they want to attack me and distract the public's attention away from their nominee's woeful record, it just demonstrates how much they just don't get it."
She added: "I have no judgments about women who work outside the home vs. women who work in the home raising a family. I admire women who can stay home and raise their kids full time. I even envy them sometimes. It is a wonderful luxury to have the choice. But let's stipulate that it is NOT a choice that most women have in America today."

HEADLINE: Reddy Ice to File for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The company also plans to acquire another embattled ice maker, Arctic Glacier, which filed for bankruptcy in February. 

 BODY:
Reddy Ice, the largest manufacturer and distributor of packaged ice in the United States, said on Thursday that it expected to file for bankruptcy as it confronted a huge debt load, stiffer competition and broader economic uncertainty. 
The company, based in Dallas, also plans to acquire another embattled ice maker, Arctic Glacier, which filed for bankruptcy in February.
Centerbridge Partners, a hedge fund that is a major creditor of Reddy Ice, has "indicated its interest" in financing the acquisition, Reddy Ice said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.
Macquarie Bank, meanwhile, is expected to provide a $70 million debtor-in-possession revolving credit facility. The credit will address the company's capital needs while in bankruptcy, and provide $50 million once Reddy Ice emerges from Chapter 11 proceedings.
In a statement, Reddy Ice said it would file for bankruptcy "promptly" in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. It plans to seek approval from the court to emerge from bankruptcy in 45 days or less.
The company said it did not expect the bankruptcy process to disrupt its business operations.
"We expect to emerge from this restructuring as a much stronger company that is well positioned for investment in growth and enhanced profitability," Gilbert M. Cassagne, the company's chief executive officer and president,said in a statement.
Still, the company faces a challenging road to recovery. It lost nearly $70 million last year, on top of more than $40 million in losses in 2010.
The company suffered as its prices declined amid deeper industry competition, and racked up a mounting debt load. It currently has $516 million in liabilities. The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in December after its stock price failed to meet the exchange's listing requirements.
Reddy Ice said in recent months that it had formed an informal committee of creditors to renegotiate and restructure the company's debt burden. A majority of lenders and major creditors support the restructuring plan, Reddy Ice said on Thursday.
The company's legal advisor is DLA Piper, while its financial advisers are Jefferies & Company and FTI Consulting.

HEADLINE: Apple's Former Patent Chief Joins Nest Labs

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: Apple's former patent chief, Richard Lutton Jr., has joined Nest Labs, a hot Silicon Valley start-up, which has developed a sleek, energy-saving digital thermostat. Honeywell, the giant of the thermostat industry, sued Nest, alleging patent infringement, earlier this year. Nest filed its reply on Thursday. 

 BODY:
The next front in the high-stakes, high-tech patent wars after smartphones? Thermostats.
No, really, and that helps explain why Nest Labs, a hot Silicon Valley start-up, has recruited Richard Lutton Jr., Apple's former chief intellectual property officer.
Nest announced that Mr. Lutton had joined the company as general counsel on Thursday morning, an hour or so after it filed a fiery rebuttal to the patent-infringement suit that Honeywell brought against Nest in February.
A bit of the back story: Nest is populated with talented recruits from Apple, Google, Microsoft and other technology companies, and it has developed a digital "learning" thermostat.
Nest's leaders speak of the thermostat as a device, and a marketplace, ripe for disruptive innovation. A smart thermostat that learns and adjusts to homeowners' comings and goings can deliver big savings to consumers, while delivering the environmental payoff of saving energy and curbing pollution, they say.
Nest introduced its first model last fall to rave reviews and a surge of orders. In February, Honeywell, the thermostat giant with about half of the market in the United States, sued Nest in a Federal District Court in Minnesota.
Honeywell alleges that the design and functions of Nest's thermometer, from its shape to set-up routines, borrow from other companies and, in particular, infringe on seven Honeywell patents.
In its lengthy reply on Thursday, Nest asserts that not only is the start-up not infringing, but that Honeywell's patents are toothless. Clearly, the Nest legal strategy is to try to invalidate the Honeywell patents.
"Honeywell's patents in this case are no good," the Nest filing states. "They are retreads -- already invented by others years before."
In response to Nest's filing, Honeywell said in a statement Thursday morning that it "stands by" its claims of patent infringement, and added that its intellectual property is "a prized business asset that we protect vigorously."
The real test of a patent, it is said, comes not in the patent office but in court. That seems to be the likely path in the Honeywell-Nest conflict.
Mr. Lutton said the Honeywell case was a good initial project, but was not why he joined Nest. The real opportunity, he said, was to "make a difference in building a truly great company," which is applying advanced technology to the big economic and social problems of energy and pollution.
Nest, he said, is an innovator, so "the intellectual property strategy really matters."
Mr. Lutton, 44, left Apple at the end of last year. He had guided Apple's patent policy for a decade, through the iPod, iPhone and iPad. In 2001, when he began, Apple was filing about 50 patents a year. The current pace is more than 1,000 a year, he said.
His Apple years were a great experience, he said, but he had started to "feel like it was time for my next act."
Nest's chief executive, Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who led the design teams on the iPod and iPhone, was a longtime colleague. Mr. Fadell got in touch with Mr. Lutton and introduced him to Nest, its vision and its team. Mr. Lutton has been an adviser to Nest since the start of the year.
The Honeywell suit has apparently not yet had any impact on Nest's business. The start-up is just catching up with back orders and continues to ramp up production at its contract manufacturers. "We're doing great, busting through our numbers," Mr. Fadell said, though the young company has not disclosed sales figures.

HEADLINE: Nothing to Fear But Medicare Cuts

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: How fear-based liberal campaigns can fail, and how they can work. 

 BODY:
My Campaign Stops column yesterday suggested that an Obama re-election campaign devoted almost exclusively to demonizing Mitt Romney and the Republicans might be more successful than some conservatives would like to think. For a counterpoint to that take, here's Josh Kraushaar of National Journal arguing that left-liberal negativity is not enough:
As Obama's advisers have indicated, the president's campaign strategy is to portray the opposition as so extreme that voters will hold their noses and vote for the incumbent even if they're dissatisfied with the country's direction. To eke out a victory in a slow-growing economy, Obama needs to turn out his base and turn off independents to Romney.
But the president is seriously miscalculating if he believes that the key to winning the hearts and minds of independents is "us-against-them" rhetoric that hails back to a bygone Democratic era ... a poll analyzing the sentiments of the swingiest independents from battleground states, commissioned by the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way ... showed those voters narrowly favoring Obama (44 percent) over Romney (38 percent), and showed the president with respectable overall favorability scores. But ... a message centered on income inequality was a flop with these swing voters, who said they were much more anxious about rising debt and with regulations and taxes on businesses. A clear 57 percent majority said they thought the American economic system was "basically fair" and that the deck is not stacked against them ... More than half (51 percent) of respondents said they preferred a candidate who advocates for an economy based on opportunity where "government lives within its means and economic growth is our top priority" while just 43 percent preferred a candidate backing "an economy based on fairness - where the rich pay their fair share, corporations play by the rules, and all Americans get a fair shot." Those arguments closely mirror the Romney and Obama campaign messages unveiled last week, with the broad outlines of the GOP argument coming out on top.
... Democrats are confident that Romney's embrace of House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan's sweeping Medicare reforms is a colossal political blunder, and they marvel at the possibility that Ryan could even be his running mate. But this survey, consistent with Gallup polling illustrating a center-right electorate, suggests that voters more closely identify with the overarching Republican message of an opportunity society over the Democratic message centered on economic security.
These are, indeed, danger signs for Obama, and reminders of his enduring vulnerability. But let me suggest an important distinction. So long as the presidential campaign remains at the thematic level, a purely negative, "don't trust those Republican fat cats" message is likely to be a loser for a Democratic incumbent, precisely because (as Kraushaar notes) we have an electorate that still tends to prefer the rhetoric of Reaganite conservatism to the rhetoric of welfare-state liberalism. But if the campaign descends to a more specific debate over the fate of specific welfare-state programs - Medicare and Social Security above all - that even many center-right voters are loath to see altered in any way, then suddenly negativity might be more of a winner for the Democrats. Or to put it another way: "The people versus the powerful" is often a losing slogan for liberalism, because it's abstract and vaporous, and when the debate is abstract and vaporous Americans prefer to think of their politics in more uplifting, opportunity-oriented terms. But "the Republicans want to cut your Medicare" has been a winner for liberals for a very long time, and as much as I'd like to think otherwise, I don't think the polling Kraushaar cites proves that it can't be a winner again.

HEADLINE: Why Jim Yong Kim Wants to Run the World Bank

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with the president of Dartmouth College, one of three candidates to lead the bank, and President Obama's nominee. 

 BODY:
This week, I had the opportunity to interview Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the Obama administration's nominee to head the World Bank. Dr. Kim is the president of Dartmouth College and a public health expert. He is a physician and anthropologist, a founder of the nonprofit Partners in Health and a former World Health Organization official. 
Dr. Kim is also the front-runner for the World Bank job, given that Europe customarily supports the American candidate for the bank, and the United States supports Europe's candidate for managing director of the International Monetary Fund in turn. 
But that does not mean that Dr. Kim's nomination has met with universal praise. Commentators have questioned whether he has broad enough experience for the post, and questioned a decade-old book in which he critiqued the bank's development approach. There has also been broad criticism of continued American leadership of the multilateral institution.
To quell some of that criticism and rally support, Dr. Kim has gone on a global "listening tour," visiting heads of state and other leaders, and hearing about what the world wants from the bank. The World Bank board is due to announce the institution's new president next week. 
I previously interviewed the other candidates, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria's finance minister, and Jos Antonio Ocampo, a former Colombian finance minister. As with those, the interview with Mr. Kim has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Q.
A.
 The middle-income countries [I visited recently] were all very clear: They think the bank should continue to play a very important role. They were very focused on continuing to receive loans. But they were also interested in the two-way transfer of knowledge, both from the bank to those countries and also from those countries, which have had tremendous innovations, country-led innovations that the bank supported.

What I heard [on my tour] is that the bank continues to remain extremely relevant for poor countries, middle-income countries and also the developed countries. And I heard very helpful suggestions for how the bank can be more effective. 
Q.
A.
 The good news is the World Bank is tackling those issues right now - the bank is very engaged in middle-income countries. And the bank must continue to find ways to remain relevant in different countries. There are different views. There are even differences between the middle-income countries - China, India and Brazil all had different things that they wanted to talk with me about. But the good news is the bank is relevant and there is certainly a commitment on the part of the middle-income countries to remain deeply engaged with the World Bank. 
Q.
A.
 I'm not going to comment on the specific budgetary issues at this point. The critical point is there are very different views on these different institutions. 
The I.F.C. [the International Finance Corporation, one of the bank's five agencies, which makes loans to stimulate private-sector investment] has been very successful. Countries have expressed to me different kinds of aspirations, but one of the things that was clear almost across the board is that they'd like to see a very close working relationship between the I.F.C. and the other parts of the bank. There are synergies there that could be developed.
That's been my approach in all of the institutions I've worked with, to try to get the different parts of the institution to work together. When I was at the World Health Organization I did it; when I was at Harvard and at Partners in Health, and now also at Dartmouth.
Q.
A.
 World Bank is a bank that's focused on economic development and poverty alleviation. I've spent my entire life working to invest in human beings and human communities, to help them move down the path of economic development. 
I was born in in a developing country. Korea was a very poor country, and both my parents were refugees during the war. I studied Korean economic development for my Ph.D. dissertation. And I've worked for years trying to help countries achieve the same economic growth I saw in Korea. You'll remember in the 1960s and 1970s, the conventional wisdom was that Korea would never grow. Not enough Western values. Too much Confucianism, low levels of literacy. Look at what they've done.
What I bring to the bank - which is a very special bank - is this unshakable optimism that countries can go down the same path I saw Korea go down. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, but every country can do it. 
And economic development and poverty alleviation are so complicated that I don't think there's a single background or a single discipline that is sufficient to tackle these great human problems. The World Bank has many extremely experienced macroeconomists. And I look forward to working with them.
Q.
A.
 That book was written based on data from the early and mid-1990s, from the approaches of the World Bank and other institutions in the early to mid-1990s. 
Our concern was that the vision was not inclusive enough, that it wasn't, in the bank's words, "pro-poor." The bank has shifted tremendously since that time, and now the notion of pro-poor development is at the core of the World Bank. The movement specifically has been away from a single big idea that guided all development programs to one now where we're much more focused on evidence.
This is what I bring as both a physician and an anthropologist. As a physician, we are constantly looking for the evidence that will help us make better decisions - I think in economic development towards focusing on what is the evidence that this particular approach to development will work in this particular country. This has been my commitment since I was a young person.
Also, the fact that I'm an anthropologist means that I look for specific solutions for specific contexts. There's no one-size-fits-all. There's no big idea that will lead to economic growth for everybody. I think we must be evidence-based and evidence-driven, and we must pay attention to local contexts.
Q.
A.
 My approach to all jobs like this is I need to spend time meeting people, introducing myself, understanding the great strengths - I've worked with the bank for years and know that it is known throughout the world for having just extraordinary staff. So that's the first thing. I need to meet people and introduce myself.
I think there are lots of priorities that the bank needs to keep its eye on, and I've mentioned some of them. But one of them is fiscal strength. The financial strength of the bank has to be assured. It is so wonderful that the United States and Europe came through with this increase, capital increase. But I think we have to ensure that the bank can continue to play a strong role.
The good news is that in the short term the bank's finances are in good shape. There is enough capital for the short term. As events evolve we have to continue to focus on the financial strength of the institution because it's so important in so many ways. 
I'm flying all over the world, and I'm presenting myself to these leaders all over the world, because this is different. This is the first open, transparent, merit-based election in history. I'm taking nothing for granted and really - I went through internship, and this is almost as hard as internship. We're doing this specifically because we take the election so seriously.

HEADLINE: Romney Camp's Parody Channels the Biden Id

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: With a parody Twitter feed, the Romney campaign imagines what @JoeBiden2008 would say, as the vice president attacked Mitt Romney in New Hampshire. 

 BODY:
In its latest attack, Mitt Romney's campaign is perhaps taking its strategy cues from The Onion.
In advance of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign-style appearance in New Hampshire on Thursday, the Romney camp launched a parody Twitter feed for @JoeBiden2008.
"Imagine if VP Biden decided to cut loose and tweeted what he really thought," says the description. "We think it would look something like this."
The fake Twitter messages include reminders of what Mr. Biden said during the 2008 presidential primary, when he and Barack Obama were competing for the Democratic nomination.
I said in '08 that @BarackObama wasn't ready to be Prez. On-the-job training isn't going so well. http://t.co/lFoP0gSv http://t.co/Sfa6IKY0
- Joe Biden 2008 (@JoeBiden2008)12 Apr 12
Others feature more recent comments by Mr. Biden, including a call for a "global minimum tax."
Why not take it one step further? A GALAXY TAX could fulfill our wildest big-government spending dreams! #taxthegalaxy http://t.co/WM1t9YYP
- Joe Biden 2008 (@JoeBiden2008)12 Apr 12
(Mr. Biden's defenders pointed out that in calling for a global minimum tax, he was proposing a tax on American companies' overseas profits.)
The fake Twitter feed debuted just hours before Mr. Biden spoke in Exeter, N.H. The vice president promoted the administration's "Buffett Rule" proposal, which would raise taxes on millionaires. In a new line of attack, he drew a contrast with the "Romney Rule."
"The Romney Rule says that the very wealthy should keep the tax cuts and loopholes they have, and get an additional new tax cut every year that is worth more than what the average middle-class family makes in an entire year," Mr. Biden said. He later said Mr. Romney's economic philosophy was "out of step with American values."

HEADLINE: To Keep Start-Ups at Home, France Invests in Them

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: One of the new investors in Viadeo, a Paris-based social network for professionals, is a fund set up by the French government to buy strategic stakes in French companies, supporting their development - and, in some cases, trying to keep them out of foreign hands. 

 BODY:
PARIS - The French government likes social media - so much so that the country's sovereign wealth fund has invested 10 million euros in an online network.
Viadeo, a company based in Paris that bills itself as the world's second-largest social network for professionals, after LinkedIn, said Thursday that it had secured 24 million euros ($31.6 million) in new financing in what analysts described as the biggest investment ever in a European social network.
One of the new investors is a fund set up by the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy two years ago to buy strategic stakes in French companies, supporting their development - and, in some cases, to try to keep them out of foreign hands.
Governments across Europe are growing more active in their efforts to nurture technology start-ups, seeing them as one of the best hopes for producing economic growth. But usually these steps take the form of tax breaks or other financial incentives; it is unusual for public funds to take direct ownership stakes.
Except in France, that is. The government wealth fund, the Fonds Stratgique d'Investissement, has made 2.5 billion euros worth of investments in French technology groups, in giant companies like Groupe Bull but also in Internet firms like Dailymotion, a video-sharing service, and Skyrock, a blogging platform.
"The digital industry is among the leading sectors in France in terms of value added and employment," said Jean d'Arthuys, a member of the executive committee of the fund, known as F.S.I., calling Viadeo a "French Internet champion."
Viadeo said the new money would be used to finance its expansion in international markets. With 45 million members, Viadeo is less than a third the size of LinkedIn, the biggest global player in the business of connecting job seekers and headhunters via the Internet.
But Viadeo says it is the biggest player in France, as well as in China, where it claims 10 million members. It has also been expanding in India, Africa and other developing economies.
"These markets are now exploding for us," Dan Serfaty, chief executive and a founder of Viadeo, said. "The market is there, but you need this kind of cash when you want to expand."
Many European Internet companies, even those that have been successful in their domestic markets, have found it difficult to grow internationally. A number of French start-ups, including PriceMinister, an e-commerce business, and SeLoger, a real estate site, have been acquired by foreign companies, feeding concerns about France's ability to hold its ground in the digital world.
Before the investment announced Tuesday, there were fears in France that Viadeo might also fall into the hands of foreign owners, or leave the country. In fact, Mr. Serfaty and the other founder, Thierry Lunati, had already moved their personal offices to Silicon Valley two years ago, while keeping Viadeo's headquarters and much of the research and development operation in France. Mr. Serfaty has since moved again, to Beijing, where the company's Chinese subsidiary, Tianji, is based.
Viadeo employs about 400 people worldwide, half of them in France. Mr. Serfaty said the new round of financing would allow the company to double its work force, with a "proportionate" number of those jobs being created in France.
He said there was no quid pro quo that Viadeo would stay in France in return for the investment from the strategic fund, but added: "I think it was important for them."
"Companies that are based in France, with employees in France, with job offers in France, that's something they looked at," Mr. Serfaty said.
The 24 million euro investment also includes new money from Allianz, the German insurer, and Jefferies, the American investment bank.
By the standards of Silicon Valley, where Facebook has just agreed to buy Instagram for $1 billion, 24 million euros might not sound like much. But it is a sizable sum in the world of French start-ups, where Viadeo has raised less than 50 million euros over all since it was founded in 2004.
"There have been some very successful French Internet businesses, but they've been quite domestic businesses," said Benjamin Robertson, a managing director at Jefferies. "Viadeo is one of the few that has managed to successfully internationalize on the back of its domestic position."
The sovereign fund's stake was not disclosed, but Mr. Serfaty said institutional investors, including the fund, would own less than a third of the company. The fund will, however, get a seat on Viadeo's board.
Some wonder whether the freewheeling culture of a start-up could continue to thrive amid the scrutiny of a buttoned-down civil servant.
This concern was raised in 2009, when the F.S.I. invested 7.5 million euros in Dailymotion, France's answer to YouTube. Dailymotion has continued to grow, but it has been swallowed up by another company with ties to the French government, France Tlcom.
Last year, France Tlcom, the former state-owned monopoly, reached an agreement to acquire 49 percent of Dailymotion in a deal that gave it the right to eventually take full ownership.
Mr. Serfaty said the plan for Viadeo was to sell stock to the public, perhaps two or three years from now. The company considered an initial public offering of shares last year but decided against it.
He said the company, which has been profitable since 2009, had spoken with a number of sovereign wealth funds but chose the F.S.I. in part because it had made a long-term commitment.
"What we liked with F.S.I. was this idea of anchoring Viadeo in Europe," he said. "Having a long-term investor with deep pockets - we thought that could be very useful for us, with what we plan in the coming years."

HEADLINE: Clouds on Solar's Horizon

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Late Wednesday night, BrightSource Energy, a start-up formed to build solar thermal power plants, was forced to make a humbling admission: Despite a year of hopes and efforts, it could not find the market it wanted for its stock. The company canceled its initial public offering of shares just hours before trading was to begin.
Not too long ago, the prospects for BrightSource seemed so limitless that the company incorporated the word into its logo. It had raised tens of millions of dollars from leading venture capitalists, struck partnerships with corporations like Google, Siemens and NRG Energy and secured a coveted $1.6 billion federal loan guarantee for its signature Ivanpah plant in the California desert. Supported by state policy that encouraged utilities to buy lots of solar power, BrightSource had also signed long-term deals to sell much of its planned electricity output to two large utilities.
Then prices plunged for power generated by competing energy sources like natural gas and traditional photovoltaic solar panels. Government subsidies dried up. And investors who once clamored to get a piece of any clean-energy company started shunning all of them. 
''The continued market and economic volatility are not optimal conditions for an I.P.O.,'' John Woolard, BrightSource's chief executive, said in a prepared statement announcing the withdrawal of the stock offering.
In part, the company's I.P.O. troubles show the limits of investor faith in the kinds of large-scale solar power projects that BrightSource develops, analysts say. The projects often pose environmental challenges, need new infrastructure and take up acres of land, and they require enormous investments before generating revenue, posing large risks for developers.
But BrightSource is also emblematic of the dark clouds that have settled over the solar market, analysts and industry executives say. Despite a vast increase in the installation of solar panels in the United States and the rollout of new utility-scale plants, profits are scarce.
As a result, the stock prices of even leading companies are down sharply. Shares of First Solar, for example, are down 93 percent from their 2008 high, closing at $22 on Thursday. Shares of Suntech have dropped 96 percent from their 2007 peak, closing at $2.80 on Thursday. The I.P.O.'s of two alternative energy companies have run into trouble, and the American subsidiaries of Solar Millennium, a German solar thermal power company that is in insolvency proceedings, recently filed for bankruptcy protection.
''It's an election year, there's policy risk, these stocks have been serial underperformers'' said Chris Kettenmann, an analyst at Miller Tabak. ''The industry pulse that we are hearing is accelerated consolidation.''
And it may get worse before it gets better.
A glut in solar panels has driven down prices, and the oversupply may take a while to clear, according to industry executives. At the same time, some European countries are cutting subsidies, which could weaken demand, while in the United States, natural gas prices are at about $2 per million British thermal units, the lowest price in more than a decade, making gas-fired plants more attractive.
Andrew Beebe, chief commercial officer of Suntech, one of the largest Chinese suppliers of solar panels, said that at current natural gas prices, ''we're really not competitive.''
In some ways, the industry is reeling from the aftershocks of its own success. The combination of subsidies and government requirements to buy green power created fast-growing markets in the United States and abroad that analysts now say are undergoing a correction, reflected in Wall Street's lack of enthusiasm.
''For solar stocks, things are bad; for solar, things are good,'' Mr. Beebe said. ''The thing that's causing the disconnect is that it was too hot for a while. Solar was too exciting. So many companies came in that there was a greater supply than there is demand.''
For BrightSource the problem may be more complicated. The company, which sought to raise about $152 million by selling 6.9 million shares for $21 to $23 each, does not use photovoltaic panels but thousands of computer-guided mirrors to concentrate the sun's heat on a water tower to produce steam that is then used to make electricity.
The technology works only at a large scale and in very sunny places, making it harder to compete with the simpler photovoltaic systems, which generate electricity directly from sunlight. The prices of photovoltaic systems have plummeted in recent years as solar plants in China achieved large economies of scale and benefited from what the Commerce Department found were illegal export subsidies from the Chinese government.
The projects that BrightSource has lined up, which include one to help Chevron extract more petroleum from an oil field, still appear to be on track. But competition for new business is getting tougher.
''The risk for BrightSource is that they have a hard time building a new pipeline'' of projects, said Shayle Kann, managing director for solar at GTM Research. ''BrightSource's technology is relatively competitive. But P.V. is generally considered to be a more established and mature technology, so they really have to win on economics, not just compete.''
Although there were signs that the overall stock market was becoming more encouraging for I.P.O.'s, stocks had some of their biggest declines of the year just before BrightSource's planned offering.
''We withdrew because the market conditions weren't attractive to us at this time,'' Mr. Woolard, the company's chief executive, said through a spokesman. ''We're in a strong financial position and we have the support of world-class investors and partners.''
Mr. Woolard and other officials declined to discuss whether BrightSource would now pursue alternative ways of raising funds. It was unclear whether BrightSource would continue with plans for a private sale of about $75 million in stock to Alstom Power, an existing investor, and Caithness Development, that was supposed to occur along with the I.P.O.
David Crane, chief executive of NRG, which is an investor in the BrightSource's Ivanpah project, said there is still demand for solar thermal technology, which generates electricity more smoothly than photovoltaic and easily integrates with storage systems, allowing utilities to better manage the intermittent energy from sunlight.
''Depending on how strong the grid is, some utilities are extremely wary about making their system too dependent on solar P.V.,'' Mr. Crane said in an interview. ''The minute a cloud comes over, solar P.V. comes down.''
NRG has invested in both solar thermal and photovoltaic plants.
Mr. Crane said he was confident that the 392-megawatt Ivanpah project would go forward, although the prices negotiated for the electricity on that deal were higher than what producers can generally get now.

HEADLINE: Training for the Jobless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Funds to Train Jobless in U.S. Are Drying Up'' (front page, April 9) and ''A Rockier Pathway to Work'' (editorial, April 10): 
America's city leaders want their cities to thrive. To do so, their residents must have access to quality education and training programs.
The evidence is clear: our residents who benefited from Pell and Workforce Investment Act programs were better educated and had better skills than those without access to these programs.
Last year, nearly 10 million low-income adults benefited from Pell grants, and 9 million unemployed adults benefited from the investment act. Each program helped put large numbers of Americans back to work in jobs that provided a good wage with benefits.
If the cuts proposed by Representative Paul D. Ryan and adopted by the House ever become law, our residents will be unable to obtain the skills they need to enter the 21st-century workplace and get better jobs.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise as Nation's Trade Gap Shrinks

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits hit a two-month high last week, and more applications were received in the previous week than initially reported, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 13,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 380,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday, defying economists' expectations for a drop to 355,000. The previous week's count was revised to show 10,000 more applications than previously reported.
While economists cautioned against reading too much into the report, saying problems adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around Easter might have pushed last week's figure higher, they said it nonetheless provided a worrying signal.
''It certainly bolsters the view that things are starting to slow down,'' said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
The four-week moving average for new claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends, rose moderately.
In another report, the Commerce Department said the nation's trade gap shrank 12.4 percent, to $46 billion in February, as exports hit a record high. It was the biggest month-to-month decline in the trade shortfall since May 2009.
The shrinking of the deficit prompted economists to lift their estimates for economic growth in the first quarter. Goldman Sachs now sees the gross domestic product expanding at a 2.5 percent annual pace instead of the 2.3 percent pace it had estimated earlier.
The economy grew at a 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
A third report showed little sign of inflation pressures. The Labor Department said prices received by producers were unchanged in March after advancing 0.4 percent in February, while wholesale prices excluding those for food and energy rose 0.3 percent.
That should allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low and even embark on a third round of asset purchases or quantitative easing should job growth completely stall.
William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said on Thursday that the central bank was gathering more data to determine whether last month's weak employment report was just a weather-related setback or a sign the recovery was losing momentum again.
''The somewhat softer March labor market report that was released last Friday may reflect the earlier positive influence of the mild weather on job creation in January and February, although other less sanguine interpretations are also plausible,'' he said.
Last month, more than a third of the rise in the core Producer Price Index was attributed to rising costs for light motor trucks. Higher prices for passenger cars, soaps and detergents also contributed to the advance.
In the 12 months through March, wholesale prices increased 2.8 percent, the smallest increase since June 2010, after advancing 3.3 percent in February.

HEADLINE: To Cut Health Costs, Can We Curb the Tests?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Do You Need That Test?'' (editorial, April 9) describes a laudable approach to cutting costs of health care, but assuring it is another question. 
The biggest challenge to cutting health care costs is the lack of incentives for anyone -- patients, doctors, hospitals and insurance companies -- to do so. As long as insurance covers the cost, patients, doctors and hospitals have no incentive to cut costs. As costs rise, insurance companies merely raise premiums, as evidenced by the last cost crisis in 1992, when costs were 11 percent of gross domestic product. They are now 17 percent.
With reimbursements continuing to decline, providers of care will ''justify'' needless tests to compensate for income loss. Patients are generally clueless about what tests cost, so they will not be energetic cost cutters.
Why do insurance companies pay $1,000 for a colonoscopy to one hospital and $2,500 to another in the same community? Why do insurance companies pay for a $10,000 surgical procedure, only to pay $50,000 for proton beam ''surgery'' for an outcome that is no better?
RALPH A. SAWYER Jacksonville, Fla., April 9, 2012
The writer is an ophthalmologist.
To the Editor:
You did not give enough weight to malpractice reform. The sad truth is that our health system is driven in large part by the ordering of unnecessary tests to protect against malpractice suits. Despite protests to the contrary, this practice referred to as ''defensive medicine'' is so ingrained in physicians' minds that changing their approach will be extraordinarily difficult, unless malpractice reform is part of the equation.
For this reason, an alternative to the malpractice system is needed, one that is less adversarial and that as a result minimizes defensive medicine.
Health courts are one such alternative. Presided over by judges with special training in malpractice, health courts have great potential to control unnecessary testing. They may have even greater weight than the experts' lists of tests of no benefit.

PERSON: Raymond Aubrac 

HEADLINE: Raymond Aubrac, Leader and Symbol Of the French Resistance, Is Dead at 97

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Raymond Aubrac, who took that nom de guerre as a storied leader of the resistance effort in Nazi-occupied France during World War II, died on Tuesday in a military hospital in Paris. He was 97.
His daughter Catherine announced the death.
Mr. Aubrac and his wife, Lucie, became exalted symbols of heroism in their country's fight against the Germans, who defeated France in 1940. Their story of valor and love was told in movies and books, some written by them, and they were showered with national honors. Mrs. Aubrac died in 2007 at 94. 
President Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday that the Aubracs and their colleagues had ''operated behind the scenes and saved the honor of France, at a moment when it seemed lost.''
The couple were at the center of one of the most dramatic episodes in wartime France. Mr. Aubrac had been captured in June 1943 with Jean Moulin, a revered Resistance leader, and six other operatives. Tortured by Klaus Barbie, the notorious Gestapo officer known as the Butcher of Lyon, Mr. Aubrac was sentenced to death.
Mrs. Aubrac, who was pregnant, appealed to Barbie for mercy, saying she wanted to marry Mr. Aubrac to make their child legitimate -- even though, unbeknownst to Barbie, they were already married. After he rebuffed her, she bribed another Nazi officer to allow the couple to have a marriage ceremony. As they met to sign a marriage certificate, she whispered to her husband that colleagues were planning his rescue.
That happened as a truck was transporting Mr. Aubrac and a dozen other prisoners from one jail to another. Suddenly, four cars appeared, their occupants brandishing machine guns. Five German guards were killed, and the prisoners escaped.
For the Aubracs, it was the end of a long underground battle that began with writing anti-Nazi graffiti and escalated into sabotage. Along the way they had together and individually used false names, including Vallet, Ermelin, Balmont and Aubrac, which they made their legal one.
After hearing the coded signal ''Ils partiront dans l'ivresse'' -- ''They will leave joyfully'' -- on BBC radio, the Aubracs were evacuated by a Royal Air Force plane to London in February 1944. In London they worked in Gen. Charles De Gaulle's government in exile.
Mr. Aubrac was born Raymond Samuel on July 31, 1914, to shopkeepers in Vesoul, France. He studied engineering and law in France and received a scholarship to continue his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard for a year.
He met Lucie Bernard while participating in left-wing politics in Paris. They married on Dec. 14, 1939, in Dijon, after he warned her that it might be dangerous for her to marry a Jew.
''That just made me even more keen,'' she said.
She joined the Resistance in October 1940, and he joined a month later. The couple settled in Lyon and founded Liberation Sud, an underground network of Resistance fighters operating in southern France. Their principal activity was publishing the underground newspaper Liberation. Mr. Aubrac was arrested twice before falling into Barbie's hands. His parents died in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
After France was liberated in 1944, Mr. Aubrac was appointed commissioner to govern Marseille. But the rough justice he administered to Nazi collaborators during this period, called the ''Epuration,'' or purification, led to his dismissal in five months.
It did not end his involvement in public affairs, however. He was soon appointed to oversee the destruction of millions of mines around France. In 1958, the government of Morocco asked him to help in its economic development efforts, which he did for five years. He continued to work with less developed countries and took a position at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.
When Ho Chi Minh, the North Vietnamese leader, came to Paris in 1946 to negotiate independence, he stayed in Mr. Aubrac's home, explaining that he would have missed having a garden if he had stayed in a hotel. In 1967, as was later widely reported, the United States secretly enlisted Mr. Aubrac to travel to Hanoi to negotiate an agreement to end the Vietnam War. He failed, but an agreement similar to the one he helped fashion led to peace talks.
In 1975, Kurt Waldheim, the secretary general of the United Nations, used Mr. Aubrac as a channel to communicate with the North Vietnamese and Vietcong authorities during the war's last throes.
Over the years, historians and others have suggested that there was circumstantial evidence that Mr. Aubrac had collaborated with the Nazis in occupied France. He successfully sued one author for libel in 1998, and asked that a jury of historians judge the evidence. The newspaper Liberation, which he had helped found, assembled such a panel, and it concluded that he had not collaborated with the Nazis.
Among the several movies based at least partly on the Aubracs was ''Lucie Aubrac,'' a 1997 French release directed by Claude Berri and starring Carole Bouquet in the title role.
De Gaulle was the godfather of Mr. Aubrac's daughter Catherine Vallade, while Ho Chi Minh was godfather of his other daughter, Elisabeth Helfer Aubrac. (Ho, an atheist, was said to prefer the term sponsor.) They survive him, along with his son, Jean-Pierre, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Mr. and Mrs. Aubrac celebrated most of their 67 anniversaries at Le Jules Verne, a restaurant on the second level of the Eiffel Tower. He told the newspaper Le Monde last year that marrying her was the best thing he had ever done.
''You know,'' he said, ''in life there are only three or four fundamental decisions to make. The rest is just luck.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

A HEAVY HAND Mark Zuckerberg, below, the 27-year-old chief executive and co-founder of Facebook, does not usually play the role of deal maker.
But the social network's $1 billion purchase of Instagram, the popular photo-sharing service, was a Mark Zuckerberg production. The deal -- large and cobbled together quickly -- underscores his control of Facebook and how he drives the social network's pace. EVELYN M. RUSLI 
BANKRUPTCY LOOMS Reddy Ice, the largest manufacturer and distributor of packaged ice in the United States, said on Thursday that it expected to file for bankruptcy as it confronted a huge debt load, stiffer competition and broader economic uncertainty.
The company, based in Dallas, also plans to acquire another embattled ice maker, Arctic Glacier, which filed for bankruptcy in February. BEN PROTESS
CLOSED FOR BUSINESS With the initial public offering of the Oaktree Capital Group, a private Goldman Sachs stock exchange has come to an end.
Goldman Sachs had grand ambitions for the exchange, the Goldman Sachs Tradable Unregistered Equity platform, which Lloyd C. Blankfein, left, Goldman's chief executive, highlighted in 2007 as an example of the firm's ability to innovate. Two investment firms, Apollo Global Management and Oaktree, signed up as charter members. But no one showed up to trade, and Apollo and Oaktree moved their listings to the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Last Will and Embezzlement

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Directed by Deborah Louise Robinson
1 hour 22 minutes; not rated
So your normally prudent 69-year-old mother has taken up with an unemployed salsa instructor half her age, and now he's living in her spare room. And co-signing her checks. She seems happy, but you're worried about his motives -- not to mention your inheritance. What can you do? 
Very little, according to the heartbreaking stories in ''Last Will and Embezzlement,'' Deborah Louise Robinson's rudimentary yet eye-opening documentary on the growing problem of elder abuse. Narrated by the actor Artie Pasquale, owner of a don't-mess-with-me mug and a wiseguy-loaded resume, the film highlights criminals who exploit vulnerabilities -- like early dementia, illness or isolation -- and insinuate themselves into a victim's life and finances. Sniffing around nursing homes and graveyards, these people can cause havoc within families, their acts of predation rarely reported and seldom prosecuted.
Seesawing between concerned experts and moving case histories -- including an impassioned Mickey Rooneyrecounting years of suffering at the hands of a close family member -- the film has a bare-bones look that only intensifies its nearly painful sincerity. As the horrors of reverse-mortgage scams bump up against forged bank documents and legal black holes, we are grateful for the lucid guidance of Kathleen J. Houseweart, an expert on geriatric cognitive impairment. Separating the charmingly forgetful wheat from the dangerously enfeebled chaff, she wonders at what point diminished capacity can reasonably be interpreted as bad judgment. ''We have a right to make bad decisions,'' she insists. Indeed we do, especially when they involve salsa instructors half our age.

HEADLINE: With Tweaks, Quinn's Living-Wage Bill Scales Back Its Ambitions

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
Early this year, Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the New York City Council, held a news conference at City Hall to announce that she had resolved one of the most contentious issues to face the Council during her six-year tenure -- a proposed law that would raise the wages of workers in developments subsidized by the city.
But to win the support of business as well as labor, Ms. Quinn had severely cut the number of workers that the so-called living-wage bill would affect, applying the measure only to companies that directly receive city subsidies, and not to companies that are tenants in those subsidized developments. 
This week, three months after her initial announcement, Ms. Quinn, a likely candidate for mayor next year, said that she had at last completed revising the measure, and that it would be ''the most impactful living-wage law in the United States.''
But it now exempts even more employers, and by her office's estimate, just 400 to 500 low-wage workers a year will benefit.
''Its impact, I believe, will be minimal,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, who opposes the measure.
And Stephanie Luce, an associate professor of labor studies at the City University of New York, said Ms. Quinn's description of the proposal as the most far reaching in the country struck her as ''strange.''
The exclusion of tenants means the bill ''is going to be much more narrow'' than the laws and policies in other cities, like Los Angeles and San Francisco, she said, adding, ''I just don't see it covering that many people.''
Because the legislation has not been approved, FreshDirect, the online grocer, will be exempt, even though it has been promised a $100 million package of tax breaks, land and other subsidies to move to the Bronx from its current home in Queens, rather than to New Jersey.
And part of the Hudson Yards major development project on the Far West Side would be exempt as a result of an exclusion in the measure's language. Ms. Quinn has defended the exemption, saying in a radio interview that the bill was intended to apply only to new developments, and that ''most of the leases, deals, whatever on Hudson Yards are well along in the negotiation.''
Some advocates for low-wage workers seemed torn by the bill, saying that something was better than nothing: affected workers would be paid at least $10 an hour with benefits, or $11.50 an hour without benefits, compared with the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. But the advocates also expressed disillusionment about the process.
''It's a little bit of a Catch-22,'' said Bettina Damiani, project director of Good Jobs New York, an economic development watchdog group. The organization, Ms. Damiani said, started off ''really excited that this conversation and debate is happening, because we've watched for so many years incredibly egregious subsidies going to companies without any guarantee that there are going to be good-paying jobs on the other end.''
She said she had been frustrated to see the bill steadily watered down. ''You watch the process and you see the water, and you see more water, and there's some more water,'' she said.
But Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said he was pleased with the bill. Mr. Appelbaum said he accepted the exception for Hudson Yards, because that project ''had been in the works for a long time.'' He also emerged victorious in the final negotiations, as Ms. Quinn rejected a clause that would have allowed the mayor to waive the wage requirement when he or she determined it was in the city's interest to do so.
The lack of such a clause led Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, to drop her support.
Some cities establish more expansive living-wage requirements through a combination of laws and economic development policies. San Francisco's mandate, for example, applies to tenants as well as to direct recipients of city subsidies. Los Angeles's mandate covers tenants if the development is on city-owned property. Moreover, the redevelopment agency in Los Angeles takes an aggressive approach in subsidy negotiations, requiring in most circumstances that major tenants in a subsidized project agree to pay a living wage.
Peter Dreier, a professor of politics and public policy at Occidental College in Los Angeles, said claiming that the New York City requirement would be the broadest in the country was in some ways not very striking.
''Anything that happens in New York is going to be the biggest in the United States,'' he said. ''It's got more people under rent control, it's got more people on welfare, so that's kind of silly.'' Of Ms. Quinn's plan, Mr. Dreier said, ''It's a step in the right direction, but it's not sufficient.''

HEADLINE: The Myth of Sustainable Meat

BYLINE: By JAMES E. McWILLIAMS. 
James E. McWilliams is the author of ''Just Food: Where Locavores Get It Wrong and How We Can Truly Eat Responsibly.''

 BODY:
Austin, Tex.
THE industrial production of animal products is nasty business. From mad cow, E. coli and salmonella to soil erosion, manure runoff and pink slime, factory farming is the epitome of a broken food system.
There have been various responses to these horrors, including some recent attempts to improve the industrial system, like the announcement this week that farmers will have to seek prescriptions for sick animals instead of regularly feeding antibiotics to all stock. My personal reaction has been to avoid animal products completely. But most people upset by factory farming have turned instead to meat, dairy and eggs from nonindustrial sources. Indeed, the last decade has seen an exciting surge in grass-fed, free-range, cage-free and pastured options. These alternatives typically come from small organic farms, which practice more humane methods of production. They appeal to consumers not only because they reject the industrial model, but because they appear to be more in tune with natural processes.
For all the strengths of these alternatives, however, they're ultimately a poor substitute for industrial production. Although these smaller systems appear to be environmentally sustainable, considerable evidence suggests otherwise. 
Grass-grazing cows emit considerably more methane than grain-fed cows. Pastured organic chickens have a 20 percent greater impact on global warming. It requires 2 to 20 acres to raise a cow on grass. If we raised all the cows in the United States on grass (all 100 million of them), cattle would require (using the figure of 10 acres per cow) almost half the country's land (and this figure excludes space needed for pastured chicken and pigs). A tract of land just larger than France has been carved out of the Brazilian rain forest and turned over to grazing cattle. Nothing about this is sustainable.
Advocates of small-scale, nonindustrial alternatives say their choice is at least more natural. Again, this is a dubious claim. Many farmers who raise chickens on pasture use industrial breeds that have been bred to do one thing well: fatten quickly in confinement. As a result, they can suffer painful leg injuries after several weeks of living a ''natural'' life pecking around a large pasture. Free-range pigs are routinely affixed with nose rings to prevent them from rooting, which is one of their most basic instincts. In essence, what we see as natural doesn't necessarily conform to what is natural from the animals' perspectives.
The economics of alternative animal systems are similarly problematic. Subsidies notwithstanding, the unfortunate reality of commodifying animals is that confinement pays. If the production of meat and dairy was somehow decentralized into small free-range operations, common economic sense suggests that it wouldn't last. These businesses -- no matter how virtuous in intention -- would gradually seek a larger market share, cutting corners, increasing stocking density and aiming to fatten animals faster than competitors could. Barring the strictest regulations, it wouldn't take long for production systems to scale back up to where they started.
All this said, committed advocates of alternative systems make one undeniably important point about the practice called ''rotational grazing'' or ''holistic farming'': the soil absorbs the nutrients from the animals' manure, allowing grass and other crops to grow without the addition of synthetic fertilizer. As Michael Pollan writes, ''It is doubtful you can build a genuinely sustainable agriculture without animals to cycle nutrients.'' In other words, raising animals is not only sustainable, but required.
But rotational grazing works better in theory than in practice. Consider Joel Salatin, the guru of nutrient cycling, who employs chickens to enrich his cows' grazing lands with nutrients. His plan appears to be impressively eco-correct, until we learn that he feeds his chickens with tens of thousands of pounds a year of imported corn and soy feed. This common practice is an economic necessity. Still, if a farmer isn't growing his own feed, the nutrients going into the soil have been purloined from another, most likely industrial, farm, thereby undermining the benefits of nutrient cycling.
Finally, there is no avoiding the fact that the nutrient cycle is interrupted every time a farmer steps in and slaughters a perfectly healthy manure-generating animal, something that is done before animals live a quarter of their natural lives. When consumers break the nutrient cycle to eat animals, nutrients leave the system of rotationally grazed plots of land (though of course this happens with plant-based systems as well). They land in sewer systems and septic tanks (in the form of human waste) and in landfills and rendering plants (in the form of animal carcasses).
Farmers could avoid this waste by exploiting animals only for their manure, allowing them to live out the entirety of their lives on the farm, all the while doing their own breeding and growing of feed. But they'd better have a trust fund.
Opponents of industrialized agriculture have been declaring for over a decade that how humans produce animal products is one of the most important environmental questions we face. We need a bolder declaration. After all, it's not how we produce animal products that ultimately matters. It's whether we produce them at all.

HEADLINE: Cannibalize The Future

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
One general rule of modern politics is that the people who talk most about future generations -- who go around solemnly declaring that we're burdening our children with debt -- are, in practice, the people most eager to sacrifice our future for short-term political gain. You can see that principle at work in the House Republican budget, which starts with dire warnings about the evils of deficits, then calls for tax cuts that would make the deficit even bigger, offset only by the claim to have a secret plan to make up for the revenue losses somehow or other.
And you can see it in the actions of Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, who talks loudly about acting responsibly but may actually be the least responsible governor the state has ever had. 
Mr. Christie's big move -- the one that will define his record -- was his unilateral decision back in 2010 to cancel work that was already under way on a new rail tunnel linking New Jersey with New York. At the time, Mr. Christie claimed that he was just being fiscally responsible, while critics said that he had canceled the project just so he could raid it for funds.
Now the independent Government Accountability Office has weighed in with a report on the controversy, and it confirms everything the critics were saying.
Much press coverage of the new report focuses, understandably, on the evidence that Mr. Christie made false statements about the tunnel's financing and cost. The governor asserted that the projected costs were rising sharply; the report tells us that this simply wasn't true. The governor claimed that New Jersey was being asked to pay for 70 percent of a project that would shower benefits on residents of New York; in fact, the bulk of the financing would have come either from the federal government or from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which collects revenue from residents of both states.
But while it's important to document Mr. Christie's mendacity, it's even more important to understand the utter folly of his decision. The new report drives home just how necessary, and very much overdue, the tunnel project was and is. Demand for public transit is rising across America, reflecting both population growth and shifting preferences in an era of high gas prices. Yet New Jersey is linked to New York by just two single-track tunnels built a century ago -- tunnels that run at 100 percent of capacity during peak hours. How could this situation not call for new investment?
Well, Mr. Christie insisted that his state couldn't afford the cost. As we've already seen, however, he apparently couldn't make that case without being dishonest about the numbers. So what was his real motive?
One answer is that the governor is widely assumed to have national ambitions, and the Republican base hates government spending in general (unless it's on weapons). And it hates public transportation in particular. Indeed, three other Republican governors -- in Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin -- have also canceled public transportation projects supported by federal funds. The difference, of course, is that New Jersey is a densely populated state, most of whose residents live either in Greater New York or Greater Philadelphia; given that position, public transit is the state's lifeblood, and refusing to invest in such transportation will strangle the state's economy.
Another answer is that canceling the tunnel allowed Mr. Christie to divert funds from that project -- as his critics have said, to cannibalize the investment -- and put them into the state highway fund, thereby avoiding the need to raise the state's tax on gasoline. New Jersey gas taxes, by the way, are lower in real terms than at any point in the state's history. But, as a candidate, Mr. Christie said that he wouldn't raise those taxes, so cannibalizing the tunnel helped him avoid embarrassment.
The crucial point about both of these explanations is that they stand Mr. Christie's narrative about himself on its head. The governor poses as a man willing to make hard choices for the future, but what he actually did was sacrifice the future for the sake of personal political advantage. He catered to national Republican prejudices that are completely at odds with New Jersey's needs; he cared more about avoiding embarrassment over a misguided campaign pledge than about serving an urgent public need.
Unfortunately, Mr. Christie's behavior is all too typical these days.
America used to be a country that thought big about the future. Major public projects, from the Erie Canal to the interstate highway system, used to be a well-understood component of our national greatness. Nowadays, however, the only big projects politicians are willing to undertake -- with expense no object -- seem to be wars. Funny how that works.

HEADLINE: Shares Surge on News From China and Europe

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Encouraging signs from two of the most important zones of the world economy, China and Europe, drove the Dow Jones industrial average up 181 points on Thursday, one of its biggest gains this year.
China's central bank reported a surprising increase in loans in March, easing concerns about a sudden slowdown in the Chinese economy, whose growth has helped pull the globe out of recession.
Italy's government easily sold $6.4 billion in bonds to investors. After the auction, borrowing rates for Italy fell, European stock indexes reversed earlier declines and worries about the continental debt crisis eased, at least for the day. 
''European governments have a mountain of debt coming due early this year,'' said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. ''Some of what you're seeing today in markets is a bit of relief that they're working through it.''
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 181.19 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 12,986.58.
After the market closed, Google reported earnings that were ahead of analysts' estimates and said it would issue a new class of nonvoting stock to shareholders. Google rose slightly in after-hours trading.
On Wednesday, the stock market snapped out of a five-day slump, its longest and deepest of the year. Investors were worried about European debt, slower job growth and the Federal Reserve's resistance to taking further steps to bolster the economy.
''I think the fear was overdone,'' said Scott J. Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. ''This is the manic nature of the stock market. The sentiment seems to shift back and forth day by day. Either the economy is booming or it's completely falling apart.''
In other trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.86 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,387.57. The Nasdaq composite index gained 39.09 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,055.55.
Materials companies led the S.& P. 500 higher, with energy and industrial stocks close behind. Hewlett-Packard gained 7.2 percent after a study reported that shipments of personal computers unexpectedly rose almost 2 percent at the start of the year.
The nation's trade deficit shrank in February to $46 billion, a four-month low, as exports were strong. The shrinking trade deficit raised the possibility that the economy had grown more rapidly in the first quarter than previously expected.
United States stocks opened higher, despite a rise in weekly unemployment claims. The Labor Department reported that applications for unemployment benefits increased to 380,000 last week, the highest level in two months.
Among stocks making big moves, Avid Technology, a maker of equipment for recording music and video, fell 17 percent after it said it expected to post a loss in the first quarter because of weaker demand from amateur musicians and disc jockeys.
McKesson, a drug provider, rose 3.9 percent after reporting that the Department of Veterans Affairs had agreed to keep McKesson as its main drug supplier. The department runs one of the country's largest health care systems.
The positive news from China also encouraged investors to move to riskier assets with higher potential payoffs from those considered safe, like Treasury instruments. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 6/32, to 99 16/32, and the yield rose to 2.06 percent from 2.04 percent late Wednesday.

Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz.
Cyrille Aimee (Tuesday through April 21) A jazz singer of unforced cosmopolitanism -- born in France, of French and Dominican parentage -- Ms. Aimee put in a strong showing at the 2010 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocal Competition, shortly before recording her most recent album, ''Live at Smalls'' (SmallsLive). At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen) 
- Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra / Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks (Friday and Saturday) Two long-running big bands and New York institutions, each with its own perspective on the jazz tradition. Ms. Akiyoshi, who was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2007, employs the broad palette of postbop in her flagship band, which used to hold a regular perch at Birdland; Mr. Giordano, a generation younger in age but a generation older in spirit, still leads the Nighthawks on Mondays and Tuesdays at Sofia's Restaurant. If there's connective tissue between the two groups, it might be the tenor saxophonist and flutist Lew Tabackin, Ms. Akiyoshi's husband and a featured member of her band, but someone you could also picture hunkering down with Mr. Giordano. At 8 p.m., with preconcert discussions at 7 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $30 to $120. (Chinen)
Wess Anderson Sextet (Tuesday, Thursday through April 22) Wess Anderson, known in jazz circles as Warmdaddy, is an alto saxophonist with a tart sound and a bluesy, charismatic style. A charter member of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, he returns to friendly turf with a young band featuring Aaron Diehl on piano, among others. The drummer Herlin Riley joins on Tuesday only; the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon does the same on Thursday. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 to $40 cover, with $15 for students in select sets, and a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
- Karl Berger's Improvisers Orchestra (Tuesday) Mr. Berger, the composer, conductor and former guiding spirit of the Creative Music Studio in Woodstock, N.Y., presides over this loosely defined large ensemble, made up of open-minded improvisers like the multireedist Peter Apfelbaum and the drummer Warren Smith. This performance is part of a series, on alternate Tuesdays through May 15, in which the musicians workshop ideas during a 7:30 p.m. open rehearsal, followed by a proper 9 p.m. performance. At Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20 for workshop and performance ($15 for members and students) and $15 for performance only ($10 for members and students).

- Regina Carter (Thursday through April 22) Ms. Carter, the violinist, has explored timbres both rustic and cosmopolitan throughout her career. Her current preoccupation -- and the subject of her most recent album, ''Reverse Thread'' (eOne) -- is folkloric music of Africa, stamped with her own improvisational flair and helped along by an ace band featuring kora, accordion, bass and drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30 cover. (Chinen)
Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival (Friday through April 30) This homegrown, community-supported festival, now in its 13th season, continues with bookings in and around the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Here he modifies the lineup a bit, with James Hurt filling in for Mr. Iyer and Justin Brown for Mr. Gilmore. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $20, includes one drink. (Chinen)
Kermit Driscoll Quartet (Saturday) The bassist Kermit Driscoll recently released his long-overdue debut as a leader: ''Reveille,'' on the Nineteen-Eight label, with his longtime colleague Bill Frisell on guitar and a smart younger talent, Kris Davis, on piano. Standing in for Mr. Frisell here is the guitarist Ben Monder, and joining the conversation is the drummer John Hollenbeck. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $25 cover, includes one drink. (Chinen)
- Jim Hall Quartet (Tuesday through April 22) Jim Hall's economical style and harmonic command have made him a quietly imposing hero of jazz guitar -- and, at 81, a certifiable legend. He appears here not only with the sturdy rhythm team of Scott Colley on bass and Joey Baron on drums, but also with a wunderkind, Julian Lage, one of countless younger jazz guitarists to swear by his influence. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $45 cover at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
- Holshouser, Bennink & Moore (Wednesday) What might sound like a personal-injury firm is in fact an improvising trio of the highest order, composed of the accordionist Will Holshouser, the Dutch drummer Han Bennink and the saxophonist and clarinetist Michael Moore. The group has a new album, ''Live in NYC'' (Ramboy), recorded on a night much like this one. It's also worth noting that Mr. Bennink, a legend of avant-garde jazz, is the subject of a 70th birthday marathon broadcast, Tuesday through April 21, on WKCR, 89.9 FM, and wkcr.org. At 7:30 p.m., Dixon Place, 161A Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $5. (Chinen)
- Vijay Iyer Trio (Friday and Saturday) The pianist and composer Vijay Iyer just released ''Accelerando'' (Act), the second album featuring his superb trio with the nimble but grounded bassist Stephan Crump and the magically propulsive drummer Marcus Gilmore. Already the subject of much praise in these pages and elsewhere, the album seems likely to spark an even more dynamic interplay in person, during this album-release engagement. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

Kneebody (Friday and Saturday) This quick-change electro-acoustic chamber ensemble is finishing a four-night residency courtesy of the indie promoter Search and Restore, presenting a different concept each night. The band will play its own music in an early set on both Friday and Saturday; the second set on Friday will revolve around the experimental electro-pop artists Louis Cole and Genevieve Artadi, while the second set on Saturday will feature as-yet-unannounced special guests. At 7:30 p.m., Littlefield, 622 Degraw Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Gowanus, Brooklyn, littlefieldnyc.com; $15, or $12 for students. (Chinen)
Wayne Krantz Band (Friday and Saturday) An electric guitarist with a smart, slashing approach and a taste for all manner of twisted fusions, Wayne Krantz has a new album, ''Howie 61'' (Abstract Logix), that showcases his distinctive voice as a bandleader (and, literally, his voice). Mr. Krantz will reunite with the members of his old rugged trio: Tim Lefebvre on bass, Keith Carlock on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, theiridium.com; $35 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Daniel Levin Quartet (Wednesday) Demonstrating an impressive breadth of texture and contrast, the cellist Daniel Levin comes well prepared for a career in jazz's contemporary avant-garde. He has enlisted equally skilled partners here, in a working band: the trumpeter Nate Wooley, the bassist Peter Bitenc and the vibraphonist Matt Moran. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $20 cover, includes one drink. (Chinen)
Tony Malaby Tuba Trio (Friday) The tuba in question belongs to Dan Peck, the guts and in many ways the glue of this band. Tony Malaby brings his searching tenor saxophone, and his compositions; John Hollenbeck outlines texture as well as tempo on the drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $25 cover, includes a drink. (Chinen)
- Kate McGarry Quartet (Wednesday) On ''Girl Talk'' (Palmetto), her effervescent and pointed new album, Kate McGarry apprehends the legacy of her female jazz-vocal precursors, including Sarah Vaughan, Abbey Lincoln and Sheila Jordan. She celebrates the album's release with her husband, Keith Ganz, on guitar; Gary Versace on Hammond B-3 organ; and Clarence Penn on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20 cover. (Chinen)
Mephista (Sunday) Texture and tonality are flexible elements in Mephista, an exploratory trio with Sylvie Courvoisier on piano, Susie Ibarra on drums and percussion and Ikue Mori on electronics. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 for students and 65+, free for members. (Chinen)
- Joshua Redman Trio (Tuesday through April 22) Joshua Redman has lately put his tenor and soprano saxophone to work in the context of James Farm, a superarticulate postbop quartet, with strong direction from all four of its members. He returns to a more ostensibly hierarchical trio format here, with Gregory Hutchinson on drums and Matt Penman, one of his fellow James Farmers, on bass. The results should be sleek and full of silvery digression. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $30 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Herlin Riley Quartet (Friday through Sunday) Few contemporary jazz drummers groove as naturally as Herlin Riley, who presides here over a quartet composed of other musicians with past ties to Wynton Marsalis: the saxophonist Todd Williams, the pianist Peter Martin and the bassist Reginald Veal. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 and $40 cover, students $15 for select sets, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)
Adam Rudolph: Go Organic Orchestra (Monday) This sprawling, meditative large ensemble, performing at Roulette every Monday night in April, is a project of the open-minded percussionist, composer and conductor Adam Rudolph. Drawing inspiration from earthy and elemental sources, it features a total of 38 pieces, in a diverse whorl of woodwinds, strings, percussion and guitars. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, at Third Avenue, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, or $10 for students, 65+ and members. (Chinen)
Angelica Sanchez Trio (Saturday) Ms. Sanchez, a probing pianist, has worked often in a collective mode with the members of this trio: Tony Malaby, a smartly blustery tenor and soprano saxophonist, and Tom Rainey, a starkly suggestive drummer. Here she leads the expedition, featuring her own music. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20 cover, or $10 for members. (Chinen)
- The Paul Simon Songbook (Thursday and next Friday) The songs of Paul Simon, wry and questioning and musically savvy, provide one hook for this concert program, featuring Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. Another hook, naturally, is Mr. Simon himself, performing with the band. Also aboard for good measure is the New Orleans soul singer Aaron Neville, who has done fine work with ''Bridge Over Troubled Water.'' At 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; sold out, but limited tickets may become available. (Chinen)
- Frank Wess Quintet (Friday and Saturday) Frank Wess, who turned 90 this year, conveys a gentlemanly cool on tenor saxophone and a marvelous expressiveness on flute. Drawing partly from his most recent album, ''Once Is Not Enough'' (La Beth), he leads a group with Ilya Lushtak on guitar, Michael Weiss on piano, Noriko Ueda on bass and Winard Harper on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $35 cover. (Chinen)
Steve Wilson Super Band (Friday through Sunday) The alto and soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson combines economy and modernity in his playing, and in this group -- convened to help celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Jazz Standard, one of his steadiest perches -- he has musicians well equipped to frame his sound. On piano is Patrice Rushen; on bass is James Genus (except on Saturday); on drums is Billy Kilson. And joining as a guest on Friday and Saturday is one of Mr. Wilson's regular collaborators, the singer Carla Cook.

HEADLINE: As Mali Prepares for Vote, Interim Leader Is Sworn In

BYLINE: By FABIEN OFFNER and LYDIA POLGREEN; Fabien Offner reported from Bamako, and Lydia Polgreen from Harare, Zimbabwe.

 BODY:
BAMAKO, Mali -- Twenty-two days after a military coup ended more than two decades of democratic rule in Mali, the leader of the country's National Assembly was sworn in as interim president on Thursday. 
The official, Dioncounda Traore, a 70-year-old labor union activist who had been jailed in Mali's earlier struggle against dictatorship, will lead a temporary government that aims to organize new elections within 40 days and guide the country back to constitutional rule.
But he must also face the challenge of reuniting a country torn in two. During the chaos of the coup, Tuareg militiamen in the north staged an opportunistic uprising, seizing strategic towns and declaring an independent nation.
''Mali has never experienced such difficult times,'' Mr. Traore said in remarks after he was sworn in. ''Its very existence as a nation is at stake.''
He called upon the Tuareg rebels to leave the areas they occupy immediately or face ''total and relentless war.'' Ecowas, the West African trade bloc that pressured the coup leaders to relinquish power by closing borders with Mali and freezing the nation's funds in the regional bank, has also been drawing up plans to help oust the rebellion in the north.
The coup was a serious setback for democracy in Africa. The country was little more than a month away from holding elections to replace its president, Amadou Toumani Toure, who had adhered to the nation's Constitution by agreeing to step down after his second term in office.
Then, in a surprise derailment of the democratic process, a group of junior officers deposed him, contending that he had been too weak in confronting the uprising in the north. In the ensuing confusion, however, the northern rebels rapidly advanced, taking control of Timbuktu and declaring their own country, Azawad.
The leader of the junta, an American-trained army captain, was reduced to begging for foreign help to defeat the rebels. He also faced fuel shortages because of the sanctions. Late last Friday, the junta agreed to step down in return for amnesty.
The speedy, diplomatic resolution of the coup stood in stark contrast to the case of Ivory Coast, where months of international condemnation and sanctions failed to dislodge the nation's strongman, Laurent Gbagbo, after he lost an election.
In that case, it took an onslaught by rival forces and airstrikes by the United Nations and France before Mr. Gbagbo surrendered last year. But here in Mali, the crisis was resolved very shortly after sanctions were imposed.
Still, the situation in northern Mali continues to be grave. The United Nations commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, said Thursday that steps must be taken to protect civilians there.
''Reports from the north of the country suggest that civilians have been killed, robbed, raped and forced to flee,'' Ms. Pillay said. ''It is difficult at this point to be sure of the scale of the human rights violations taking place, but in addition to preying on individuals, a variety of different rebel groups have been accused of looting private and public property, including hospitals and health care facilities.''

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
'Act of Valor' (R, 1:41) Grafting actual Navy SEALs -- and live ammunition -- onto a concocted narrative, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh create a pumped-up recruitment commercial whose impressive action sequences never cohere into a real movie. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'American Reunion' (R, 1:53) Jim, Stifler, Finch, Oz, Stifler's mom, Jim's dad and the rest of the ''American Pie'' crew return for a 13th high school reunion. High jinks ensue. If you are a devotee of this pioneering franchise in the now ubiquitous subgenre of man-child comedy, this movie will offer the minor, bittersweet satisfaction of catching up. Otherwise, you are likely to be mystified, irritated and bored. (A. O. Scott)
- 'The Artist' (PG-13, 1:40) This Oscar-winning best film, starring the Oscar-winning Jean Dujardin, is not so much a tribute to the glories of silent cinema as an ingeniously up-to-date attempt to replicate their magic. Completely delightful. (Scott) 
'The Beat Hotel' (No rating, 1:28) A cheap Paris hotel and its artistic clientele -- including Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and Gregory Corso -- form the subject of Alan Govenar's genial documentary about a key part of Beat history. (Nicolas Rapold)
- 'Boy' (No rating, 1:27) This quirky, unpretentious father-son story stands out in multiple ways: for its refreshing and stellar child performances, for its surprising interplay of sad and silly, and for its rustic and beautiful New Zealand setting. It's a detailed, funny and moving coming-of-age tale from the writer-director Taika Waititi. (David DeWitt)
- 'Bully' (No rating, 1:34) Lee Hirsch's documentary visits five families in four states whose children have endured torment at the hands of their peers. The title is a bit misleading since the bullies themselves rarely appear on screen, but this allows Mr. Hirsch to focus on the suffering of the victims and, more importantly, on the failure of schools to address the problem adequately. For all its emotional impact, the film is also a fascinating, raw document of a moment when bullying is beginning to be understood not as a fact of life, but as a social problem. (Scott)
'Casa de mi Padre' (R, 1:24, in Spanish) In this broad, on-and-off funny Spanish-language comedy, Will Ferrell plays the oldest son of a rancher down Mexico or rather down telenovela way. Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna costar, and Matt Piedmont directs. (Manohla Dargis)
'Chico & Rita' (No rating, 1:34, in Spanish) A sweet, sad and sexy animated valentine to Cuban jazz in the 1940s and '50s, told through the star-crossed love of a pianist and a singer. (Scott)
'Damsels in Distress' (PG-13, 1:39) Fourteen years after ''The Last Days of Disco,'' Whit Stillman (''Metropolitan,''''Barcelona'') returns with this eccentric, uneven comedy of campus manners. The excellent Greta Gerwig plays Violet, leader of a group of young women who take it upon themselves to counsel the unhappy, reform the male gender and preserve the values of civilization. Or something. The film wanders engagingly and sometimes annoyingly through a series of episodes -- some pointedly satirical, some nuttily surreal -- that touch on the peculiarities of friendship and romance in a world without clear rules or roles. (Scott)
- 'A Dangerous Method' (R, 1:39) Michael Fassbender is Carl Jung, Viggo Mortensen is Sigmund Freud, and Keira Knightley is Sabina Spielrein, a young woman caught between the two giants of modern psychology during the years of their volatile association. Directed by David Cronenberg from a script by Christopher Hampton (based on his own play and John Kerr's book), the film is sexually charged and intellectually thrilling, propelled by its characters' terror and excitement as they explore the unmapped territory of the unconscious. (Scott)
- 'The Deep Blue Sea' (R, 1:38) Working from a well-made, slightly musty 1952 play by Terence Rattigan, Terence Davies (''The Long Day Closes,''''Distant Voices, Still Lives'') has confected a tale of wayward passion and social decorum that is at once feverish and meticulous. Rachel Weisz is incandescent as Hester Collyer, the wife of a dull aristocrat (Simon Russell Beale) and the lover of a dashing, shallow World War II veteran (Tom Hiddleston). (Scott)
'Detachment' (No rating, 1:37) Tony Kaye's grim jeremiad and would-be shocker about the failure of the public school system stars Adrien Brody as a saintly high school substitute teacher with a whole mess of personal problems. For all its seriousness, the movie's subplots get in the way of its message. (Stephen Holden)
'Dr. Seuss' The Lorax' (PG, 1:26) The title refers to licensing rather than inspiration, since this noisy, junky animated thing has about the same relationship to Seuss's environmental parable as a cellphone tower has to a tree. (Scott)
- 'Footnote' (PG, 1:43, in Hebrew) Joseph Cedar turns an anecdote about two rival Israeli scholars -- who happen to be father and son -- into a richly textured, sharply satirical inquiry into family loyalty and the slippery nature of truth. (Scott)
'Friends With Kids' (R, 1:40) Allowing sitcom rhythms to sideline its most poignant insights, Jennifer Westfeldt's talky, less-audacious-than-it-thinks romantic comedy dawdles toward a destination visible from the outset. But in a world where men now knowledgeably discuss Kegel exercises and uterine droop, we must all navigate the birth canal to get there. (Catsoulis)
'Gerhard Richter Painting' (No rating, 1:37, in English and German) Corinna Belz's documentary focuses on Mr. Richter's work and process. The best parts are when we get to see a picture develop, as he paints or drags a squeegee over the canvas. Watching this can be fascinating, even exciting. After all, it prompts a fundamental movie question: What happens next? (Rachel Saltz)
'Goon' (R, 1:32) Until it reveals its true colors and turns from a rowdy sports farce into something vaguely resembling the ''Rocky'' of hockey movies, ''Goon'' presents a pungently realistically vision of an extremely violent and chaotic sport and the roughnecks who devote their lives to it. (Holden)
'The Hunger Games' (PG-13, 2:22) Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss, the teenage warrior from Suzanne Collins's book trilogy. The director Gary Ross has too soft a touch, but the film is insistently watchable partly because of how the story radically revisits -- and re-sexes -- the classic figure of the American Adam. (Dargis)
'The Hunter' (R, 1:40) Willem Dafoe plays a mercenary hired by a military biotech company to search for a Tasmanian tiger, a species thought to be extinct. The film is a subtle allegorical contemplation of opposing forces: the promises and illusions of technology; survival versus conservation; and the meaning of extinction in the age of cloning. (Holden)
'The Island President' (PG, 1:41, in English and Dhivehi) A year in the life of Mohamed Nasheed, who was elected president of the Maldives in 2008 (he was forced out of power in February of this year). Not only did he face the challenge of protecting democracy in a country emerging from decades of dictatorship, he also had to contend with the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change on a nation made up of 1,200 low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean. Jon Shenk's documentary is a candid, energetic study in environmental advocacy and high-level geo-politics. Its cautious optimism -- and Mr. Nasheed's -- becomes jarring, even heartbreaking when one considers how little has been accomplished to slow the pace of global warming. (Scott)
'Jeff, Who Lives at Home' (R, 1:23) The latest from Jay and Mark Duplass (''Cyrus,''''Baghead'') revisits the apparently inexhaustible comic theme of adult male immaturity, but from an unusual angle with unexpected results. Jason Segel is Jeff, a large, sweet-natured, melancholy fool, and Ed Helms is his older brother Pat, an insecure jerk whose marital problems set a farcical plot in motion. Judy Greer (as Pat's wife) and Susan Sarandon (as Pat and Jeff's mother) are on hand to temper the boyishness, and the Duplasses daringly steer the story away from silliness into surprising emotional and spiritual territory. (Scott)
'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' (No rating, 1:21, in Japanese) Jiro Ono, an octogenarian sushi master, and his tiny, Michelin-lauded Tokyo restaurant get a flattering spotlight in David Gelb's foodie-friendly debut documentary. (Rapold)
'John Carter' (PG-13, 2:12) Not as bad as you may have heard! Andrew Stanton's adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs's dusty tale of adventure on Mars tries to balance silliness and splendor, and manages an unsatisfying but intermittently amusing blend of camp and spectacle. (Scott)
'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island' (PG, 1:34) Jules Verne goes 3-D again as Sean (Josh Hutcherson), from the 2008 film ''Journey to the Center of the Earth,'' receives a radio message from his grandfather (Michael Caine) and heads off with his stepfather (Dwayne Johnson) to try to find him. The film has some excellent effects early -- helicopter crash, giant lizard -- but they become less convincing as the tale rolls along, with a lengthy flight sequence atop giant bees particularly rickety. The story is a serviceable escape-before-the-island-blows yarn with obligatory family lessons folded awkwardly in. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Keyhole' (R, 1:34) Jason Patric plays Ulysses, a memory-haunted crime boss in the latest black-and-white film from the Canadian experimentalist Guy Maddin. Though he evokes old gangster and horror movies, Mr. Maddin also digs around in literature, mythology and the familiar (to his fans) realm of his own unconscious. The result is funny, fantasmagorical and sometimes poignant, though it lacks the demented emotional grandeur of the director's best work. (Scott)
- 'The Kid With a Bike' (No rating, 1:27, in French) A quietly rapturous film from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne about love and redemption and the 11-year-old throwaway (Thomas Doret) who finds hope and a new life with a stranger (Cecile de France). (Dargis)
'Love in the Buff' (No rating, 1:52, in Cantonese) A surprisingly tart script, interesting leads and canny camerawork carry this Chinese rom-com, which offers an amusing glimpse into mating rituals among Beijing's young and single professionals. The capital city has rarely looked so glamorous. (Andy Webster)
- 'Melancholia' (R, 2:10) The end of the world imagined by Lars von Trier as a ravishingly beautiful planetary collision intruding on the difficult, painful relationship of two sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg. (Scott)
'Mirror Mirror' (PG, 1:46) Tarsem Singh directs this would-be comic redo of Snow White with Lily Collins as a princess who helps write her own happily ever after and Julia Roberts as the mean queen. The true stars are the costumes by Eiko Ishioka. (Dargis)
'October Baby' (PG-13, 1:47) Not even a dewy heroine and gauzy cinematography can disguise the essential ugliness of this faith-based drama about the survivor of a botched abortion, containing as it does a gory portrait of medical hackery that is clearly intended to terrify young women. (Catsoulis)
'Pina' (No rating, 1:46, in German, English, Russian, Italian, French, Slovenian, Korean, Spanish and Portuguese) Wim Wenders's 3-D documentary pays vivid tribute to the life and work of Pina Bausch, the German choreographer who died in 2009, leaving behind a corps of devoted dancers and a corpus of provocative and powerful dances. (Scott)
'Player Hating: A Love Story' (No rating, 1:37) Maggie Hadleigh-West's volatile and intimate documentary ventures into the Albany Houses in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to explore thug life through the eyes of the aspiring hip-hop artist Half-a-Mill (born Jasun Wardlaw). (Catsoulis)
- 'Project X' (R, 1:28) If you thought the teenagers-behaving-badly genre was wrung out, this raucous film about the most outrageous birthday party in history will be a pleasant surprise. The script finds plenty of fresh humor in the seemingly old story of a teenager left home alone for the weekend, and the three unknown actors at the center of things (especially Oliver Cooper as the party mastermind) deliver the goods with likable verve. Rendering an epic party filmed from multiple angles coherently is a difficult job; Nima Nourizadeh, directing his first feature, makes it look easy. (Genzlinger)
'The Raid: Redemption' (R, 1:41, in Indonesian) The cops check into the Indonesian apartment complex teeming with villainy where much of this tediously violent action movie takes place, but most don't check out. The Welsh director Gareth Evans recycles a lot of action cliches mostly in the service of a high body count. (Dargis)
'Safe House' (R, 1:55) Daniel Espinosa directs, with action-film verve and smash-and-go chases, this ''Bourne''-esque story about the bad, bad things that agents sometimes do (or seem to) in the name of country and company. A very fine Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds star. (Dargis)
- 'Salmon Fishing in the Yemen' (PG-13, 1:51) Although largely defanged of its satire, the screen adaptation of Paul Torday's absurdist novel about an Arab sheikh who wants to create a salmon run in the desert remains an agreeable romantic comedy, with strong performances by Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. (Holden)
'Scenes of a Crime' (No rating, 1:26) This disturbing but even-handed exploration of modern police interrogation explores the application of a psychologically sophisticated technique to the 2008 case of a man in Troy, N.Y., accused of killing his infant son. (Holden)
- 'A Separation' (PG-13, 2:03, in Farsi) In this tightly wound, complex drama from Iran, a couple's marital crisis reveals schisms of class, sex, age and ideology. The writer-director, Asghar Farhadi, achieves the pace and suspense of a thriller and the psychological depth and social insight of a good novel in this Oscar-winning film. (Scott)
'Shame' (NC-17, 1:39) A somber study of sex addiction, directed by Steve McQueen. Vague and dreary when it should be tough and devastating. (Scott)
'Silent House' (R, 1:25) Elizabeth Olsen looks lovely by lantern light as she slinks around a scary house in this horror film, but the thin script doesn't give her much of a chance to show acting skills other than the ability to look terrified. She's pretty good at that. (Genzlinger)
'Surviving Progress' (No rating, 1:26) In their 86-minute breeze through civilization, its history and self-made discontents, the Canadian filmmakers Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks, working off Ronald Wright's aptly titled book ''A Short History of Progress,'' basically reach the conclusion that we are doomed. Surprise! (Dargis)
- 'Turn Me On, Dammit! (No rating, 1:16, in Norwegian) Taking coming of age literally, Jannicke Systad Jacobsen's low-key Norwegian comedy follows a hormonal 15-year-old (Helene Bergsholm) who pays a harsh social price for her sexual fantasies. (Catsoulis)
'21 Jump Street' (R, 1:49) This big-screen update of a popular late '80s television series is cruder and more aggressive than the original, but also, unusually for the pop-culture recycling genre, fresh and often quite funny. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are barely competent cops working undercover at a high school, blasting away at cliches with goofy abandon. (Scott)
'Wanderlust' (R, 1:38) In David Wain's mostly funny comedy, Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd flee New York and the Great Recession and end up in a 1960s-style commune filled with good vibrations and assorted goofiness. (Dargis)
- 'We Have a Pope' (No rating, 1:42, in Italian) The story of a specific crisis of conscience with larger reverberations, this emotionally generous and moving tragicomedy from the Italian filmmaker Nanni Moretti (''Caro Diario'') stars the great Michel Piccoli as a newly elected pontiff who has serious doubts about the job. (Dargis)
'Wrath of the Titans' (PG-13, 1:39) Perseus (Sam Worthington) mounts Pegasus once again in this sequel to the 2010 ''Clash of the Titans'' remake, and once again hammy acting, oversize digital monsters and largely bloodless conflagration takes over ancient Greece. Alas, as little stays with you after this installment as it does after the first. (Webster)
Film Series
Mezhrabpom: The Red Dream Factory (Friday through Thursday) Originally organized by the German Kinemathek for the Berlin International Film Festival, this survey of the works of the Soviet film studio Mezhrabpom (a privately financed German-Soviet venture) vividly demonstrates how much more there is to the Soviet cinema than the official classics of Eisenstein and Vertov. The weekend begins with two films by one of the greatest and least well known of Russian directors, Boris Barnet, with the rare 1931 propaganda film ''Thaw'' (Friday at 4 p.m. and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.) and the film that may be his masterpiece, the 1933 ''Outskirts'' (Friday at 7 p.m. and Saturday at 1:30 p.m.), a study of a remote Russian village torn apart by World War I. More entertainment-oriented than the state-run studios, Mezhrabpom produced such genre pieces as Alexander Andriyevsky's 1935 ''Loss of Sensation'' (Saturday at 5 p.m.), an amazing science fiction parable about a scientist who creates a robot task force controlled by the notes of a saxophone, and Vladimir Schneyderow's ''Golden Lake'' (Wednesday at 4 p.m.), an outdoor adventure set in Siberia that is often compared to American westerns. Comedies include Sergei Komarov's ''Kiss for Mary Pickford'' (Monday at 4 p.m.), a romantic comedy fashioned around footage of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks's visit to the Soviet Union, and Yakov Protazanov's anti-religious satire ''St. Jorgen's Day'' (Wednesday at 7 p.m.), about priests who decide to make a movie. The program continues through April 28. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $12. (Dave Kehr)
New York African Film Festival (Friday through Tuesday) A wide-ranging program of fiction films, documentaries and experimental work from continental Africa and the African diaspora are part of this 19th festival in a series. Among the highlights: Miriam Makeba is the subject of Mika Kaurismaki's ''Mama Africa'' (Friday at 1:30 p.m.); Andrew Dosunmu's ''Restless City'' (Saturday at 9:30 p.m.) is the fictional tale of a young African immigrant in New York who dreams of returning home as a pop star. From Nigeria, Tunde Kelani's ''Maami'' (Monday at 8:45 p.m.) is the story of a single mother who raises her son to be a world-class soccer player. The writer-director Rachid Bouchareb (''Indigenes'') will be present Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. for a screening of his 2010 ''Outside the Law,'' about three brothers working for Algerian independence in the Paris of the 1950s. Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 975-5601, filmlinc.org; $13. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: Now the Playwrights and Artists Can Come Here

BYLINE: By REYHAN HARMANCI. 
rharmanci@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Walking into Berkeley Repertory Theater's rehearsal and office complex, on a nondescript street in West Berkeley, felt very different from the klieg lights of the company's downtown performance space.
The entrance to this 62,000-square-foot complex showed off a light-filled and spacious but unfinished main building. Tape outlined a square in a wall facing the door, furniture only half-filled some conference rooms, and the kitchen was devoid of appliances.
While many local theater companies have been forced to scale back because of economic pressures, Berkeley Rep is expanding. The new space will house the Ground Floor, an ambitious new project that aims to transform this 44-year-old theater company's new works program into an ''R&D facility'' and ''an incubator for theatrical start-ups.'' 
''We take very seriously that we're in the Bay Area, and we want to have some sort of synergy between us and that feeling of innovating, of pioneering that is Silicon Valley,'' said Madeleine Oldham, the project's energetic, tattooed artistic director.
Ground Floor's first initiative is the forthcoming Summer Lab. Beginning in July, Berkeley Rep will host more than 75 artists, playwrights, actors and musicians at the new site -- a month of communal dinners, workshops, rehearsals and experimentation, with overlapping residencies intended to encourage as much collaboration as possible.
Some, like Daniel LeFranc, whose play ''The Troublemaker, or The Freakin' Kick-A Adventures of Bradley Boatright'' is slated for the stage this fall, will be working alongside already commissioned works alongside artists with projects in earlier stages of development. More than 200 proposals vied for spots in the program. And a group of 20 writers, including Danny Hoch and Lynn Nottage, will be on hand for a four-day intensive residency. ''We're envisioning the Ground Floor as the umbrella for all of our new work activity,'' said Ms. Oldham. ''The Summer Lab is the sexy, big cornerstone, but year round, there will still be workshops happening.''
For audiences, who enjoy 9 to 10 plays every season on Berkeley Repertory's two downtown stages, the change will not be radical. The company has built a national reputation by helping develop work like ''Passing Strange'' and ''American Idiot'' as well as presenting marquee performers like Mikhail Baryshnikov. He will appear in a play, ''In Paris,'' starting April 25.
But for the artists who work with the company, the Ground Floor represents a sea change. Instead of Berkeley Rep staff members traveling to work with artists on commissioned works, Berkeley will become a self-contained hub of activity with housing, rehearsal spaces, even costuming on site. There will be more opportunities for both the staff and the public to see plays in progress, and Ms. Oldham plans to overhaul the new works program's Web presence.
''We didn't like that so much of our development work has been happening other places,'' Ms. Oldham said.
''And some ways, undercover,'' said Meghan Pressman, associate managing director.
Berkeley Rep certainly is not the only local organization throwing around tech-infused terms. San Francisco's Intersection for the Arts now operates out of the Hub, a technology and art space in downtown San Francisco, and has loudly championed its work with entrepreneurs of all stripes. But Berkeley Rep's new project is unusually large.
''We haven't been able to approach it that expansively before, to think of it as an incubator for risk-taking,'' Ms. Oldham said.
For many playwrights, the chance to collaborate with artists in the Berkeley Rep complex was extremely enticing.
''You don't always get the opportunity to have workshops on something that is not necessarily a commissioned project,'' said Heidi Stillman, a Chicago playwright and artistic director of new work at the Lookingglass Theater Company. She arrives in July to work on a piece inspired by Marguerite Duras.
''It's exciting to see what happens with the cross-pollination, being there with the other artists,'' Ms. Stillman said, adding that while other summer programs, like Sundance Institute's theater lab, exist, Berkeley Rep is refreshingly ''artist-focused.''
Many details about the Ground Floor are yet to be worked out, particularly how technology will mix with Berkeley Rep. Ms. Oldham said she wanted to find new ways of using technology to represent the work they do and introduce audiences to new playwrights. That will mean using social media not just as a marketing device but as a way to communicate about how Berkeley does what it does so well -- produce experimental new theater. But both Ms. Oldham and Ms. Pressman were surprised by many of the ideas they had seen so far by other theater companies -- for instance, creating a section for people who want to send Twitter messages during a performance or just start filming performances for online audiences.
''My goal for myself is to make the Web content as creative as the work that we do onstage,'' Ms. Oldham said. ''A lot of people put a camera on an artist and they just talk at it, and it's not actually very interesting. I'm hopeful that we can create something that is reflective of what these people are doing.''

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept. 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause of rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi 1707-1857' (through May 6) This exhibition covers the late reign of the rich and powerful Mughals, from whom we derive the word mogul, tracking their decline, which coincided with the rise of British rule in India. Wall texts describe imperial intrigue and violence, while paintings depict serene landscapes and interiors and exquisitely drawn courtly figures. There are British colonial patrons called ''White Mughals'' because they had Indian families and adopted local customs, and a final section in which the gruesome narrative told in the texts fuses with the images, in the medium of photography, in works like ''Zafar in Captivity,'' which shows the last Mughal emperor as a profoundly defeated man. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Juan Downey: The Invisible Architect' (through May 20) In the wilder moments of his career, Mr. Downey, who died of cancer in 1993 at 53 and is getting his first United States museum retrospective here, reversed the traditional dynamic of sculpture, examining how humans could affect objects rather than the other way around; administered oxygen to pedestrians on the street in New York in ''Fresh Air'' (1972); and cohabitated as a kind of gonzo anthropologist -- or early implementer of art as social practice -- with the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela. Central to his vision, which drew on Frederick Kubler, critical theory and hallucinogenic states of mind, Mr. Downey also developed a concept of ''invisible architecture,'' which he described in 1973 as ''an attitude of total communication within which ultra-developed minds will be telepathically cellular to an electromagnetic whole.'' 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Keith Haring: 1978-1982' (through July 8) Heavy on the party photographs and punk-to-New Wave soundtrack, this show repackages the mythic Haring -- club kid, Warhol protege and maker of friendly street art -- for a younger generation. But other Harings emerge in rarely seen early drawings, collages, journals and, especially, in short performative videos like ''Painting Myself Into a Corner'' and ''Tribute to Gloria Vanderbilt.'' 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Rachel Kneebone: Regarding Rodin' (through Aug. 12) Ms. Kneebone, a British artist, has been invited by the Brooklyn Museum to riff on Rodin and chose 15 works from the museum's permanent collection to show with her own porcelain sculptures. She is drawn to Rodin's maquettes, or the smaller models on which larger sculptures were based. Some works recall wedding cakes and Baroque or Rococo fountains. Chef d'oeuvre of the show, ''The Descent'' (2008), recalls Rodin's ''Gates of Hell'' and is comprised of dozens of little figures descending into a cauldron-shaped pit. That Ms. Kneebone's project is installed in the museum's Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art might suggest that you're going to get a feminist flogging of Rodin, but Ms. Kneebone does not head down that path. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (through April 22) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Frick Collection: 'Renoir, Impressionism and Full-Length Painting' (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick's mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed little girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (through April 29) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor-to-ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'John Chamberlain: Choices' (through May 13) The postwar sculptor John Chamberlain, who died in December, manipulated crushed car parts into abstract clusters that are both gorgeous and terrifying. As installed on the Guggenheim Museum's curved ramps for this full-dress retrospective, they look, inevitably, like mangled wrecks on a speedway. Yet the show goes to great lengths to extricate Mr. Chamberlain from what he called ''the car-crash syndrome.'' It includes work made from foam, aluminum foil, paper and plexiglass, and it emphasizes the collage process behind the metal sculptures rather than the material that went into them. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'Francesca Woodman' (through June 13) Francesca Woodman, the photographer who at 22 took her own life, in 1981, is as close to a true saint as the putatively secular world of contemporary art can claim. The dreamy, formally playful and disarmingly erotic pictures she made -- mostly of herself partly unclothed or naked -- project a self surrendering unreservedly to the spirit of art. Viewing this riveting survey of her sadly abbreviated career, it is hard to shake off the admittedly absurd notion that she was too pure an artist for this muddy world. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' (through May 6) Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed not as political activists, but as political heroes who fell into history by accident. The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether ''black or white, young or old, gay or straight.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared in New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion, the work of his competitors and peers, the evolution of tabloid journalism and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Japan Society: 'Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 1920-1945' (through June 10) This beautiful, surprising and sociologically intriguing exhibition reveals how Japanese artists, designers and craftsmen cultivated their own version of Art Deco, that excruciatingly suave style of art, design and decor that prevailed in Europe and America during the 1920s and '30s. The 200 paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glassware, jewelry, fashion and printed ephemera on display seamlessly blend East and West and old and new. You could almost believe it was the Japanese who invented Art Deco. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)
Jewish Museum: 'Kehinde Wiley / The World Stage: Israel' (through July 29) After earning a master of fine arts at Yale in 2001, Kehinde Wiley began exhibiting his large, figurative oil-on-canvas portraits of young black men in hip-hop apparel. With their emphasis on bright, acid colors and ghetto-fabulous outfits, the paintings borrowed heavily from the work of Barkley Hendricks, although Mr. Wiley's contribution was to push things in a more bombastic direction, hijacking the format of old master portraits. Mr. Wiley's work hasn't changed much over the last decade, although his scope has gone global. This exhibition, which focuses on Ethiopian Israeli Jews, is shown alongside historic paper cuts and textile works he selected from the museum's collection. The result is a fusion of Pattern and Decoration painting with figuration, a mash-up or sampling of historical styles and references. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Byzantium and Islam: Age of Transition' (through July 8) Concluding the Met's series of Byzantine art blockbusters, this show tells the story of the Byzantine Empire in the Eastern Mediterranean, from Syria through Egypt and across North Africa, as it made contact with (and lost ground to) the emerging Islamic world between the seventh and ninth centuries. Loans from Egypt could not be secured, because of the continuing turmoil of the Arab Spring, but important pieces from Jordan, Greece and Georgia are among the show's highlights. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Naked Before the Camera' (through Sept. 9) This resonant, illuminating if sometimes fraught exhibition traces the progress of the naked, mostly female body through photography from its early years nearly to the present with some 90 images, all owned by the Met. In works variously artistic, erotic, scientific, ethnographic, forensic and experimental, we see a medium stretched by human use and imagination. The male gaze is often relentless, but as time passes, individual faces, personalities and relationships come into focus on all sides; consciousness rises and oppressiveness decreases, which is a relief. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rembrandt and Degas: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' (through May 20) This lovely small show, focused on self-portrait paintings and prints, proposes that Rembrandt was a greater influence on Degas than has generally been recognized. Degas as a young man studied Rembrandt prints, copied at least one and made others imitating Rembrandt-type effects. But a group of four captivating self-portraits at the heart of the show -- two by each artist painted at age 23 -- suggests that the men were temperamentally about as alike as a cat and a dog. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rembrandt at Work: The Great Self-Portrait From Kenwood House' (through May 20) This late, magnificently plain-spoken self-portrait finds the artist in his studio, brush and palette in hand, contemplating his homely visage. Surrounded by, and generally overshadowing, several of the Met's own Rembrandts, it is among the high points of European painting, not the least for the pale background wall where two drawn circles echo, abstractly and much enlarged, the painter's intent gaze. Its emotional gravity and psychic complexity underscore why Rembrandt is often likened to Shakespeare in his epoch-changing grasp of human interiority. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Spies in the House of Art: Photography, Film, and Video' (through Aug. 26) This exhibition of 17 contemporary works inspired by museums doesn't mention Theodor Adorno by name, but it nods toward his ideas in a wall text, which jokes that artists often see museums as ''mausoleums, places where art goes to die.'' Andrea Fraser's video ''Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk'' (1989) leans toward the anti-museum view, while a 16mm film by Nashashibi/Skaer, the duo of British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, made by gliding through the Met in the dark with a camera and a flash strobe, treats the museum like a darkened crypt. Lutz Bacher's video offers another museum tour, while the museum appears in poetically distorted form in photographs by John Pilson, Tim Davis and Lothar Baumgarten. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso, and the Parisian Avant-Garde' (through June 3) Like the family it chronicles, this exhibition is fragmented and contentious, with flashes of brilliance. It explores the closely intertwined collections of the siblings Leo, Gertrude and Michael Stein (and Michael's wife, Sarah), casting these wealthy American expatriates as ahead-of-the-curve art patrons whose tastes and social networks shaped Modernism as we know it. And it shows Matisse and Picasso vying for the Steins' attention. Highlights include Matisse's Fauvist ''Woman With a Hat'' and, naturally, Picasso's proto-cubist portrait of Gertrude. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' -- five hand scrolls never before shown together -- is a must-see. And the show's second rotation of fragile treasures is every bit as good as the first, perhaps better, with even more in the way of radiant color and an added demon or two. Return visits are rewarded. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: 'Frances Stark: My Best Thing' (through April 30) ''My Best Thing,'' a 99-minute film that Los Angeles presented at the 2011 Venice Biennale, features digitally animated, childlike figures isolated on green-screen backgrounds. In computer-generated voices, they candidly converse about art, literature and sex to improbably engaging effect. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Dan Flavin: Drawing' (through July 1) Flavin (1933-96) is so closely identified with his signature medium, the fluorescent light sculpture, that a show of his drawings is bound to surprise. And it's particularly exciting to find that he was not only a devoted draftsman but also a freewheeling polymath on paper. The Morgan's show includes drawings from Flavin's personal collection, which encompasses Hokusai, Mondrian and the Hudson River School and will completely change the way you see his art. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression' (through May 6) The city's premier museum of Latin culture explores its holdings in urban folk art, so-called handicraft and other forms of vernacular expression and comes up with visual gold. Among the kaleidoscopic displays are Puerto Rican santos and the winsome cellophane animals, birds and insects of Gregorio Marzan (1906-97). Splendid textiles include Haitian voodoo banners; densely appliqued molas and the patchwork scenes called arpilleras, with which Chilean women kept hope alive for disappeared relatives during the regime of Augusto Pinochet. An intoxicating, if sometimes bittersweet, vitality is revealed. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Swept Away: Dust, Ashes, and Dirt in Contemporary Art and Design' (through Aug. 12) From the department of unsolicited advice for aspiring artists: avoid dust, dirt, ashes, soot, smoke, sand, mud and lint, especially if you want to make a statement about life, death, history and the ephemerality of it all. The dangers are well-illustrated in this 25-artist show. While formally various, almost every piece trades on stereotypical associations with the entropic end to which we all are destined. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Exquisite Corpses: Drawing and Disfiguration' (through July 9) This entertaining little show includes five products of the Surrealist parlor game ''exquisite corpse'' and rustles up other examples of distorted or disjointed figuration from MoMA's permanent collection. There's much here to amuse, provoke and titillate, though the curators don't include more performance-based forms of collaboration. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Print/Out' and 'Printin' ' (through May 14) ''Print/Out'' presents printed works by 40 artists and artist groups from the museum's permanent collection. Produced over the past two decades, most involve public modes of address borrowed from the worlds of advertizing and design and concepts promoting critical suspicion of mainstream media, culture and society. ''Printin','' a related print-focused exhibition, is full of surprises addressing multiple aspects of human experience. With fearless eclecticism, it ranges from a Krazy Kat cartoon by George Herriman to Puritan stocks cut from cardboard by Cady Noland. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-2 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Cindy Sherman' (through June 11) Aided by ever-shifting arrays of costumes, wigs, makeup, props, masks and prosthetic body parts, the leading light of postmodern photo-based art spent nearly four decades turning photography against itself, laying waste to a lexicon of mostly female stereotypes and exposing both the tyranny and the inner lives of the images of women that bombard and shape us all at every turn. This retrospective could have been larger, more clearly organized and less familiar, but its strengths, like the achievement it honors, are undeniable. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Cecil Beaton: The New York Years' (through April 22) A British dandy in the Wildean mold, Beaton photographed fashion for Vogue and Vanity Fair; made photographic portraits of rich, famous and glamorous people; drew and painted cartoons, caricatures, fashion illustrations and theatrical sets with a deft hand; published six volumes of his diaries; and won two Oscars for his costume and set designs, for the Hollywood movies ''Gigi'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' He spent much time in New York, and this entertaining exhibition surveys what he did here during his five-decade career. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'The Ungovernables: 2012 New Museum Triennial' (through April 22) The second edition of this survey of young talent, organized by Eungie Joo, is more international than the last one, with artists from Asia and South America and collectives from Africa and the Middle East. Much of the work is made up of small, light formal gestures, unemphatic in tone and socially engaged, though in an unperturbed way that accommodates friendliness and wit. There is also a schedule of performances on- and off-site. An Israeli collective, Public Movement, will stage topical debates around town. Yet another collective, House of Natural Fiber, from Indonesia, plans to demonstrate technology for producing alcoholic beverages and electronic music simultaneously. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Noguchi Museum: 'Civic Action: A Vision for Long Island City' (through April 22) Several artists suggest their visions for the future of Long Island City, ranging from site-specific to silly. Natalie Jeremijenko's ''feral robots'' sniff out pollutants in contaminated soil, and she suggests hula hoops filled with wildflower seeds. Rirkrit Tiravanija proposes growing ''drivable'' grass along a section of Broadway, and Mary Miss focuses on four giant smokestacks that tower over the area and imagines them as an eco-feedback center registering environmental changes visible to the community. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Whitney Biennial 2012' (through May 27) With remarkable clarity of vision, striking spatial intelligence and a generous stylistic inclusiveness, one of the best Whitney Biennials in recent memory confidently weaves together art objects and time-based art -- dance, theater and performance as well as film and video -- on a scale unprecedented in New York. So doing, this especially poetic incarnation also reinvents the museum's signature show and places future biennial curators in its debt, while offering the out-of-control, money-saturated art world a bit of redemption. Visit early and often. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Paul Graham: 'The Present' (through April 21) This latest series by the British photographer Paul Graham was shot entirely in high-traffic areas of Manhattan (Penn Station, Times Square and 125th Street, among others). Its 16 diptychs and 2 triptychs have a simple premise: They show two or three views of the same intersection, taken seconds apart and from more or less the same angle. People go out of focus or disappear entirely and are replaced by new pedestrians doing pretty much the same thing. Cabs speed by, cellphone conversations end, attentions are diverted and street photography is reinvented for an age of perpetual distraction. The Pace Gallery and Pace/MacGill, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, thepacegallery.com. (Rosenberg)
'Virginia Overton' (through May 6) Made from detritus scavenged from the Kitchen's basement, Ms. Overton's Post-Minimalist sculptures generate an air of excruciatingly sophisticated decorum. On a squarish wall, a single, 17-foot-long pipe reaches diagonally from one corner to its opposite. Wedged between opposite walls, a set of eight scuffed white pedestals seems to levitate. The floor of one room is entirely covered by two-by-four scraps. Viewing these works is like browsing through an issue of Artforum magazine from about 1970. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
'Giverny': E. V. Day and Kembra Pfahler (through April 24) Few have treated Monet's garden at Giverny as irreverently as the sculptor E. V. Day and the performance artist Kembra Pfaler, known for her signature look: naked body painted in lurid colors, dominatrix boots, Kiss-style makeup and giant mass of teased black hair. Here, Ms. Day's surreal photographs of Ms. Pfaler in costume posing against verdant backdrops at Giverny are displayed in an installation that replicates the garden in miniature, complete with grassy Astroturf, live flowers, gravel paths and a wooden bridge. The Hole Gallery, 312 Bowery, East Village, (212) 466-1100, theholenyc.com. (Johnson)
- 'The Brucennial 2012: Harderer. Betterer. Fasterer. Strongerer.' (through April 20) Organized by the collective of anonymous artists known as the Bruce High Quality Foundation, this jampacked, multifloor exhibition displays paintings, sculptures, videos and more by close to 400 artists. A radically inclusive survey of what artists in New York really are doing outside the filtering systems of galleries, museums and curators, it is by turns exhilarating, numbing and depressing. Don't miss it. 159 Bleecker Street, at Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, thebrucehighqualityfoundation.com. (Johnson)
Oded Hirsch: 'nothing new' (through April 22) In the mesmerizing video art of Oded Hirsch, who is now having his first solo exhibition in New York, the communal labors of the kibbutz become haunting performances. In the 10-minute ''50 Blue'' (2009), a young man struggles to push an older man in a wheelchair through a swampy landscape to an elevated viewing platform. And in ''Tochka'' (2010), men in blue shirts and white peasant hats cross a field and set to work on a mysterious construction project, which turns out to be a bridge to nowhere. Thierry Goldberg, 103 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 967-2260, thierrygoldberg.com. (Rosenberg)
Sam Moyer: 'Slack Tide' (through April 22) Sam Moyer's beguiling, expansive pictures oscillate astutely between the sublime and the decorative. Mounted on panels whose dimensions range from about 5 to 10 feet, they resemble much-enlarged, black-and-white, aerial photographs of mountainous topographies, possibly on another planet. They also are like giant, dark photocopies of profusely wrinkled bed sheets. But they are entirely made by hand. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com. (Johnson)
Frances Stark: 'Osservate, Leggete Con Me' (through April 21) Conversations about art, movies, literature, philosophy and sex, and expressions of excitement accompanying simultaneous masturbation -- all transcribed from Skype dialogues between Ms. Stark and anonymous Italian men -- are video projected in two separate rooms, as lines of text accompanied by music. Prepare to be teased. Gavin Brown, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, gavinbrown.biz. (Johnson)
Public Art
Josephine Meckseper: 'Manhattan Oil Project' (through May 6) Two pristine, full-size oil pumps seemingly toiling away in an empty lot of the theater district are intended to raise alarm about waste and the environment, but mainly they exemplify Surrealist cliche, highlight public sculpture's all-too frequent role as light entertainment and -- highlighted with red on black -- are presentable enough to appear on the Broadway stage, perhaps in an update of ''Oklahoma!'' Eighth Avenue, at 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 966-0193, artproductionfund.org. (Smith)
Out of Town
- 'Colorful Realm: Japanese Bird-and-Flower Paintings by Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800)' (through April 29) This miraculous exhibition presents for the first time outside of Japan all the pieces of a famous suite of scroll paintings that Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800) created for a monastery in Kyoto. Three representing enthroned Buddhist deities are comparatively dull, but the 30 depicting flowers, trees, birds, insects, seashells and much more are astoundingly beautiful. Formally virtuosic and magically realistic, they will leave you helplessly enchanted. National Gallery of Art, Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
Neuberger Museum of Art: 'American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942' (through April 29) This exhibition, organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Mass., reunites the Four Musketeers of New York painting: John Graham, Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis and Willem de Kooning. For a time -- the 1930s, give or take a few years -- these artists linked arms to defend modern American art against the dreariness and insularity of the Depression. One might see this show as an expansion of the first few galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's recent de Kooning retrospective, with their eerie still lifes and fidgety figure paintings that seemed to collapse abstraction and representation. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Rosenberg)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Zoe Strauss: Ten Years' (through April 22) In 2001 Ms. Strauss came up with an unusual idea for an exhibition. It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, ''I-95,'' is at the core of ''Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,'' an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Van Gogh Up Close' (through May 6) Nature both inspired van Gogh's extraordinary art and calmed his perpetually jangled nerves, and this modest yet groundbreaking show of 45 often small, unfamiliar canvases -- devoted almost entirely to landscapes -- examines his crucial connection to its bounty. The selection cuts a narrow, well-organized path through his art, examining the terrains he painted, the often close-up viewpoints he used and the shifting topographies of his paint textures, leading us to the fullness of his achievement along a fresh and eye-opening route. 26th Street at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Phillips Collection: 'Snapshot: Painters and Photography, Bonnard to Vuillard' (through May 6) The focus on Bonnard, Vuillard and a few other post-Impressionists -- among the earliest adopters of the hand-held camera -- brings some order to an unwieldy topic: the competitive relationship between painting and photography at the dawn of the 20th century. And throughout this exhibition's more than 200 photographs and 70 paintings, prints and drawings press us to think about our own fast-changing photographic culture. (You wonder what these artists would have done with Instagram.) 1600 21st Street NW, Washington, (202) 387-2151, phillipscollection.org. (Rosenberg)
Last Chance
'Approaching the Horizon: Important Japanese Prints From the Brewster Hanson Collection' (closes on Friday) Unfamiliar landscape prints by familiar names -- mainly Katsushika Hokusai and Utagawa Hiroshige -- dominate this lavish show, and their superb condition has kept the colors strikingly vivid. The grandly descriptive can turn grandly abstract on a dime, especially when Hokusai tackles waterfalls in vertical formats. Also noteworthy are the prints of his lesser-known contemporary Keisai Eisen, whose inclination to give tumbling water the solidity of nearby rocks has a bracing visionary force. Joan B. Mirviss, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 799-4021, mirviss.com. (Smith)
Sarah Charlesworth: 'Available Light' (closes on Saturday) Of all the 1980s Pictures artists, few have turned out to be as dedicated as Sarah Charlesworth to photography's traditional methods or to the notion of beauty in the purely contemplative, almost neo-Classical sense. This serene show sums up her breadth of vision with an impressive, almost narrative sequence of images that encompass and blur the boundaries among postmodern appropriation, pristine close-ups of the studio and semi-abstract still lifes that meditate on optics and the glories of light and form. Susan Inglett, 522 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-9111, inglettgallery.com. (Smith)
'Haitian Masters: 1950-1980s' (closes on Saturday) The astounding work of Bourmond Byron, Wesner La Forest, Peterson Laurent and Odilon Pierre confirms once more the extraordinary achievement of 20th-century Haitian painting, while elucidating the overheated mixture of everyday life, voodoo faith, incessant turmoil and Edenic nature basic to its fervent plasticity. It is as rare to see these artists' efforts in such quantity as it is frustrating to continue to wonder when they will be accorded a place in the history of mainstream modernism. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6565, edwardthorpgallery.com. (Smith)
'Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones' (closing on Sunday) This wide-ranging survey was assembled by one of the leading milliners in Britain and draws heavily on the incomparable collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It includes fascinating historical material; a survey of 20th- and 21st-century headgear at its most creative (and often most frivolous); and rather too many efforts by the show's organizer. But what's good is great: for example, a platterlike feather number from 18th-century London. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
Thomas Kovachevich: 'Alpenglow' (closes on Sunday) Named for the glowing skies that accrue near mountains because of extremes of temperature and humidity, this show is dominated by three large striped wall pieces made of nothing but white packing tape and brightly colored grosgrain ribbon. They implicate the gallery space by adjusting noticeably to prevailing climatic conditions: the tape curls or uncurls, and that makes all the difference. Rarely has the divide between Minimalism and Post-Minimalism -- or Donald Judd and John Cage -- been finessed with such elegance and economy. Showroom 170, 170 Suffolk Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (646) 559-2856, showroom170.com. (Smith)
- Ryan McNamara: 'Still' (closes on Saturday) This resourceful performance artist, who is aided by an array of backdrops, costumes, props, materials and whatever ideas spring to anyone's mind, shows the environmental artwork that he wrought earlier in the exhibition by culling images from the photo sessions and decoupaging them, downsized and tinted, to whatever strikes his fancy. Elizabeth Dee Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-7545, now.elizabethdee.com. (Smith)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Art in an Age of Revolution: Fu Baoshi (1904-1965)' (closes on Sunday) Serene on the surface but less so underneath, the museum's first full-dress retrospective of a 20th-century Chinese painter is as much about history as art history. It focuses on an artist, teacher and art historian who helped preserve the ancient tradition of ink painting and then struggled to make it relevant under the Communists, bending it toward propaganda, introducing a new degree of realism and making frequent use of the color red. While fascinating, the show leaves you wondering what he might have accomplished under less encumbered circumstances. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Catherine Opie: 'High School Football' (closes on Saturday) In her latest series, ''High School Football,'' the photographer Catherine Opie doesn't seem to know what to do with this all-American, uber-masculine subject. Taken all over the country, her images run the gamut from action shots, to sentimental ''Friday Night Lights''-style views of the field and bleachers, to landscapes in which the game seems incidental. There are portraits of warrior-faced young men in their team uniforms, too, which turn out to be a pretty effective defense against emotional candor. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Rosenberg)
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts: 'Henry Ossawa Tanner: Modern Spirit' (closes on Sunday) Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937) was the first African-American artist to achieve international fame in modern times. After permanently expatriating to France in 1891, he found success as a painter of luminous pictures of biblical subjects. In this informative survey of his career, one piece stands out: an Annunciation in which the angel Gabriel appears to Mary as a burst of yellow light. It is a painting of amazing grace. 118 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, (215) 972-7600, pafa.org. (Johnson)
- 'Silver and Gold in Ancient China' (closes on Saturday) Ranging from a first-century B.C. silver harness ornament depicting a winged stallion to bevies of gold hair ornaments depicting dragons, birds and flowers from the 10th to 14th centuries (Liao, Northern Song and Song dynasties), this exhibition provides a rare in-depth at ceremonial and luxury objects. Forms, purposes, techniques and surface decoration vary tremendously and to illuminating effect. Standouts include a chased silver Liao dynasty funeral mask and a Song pictorial dish engraved with a marvelous landscape scene of scholars drifting in a boat. Instructive pleasures abound. J. J. Lally & Co. Oriental Art, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 371-3380, jjlally.com. (Smith)
Swiss Institute Contemporary Art: 'Heart to Hand' (closes on Sunday) Organized by the curator, art-restitution lawyer and salon hostess Pati Hertling, this group show was ''conceived of in the wake of the #occupywallstreet movement and the Republican primaries,'' the news release says. Its themes of struggle and resistance play out on the level of process, as in an ambitious architectural intervention by Oscar Tuazon and Elias Hansen and in Klara Liden's overhead shot of a graffiti-etched picnic table. 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, swissinstitute.net. (Rosenberg)
- Terry Winters: 'Cricket Music, Tessellation Figures, & Notebook' (closes on Saturday) Mr. Winters's new, vigorously painted abstractions are ravishing. As if to defend against anti-hedonist judgment, he also offers a series of notebook collages combining scientific and quasi-scientific imagery in Matthew Marks's small exhibition space at 502 West 22nd Street. They are interesting, but the paintings of flickering, warping, spiraling and tunneling diamond patterns in hot and cool colors are the real trip. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 and 502 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Johnson)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2012': (through May 27) With remarkable clarity of vision, striking spatial intelligence and a generous stylistic inclusiveness, one of the best Whitney Biennials in recent memory confidently weaves together art objects and time-based art -- dance, theater and performance, as well as film and video, like Werner Herzog's ''Hearsay of the Soul'' (2012) -- on a scale unprecedented in New York. So doing, this especially poetic incarnation also reinvents the museum's signature show and places future biennial curators in its debt, while offering the out-of-control, money-saturated art world a bit of redemption. Visit early and often. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Roberta Smith) (PHOTOGRAPH BY LIBRADO ROMERO/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (C15)

HEADLINE: There's Sex, There's the City, But No Manolos

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The new HBO series ''Girls'' slips in a wry acknowledgement of ''Sex and the City,'' and that tribute -- a character describes herself as a Carrie with a touch of Samantha -- is gracious but not entirely necessary.
Lena Dunham's much anticipated comedy about four single women in New York, which starts on Sunday night, is worth all the fuss, even though it invites comparisons to Carrie Bradshaw and friends, and even though it incites a lot of dreary debate about the demise of feminism. There are obvious parallels between ''Girls'' and that earlier HBO series, but the theme of female friendship and romantic disappointment stretches back long before, all the way to the early 1940s and Mary McCarthy's first novel, ''The Company She Keeps.''
One reason that ''Girls'' is unsettling is that it is an acerbic, deadpan reminder that human nature doesn't change. There was a lot of sex in the '60s, but not much sexual revolution. For all the talk of equality, sexual liberation and independence, the love lives of these young women are not much more satisfying than those of their grandmothers. Their professional expectations are, if anything, even lower.
And that is the baseline joke of ''Girls.'' 
''Sex and the City'' served up romantic failure wrapped in the trappings of success. ''Girls'' offers romantic failure wrapped in the trappings of failure.
The economy fluctuates, neighborhoods blossom or decay, but men never cease to disappoint. ''Sex and the City,'' which began in 1998, when its heroines were already in their 30s, placed boy trouble in a satiny frame of glamour, cocktails and pricey real estate. On ''Girls,'' the women are in their 20s, and boy trouble comes with cramped apartments, S.T.D.'s and dead-end volunteer jobs.
Ms. Dunham's character, Hannah, a 24-year-old would-be writer and unpaid intern, tells her parents she may be ''the voice'' of her generation. But her voice, or at least the part that complains about men, speaks for pretty much every epoch since the battle of the sexes began.
And Ms. Dunham, who made her reputation with an independent, highly autobiographical movie, ''Tiny Furniture,'' makes great comedy out of her own shortcomings. Her sense of humor is sardonic and unsentimental enough to appeal to men, which helps explain why Judd Apatow is an executive producer.
''Girls'' has none of the cheeriness -- and forced punch lines -- of ''2 Broke Girls'' or ''Whitney.'' Hannah is not a heroine fit for network television. She is plain, unshapely and unpleasant in ways that are only occasionally endearing. She's a parasite sponging off her parents and a forgetful and sometimes unreliable friend. Her liaison with Adam (Adam Driver), an out-of-work actor, is debasing.
Adam lets her visit his apartment for sexual gratification -- his own -- and ignores her desires; most of his sexual fantasies seem borrowed from video games and porn videos. He is just as callous about her feelings, grabbing her stomach rolls and asking why she doesn't lose weight.
Those sex scenes are shocking not because they are graphic, though they are, but because the sex is so unsexy: they are as clinical and coldly funny as the seduction scene of Dottie in McCarthy's novel ''The Group.''
Low expectations can skip a generation. Carrie, Samantha and the others in ''Sex and the City'' had a hard time finding true love, but they expected fulfilling careers, summer shares in the Hamptons and sexual satisfaction from their partners. Hannah is far less ambitious.
Even those who have more going for them feel let down. Marnie (Allison Williams), Hannah's best friend and roommate, has a job, albeit as a lowly art gallery receptionist, and she has Charlie (Christopher Abbott), a doting, longtime boyfriend who is so eager to please her that she finds him repellent.
Jessa (Jemima Kirke) is a glamorous British world traveler with bohemian flair, even though she is actually a baby sitter who in New York mooches off her younger American cousin. Jessa is a sexual free spirit but not particularly joyful. She is also comically wrong about almost everything, including career advice. She urges Hannah to coax more money out of her parents by saying that she is an artist.
''Tell them you'll get tuberculosis in a garret, if you have to; it's what Flaubert did.'' (That too is a joke on Jessa: Flaubert famously advised artists to be ''regular and orderly in your life like a bourgeois.'')
Jessa's cousin Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) is just as funny as the opposite type: an overly eager college student who is in awe of her glamorous cousin, talks a mile a minute and mostly worries about her inexperience.
Not all the characters see themselves clearly, but Ms. Dunham's writing is keenly self-aware. The actresses playing these true-to-life Gen Y losers are unusually privileged in real life. Ms. Williams is the daughter of the NBC anchor Brian Williams; Ms. Mamet's father is the playwright David Mamet; Ms. Kirke's father plays drums in the rock band Bad Company; and Ms. Dunham's parents are successful artists.
Ms. Dunham's fictional cohort is more ordinary and middle class, but that generation's sense of entitlement -- and pass/fail work ethic -- is still gently mocked. When Hannah moans that she is so poor that she can only last in New York another three and a half days, ''seven if I don't eat lunch,'' one of her friends, who owes $50,000 in college loans, says angrily, ''This is like watching 'Clueless.' ''
The depiction of slacker life in New York, which includes tattoos, drugs, casual sex and abortions, is presented with wry humor, but it could easily be interpreted as a cautionary tale written by the religious right: the lifestyles of these modern women, untethered to responsibility, faith or morality, are parables that could scare Amish youth away from Rumspringa and wayward Mormons back into their temple garments.
Actually, of course, there is a romance to misery, and ''Girls'' is a step ahead of that too. Marnie is asked if she ever saw the musical ''Rent.''
''Please, I saw it like 12 times,'' Marnie replies. ''It's basically why I moved to New York.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Media Fight Scandal Fallout; Focus on Bo's Family

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and KEITH BRADSHER; Michael Wines reported from Beijing and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong. Li Bibo contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Chinese officials rapidly intensified a propaganda campaign to paper over a leadership split in the Communist Party on Thursday as the first hints began to emerge of the wealth and influence amassed by relatives of a deposed Politburo member, Bo Xilai.
The burst of coverage was remarkable for its intensity and focused message, even for a propaganda apparatus that regularly sings the party's praises, analysts said, reflecting deep concern that Mr. Bo's removal and the murder investigation aimed at him and his wife would deepen a now evident split between the Communist left and the more moderate right wing. 
The two-day blitz of articles and television segments included an unusual television national news segment in which a series of local leaders proclaimed their support for the party. Newspapers and Web sites recounted declarations of unanimous support for the party's Central Committee from a congress of local party officials in Chongqing, Mr. Bo's former domain.
The state news media also gave extensive coverage to anticorruption efforts in the Chinese military, including an exhortation by President Hu Jintao to maintain purity in the military ranks.
''The way they're using the news media over the last 48 hours really projects a sense of deep insecurity,'' said one analyst, said David Bandurski, at the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong.
''When you have to drum home the point of unity this hard,'' he added, ''it conveys the opposite message.''
But another scholar of the leadership, Dorothy J. Solinger of the University of California at Irvine, suggested that party officials more likely are transmitting an order for underlings to fall in line and support the dismantling of Mr. Bo's political machine.
One driving factor in the leadership split is economic policy. Mr. Bo and his supporters favored a large government role in guiding the economy, while many senior leaders want further, accelerated relaxation of state controls.
Mr. Bo's own financial network has become a target in the propaganda campaign. An article on Wednesday in People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, that on its face discussed the party's fight against corruption, appeared to lay out a list of potential charges that could be brought against Mr. Bo. ''Some people'' have secretly gained dual citizenship and foreign identities, the article said, transferred money and goods overseas, and used relatives, friends and mistresses to conceal their wealth.
On Thursday, a Hong Kong newspaper, Apple Daily, disclosed myriad details of Bo family dealings in line with those criticisms. His older brother, Bo Xiyong, has for nine years served under an assumed name as executive director and deputy general manager of China Everbright Holdings, a state-owned company that controls one of China's major banks and an array of other businesses.
Under the name Li Xueming, Bo Xiyong receives a $1.7 million annual salary and holds stock options worth nearly $25 million by also holding the position of vice chairman in one of the state company's series of Hong Kong-traded subsidiaries, China Everbright International, according to a profile maintained by Bloomberg Businessweek. Until May 31 he also was deputy chairman of Hong Kong Construction Limited, a Chinese property developer.
Senior Communist Party officials are known to frequently secure lucrative jobs in state-owned companies for family members and relatives, often through connections. Mr. Bo's ties to Everbright, first published by Apple Daily, were also described by a person familiar with the company who refused to be named because of the political sensitivity of the issue.
Two women the newspaper described as sisters of Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, also show up in Hong Kong corporate records. A check of the records on Thursday showed that Gu Wangjiang has been a director of eight privately held companies in Hong Kong and that Gu Wangning has also been a director of one of these companies, Hangang Worldwide Ltd. Neither Gu Wangjiang, Gu Wangning nor Bo Xiyong could be reached for comment.
Mr. Bo once aspired to join the Politburo's Standing Committee, the nine-member body that effectively runs China, when a once-in-a-decade turnover of the leadership takes place this year. The authorities had been almost obsessed with demonstrating that the nation's top leaders were in total agreement in advance of that handoff, to minimize rumors of infighting over the composition of the next generation of rulers.
But that facade broke in February, when a top aide who had fallen out with Mr. Bo fled to an American consulate and told diplomats that Mr. Bo's wife had a falling out with a British businessman and onetime family friend and was implicated in his murder. That man, Neil Heywood, was found dead in November in Chongqing, the southwestern city-state where Mr. Bo was party secretary.
Attention to the case skyrocketed this week, as party leaders announced Tuesday that Mr. Bo had been suspended from the 25-member Politburo and that his wife would be investigated in connection with Mr. Heywood's death.

HEADLINE: How to Tell if the Iran Talks Are Working

BYLINE: By MARK HIBBS, ARIEL LEVITE and GEORGE PERKOVICH. 
Mark Hibbs and Ariel Levite are senior associates of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Nuclear Policy Program, which George Perkovich directs.

 BODY:
AFTER a hiatus of more than a year, negotiations about Iran's nuclear program are set to resume in Turkey on Friday between Iran and France, Germany, Britain, Russia, China and the United States. Though the participants foresee several rounds of discussions, all will be acutely aware that time to reach agreement peacefully may be running out.
So it is important to ask, at the start, how we will be able to tell whether the talks are moving forward. 
Though talks that have taken place since 2004 have produced no real progress, recent developments suggest some grounds for cautious optimism. Sanctions are hurting Iran, and even tougher ones are expected to go into effect July 1. President Obama and other American officials have repeatedly warned Iran in recent weeks that the window for diplomacy is closing. Israel's patience for a meaningful outcome from diplomacy is running thin. Iranian leaders presumably recognize that the likelihood of military action would be higher than ever if negotiations collapsed or began to stretch out aimlessly.
In addition, there are some indications that Iran's attitude may have become more flexible. Iran still insists that its nuclear program is intended for peaceful use, and that it will not compromise on its right to enrich uranium. It continues to rebuff the International Atomic Energy Agency's demands for greater cooperation, while threatening retaliation for sanctions imposed on it. But its leaders may be creating room for compromise. Iran sought the new negotiating round. It has done so in the past under severe pressure, only to step away from real compromise; but this time the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has twice reiterated his fatwa prohibiting acquisition of nuclear weapons. And some of his recent moves suggest that he is maneuvering to build a domestic political base of support for a possible deal over the nuclear program.
Still, tough and protracted negotiations undoubtedly lie ahead. Iran may never surrender some key elements of the hardware or material related to a bomb-making capacity, and its basic knowledge in this domain cannot be unlearned. At another level, any deal with the United States might ultimately run counter to preserving the clerical regime, for which opposition to America has long been a core political attitude. The United States, for its part, would be reluctant to let Iran leave the negotiations with a deal that left its nuclear option viable, bolstered the regime internally, and reinforced its regional influence and ambitions to the detriment of America's allies.
In addition, the two sides distrust each other deeply, and their negotiating styles differ fundamentally. The Americans doubt that the Iranians ultimately can ''deliver'' on any deal, and Iran's leadership has similar doubts about President Obama's capacity to deliver in an election year.
Given these complexities, it won't be easy to assess the progress of the coming talks. But we can suggest benchmarks:
Oil prices: The oil market is exceptionally sensitive to the possibility of a military escalation in the Persian gulf; the traders who set prices tend to be sophisticated, with sources of information among policy makers. Global oil prices, which have been above $100 a barrel all this year, are widely believed to reflect a risk premium of $20 to $25. Any significant decline in that premium following the new negotiation round would reflect optimism about the course of diplomacy. It would also further weaken Iran's economy -- putting even more pressure on Iran to negotiate seriously -- while helping distressed Western economies and helping President Obama's chances of re-election.
Access for verifiers: One urgent concession required of Iran is that it grant the International Atomic Energy Agency far greater access to its nuclear plans, facilities, records and personnel. In the absence of this, most other steps would ring hollow, making it unlikely that sanctions on Iran would be phased out -- a goal high on Iran's list of demands. Since time would be needed to test Iran's sincerity about disclosures, and its cooperation with the atomic energy agency after years of delay and deceit, Iran's willingness to undertake such steps early on would both be a prerequisite for, and a signal of, progress on the negotiations.
The bargaining issues: If the focus of talks remains stuck on an attempt to resurrect an earlier deal to trade a foreign supply of nuclear fuel for Iran's agreement to ship its existing stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country, the diplomatic process will be headed in the wrong direction. Such a deal would fall short of what Iran and its counterparts across the table need in order to end the crisis. Anything less than early Iranian gestures on suspending higher levels of enrichment and conducting enrichment outside its commercial facility at Natanz would most likely doom the negotiations to failure. So would a refusal by the other side to suspend the implementation of new sanctions if Iran extended such gestures.
U.S.-Iran dialogue: In earlier rounds, Iran usually resisted conducting parallel direct discussions with the United States on the margins of the six-party talks. Yet such one-on-one dialogue is essential for success. Iranian willingness to relax its position, and American willingness to sustain bilateral dialogue in an election year, could indicate a prospect of resolving the nuclear crisis.
Frequency and duration of meetings: Previous unproductive negotiating rounds have been truncated and followed by long pauses. Such pacing would be inconsistent with the urgency of this round. Anything but frequent and prolonged negotiating rounds (though some might be unpublicized or employ back channels) would indicate that the negotiations were headed for failure.
A summer deadline: Sorting out all the issues associated with Iran's nuclear program, let alone other issues that include Afghanistan, Iraq, support for terrorism and human rights, would take a long time. But in the absence of visible progress by the end of June, new sanctions will go into effect, making it even more painful for Iran to negotiate under pressure. Israel would be likely to conclude, in such a case, that the only option left was military. Diplomacy, in other words, has 11 weeks to yield results. Still, it is not unrealistic to think that most of the criteria described here could be met in the first round of renewed diplomacy -- if Iran and its counterparts are determined to move from crisis to problem-solving.
Much more work would remain to be done, but the momentum toward war and economic hardship could at the very least be suspended.

HEADLINE: Trade, Energy and Drugs Are Topics for Obama at Summit of the Americas

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Friday heads to Latin America for the third time for a summit meeting whose very location -- Colombia -- reflects the broader economic and security gains in the hemisphere.
Mr. Obama will spend the weekend in Colombia's coastal city of Cartagena at the Summit of the Americas for discussions with other leaders on trade, energy and that constant, drug trafficking. In contrast with the previous gathering three years ago, when the global economic crisis forced the leaders to focus simply on weathering the downturn, the changed agenda and mood for this gathering is summed up by its name -- ''Connecting the Americas: Partners for Prosperity.''
The president will be navigating several controversial areas. Some leaders want to legalize currently illicit drugs; the United States is routinely pressed to end its half-century-old embargo against Cuba; and American unions continue to criticize Colombia's labor-rights record. But none of those issues is seen as likely to overshadow the meeting. 
''The best of the summit, what it provides, is an opportunity for the heads of state from all the countries in the hemisphere, almost all of them, to come together and have a moment -- a forced moment -- to talk,'' said Shannon K. O'Neil, a Latin American studies fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. And on energy, commerce and infrastructure projects, she added, ''You could see movement forward'' that will not necessarily be reflected in the press releases.
For the most part, the tension over Cuba seems mostly to be behind Mr. Obama -- a not insignificant consideration in a presidential election year in which Florida, the bastion of anti-Castro sentiment, could be a critical swing state. Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, announced earlier this month that he would boycott the meeting in Colombia because Cuba, as usual, was not invited, but he failed to persuade other leftist leaders in the region to do the same. And Raul Castro, who succeeded his brother Fidel as Cuba's leader, said he did not want to attend anyway, sparing Mr. Obama the prospect of any photo opportunities with a Castro.
''We look forward to the day when a democratic Cuba rejoins the inter-American system,'' said Dan Restrepo, the top White House adviser for Latin American policy. ''Unfortunately,'' he added, ''Cuban authorities haven't decided to go down that path. Instead you see, even with Pope Benedict in Cuba a couple weeks ago, the Cubans insisted publicly that theirs will remain a one-party state.''
Julia E. Sweig, director of Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, all but dismissed the potential for spats over the United States' policies. ''It's a perennial issue that any White House will continue to have to contend with'' until Communist Cuba democratizes, she said.
Drugs may be more of a problem. Most leaders in the region believe the United States-led war on drugs has failed. It has neither controlled supply, by reducing the ranks of drug lords and smugglers, nor cut demand, by changing consumer habits at home.
Demand has also risen sharply in Brazil. The host of the summit meeting, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, has put on the table the general topic of an alternative policy.
The president of Guatemala, Otto Perez Molina, has led the call for decriminalization of narcotics, a proposal that is certain to be discussed.
''U.S. policy on this is very clear,'' Mr. Restrepo said. ''The president doesn't support decriminalization. He does think this is a legitimate debate and it's a debate that we welcome having because it helps demystify this as an option.''
Mr. Obama will emphasize the financing increases that the administration has won for drug treatment and prevention in the United States, responding to the sense that the country needs to do more to curtail demand. Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, at the White House on Monday for a meeting with Mr. Obama, said, ''As I have consistently mentioned, I believe that when it comes to drug trafficking, we have to take a hard stance in fighting drug trafficking while addressing those that have fallen prey.''
The president's focus will be on free trade throughout the Western Hemisphere, aides said, in keeping with his pledge to double American exports.
According to the administration, more than 40 percent of the nation's exports are to the Americas, including Canada, and the traffic is growing faster than trade elsewhere.
Trade pacts with Colombia and Panama took effect late last year, but the Colombia agreement remains controversial with Mr. Obama's union allies.
The president of the AFL-CIO, Richard L. Trumka, wrote to Mr. Obama last week warning him not to certify that Colombia has complied with a side agreement requiring that nation to do more to stop the decades-long killings of labor leaders there.
On his way to Colombia, Mr. Obama will stop in Tampa, Fla., whose port handles a significant amount of trade with southern neighbors.
He will then go to Cartagena for dinner with other leaders before two days of talks.
Colombia is an appropriate venue, administration officials said, given that it has overcome years of drug-related chaos and civil war to become what Benjamin J. Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, called ''a tremendous success story in the Americas.''
''The attention of the United States is often focused on trouble spots,'' like Afghanistan, Mr. Rhodes said. But, he added, ''There is a unique quality to the relationship with the Americas,'' given that so many Americans trace their heritage there.

HEADLINE: Gov. Christie and the Tunnel Project

 BODY:
If you find yourself in a stopped train in a Hudson River tunnel, or in a vehicle on a choked highway, in coming years, at least you will know why. In his drive to become the darling of the cut-costs-at-all-costs Republican crowd, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey ignored real economic analysis and relied on exaggerated worst-case scenarios to kill the largest public transit project in the nation in 2010. 
The project, two new rail passages under the Hudson River, would have vastly improved the region's economy, the environment and the lives of millions of commuters. The federal government and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were providing most of the $10 billion needed to build the tunnels. But Mr. Christie said they were going to cost a lot more than that and that New Jersey would be on ''a never-ending hook.''
Now, a report from the Government Accountability Office makes it clear that the cost-cutting talk was political bluster. Mr. Christie estimated that the project could cost more than $14 billion, of which New Jersey would have had to pay 70 percent if you counted federal stimulus dollars and Port Authority money. The report said later federal estimates ranged from $9.8 billion to $12.4 billion and that the state's real share was 14.4 percent. The benefits would have been huge. Today, traffic moves under the Hudson River through two 100-year-old tunnels that are nearly at capacity at peak travel times. With projections that transit demands in this area will increase 38 percent by 2030, the new tunnels would have allowed twice as many trains during rush hour, 48 per hour instead of 23.
The report, which Mr. Christie continues to dispute, cited estimates that home values and tax revenues would have risen, and that the construction would have added $9 billion to the regional economy. But Mr. Christie wanted to use the tunnel money to avoid adding a few cents to the state's gasoline tax, the nation's second lowest. He was thinking about his career, not his constituents.

HEADLINE: Obamas and Bidens To Release Tax Returns

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Punctuating a week of political assaults on Mitt Romney over taxes, President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. plan to release their own income tax returns on Friday, along with a statement calling on Mr. Romney to do the same, according to an Obama campaign official.
The release of the returns, four days ahead of the Internal Revenue Service's tax deadline for the public, will set the stage for another week of wrangling over taxes, with the Senate scheduled on Monday evening to take up the White House's proposed ''Buffett Rule'' minimum tax for the wealthiest Americans. 
It comes after days of attacks on Mr. Romney -- by the Obama campaign for not releasing tax records for more years, and by Mr. Biden in a campaign speech in New Hampshire on Thursday, for what the vice president said was Mr. Romney's siding with fellow Republicans against taxes on millionaires.
''If Governor Romney has his way, we'll have the Romney Rule,'' Mr. Biden said. ''The Romney Rule says, 'Let's double down on tax cuts for the wealthy.' '' Later, Mr. Biden expressed incredulity that Mr. Romney would label the president ''out of touch,'' asking the audience, ''How many of you all have a Swiss bank account?''
While Mr. Obama has long acknowledged being in the nation's high-income echelon, thanks largely to sales of his best-selling books, he and his wife, Michelle, have paid an effective federal tax rate nearly twice that of Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, according to tax returns released by both couples.
The Obama campaign will post the 2011 tax return for the Obamas, as well as those dating back to 2000, on the campaign's Web site, an official said. It will also post tax returns for Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill.
In January, under intense pressure from his Republican rivals, Mr. Romney released his tax return for 2010, plus an estimate of his tax payment in 2011. But he has not released returns from earlier years, when he was governor of Massachusetts or a financial executive at Bain Capital.
The Obama campaign has seized on that to argue that Mr. Romney is defying well-established tradition among presumptive presidential nominees. Former President George W. Bush, the campaign noted, released 17 years of tax returns in his political career. Mr. Romney's father, George Romney, a Republican candidate in the 1968 election, released 12 years of tax returns -- unprecedented at the time.
Noting that Mitt Romney turned over tax returns for 23 years to the campaign of Senator John McCain when Mr. McCain was considering him as a vice-presidential running mate in 2008, Obama campaign advisers have argued that Mr. Romney should demonstrate the same openness with the public now.
''Governor Romney has asked Americans to elect him based on his tenure as a corporate buyout specialist,'' the Obama campaign's spokesman, Ben LaBolt, said in a statement, ''but he refuses to share his tax returns from that period, which could help answer questions like, 'Did he exploit loopholes in the tax code by keeping his investments off-shore? Why did he open a Swiss bank account and establish a corporation in Bermuda?' ''
The 547 pages of tax documents released by the Romneys -- including returns for their charitable foundation and trusts established for their children -- showed that the couple was expected to pay roughly $6.2 million on $42.5 million of income over the two years, with effective tax rates of 13.9 percent for 2010 and an estimated 15.4 percent for 2011.
In 2010, the Obamas paid $453,770 in federal taxes, on an adjusted gross income of $1,728,096, for an effective tax rate of just over 26 percent. Their income fell from $5.5 million in 2009.
In January, Mr. Romney explained his reluctance to release tax returns before he won the nomination, saying, ''Every time we release things drip by drip the Democrats go out with another array of attacks.'' On Thursday, his spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said the attacks by Mr. Biden and other administration officials showed they are ''desperate to avoid talking about his failed economic record, which is why they create sideshows to distract people from what really matters.''
Asked Thursday if Mr. Romney had plans to release his returns, an aide said, ''I can't give you any guidance on when they will be released, but I can let you know that in previous years, Mitt Romney has sought an extension.''

HEADLINE: Slow First Quarter in China, But Recent Signs of Growth

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
China's economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of this year, but recent efforts by policy makers to jump-start its economy, the world's second largest, appear to be already bearing fruit, with industrial and retail activity both rising during March, new data released on Friday showed.
The economy expanded 8.1 percent compared to a year earlier, significantly slower than previous quarters, and a sharp cooldown from the double-digit expansion seen in much of the last decade. 
That was markedly below analysts' expectations for an increase of 8.4 percent. It underlined the problems that China faces on two fronts. Domestically, demand has weakened, and the all-important construction sector has slowed, in large part because of government efforts to curtail breakneck expansion last year. At the same time, overseas demand for Chinese goods has weakened as consumers in the United States and Europe remain deeply worried about job prospects in their home countries.
This has slowed expansion to the weakest level in 11 quarters, the G.D.P. data showed.
However, the rate of expansion from the fourth quarter of last year was healthier than expected: quarter-on-quarter growth -- which many analysts focus on because it gives a clearer sense of the economy's recent performance than the year-on-year comparison -- came in at 1.8 percent, topping expectations for an increase of just 1.6 percent.
At the same time, a flurry of statistics for March has looked more positive. Many analysts say that, with the government again tapping the gas pedal, the economy will avoid an all-out crash.
''Green shoots have sprung up in many sectors, convincing us that the current slowdown looks more and more like a slow consolidation, rather than a precipitous downturn like we saw in 2008-09,'' Xianfang Ren, a China analyst at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, wrote in a research note.
Retail sales data for March, also released on Friday, showed a gain of 15.2 percent compared to March 2011, while industrial activity rose 11.9 percent. Both figures marked slight accelerations from February, and both modestly topped analysts' forecasts.
Earlier in the week, trade data showed that import growth remaining muted but exports regaining some strength.
And on Thursday, the central bank announced that Chinese banks issued just over 1 trillion renminbi ($160 billion) in new loans in March, well above what analysts had expected.
The lending surge ''is a strong piece of evidence that the People's Bank of China is quietly but unequivocally relaxing credit quotas behind the scene,'' Yao Wei, an economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, wrote in a research note.
The first quarter ''might turn out to be the weakest quarter for China in the current down cycle, as signs of stabilization have already emerged on both domestic and external demand sides since the end of the Chinese New Year Holiday,'' Ms. Ren of IHS wrote.
The authorities are likely to continue supporting growth through a series of relatively low-key stimulus measures. Over the last few months, these have included lowering so-called reserve-requirement ratios for banks -- a step that effectively frees more room for lenders to extend loans.
''We expect the authorities to continue with current policies of easing financing conditions and completing ongoing projects, especially those in the railway, water transfer and power sectors. The authorities are also supporting mortgage lending and the construction of small- and medium-sized apartments, mainly for first-time home buyers,'' economists at Barclays in Hong Kong wrote.
They added: ''We do not think policy makers will cut interest rates or announce another big stimulus package. It is important to remember that somewhat slower growth is the intended result of policies designed to promote economic restructuring and rebalancing.''

HEADLINE: Collision Over Roles of Women Sets Off Combative Debate Along the Trail

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
The campaign for the White House spilled into the politics of motherhood on Thursday as a combative back-and-forth involving a Democratic strategist and Mitt Romney's wife quickly revived a deeper, decades-old cultural debate about the roles of women in and out of the workplace.
The strategist, Hilary Rosen, who has some ties to President Obama, apologized Thursday afternoon to Ann Romney, a stay-at-home mother of five, after setting off a firestorm on Twitter and cable news programs by saying that Mrs. Romney had ''never worked a day in her life.''
By the end of Thursday, the most prominent voices in Washington had weighed in, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the first lady, Michelle Obama, and the president himself, who said that there is ''no tougher job than being a mom'' and that anyone who thinks otherwise ''needs to rethink their statement.'' 
The latest flare-up in the working-mother wars was fueled by the political stakes on both sides as Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama begin waging a seven-month battle for the White House. The top advisers for the campaigns see the political fortunes of their candidates intertwined with the conclusions reached by independent women in swing states across the country. Mrs. Romney has lately taken a more prominent position on the campaign trail, acting as a surrogate for her husband and reaching out to female voters, a bloc that is one of Mr. Romney's greatest vulnerabilities.
But women of various political ideologies who said in interviews that they had struggled with how to balance work, family and society's inevitable judgments, largely disapproved of the debate's tone, calling it demeaning and superficial, even as the issue remains as timely a conversation as ever.
''I'm not a Mitt Romney supporter, but I think the comments about his wife were petty and unfair,'' said Beth Shelton, 33, a property manager and mother who described herself as a moderate independent voter. ''I was a stay-at-home mom for nine years. Working at home is hard. Working at an office is hard. There's no way to say what's easier. That's not the point.''
Ms. Shelton continued: ''There are a lot of real issues right now with Republicans and women, things having to do with birth control and women's health care. There are more important things to be talking about having to do with supporting families, from a woman's perspective.''
Other women echoed those sentiments.
Charlotte Udziela, a retired community college instructor in Beaverton, Ore., who supports Mr. Obama, said she wished both campaigns would address the issues of work, home economics and family balancing with more gusto. There is a ''huge divide,'' she said, between wealthy women like Mrs. Romney and women of more modest means who would like to stay home to raise children, but cannot afford to.
If Ms. Rosen ''had chosen her words differently,'' said Ms. Udziela, a grandmother of five, ''this might have been a more useful discussion, something we should be talking about.''
In Ms. Rosen's initial comments Wednesday night on CNN, where she is a political analyst, she questioned Mrs. Romney's ability to relate to financial struggles of mothers who must work full time. Even after the initial criticism, Ms. Rosen continued to press that case for hours on Twitter, in an online column and in television appearances.
''This is not about Ann Romney,'' Ms. Rosen said on CNN Thursday morning. ''This is about the waitress at a diner someplace in Nevada who has two kids whose day care funding is being cut off because of the Romney-Ryan budget and she doesn't know what to do.''
She added: ''This isn't about whether Ann Romney or I or other women of some means can afford to make a choice to stay home and raise kids. Most women in America, let's face it, don't have that choice.''
A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney lashed out at Ms. Rosen on Thursday before she apologized, turning the economic argument against the White House.
''Not only was this Obama confidante wrong to attack a mother who chooses to stay home; so many women have lost their jobs under the Obama economy, they don't even have that choice,'' said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney.
Ms. Rosen's apology to ''anyone else who was offended'' followed Mrs. Romney's response that she ''should have come to my house when those five boys were causing so much trouble. It wasn't so easy.'' Mrs. Romney, whose children are now adults, added, ''My career choice was to be a mother.''
Appearing on Fox News on Thursday, Mrs. Romney stressed that she, too, had known struggles. But given that Mr. Romney's wealth is estimated at $250 million, she acknowledged that her struggles had not been financial. This combustible nature of the gaffe bears some resemblance to what is now known as Mr. Romney's Etch A Sketch moment. A Romney aide mentioned the toy last month to describe how the campaign would pivot to the general election, and Mr. Romney's opponents seized on the comment for days, to bash him as inconsistent.
In this case, Mr. Romney's campaign has used the controversy to raise money. In an e-mail titled ''War on Moms,'' Beth Myers, Mr. Romney's former chief of staff, asked for $6 in exchange for a ''Moms Drive the Economy'' bumper sticker. ''If you're a stay-at-home mom, the Democrats have a message for you: you've never worked a day in your life,'' the e-mail said. ''America deserves a president who will bring us together -- not pit us against each other.''
Mr. Obama's top political advisers moved rapidly to distance him from Ms. Rosen, noting that she is not a paid adviser to the campaign or to the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Obama's most senior campaign aides posted on Twitter their outrage at Ms. Rosen's comments moments after she made them.
''I could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly,'' said Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager. ''Her comments were wrong and family should be off limits. She should apologize.''
Ms. Rosen is a managing director at the political consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker, one of whose founders, Anita Dunn, was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama and, this year, to the Democratic National Committee.
Officials of the Democratic Party said Ms. Rosen had had no formal advisory role, though she had attended some meetings informally. A prominent Democrat in Washington, Ms. Rosen has been a repeat visitor to Mr. Obama's White House.
By the end of the day, as dueling Twitter messages and cable news debate continued, some women saw an opportunity squandered.
''It's hard to believe that after all these years we're still debating,'' said Karen Davidson, 65, a jewelry designer who started her own business shortly after being fired from a retail job by a male boss who objected to her being visibly pregnant around customers. ''Work is work.''

HEADLINE: At Nuclear Talks, Hopes That a New Iranian Attitude Will Reduce Tensions

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- At negotiations this week between Iran and six world powers, the United States and its allies hope to make enough progress to take some of the urgency out of the confrontation over Tehran's nuclear program, to reassure Israel and to arrange a second round of talks soon.
For the first time in years, both Iran and the six powers -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany -- seem interested in serious negotiations that both sides have agreed will take a ''step by step'' approach and be ''reciprocal.'' And both sides say they are coming to the talks here in Istanbul with proposals on the nuclear issue in discussions that may begin over dinner on Friday night and will continue formally on Saturday.
But considerable doubts remain about how far Iran is willing to go to satisfy the United Nations Security Council's demands to suspend uranium enrichment and cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency. One reason is the West's experience with Iran's lead negotiator, Saeed Jalili, who is considered tough and inflexible, is given to long speeches and is careful to stick to his negotiating instructions. 
Mr. Jalili, 46, an engineer by training, is the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. His career has had its ups and downs, but it appears to be on the rise again.
Intriguingly, diplomats said, Mr. Jalili has acquired an additional title in his correspondence with the representative of the six powers, Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief. Mr. Jalili's letterhead identifies him as the ''personal representative of the supreme leader,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, presumably meaning that Mr. Jalili will speak on his behalf in Istanbul, at least up to a point. That alone would be a major change, the diplomats said, especially in an Iranian system that everyone outside of it agrees is opaque.
''When the Iranians do things like this we think it means something,'' said Volker Perthes, director of Germany's Institute for International and Security Affairs. ''Jalili seems to be indicating that you can do business with me because the supreme leader is behind my mission. That's a change.''
At the last round of these talks, in Istanbul in January 2011, Mr. Jalili lectured rather than negotiated, and demanded preconditions for serious talks that were unacceptable to the six powers. But Mr. Jalili was also Iran's lead negotiator in Geneva in October 2009, when a tentative agreement was reached to export most of Iran's enriched uranium in return for nuclear fuel. That deal, openly supported by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, was rejected by Ayatollah Khamenei.
Both Mr. Jalili and Mr. Ahmadinejad suffered when that deal fell apart, derailed partly by a fierce presidential election in Iran and by the Iranian hierarchy's belief that President Obama was not serious about the talks, said Farideh Farhi, an independent scholar and expert in Iranian politics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
But the context is different now. Iran has produced a much greater quantity of enriched uranium, some of it at 20 percent purity, just a few technical steps from bomb grade; it has placed many more centrifuges deep inside a protected mountain at Fordo, near Qum; and it is facing increased sanctions that are causing severe economic distress. So there is more of a sense of urgency on both sides, with Israeli leaders talking openly of bombing Iran's nuclear sites before it becomes too difficult to do so.
There are important internal changes in Iran, too. Iran appears to have suppressed its ''green revolution,'' while Ayatollah Khamenei has solidified his power and Mr. Ahmadinejad, who had challenged him, is considered much weakened. Ayatollah Khamenei has been especially protective of Iran's nuclear program, while at the same time saying that it is against Islam to possess nuclear weapons. Iran denies that its nuclear program has a military aim, but most members of the Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency have expressed doubts.
The United States has made clear that the 20-percent-enriched uranium and the protected Fordo site are matters of urgency, and Iran has hinted that it may be willing to suspend enrichment to 20 percent, at least temporarily, in return for concessions -- which may include, for instance, suspending the European Union's oil embargo, scheduled to begin July 1, or even of some sanctions against Iran's Central Bank. Reciprocal suspensions of some kind, experts say, might be enough to buy time and get both sides to another round of talks.
''Jalili is not considered to be very smart, even inside Iran,'' Ms. Farhi said. ''He used to work in the office of Khamenei, and wouldn't go to Istanbul without specific instructions about how serious the talks should be. But for Iran, some things have changed: sanctions have become harsher, and they believe the kinds of technological advances they pushed through have made a difference in American calculations.''
So this time ''both sides seem a bit more optimistic, and both sides are worried about failure,'' Ms. Farhi said. ''There is more of a balance of interests; that brings a seriousness to this discussion.''
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, talking to reporters in Washington on Thursday about the impending talks, acknowledged that the Iranians had signaled their intent to bring up new ideas, and she suggested that the United States was prepared to consider reciprocal steps. But Mrs. Clinton also said the Iranians must ''demonstrate clearly in the actions they propose that they have truly abandoned any nuclear weapons ambition.''
Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and a former senior official at the State Department, said he also saw a new impetus for these talks stemming from the pain of the economic sanctions on Iran and of Washington's ''keen interest in persuading Iran to accept some limits'' so that Israeli military action can be postponed and talks can continue.
He also said that Mr. Jalili, humiliated by the rejection of the 2009 deal, clearly had moved closer to Ayatollah Khamenei and had been an important figure in Iran's rejection in February of closer cooperation with the international atomic agency on military inspections in Iran. Those inspections were meant to satisfy lingering questions about Iran's nuclear intentions.
''So he's seen as a hard-liner,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick said. ''And he's again the one fronting for Iran, so expectations are not high that he of his own volition would be looking for a way out.''
In the end, all agree, any key decisions will rest with Ayatollah Khamenei, 72, who since he became supreme leader in 1989 has remained highly suspicious of the United States.
Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace in Washington, said that ''in past meetings, Jalili has been less a negotiator and more a human tape recorder who simply repeats official government slogans.'' But Iran will have to make ''meaningful compromises,'' he said, if it wants to avert new sanctions and participate in a further round of talks.
Mr. Sadjadpour expressed doubts that Ayatollah Khamenei is ''capable of suddenly reinventing himself at age 72.'' No deal can be made without him, ''but what's unclear is if any deal can be made with him.''

HEADLINE: 'First Generation' Chronicles Students' Difficult Path to College

BYLINE: TANYA CALDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new documentary shadows a group of anxious applicants seeking to become the first in their families to attend college. 

 BODY:
The college admissions process can be confusing on its own, but the missteps are multiplied, it seems, when a young applicant looks around and can find no relatives who've ever been through it.
In the documentary "First Generation," which had its New York City premiere at New York University on Wednesday night, four such teenagers forge their way to become the first in their families to go to college. The film, narrated by Blair Underwood, chronicles the actions and anxieties of these diverse students, all living in California, from their junior year, when the college admissions process begins in presumptive earnest, until they are freshmen in college.
The makers of the film are Adam and Jaye Fenderson, a married couple who said that they found it difficult not to help the students they were covering.
"We actually made a decision when we started thinking about the film that we were not going to intervene in the students' lives," Mr. Fenderson said. "It was very difficult to sit there and listen to them talk about what their counselor told them when we knew that it was wrong. It was difficult to even sit in some of the counselor meetings and hear the counselors be so brief and quick with these students and these students not get answers that they really needed."
An absence of college graduates in a family can result not only in a lack of financial support - many economic studies have suggested that college graduates make more money over time than high school graduates - but also a shortage of knowledge about the college admissions process. In the film, one of the student's mothers is depicted as having no idea how to pay for college, and not knowing whether the cost is required to be paid in full upfront. The students, themselves floundering through the process, make misinformed financial decisions that limit their college choices and may even stifle their academic potential.
One student, a scholar named Jess who has won multiple awards, failed to apply to one university because she couldn't afford the $50 application fee.
"We just assumed that they all knew about fee waivers," Mrs. Fenderson said after the screening. "We didn't realize that she didn't even know."
The documentary packs power in its subtle way of portraying the complex problems that these low-income, first-generation students face. They must overcome mindsets that make them feel unworthy to even apply to top-tier colleges; they must make major financial decisions based on incorrect or incomplete knowledge about financial aid; they must work hard to make ends meet and, hopefully, earn scholarships; and they must excel in standardized tests for which they seem ill-prepared.
They must also overcome obstacles that come from within their own families. In one scene, Cecilia, a first-generation American citizen and daughter of migrant field workers, decides to move in with a friend's family.
"I feel a lot more comfortable with this family," she said. "I feel like I can have a future with this family."
The filmmakers refrain from offering opinions in the film, though the students are portrayed with an empathetic lens. Scenes like the one described above compel viewers to make sense of the students' circumstances. Among the searching questions prompted are these: How many low-income students fail to strive because they feel as if their family doesn't have the resources to help them become successful? Is potential a moot point?
At the screening, the audience watched in silence another scene, in which Jess is sitting at a lunch table with her father. She is extremely worried about paying for college, but never asks him for help. Her father, who is obligated to pay child support for a few more months until she turns 18, doesn't offer to send Jess money for school; instead, he recommends that she set her sights on a nearby junior college.
"I know he loves me and I know he tries," Jess said, "but at the same time, I wonder how hard he's trying."
While it can be disheartening to watch how heavily wherewithal outweighs potential throughout the college admissions process for these students, the documentary shows that, despite what might have been, each of the students is still in school and doing well.
The filmmakers and the students have all been invited to screen the film on Capitol Hill on April 24 before members of Congress, as well as representatives from the White House and the Department of Education.
Although the filmmakers plan to continue screening the film at universities and high schools throughout the country, they are also hoping the film will be a part of the classroom. They are designing a curriculum for the documentary and targeting universities with schools of education, so that future teachers will show the documentary to students who might otherwise stumble through the college admissions process. There have also been talks of adding closed captioning and Spanish subtitles to the documentary.
"We try not to point a finger in this film at any one thing," Mr. Fenderson said. "We try not to say: 'Hey, look, it's the government's fault. Hey look, it's the school's fault, or it's parents' fault, or video games,' or whatever anybody wants to blame for these problems. We try to say that there's a lot of things that are going wrong. What we want to do with this film is to get a conversation going. We want people to leave talking about the issues that they saw. We want people to relate to the students and we want all of you to know that you can do something about it.
"You can be a mentor. You can do SAT prep. You can do writing coaches. You can donate your money, your time, your resources, whatever you have, and literally, tomorrow, you can start making a difference, rather than waiting for something to come up on a ballot, or waiting for somebody to start a P.T.A. group or something like that. You can make a difference in these students' lives now."

HEADLINE: Was Hilary Rosen's Remark About Ann Romney 'Witless'?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Readers think I wasn't fair to the Democratic strategist. 

 BODY:
Several readers have objected to my calling Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney "witless." They seem to think I've joined Republicans in expressing "faux outrage."
Let me clear things up: I meant what I said, but that doesn't mean I'm outraged.
Ms. Rosen, a Democratic strategist, said on CNN that Mrs. Romney "has actually never worked a day in her life" and has "never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing."

I don't think she intended to denigrate mothers who do not earn wages or run their own businesses. I think she meant to say that Mrs. Romney is a rich, privileged woman and from that position is not in touch with the lives of ordinary American women, especially those who are working one or more jobs just to make ends meet raising children.
But "never worked a day in her life" was a poor choice of words, because the phrase dissociates childcare from other forms of labor. A woman who stays home to raise and nurture her children is working just as much as one who goes out into the world to be paid for her work. She is just as vital a part of the economic and emotional fabric of her family as her husband.
Ms. Rosen, who ran the Recording Industry Association of America for 16 years, is supposed to be an expert on public relations and politics, and could surely have anticipated how the Romney campaign, or even just ordinary viewers, might interpret what she said. "Witless" still sounds like a pretty good description to me.

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: With both sides setting their fund-raising goals high, it doesn't look as if either presidential nominee will accept public funds and the attached spending limits. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
With both parties setting high fund-raising goals for the general election, it seems unlikely that either presidential nominee will accept public funds and the spending limits that come with them, dealing a blow to the post-Watergate reforms intended to control the electoral influence of money, Nicholas Confessore reports.

        
The race for the White House took a turn into the politics of motherhood after a Democratic strategist said Mitt Romney's wife had "never worked a day in her life," prompting Ann Romney to defend being a stay-at-home mother and reviving the debate over the roles of women in and out of the workplace, Michael D. Shear and Susan Saulny report.

        
Unlike the last meeting a few years ago and its emphasis on the economic downturn, this weekend's Summit of the Americas in Colombia will focus on how President Obama and other leaders can on trade, energy and drug trafficking to encourage prosperity, Jackie Calmes reports.

        
Ahead of the Senate's consideration of the president's proposed "Buffett Rule" minimum tax for the wealthy, Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Friday and urge Mr. Romney to follow suit, Mark Landler and Jim Rutenberg report.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Profit Rises 13%, as Revenue Increases

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Wells Fargo reported earnings of $4.2 billion, or 75 cents a share, as its loan portfolio continued to improve. 

 BODY:
Wells Fargo, one of the nation's largest consumer lenders, posted a 13 percent increase in first-quarter profit on Friday, the latest in a series of upbeat report cards for the bank.
Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, reported earnings of $4.2 billion, or 75 cents a share, as its loan portfolio continued to improve. The results - partially helped by the bank's decision to set aside less in reserves to cover troubled loans - narrowly beat the 73 cents a share that analysts were forecasting.
For Wells, it was the seventh-straight rise in quarterly net income. 
 Analysts expected strong results from Wells Fargo after the bank moved up its earnings announcement date by several days. The bank, which traditionally reports results days after its Wall Street competitors, kicked off the industry's earnings season this quarter along with JPMorgan Chase.
The strong results spread across the bank. Mortgage originations were up. The unit that caters to corporations showed improved earnings. Even revenue, which has suffered across the financial industry in the years since Wall Street's near collapse, increased to $21.64 billion, from $20.33 billion. It was the bank's highest quarterly revenue in more than two years. 
"Wells Fargo delivered outstanding first-quarter results driven by strong revenue growth," the bank's chief executive, John G. Stumpf, said in a statement. "Our continued performance for shareholders through a variety of economic environments is a testament to our diversified business model."
Wells Fargo has proved resilient in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It recovered from the mortgage mess - and is coping with the lackluster economy -- better than most other big banks. The bank also received high marks from the Federal Reserve's latest round of stress tests, and used the rosy report to raise its dividend from 12 cents to 22 cents per share.
The bank's strength was reflected in the latest earnings report, which was driven by improvements in the lending business. Allowance for credit losses amounted to $19.1 billion, down from $22.4 billion in the period a year earlier. The bank's reserve for bad loans fell to $18.9 billion in this year's first quarter, a $3.1 billion drop from $22 billion in the first quarter of 2011, reflecting how the flood of losses has slowed.
Profit in the community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo's retail branches and mortgage business, climbed 8 percent, to $2.3 billion, from first quarter 2011. The unit's revenue jumped $764 million, or 6 percent, on the back of greater mortgage banking income and deposit growth. The bank's home mortgage originations amounted to $129 billion, up from $84 billion in the period a year earlier.
The gains extended to the wholesale banking unit, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division. In the unit, Wells Fargo turned a $1.9 billion profit, up 14 percent, from first quarter 2011.
Some other banks, meanwhile, are still struggling under the weight of their soured loans. Big financial firms like Bank of America and Citigroup will report earnings next week.
"Wells Fargo stands out from its peers not only due to its long history of superb management, but also because of its relatively simple business model, making it our favorite of the big four American banks," Jim Sinegal, a Morningstar analyst, said in a recent report.

HEADLINE: For Obama, Going Positive May Be More Difficult This Time

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: Even as it steps up its efforts to define Mitt Romney on its terms, the White House is working to communicate a positive case for Mr. Obama, one built around the themes of fairness and security. 

 BODY:
 President Obama's campaign has left no doubt about how it intends to run against Mitt Romney, portraying him as a bazillionaire elitist and conviction-free flip-flopper who has allied himself with the Republican Party's most extreme positions.
 After a year in which he was excoriated on an almost-daily basis by Mr. Romney and the others seeking the Republican nomination, Mr. Obama is now letting loose his competitive, street-ball side, mocking his opponent's vocabulary and suggesting a Republican victory would lead to social Darwinism. The comments by a Democratic strategist Wednesday night about Ann Romney's work history were condemned by Mr. Obama and his inner circle but only reinforced the sense that a lot Democrats are primed to play rough in 2012. 
 To conservatives, it is all just more evidence that hope and change was never more than bait-and-switch. To some liberals, it is about time the White House showed a willingness to brawl. Moderates and independents who had hoped for some ideological accommodation have long since resigned themselves to an era of post-postpartisanship. 
 But the edgier and more negative tone coming from the president's re-election is highlighting another issue. Successful campaigns tell positive stories even while they are in knife fights, and even as it steps up an effort to define Mr. Romney on its terms, the White House is working to make a positive case for Mr. Obama, one built around themes of fairness and security. 
 Judging by the difficulties he has had selling his policies and himself for the last three years, going positive in an effective way could prove to be more challenging for Mr. Obama than going negative. 
 It was almost an article of faith among Democrats following the 2008 election that Mr. Obama would hold an inherent advantage over Republicans in his ability to inspire voters. 
 Yet the same man who even in the view of his opponents spoke eloquently to the nation's yearning for a new direction in the last campaign has proved inconsistent after taking office when it came to summoning goose-bump-inspiring magic.
 He and his team were soundly defeated in the messaging wars with conservatives when it came to his two signature pieces of legislation, the economic stimulus bill and the health care overhaul. In key battles, liberals faulted him for being too timid, moderates and independents for exceeding the mandate voters had given him. New slogans came and went with the seasons.
 The president even lost the ability at times to define himself on his terms, leaving him fending off accusations that he was foreign born, a socialist, a Muslim and an apologist for the United States. By turns pragmatic and ideological, he struggled to find a clear, coherent narrative to explain to the American people what he stood for and where he was leading them.
 All of which makes his effort to articulate a reason why voters should give him another four years -- other than the fact he is not Mr. Romney -- even more vital to his prospects. And in a series of speeches beginning late last year and getting more attention in recent weeks, he has tested the following strategies and themes he is now carrying into the general election.
 RAISE THE STAKES - It is axiomatic that incumbents who have presided over tough times want to avoid having the election be a referendum on their performance and seek instead to frame it as a choice between competing visions. In Mr. Obama's case, that means making the election not about still-high unemployment rates and month-to-month job growth but about something much bigger: the best way to assure the future of the middle class and the American dream of upward mobility.
 "This is the defining issue of our time," Mr. Obama said in a speech in Florida this week, stressing policy initiatives that would make the rules of the game more "fair" to those being left behind in what he described as a rich-get-richer economy. "This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and everybody who's aspiring to get into the middle class."
REBUT THE RIGHT - Mr. Obama has long since given up on his initial strategy of ignoring the sometimes baseless but often effective conservative criticism against him. His public appearances now feature statements that amount to specific rebuttals of that criticism and efforts to define him as mainstream in his background and values. 
 To the assertion that he is a socialist: "I believe deeply that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history." To claims that he does not believe in American exceptionalism: "Nobody does it better," he said, referring to the ability of the United States to compete in the global economy. To the implication that he is somehow not a real American or does not share core American values: "My mother and the grandparents who raised me instilled the values of self-reliance and personal responsibility that remain the cornerstone of the American idea."
 TURN LIABILITIES TO ASSETS - If the unemployment rate is a symptom of the economic problems that threaten Mr. Obama's re-election, the broader underlying cause is the sense among voters that economic upheaval has left them vulnerable and that it is harder for most people to get ahead. Rather than trying to convince voters that things really aren't so bad, Mr. Obama is increasingly embracing their angst and trying to turn it to his advantage by talking about his agenda as one that will increase their security. 
 "What, if anything, can we do to restore a sense of security for people who are willing to work hard and act responsibly in this country?" he asked in a speech last week. 
 THREAD THE NEEDLE - In 2008, Mr. Obama assembled a broad coalition of liberals and moderates to propel him to an easy victory. But he faces a more difficult task this time energizing the left, which is looking for reassurance that he is dedicated to progressive issues, while also appealing to the center, which wants to see partisanship in Washington give way to results. 
 Here, he is still working to find the right balance, reflecting the challenge for both parties of coping with a politics of austerity. 
 His dire assessment of the effects of the Republican budget proposed by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin signaled to liberals, following his failed negotiations for a budget deal with the Republican leadership, that he will fight aggressively against deep spending cuts. But his tone - making fun of Mr. Romney for calling the Ryan budget "marvelous" and suggesting that Republicans would pit Americans against each other in a fight for survival - drew criticism from some centrist quarters. 
 So he has begun invoking Republicans - Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Eisenhower most frequently - in the service of progressive goals, from regulating the financial and corporate worlds to building roads and improving education.

HEADLINE: Sizing Up the Impact of Tax Cuts (and Their End)

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: How various analysts have measured the effect of the Bush and Obama tax cuts due to expire at the end of this year, and what might follow if they lapse. 

 BODY:
 Without the Bush tax cuts of 2001, 2003 and 2008 and the Obama tax cuts of the last few years, median after-tax household income would be about $1,750 a year lower than it is. All of those tax cuts, of course, face an uncertain fate, because they are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. 
 If they do expire, they would make a major dent in the medium-term budget deficit, as I explain in a news analysis for this weekend's Sunday Review section. But the expiration would also make a serious dent in income for many households.
 Already, the last decade has not been good for household income (except at the top of the distribution). Median income grew slowly between 2002 and 2008 - much more slowly than in other recent economic expansions - and then fell sharply in the recession. 
Pretax median income last year was still 6.2 percent below its 2000 peak, according to inflation-adjusted numbers from Moody's Analytics. After-tax income fell only 1.3 percent between 2000 and 2011, thanks in large part to the tax cuts, which, for better or worse, are now at risk.
The effects of the looming expiration of the tax cuts - as well as the looming cuts to domestic and military spending - are examined in an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and another from the Heritage Foundation. 
The Tax Policy Center, in previous work, has analyzed the effect of the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, as well as the so-called patch for the alternative minimum tax. 
The center has also looked at the effect of the expiration of the payroll-tax cut, the largest of the Obama tax cuts. (Note, though, that the numbers in its document refer to the effect over 10 months, not a full year.)

HEADLINE: Solid Results at 2 Banks Bode Well for the Industry

BYLINE: NELSON SCHWARTZ and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Two of the nation's largest lenders, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, reported strong revenue growth on Friday, a surprise that could bode well for the rest of the industry and the broader economy. 

 BODY:
Revenue is back.
Hard hit by new regulations and a sluggish economy, banks have struggled to revive top-line performance since the financial crisis, even as profits improved. But two of the nation's largest lenders, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, reported strong revenue growth on Friday, a surprise that could bode well for the rest of the industry and the broader economy.
"For the expansion to be sustained, it is important that the banking sector be healthy and willing to extend credit," said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. "We're seeing the banking sector turn more expansionary."
Indeed, Federal Reserve data show that total bank lending grew at an annualized rate of 5.4 percent in the first two months of 2012, compared with a rate of 4.2 percent in the second half of 2011.
Still, bank stocks were down sharply on Friday in part on concerns that the first-quarter gains may be fleeting and over the European debt crisis.
At JPMorgan, the country's biggest bank by assets, revenue rose 6 percent, to $26.71 billion, compared with the quarter a year ago. It was partly because of strong demand for mortgages, business loans, as well as healthy trading volumes on Wall Street. That was $2 billion more than analysts had expected.
For Wells Fargo, which recently supplanted Bank of America as the nation's leading mortgage lender, home loans were also a source of strong growth, as was lending to corporations. Revenue at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent, to $21.64 billion, the highest level in more than two years. Until now, the bank's revenue had steadily declined for several quarters. In the first quarter of last year, for instance, the bank's revenue dipped 5 percent.
"There is nothing not to like here," said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. Unlike the first quarter of 2011, earnings growth came largely from underlying operating strength, while one-time gains from the release of reserves for credit losses actually dropped.
Banks in recent quarters have bolstered profits by reclaiming billions of dollars they had reserved for expected losses from unpaid loans to businesses and consumers. JPMorgan Chase released $1.7 billion from reserves compared with $2.6 billion a year ago, while these gains totaled $400 million at Wells Fargo compared with $1 billion a year ago.
"Core earnings were stronger than we were looking for," Mr. Kotowski said. "Most of the loan portfolio was growing and credit quality was well-behaved."
Despite the better-than-expected results, bank stocks suffered profit-taking on Friday after a strong run recently. The market also declined after news that the Chinese economy was slowing and Spanish borrowing costs were spiking. Shares of JPMorgan Chase dropped 3.6 percent, to $43.21, while Wells was down 3.5 percent, to $32.84.
Some analysts question whether the revenue recovery is sustainable. The revenue gains, some say, could be fleeting because banks still face a sluggish economic recovery and a new round of federal regulations that restrict the fees they can charge consumers. And the improvements stem in part from the booming refinancing business, which will most likely slow once interest rates climb.
"I think people will be wary of reading too much into it," said Jim Sinegal, an analyst at Morningstar. "It would be more encouraging if it was a sustainable recovery in the mortgage business."
The reports started a series of earnings announcements by the big banks that will continue next week as Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs disclose results, and the revenue line will most likely be a focus at the other banks.
Last year, for example, total industry revenue fell 2 percent, to $652.9 billion, according to Matthew Anderson, managing director at Trepp, a data provider for the banking industry. Mr. Anderson added that margins remained compressed in traditional businesses like lending, forcing banks to look elsewhere for growth, including by imposing new fees on account holders and focusing on more volatile trading activities, where results can vary sharply from quarter to quarter.
That certainly was the case at JPMorgan's investment bank. Stronger capital markets helped lift revenue 68 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011, hitting $7.32 billion, while profits in that unit jumped 29 percent, to $1.68 billion.
The company also kept a tight lid on expenses at the investment bank. The amount set aside for compensation fell to $2.9 billion from $3.29 billion in 2011. The employee count dropped to 25,707 from 26,494. Based on those figures, average compensation declined to $112,800, from $124,300 a year ago.
JPMorgan was helped by growth in many of its businesses, as consumers gradually began to spend more and businesses increased borrowing. Business loans were up 23 percent over the period a year ago, while credit card spending increased 12 percent and mortgage applications surged 33 percent. Deposits in branches increased 8 percent.
The increase in mortgage applications helped turn around results in JPMorgan's retail mortgage business, which reported a profit of $1.75 billion, in contrast to a loss of $399 million a year ago.
"It's the combination of a strengthening economy and for us, consistent investments in the business that improved our market share in mortgages, credit cards and the commercial bank," said Douglas L. Braunstein, chief financial officer for JPMorgan Chase.
During a conference call with journalists, the company's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was largely upbeat about the broader economy. "No one knows the future, but in short, business is in good shape," he said. While recent government employment data has been slightly weaker than expected, Mr. Dimon did not consider it to be a trend. "I wouldn't overreact to monthly data if I were you. It looks O.K.," he said.
Wells Fargo credited its revenue gains to strong mortgage banking returns and improvements in bond trading. Revenue in the community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo's retail branches and consumer lending business, jumped 6 percent, or $764 million. The bank's home mortgage originations amounted to $129 billion, up from $84 billion in the period a year earlier.
The flood of losses from soured loans has also slowed. Allowance for credit losses at Wells Fargo totaled $19.1 billion, down from $22.4 billion in the period a year earlier. The bank's reserve for bad loans fell to $18.9 billion in this year's first quarter, a $3.1 billion drop from $22 billion in the first quarter of 2011.
The gains extended to the wholesale banking division, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division. Revenue jumped about 11 percent in that unit.
"It's growing because the economy is growing and we're taking more share from our competitors," said the bank's chief financial officer, Timothy J. Sloan, in an interview. "We feel good about being able to grow this over time."

HEADLINE: Is There a Republican Alternative to Obamacare?

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Some Republicans have indeed put forward some serious alternatives to President Obama&#8217;s plans for health care reform, though it is not clear if or how well they might work, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
On the blog of the National Center for Policy Analysis - a research firm that champions free-market solutions to problems in public policy - its founder and chief executive, John C. Goodman, recently posted a column with the headline I use on this post.
Mr. Goodman was reacting to a column, "G.O.P. to the Uninsured: (Feel Free to) Drop Dead," by Michael Millenson, published on April 1 on the Health Care Blog. In his post, Mr. Goodman took issue with Mr. Millenson's assertion that no "Republican presidential candidate has ever presented a serious plan to cover all uninsured." He asked if Mr. Millenson's commentary was meant to be an "April fool's column."
A strict constructionist of the English language, of course, would understand the words "all uninsured" to imply truly universal health-insurance coverage. 
To my knowledge, no recent Republican alternative to Obamacare has envisaged reaching that goal, nor, for that matter, does what is known as Obamacare, even though the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it goes further toward that goal than any other plan with a chance of passing Congress, as far as I can recall.

Not dwelling on this fine point, Mr. Goodman pointed out that serious proposals to extend health-insurance coverage and reform the health-care system have, indeed, come forth from Republicans, and he is right on that, too.
He cites, for example, a proposal that he and Mark V. Pauly, a health economist at the University of Pennsylvania, published more than a decade ago.
Among politicians, he cites the health-care plan offered by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, during his presidential campaign of 2008, along with a more recent proposal introduced in the Senate in May 2009 as Senate bill S.1099 by Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma.
Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, was co-sponsor; in the House, a parallel bill, H.R. 2520, was sponsored by Representatives Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Devin Nunes, Republican of California.
For reasons that have always amazed me, the Coburn bill, as Mr. Goodman calls it, was not much discussed in 2009, although I did remark on it in several posts.
What intrigued me most in Mr. Goodman's post was the rough outline of a proposal with which he ended his column. To quote him precisely, a serious alternative to Obamacare "should start with these basic ideas":
 The current system of tax and spending subsidies [mainly the tax preference accorded employment-based health insurance] would be replaced by a tax credit of, say, $2,500 per person or $8,000 for a family of four for the purchase of health insurance.
 The subsidy would be refundable; everyone gets it even if he does not owe any income taxes.
 Families can obtain the subsidy in the year in which the insurance is purchased and would not have to wait until April 15 the following year to get their credit.
 Insurance companies and other intermediaries would be able to help families obtain their credit and apply it directly to the health-insurance premiums.
Because I did not see in his post any proposal for reforming the market for individually purchased health insurance, I posted this comment on his blog post:
Let me ask you this question (and I would have asked McCain and Coburn the same): picture a family of four with an annual household income (after all taxes and cash transfers) of, say, $30,000. Keep in mind that, according to the Milliman Medical Index, the total medical costs for a typical U.S. family with private employer-based insurance, averaged over some 10 million, came to $19,500 (including the employer-paid premium contribution, the employee's contribution and out-of-pocket spending).
That total may have some fat in it for unnecessary stuff, but I wonder how much it can be, given the high health-spending concentration among a few very sick patients and given our cultural trait, especially among conservatives, never to rule out any heroic procedures over issues of cost-effectiveness.
My concern is that, if insurers in the individual market are free to base their premiums on the health status of individual applicants, a family in less-than-good health might find it very hard to get adequate health-insurance coverage for $8,000, unless very high deductibles and tight upper limits on this or that procedure make a mockery of the term "insurance."
Mr. Goodman replied to my comment:
I believe we can have credits of $2,500 for adults and $8,000 for a family of four. I believe that very quickly you would find insurance products that offered $8,000 premiums.
However, I'm willing to keep Medicaid as a backup for the $30,000-a-year worker. In fact I would open Medicaid to everyone - let them join by paying their $8,000 to Medicaid. How is that for a public plan competing on a level playing field?
At the same time, I would let everyone on Medicaid have the option of going private.
I recall proposing a vaguely similar idea of choice in a paper, "The All-American Health Plan," in 1993, as an alternative to the Clinton health plan.
So here, on the blog of the National Center for Policy Analysis, we have a serious plan that would give Americans a chance to reach truly universal health-insurance coverage, at long last.
The plan calls for a government-run health insurance plan, Medicaid, as a guaranteed-issue, fail-safe health insurance system, accessible to all people, in exchange for a government-issued tax credit voucher of $2,500 per individual and $8,000 per family.
I assume, of course, that Mr. Goodman does not have in mind having Medicaid charge applicants "actuarially fair" premiums, by which is meant premiums based on the individual applicant's health status.
How viable such a fail-safe plan might be, of course, is quite another matter.
Eliminating the tax preference for employment-based coverage would yield additional government revenue of $200 billion to $300 billion. But much of it would be eaten up by the tax credits for every American family, rich or poor.
The question is how the Congressional Budget Office would "score" the plan, that is, estimate its future impact on federal and state spending. Mr. Goodman's horse could break its neck on that very first hurdle.
Finally, it should be clear even to non-actuaries that in this plan Medicaid would be the catch basin mainly for relatively sicker Americans, as it already is. So spare us uninformed, loose talk that asserts government-run health care is ipso facto more expensive than comparable private coverage. The fact is that the government is required to cover much higher actuarial risks than is the private sector.

HEADLINE: Spain Cautions Argentina On Takeover of Energy Firm

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER. 
Floyd Norris, whose Off the Charts column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
MADRID -- The Spanish government warned on Friday that it would take unspecified retaliatory measures against Argentina if it proceeded with plans to take back control of YPF, the large oil and gas producer, from Repsol, its Spanish parent. 
The warning came as Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, the Spanish foreign minister, also announced that Spain had called on the European Commission, the United States Treasury and other governments in Latin America to support Spain in its efforts to prevent the nationalization of YPF.
Meanwhile, Inigo Mendez de Vigo, the Spanish secretary of state for European affairs, warned in a radio interview that Argentina could become ''an international pariah'' if such a nationalization went ahead.
The dispute with Argentina could not have come at a worse time for Repsol and the government in Madrid, which is already struggling with Spain's second recession in three years, as well as facing soaring borrowing costs amid concerns among investors about whether Spain will be the next euro economy to require a bailout.
For Repsol, meanwhile, YPF has come to account for a third of its profits and 42 percent of its estimated reserves of crude oil.
Repsol took control of YPF in 1999 and owns 57 percent of its equity.
The YPF takeover was one of several forays by Spain's largest banks and industrial companies into Latin America. These investments have recently helped soften the blow of crumbling earnings at home.
Independent of what measures the Spanish government might take against Argentina, a nationalization would also push Repsol shareholders to start ''an intense judicial battle in Madrid, Brussels, Buenos Aires and New York to defend themselves against an attack on their property,'' said Javier Cremades, who has been a lawyer for Repsol shareholders and has also worked for the company. Mr. Cremades is chairman of Cremades & Calvo-Sotelo, a Madrid law firm.
Shares of Repsol YPF fell 49 euro cents on Friday, or 2.73 percent, to 17.47 euros. The stock has been tumbling since the start of the year, in large part reflecting concerns among investors about the future of YPF, as the government in Buenos Aires gradually intensified its criticism of Repsol, accusing the company of not investing enough in Argentina and instead paying too much of its profits in dividends.
Mr. Garcia-Margallo, the foreign minister, suggested Friday that any nationalization would be seen as ''an aggression'' against the Spanish government as well. Still, he said that Argentina's ambassador, whom he had summoned for a meeting, had not made clear whether such a nationalization plan would go ahead, amid conflicting reports from Buenos Aires.
''We are in a moment of uncertainty which we want to use to call again for dialogue and negotiation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The State of Afghanistan

BYLINE: By IAN LIVINGSTON and MICHAEL E. O'HANLON. 
Ian Livingston is a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution, where Michael E. O'Hanlon, a co-author of ''Bending History: Barack Obama's Foreign Policy,'' is a senior fellow.

 BODY:
THE key trends of the war in Afghanistan can be summarized fairly simply. The hard part is figuring out what they collectively add up to. The muddled picture no doubt contributed to recent poll results showing that two-thirds of Americans oppose their country's involvement in the conflict. Afghans themselves seem confused; according to a 2011 Asia Foundation poll, 73 percent of citizens support their national government (and even higher percentages their army and police), but only 46 percent believe the country is headed in the right direction. 
Here is what we know: Afghans are wealthier, healthier and better educated than ever before. Unquestionably, Afghan security forces are bigger and better. Despite the occasional spectacular attack, Kabul is relatively safe, accounting for less than 1 percent of violent episodes nationwide, thanks largely to the efforts of these troops. The security situation in the more dangerous south is also much improved, after two years of efforts by foreign and Afghan forces. The north and west are at least no longer deteriorating and collectively account for less than 10 percent of violence nationwide.
But the east, near where insurgents in the Haqqani network have found sanctuary across the Pakistani border, remains highly troubled. There, insurgent violence against Afghan citizens and troops, as well as foreign soldiers, actually went up about 20 percent last year. NATO and Afghan forces will increasingly concentrate their efforts in the east this year and next.
In addition, after attacks by Afghan soldiers on NATO units, trust between the forces is lower than before. Meanwhile, government corruption remains high. Some anti-corruption measures are in place, but we cannot yet find any clear evidence that they are working systematically. The Afghan elections of 2014 threaten to intensify already growing ethnic tensions between the Pashtuns and the minority Tajiks, and between Uzbeks and Hazaras, and peace talks with the Taliban are halting.
After recent weeks marred by the attacks on NATO units, as well as riots after American military personnel burned copies of the Koran and the accusation that another American slaughtered 17 Afghan civilians, Americans and Afghans are right to wonder about the future of this conflict. They do have some happy news to look to, however, like new accords transferring the responsibility for night raids and the main coalition prison to the Afghan government.
Based on current trends -- some of which are depicted in the chart accompanying this article -- the most likely outcome in Afghanistan is a mixed one. Come 2014, when NATO withdraws, we expect that the Afghan government will be able to hold most cities and major roads. That is because of the often underappreciated improvement in its security forces, combined with the hits taken by the insurgency in recent years, as well as the general lack of appeal the Taliban movement holds for most urban Afghans. Yet the government will probably still be unable to control many of the nation's rural areas, particularly in the East. On top of that, corruption among officials will perhaps further erode the government's legitimacy; the economy will suffer as the stimulus provided by foreign troops declines; and the 2014 electoral process could easily divide Afghans more than unite them.
That said, 2014 is a long way off, and the situation could easily get better -- or worse -- than this extrapolation of current trends suggests.

HEADLINE: Trying To Save The Lincoln

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Ford Motor, alone among America's Big Three automakers, staved off bankruptcy and survived the financial crisis. Its sales, profit and stock price have surged. Now it faces what may be an even tougher challenge: Can it save its faltering Lincoln brand?
Lincoln sales peaked in 1990 at over 200,000 vehicles. By last year, sales of Lincoln, Ford's luxury nameplate, had fallen to 85,643. Lincoln has lost ground to the perennial leaders Mercedes, BMW and Lexus, as well as to a resurgent Audi and a Detroit rival, Cadillac. It's even losing customers to Ford's own brands, as the revamped Taurus and critically praised new Ford Fusion offer an array of traditional luxury features.
To reinvent Lincoln, Ford has focused on design to an unusual, perhaps unprecedented, degree. It lured a 40-year-old designer, Max Wolff, from Cadillac and has accorded him the star treatment more commonly associated with fashion designers on the Paris and Milan runways.
At the unveiling of the much-anticipated new Lincoln MKZ in Manhattan's trendy Chelsea neighborhood last week, an energetic Mr. Wolff jumped onto the stage wearing a modish suit, dark shirt, no tie, and what looked like several days' growth of facial hair. He exuded a rakish charm enhanced by his Australian accent. 
''This position is unique,'' Mr. Wolff told me when I caught up with him and Ford's global marketing vice president, Jim Farley, at this week's New York International Auto Show, where a gleaming ''ruby red'' Lincoln MKZ was on display a few feet away. ''I was hired to reinvent a storied brand,'' Mr. Wolff said. ''I had a blank canvas. Jim hired me to be a provocateur. A chance like this probably comes along only once in a lifetime.''
Lincoln is indeed storied within design circles. When Ford recently acquired a rare Continental Mark II from 1956, Mr. Wolff had the car moved to the new Lincoln design studio in Dearborn, where it served as inspiration for a new generation of Lincoln designers. In 1956, Lincoln sold the Mark II for a then-exorbitant $10,000, about the same price as a Rolls-Royce and twice that of a Cadillac. Fewer than 3,000 were built. A model once owned by Elvis Presley sold at a charity auction in 1999 for $250,000.
The most iconic Lincoln design may be the 1961 model, considered the masterwork of the legendary designer Elwood Engel, which was seared into the American consciousness as the car in which John F. Kennedy was riding when he was shot in Dallas. It shared with the Mark II an elegant simplicity that was a sharp departure from Detroit's recent taste for flamboyant tail fins. The 1961 Continental has attracted a cult following and has been featured in numerous films as well as the opening credits of the HBO series ''Entourage.''
''I look at the 1961 Continental and I see beautiful proportions, great details, elegant restraint, with just the right amount of chrome,'' Mr. Wolff said. ''In that sense, there are some similarities. If you look at the MKZ, you'll see some of the same craftsmanship and detail, but it's very simple. There's not a bit of added surface language. It's refined and elegant. But we're not reimagining the past. It's not a retro look. We wanted to break the mold. It's provocative for Lincoln, and we believe it will change people's perceptions.''
That may be just as well, since the Lincoln design legacy is hardly untarnished. Like many American models, Lincoln's designs starting in the 1970s featured ever more bloated, kitschy elements, like white vinyl roofs, nonopening oval ''opera'' windows, and fake spare tire covers, all heavily etched in chrome. The mid-'70s Lincoln Versailles was little more than a tricked-out Ford Granada.
''Lincoln made amazing cars in the 1950s and early 1960s, and they absolutely lost their minds in the early 1970s,'' Gadi Amit, president of New Deal Design in San Francisco, told me this week. Mr. Amit's firm has won over 70 design awards and specializes in technology, but he said he's a car buff and originally wanted to be a car designer. ''That was a national disaster, and it wasn't just Lincoln. Detroit is practically a ghost town, and a lot of the reason is a lot of really bad decisions about design management were made throughout the '70s, '80s and even into the '90s.''
With just 5.5 percent of the luxury car market and an aging customer base (average age: 65), Lincoln needs to attract buyers from other brands. While Mr. Wolff may have had a free hand, he was guided by copious amounts of consumer research. ''Cadillac and BMW have a very aggressive look that basically says, 'Get out of my way,' '' Mr. Wolff said. ''We wanted to define our unique space in the luxury market.''
''We found that our potential customers in an idealized state think of themselves as magicians,'' Mr. Farley continued. ''They can flow effortlessly from a social to a business environment, from big cities to adventure travel. The image that came to mind was a stingray: powerful but graceful.'' Mr. Farley is leading the Lincoln reinvention and earlier in his career helped Toyota introduce its Lexus luxury brand in the United States.
If there's another brand Lincoln would like to emulate, it's Audi, Volkswagen's luxury brand, which came back from a near-death experience after a 1986 ''60 Minutes'' expose on unintended acceleration. Although Audi was subsequently exonerated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, annual sales barely topped 10,000 by 1991. Audi sales were just under 75,000 annually in 1985. After a comeback led in part by sophisticated design that helped separate Audi from its more prosaic Volkswagen cousins, Audi sold nearly 12,000 cars in March alone.
Ironically, Cadillac decided to radically redesign its Cadillac line after Lincoln surpassed it in sales for the first time in 1998. Its distinctive knife-edge styling was introduced with the marketing theme ''art and science.'' Mr. Wolff was among the Cadillac designers who took the concept and refined it, especially on exteriors of more recent models like the CTS Coupe. Cadillac sales went from about 120,000 a year in the late '90s to a peak of over 230,000 in 2006. Though buffeted by the financial crisis, sales were up 10.5 percent in 2011, to just under 200,000, and Cadillac had a 10.2 percent share of the luxury car market.
As Audi does with Volkswagen, the new Lincolns share platforms and other technical elements with Ford brand vehicles. Yet Audi has managed to differentiate its brand. Mr. Farley said he would interview Audi buyers about their buying decision while he was at Lexus. They told him they wanted something different, and didn't see themselves like other car buyers. ''They appreciated a mix of art and technology. They wanted to set themselves apart. I heard that a lot,'' Mr. Farley said.
That's why the MKZ -- and the six newly designed Lincoln models that will follow it by 2015 -- are meant to look different from their predecessors.
''We wanted to break the mold,'' Mr. Wolff said. The roof of the MKZ, which features a 15.2-square-foot glass panel, ''is unique,'' he said. ''The center console is unique.'' The redesigned front grill is meant to conjure images of ''an eagle's wings.''
Has the new Lincoln achieved its creators' ambitious goals? The MKZ doesn't go on sale until this fall, but early reviews have been positive. ''Things are finally starting to move in the right direction'' (Motor Trend); and Lincoln has achieved a ''striking, elegant design'' (Automobile).
''I have to say that finally, they got the front fascia right,'' Mr. Amit told me. ''The split grill is very effective with a stylish logo between the panels. Everything flows together very nicely. It's very elegant, very refined. But at the end of the day, we'll have to see. It's not really bold. Compare it to Cadillac. Cadillac used a bold design language to reinvigorate the brand. It was not refined. But it did stop you and make you look. It had power. You knew something new was going on with Cadillac. I'm not sure Lincoln is doing enough of that. I'd say it's a little too elegant. It's a little timid, and maybe too 'nice.' ''
Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley automotive analyst, and some of his colleagues saw the new MKZ at the auto show this week. ''The car is stunning,'' Mr. Jonas told me. ''Even the display was beautiful. I mention that because it shows Ford's commitment to the brand. I won't even guess how many millions that cost. You have to hand it to them: they're really going for it. But it's risky. This is a radical repositioning of the brand. They're going for a younger, more sophisticated, more tech-savvy customer. The previous MKZ was a great car. It was perfectly capable. It just didn't work. There's no guarantee.''
Mr. Farley said failure wasn't an option, and there was no plan B. ''We're all in on this,'' he said.
I asked Mr. Wolff if he felt any pressure. ''Pressure?'' He laughed. ''Pressure comes with this job. There's always pressure. But I'd like to say I feel more excitement and enthusiasm. We worked really hard, and I think the work speaks for itself.''

HEADLINE: Inflation Is Outrunning The Earnings of Workers

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer prices rose modestly in March amid signs that a spike in gasoline costs was ebbing, but inflation still outpaced workers' earnings, the Labor Department said Friday. 
Consumer prices increased 0.3 percent last month, the department said. Gasoline prices rose 1.7 percent, a slowing from February when costs at the pump rose more than three times as quickly.
Still, workers' earnings fell 0.4 percent in March after adjusting for the increase in prices.
Other data showed that consumer sentiment slipped in April as higher gasoline prices hit household budgets.
''The underlying problem of inflation outstripping wage gains remains. That is the danger for the economy in the long run,'' said Joseph Trevisani, a market strategist at Worldwide Markets in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, climbed 0.2 percent, pushed higher by rising rents, medical care costs and used car prices.
In the 12 months to March, core consumer prices increased 2.3 percent after rising 2.2 percent in February. The persistence of core inflation could affect the Federal Reserve's maneuvering room for stimulus. ''This could hem the Fed in,'' said Boris Schlossberg, head of research at GFT Forex in Jersey City, N.J.
Overall consumer prices rose 2.7 percent compared with a year ago, down from a reading of 2.9 percent in February.
Still, consumers appear anxious they are falling behind. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading for the consumer sentiment index dipped slightly to 75.7 in April. Analysts had expected the reading to hold steady.
At the same time, consumer expectations for inflation over the coming year declined, reflecting the slower rise in gasoline prices.
And in March, a drop in electricity costs eased some of the bite from higher gasoline prices. Electricity costs fell 0.8 percent, the steepest decline since June.
Food prices climbed 0.2 percent last month, with poultry prices up by the most since January 2008.

HEADLINE: S.& P. 500 Suffers Biggest Weekly Decline of the Year

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Friday, giving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index its biggest weekly decline of the year, as consumer confidence dropped, China's growth slowed and the cost of insuring against a Spanish debt default rose to a record.
Financial shares fell the most among 10 industries in the S.& P. 500, following a plunge in European lenders. Technology shares fell 1.6 percent as a group and had the first weekly decline this year. 
The S.& P. 500 index fell 17.31 points, or 1.25 percent, to 1,370.26, extending its weekly decline to 2 percent. It fell a second week, for the longest losing streak since November. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 136.99 points, or 1.05 percent, to 12,849.59. The Nasdaq composite index fell 44.22 points, or 1.45 percent, to 3,011.33.
''Let's not get overly concerned, but yes, there are concerns out there that we need to look at,'' said Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector analysis at Charles Schwab. ''China has been disappointing, U.S. consumer confidence adds to the pressure and Europe is not out of the woods yet.''
Stocks fell as confidence among American consumers cooled in April from a one-year high. China's growth slowed to the weakest level in almost three years. Credit-default swaps on Spain surged as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy struggled to prevent the nation from becoming the fourth euro-region member to need a bailout.
The decline in stocks followed the biggest two-day rally in 2012. The S.& P. 500, which had its best first quarter since 1998, was still up 9 percent this year as investors bought stocks amid better-than-estimated economic data and expectations that Europe would tame its debt crisis.
Concern about Spain's borrowing costs drove investors from riskier positions into the perceived safety of fixed-income instruments, sending interest rates down.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 19/32, to 100 3/32, and the yield fell to 1.99 percent, from 2.06 percent late Thursday.
''It's going to be a long process before Europe is out of the woods,'' said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.
''It's a risk-off day. Europe has an effect on our markets as well, and it will have an effect on economic data and how our economy grows.''
Concern about the global financial system drove bank stocks lower even after JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Company reported earnings that beat estimates. Bank of America shares sank 5.3 percent, the most in the Dow, to $8.68. JPMorgan stock lost 3.6 percent, to $43.21. Wells Fargo dropped 3.5 percent, to $32.84.
Google shares tumbled 4.1 percent, to $624.60, even as earnings beat estimates. The bid to preserve control for founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin raised concern among corporate-governance watchdogs. Google introduced a plan that lets the company issue new shares without diluting the founders' voting power.
Shares of Coinstar, the owner of the Redbox movie-rental kiosks, surged 7.3 percent, to $65.78, after the company said first-quarter sales and profit exceeded its previous projection and lifted its earnings forecast for 2012 to at least $4.40 a share.
Stock in Dow Chemical, the chemicals producer, rose 1.6 percent, to $33.20, after it increased its quarterly dividend to 32 cents a share, from 25 cents.
The economic slowdown in China raised concern about a decline in demand for crude oil and the June futures contract fell 78 cents, to $103.32 a barrel in New York.

HEADLINE: 3 Tulsa Strangers, Familiar With Struggle, Met One Fate

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
TULSA, Okla. -- Shortly after midnight on Good Friday here, Bobby Clark was standing at the corner, waiting for his brother. Dannaer Fields was walking home after playing dominoes at a friend's house. William Allen was walking, too, headed home after visiting his brother.
In the close-knit world of north Tulsa, the three of them were strangers, two men and a woman who happened to be out on the streets late at night, in the middle of a mundane moment. But they had more in common than they could have imagined. The predominantly black neighborhoods where they lived -- home to crime, poverty and hundreds of boarded-up homes and businesses -- have known struggle, and so had they. 
Mr. Clark, 54, who as a teenager was given a diagnosis of schizophrenia, used to be homeless and had moved in with his brother after being evicted from the public-housing apartment where he lived. Ms. Fields, 49, overcame drug addiction; she, too, moved in with her brother after an eviction.
In a three-square-mile area of north Tulsa in the span of one hour on April 6, the authorities say, two men drove up to Mr. Clark, Ms. Fields and Mr. Allen, asked them for directions and then fatally shot them, part of a series of attacks that left two others wounded and terrified the second-largest city in Oklahoma. The five victims were black. One of the suspects, Alvin L. Watts, 32, is white, and the other, Jacob C. England, 19, is an American Indian who has also described himself as white.
On Friday, prosecutors formally charged Mr. England and Mr. Watts with hate crimes. The two men were each charged with three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of shooting with intent to kill and five counts of malicious harassment, the equivalent of hate crimes under state law.
The shootings unfolded the day after Mr. England used a racial slur on Facebook to describe the man he believed had killed his father, Carl, in April 2010. Prosecutors declined to file homicide charges against the man who was a person of interest in the case, Pernell Jefferson. They determined that Mr. Jefferson, who is black, was justified using deadly force in self-defense under Oklahoma law.
In a statement on Friday, Doug Drummond, the first assistant district attorney for Tulsa County, said he would not comment about the specific evidence for any of the charges against Mr. England and Mr. Watts, both of whom the police said had confessed after their arrest on Sunday.
''Filing charges is the first step to obtain justice for the victims and their families,'' Mr. Drummond said. ''This is a tragic and senseless crime. Our office is committed to holding those responsible accountable for their actions.''
The potential punishment on each first-degree murder charge is life with parole, life without parole or the death penalty. Mr. Drummond said the decision whether to seek the death penalty against the two men would be determined later.
The charges were announced the day of the first funeral, for Mr. Clark. At a chapel not far from the scenes of the shootings, Mr. Clark's brothers and relatives and several black leaders and Tulsa officials, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mayor Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., gathered before his coffin to sing and pray.
In his remarks to mourners and in an interview after the service, Mr. Jackson likened Mr. Clark's death to those of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old who was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, and Emmett Till, the 14-year-old whose murder in Mississippi in 1955 was a catalyst of the civil rights movement.
''Emmett Till was not famous,'' Mr. Jackson said outside the Crown Hill Chapel. ''Trayvon Martin was not famous. And yet it is the power of the blood of the innocent that often is redeeming to us all.''
Mr. Clark -- who was the son of a school bus driver and who grew up in the Seminole Hills public-housing complex -- walked around the city with his auburn-colored acoustic guitar slung across his back, and he would often play for friends at the downtown Tulsa homeless shelter where he once stayed, the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless. He was unemployed, and had survived on his disability check.
Every Tuesday morning, he would pick up a portion of his check from the homeless center's executive director, Sandra Lewis, whom he had known for years.
''He was not the stereotypical version of a schizophrenic man,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''Bobby didn't have a mean bone in his body. He was a very kind and gentle man. Never cross. Never cranky. Never had a bad day that I ever saw.''
On Friday at the chapel, Ms. Lewis and Mr. Clark's relatives and friends reminisced about him, telling stories about the Kool-Aid that he made so sweet no one else could drink it, and about his love of Jimi Hendrix riffs. There was little anger displayed for Mr. England and Mr. Watts by relatives and friends, even after word spread that the two men were being charged with hate crimes.
''Justice needs to be served,'' said Donnie Clark, 56, one of Mr. Clark's three brothers. ''We didn't know them. Maybe if they would have known us it wouldn't have happened.''
Ms. Fields's funeral is Saturday. Services for Mr. Allen, 31, a native of Hattiesburg, Miss., will be Tuesday.
Ms. Fields did not know Mr. Clark, but members of their families knew one another: one of Mr. Clark's brothers was friends with one of Ms. Fields's brothers, Kenneth Fields.
Ms. Fields was known as Donna because people had trouble pronouncing her first name, Dannaer, which sounds like Danner. She was an active member of Rentie Grove Baptist Church, and after becoming seriously ill a few years ago, she stopped abusing drugs and alcohol, turning more than ever to her faith, those close to her said. She often walked home late at night after playing dominoes at a friend's house, and her brother would caution her.
''I had been telling her, 'You don't need to walk that late in the morning,' '' said Mr. Fields, 58. ''But she said, 'I got Jesus on my side.' That's what she would always say. 'I got Jesus on my side.' ''

HEADLINE: Diamonds as a Commodity

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Could diamonds be the new gold?
A small number of investment professionals around the world are competing behind the scenes to turn the gem into a commodity that would be available to investors in the way that gold has been traded through funds on exchanges.
Trading in diamonds is limited in the United States to the retail market for engagement rings and other jewelry and the back-room bargaining among merchants in places like Manhattan's diamond district on West 47th Street.
But financial industry players in New York, London, Switzerland and Israel say there is an opening to provide reliable public access for the growing universe of investors who have been willing to sink money into funds backed by exotic assets like palladium and silver. Those players have turned a gold-backed fund, the SPDR Gold Shares, into one of the world's largest exchange-traded funds, with a market capitalization of about $70 billion. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing a proposal to create the first diamond-backed exchange-traded fund, which would be available to anyone with an online trading account. It would buy one-carat diamonds and store them in a vault in Antwerp, Belgium, providing daily values with an as-yet-unnamed index. The fund is backed by a New York company, IndexIQ, that has brought 14 other exchange-traded funds to market in the last five years.
In addition, Martin Rapaport, who founded a popular gauge of diamond pricing, said recently that he was preparing to release a ''few'' products this year that would be available to retail investors. He declined to describe them.
In perhaps the most developed plan, the largest publicly traded diamond company, Harry Winston, is working with a Swiss asset manager to create a $250 million fund that is set to begin buying half-carat to six-carat diamonds this year with money from institutional investors like hedge funds and pensions. The fund would own diamonds bought and sold in Harry Winston stores and sell shares to private investors.
''Diamond is the last uncommoditized commodity, and so it's drawing in many organizations,'' said Edahn Golan, the editor in chief of IDEX Online, a provider of diamond industry data. ''I assume that by the end of this year there will be a bunch of them out.''
Investment professionals say that retail investors should be very careful, given the difficulty of establishing consistent prices for diamonds of widely different cuts and quality, and the traditional secrecy of the industry. The diamond market has also been tarnished by accounts of stones mined in war-torn parts of Africa, though both the IndexIQ fund and the Harry Winston fund have committed to avoiding such so-called blood diamonds.
''There would be a huge learning curve for me to be comfortable trading something like this,'' said Matt Zeman, a commodity trader at Kingsview Financial.
The diamond industry can only dream of replicating the success of gold companies. Gold investments, rather than jewelry, have become the primary driver of growth in the industry, according to the World Gold Council, pushing annual production to around $100 billion, Citigroup analysts say. By comparison, the annual production of polished diamonds is about $18 billion, Citi said.
The allure of diamonds is that, like gold, they are easily authenticated and long lasting. But unlike gold, and oil, diamonds have not had much price volatility, in part because they have not been touched by large flows of speculative money, though that could change if the new efforts succeed.
''It makes sense that investors would have interest in diamond-backed funds,'' said Joung Park, a commodities analyst at Morningstar.
This is not the first rush to bring diamonds to Wall Street. When inflation was soaring in the late 1970s, the search for stable stores of value led to a few legitimate, and many illegitimate, operations that lured retail investors into diamonds. One, started by the financial company Thomson McKinnon, sold shares privately and was wound down when interest rates plummeted, taking the value of diamonds with them.
The market long repelled many investment professionals because of the 80 percent to 90 percent market share of production held by De Beers, the global diamond giant. That began to ebb when De Beers relaxed its grip on the supply channels in 2000, and subsequently sold some of its mines and inventory, reducing its market share to 40 percent today, according to Citi.
''Before De Beers gave up its monopoly, the investment case was pretty difficult,'' said Peter Laib, chairman of the Swiss firm Diamond Asset Advisors, which is working with Harry Winston on a diamond fund. ''Why would I start a fund where the price is controlled by one company?''
The end of the monopoly still left perhaps the biggest barrier to investment: the lack of uniform standards for diamond pricing. Unlike gold, which is sold for essentially the same price in financial markets around the world, diamonds have been sold mostly through bazaarlike areas like the Manhattan district and the Antwerp Diamond Bourse, which advertises that a ''binding handclasp fixes price, delivery and conditions.''
''The diamond industry suffers from an image which sadly is rather well deserved, which is hiding behind smoke and mirrors,'' said Charles Wyndham, the London-based founder of Polished Prices, a diamond pricing company.
Many market participants argue that diamonds are not a commodity but unique items that need to be evaluated individually. But Wyndham, Rapaport and IDEX are competing to prove that wrong by creating standardized pricing. IDEX has an hourly updated index of asking prices from its online database, weighted with the 15 most popular varieties.
The IDEX index is not the best gauge, Mr. Wyndham argues, because it relies on asking prices rather than actual transaction prices, as stock exchanges do. He has built the Polished Prices index, which is available on Bloomberg terminals, and uses selling prices the company receives from 20 wholesalers. He said he was working with a ''major European financial institution'' that is seeking to win regulatory approval in Europe for yet another diamond fund that could be available to the public.
Polished Prices hosted a conference in 2007 with dozens of finance industry professionals who considered how to make diamonds a regulated investment. Mr. Wyndham's partner, Richard Platt, said he thought then that a product would be available sooner.
''It's been difficult, but we're quite a long way down the road to getting there,'' Mr. Platt said.
Mr. Wyndham and Mr. Rapaport are critical of the only fund that is available to ordinary investors, the Diamond Circle Capital Fund, which listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2008. It collected roughly $50 million from investors and used it to buy stones, each worth at least a million dollars. Mr. Wyndham said the fund managers did not work out a system for pricing and eventually selling its holdings. Shares have dropped to less than $4.20 this week from around $10 in 2008.
Andrew Dawson, the fund administrator, said it recently underwent a management change and now has a better strategy with the new managers. The fund working with Harry Winston has devised a novel way of dealing with the problem of pricing. The manager in Switzerland will pay for the inventory in Harry Winston stores. The value of the diamonds will be determined after a customer buys a piece of jewelry containing the stones and a replacement stone is purchased through Harry Winston's supply chain. The fees for the fund will be similar to those of a hedge fund, with a 1.5 percent management fee and 20 percent of any increase in value.
The United States-based fund from IndexIQ advisers did not list its planned fee in the application it filed to the S.E.C. in March. Its other exchange-traded funds have fees around 1 percent annually and trade on the New York Stock Exchange's Arca exchange. Its biggest fund replicates hedge fund strategies and has attracted $200 million in assets. The S.E.C. does not comment on pending applications.
All the new sponsors make the same argument for what makes diamonds attractive to investors: while the supply of new diamonds is not expected to rise, the demand from India and China is expected to increase steadily. Brian Chen, a mining analyst at Citigroup, said ''the fundamentals look so good in terms of supply and demand.''
The Polished Prices index has fallen 2.2 percent this year, but risen 5.6 percent over the last year, and 56 percent since its inception in 2003.
But Ron Rowland, a mutual fund and exchange-traded fund adviser, and the founder of Capital Cities Asset Management, said that even if funds did begin, retail investors should approach with extreme caution.
''Stay away until you know exactly how it works, and can be sure it's acting like you think it will,'' he said. ''It's going to be a difficult market to create.''

HEADLINE: Hitting the Streets In a Harlem Precinct

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
There's only one thing wrong with ''NYC 22,'' the latest CBS cop show. Every minute that you're watching it, you are wearyingly aware of how very many cop shows there are.
The series, which has its premiere on Sunday, tracks the growing pains of six rookie police officers assigned to Harlem. The scripts are efficient. The acting is decent. But you're likely to find yourself just waiting for the familiar crises and character complications to come along, and sure enough, they do.
Hostage situation? You bet. Troubled youngster in need of a male role model? Got one right here. Officer with a drinking problem? See Episode 3. Dangerous man on the subway? Stand clear of the closing doors. 
Even the rookie hazing feels as if it came from the ''How to Write a Police Show'' manual, which isn't a good thing, considering that the series is about rookies. This particular batch may be the most diverse and best-looking in New York City history. It includes Ahmad (Tom Reed), who is from Afghanistan; Jayson (Harold House Moore), who is black and once played professional basketball; and Jennifer (Leelee Sobieski), who isn't nicknamed White House because of how white she is but might as well be.
The show has prominent names behind it. Robert De Niro is an executive producer. Richard Price, whose screenwriting credits include ''Clockers'' (based on his book) and ''Sea of Love'' and who logged time as a writer on ''The Wire,'' is billed as creator. But all that talent doesn't seem to find much to add to the cop show genre.
Maybe that's because there's nothing new to be found, but lack of effort may also be a culprit. At least in the first few episodes, there's a reluctance to delve too deeply into issues or characters, which would have been fine in an earlier age but seems lazy after nuanced, character-rich crime shows like ''The Shield'' and even ''NCIS.''
In Episode 2, for instance, one of the rookies, Tonya (Judy Marte), who is Hispanic and comes from a family that has had trouble staying on the right side of the law, is infuriated that senior officers let local pot dealers slide because they're integral to the neighborhood ecosystem.
''I've never known dope to make a block better,'' she tells her partner bitterly, after superiors have advised them to stand down. But the episode doesn't press this potentially fruitful point; the writers seem more interested in rushing ahead to meet some crisis-per-hour quota.
Perhaps this reflects professional bias, but the most interesting rookie in the early going is Ray (Adam Goldberg), a veteran newspaper reporter who is making a radical career change after having been laid off. He is significantly older than the other rookies and awards himself the nickname Lazarus. Mr. Goldberg, who played one of the more memorable soldiers, Mellish, in ''Saving Private Ryan,'' is given a bit more to work with than the other stars of the series, and he knows what to do with it.
The show may not help Harlem's efforts to improve its image. Gangs, drugs, robberies and arsons abound, and the series flaunts its New York locations to irritating excess, with a close-up of a street sign or a reference to a subway stop never far away, lest you forget where you are.
But something else lingers over ''NYC 22'' besides Harlem's past: the struggling economy. In addition to being the reason for Ray's career change, it's the trigger that sets off a miscreant in each of the first two episodes. But this probably isn't a social statement by the people behind this series; just a not very successful attempt to find a new angle in an exhausted genre.

HEADLINE: Dissident Opposes Sanctions On Tehran

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian human rights lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has no affinity for the authorities in Iran, who she fears would have her arrested or worse if she returned home. But she has found herself standing with them in opposition to the onerous nuclear sanctions imposed on her country.
As representatives of Iran and six world powers prepared to resume negotiations on Iran's uranium enrichment activities this weekend in Istanbul, Ms. Ebadi said that the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union were misdirected. 
Although meant to pressure the Iranian government to compromise on its nuclear program, ''the very stringent sanctions have really been a tremendous blow to people,'' Ms. Ebadi said in a telephone interview. ''The people need these sanctions to be removed for a sustainable life.''
The sanctions have contributed to acute shortages of foreign goods there, rising inflation and unemployment and a sharply devalued currency. Further deprivations loom, especially if a European Union ban on Iranian oil sales goes ahead as planned in less than three months.
In response to the sanctions, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been defiant, asserting that Iran will never stop enriching uranium in response to foreign demands. At the same time, he insists that Iran will never use its uranium stockpile to develop nuclear weapons, despite Western suspicions to the contrary. As for the economic pain in Iran caused by the sanctions, the ayatollah has said Iranians should take it as an opportunity to become more self-reliant and wean themselves off foreign goods.
Ms. Ebadi, 64, who was attending a conference in Minneapolis on Thursday and Friday, asserted that the Iranian government was not correct in saying that its nuclear energy program was popular among Iranians. While Iranians across the political spectrum say Iran has the legal right to develop nuclear energy, Ms. Ebadi said, many people are privately worried about the environmental risks of nuclear reactors, particularly in Iran's earthquake zones. She said there was no public discussion about this issue because the government had banned newspapers from reporting anything but the official position in recent years.
As for the nuclear negotiations, which were resumed after more than a year, Ms. Ebadi was not optimistic. ''I hope the talks in Istanbul are fruitful, but the previous experiences proved that Iran was just buying time,'' she said.
Ms. Ebadi's opposition to the sanctions has not diminished the mutual antagonism between her and the Iranian government, which considers her one of the more annoying critical voices it cannot silence. She left Iran before the disputed 2009 election and ensuing crackdown on antigovernment protests, and has often spoken out about the repression of dissidents, women, religious minorities and others deemed a threat to the conservative Islamic establishment.
She became the first Iranian and first Muslim woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in 2003, for her work in advancing the rights of women in Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. A judge by training before Islamic clerics took control, she was stripped of that title because they deemed women unfit to be judges, and she was made a secretary in her own court. She quit.
Ms. Ebadi then developed her own law practice, representing dissidents and victims of child abuse, and later founded the Human Rights Defenders Center in Iran. Six years after she won the Nobel Peace Prize, the government confiscated her medal and bank accounts, accusing her of evading taxes on the award money and forcing her into exile. The medal was later returned.
She now spends most of her time traveling, attending conferences and lectures and discussing her books about Iran, ''The Golden Cage'' and ''Iran Awakening.'' She said she had often received death threats that she attributes to Iranian government harassment.
''They only are doing this to scare me,'' she said. ''They've always said they would come after me and kill me.''

HEADLINE: A To-Do List for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released preliminary plans this week to require banks to improve their mortgage servicing and become more open and accountable in their dealings with consumers.
The bureau's preliminary plans cover areas as varied as disclosing interest rates and helping delinquent borrowers. But I was most interested in the section on force-placed insurance -- hazard, flood or wind insurance that the lender buys at a price that is almost always higher than the market rate.
That is because I have had experience with this insurance. It took me four months to convince the lender on a condominium my wife and I owned in Florida that we had sufficient flood insurance. I succeeded only because of my willingness to sit on the phone for as much as two hours and then do it again a week later when nothing was resolved.
But at least I had it removed. For some homeowners, the cost of this insurance has pushed them into foreclosure. 
''If consumers find that their mortgage servicers are trying to force expensive insurance on them, they would have the ability to head off this unnecessary result,'' Richard Cordray, the bureau's director, said at a news conference on Tuesday. ''We have heard horror stories about people whose foreclosures were accelerated by having force-placed insurance imposed on them without notice. Even when this is clearly a mistake, you cannot get it corrected unless you can get a live human being who is willing to work with you to rectify the error. With many of the servicers, that was simply not possible.''
So as the consumer protection bureau enters a comment period for its plans, which are set to go into effect in January, I want to make some suggestions of my own, from personal experience but also from stories I have related in previouscolumns.
POOR DEFINITION The Dodd-Frank financial reform law requires the consumer protection bureau to act on force-placed insurance. But the wording seems to contain a glaring loophole. It states that the mortgage servicer ''shall not obtain force-placed hazard insurance unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain property insurance.''
While that sounds straightforward, it may not be. In insurance parlance, ''hazard'' means coverage for damage to the structure caused by fire, smoke or vandalism. Coverage for flood and hurricanes is separate and is not explicitly mentioned in the law.
I called the Insurance Information Institute, and a spokesman, Michael Barry, confirmed my suspicion. The typical force-placed policy covers fire and maybe wind or hail. But in many cases, wind coverage has to be purchased separately, and flood insurance is never included in a typical hazard policy.
A spokeswoman for the consumer protection bureau, Jennifer Howard, said: ''The force-placed insurance provisions would protect borrowers who are required by their mortgages to maintain insurance against hazards to the property, including special hazards such as wind, hurricane and flood damage.'' But the bureau has also made clear that these plans are preliminary.
Regardless, the somewhat vague wording could give mortgage servicers the opening to continue the frustrating practice of telling people their homes are in an area that has been reclassified as a flood zone. This happened to James W. Hart Jr., whom I spoke to last year. He had lived in the same house in Longwood, Fla., for 20 years when he received a letter in 2010 saying he needed flood insurance.
''They started out the letter with buying me flood insurance,'' he told me. ''I said if anyone is going to be buying flood insurance, it's me because I'm not going to buy it at your exorbitant rates.''
Still, it cost him $150 for a surveyor, not to mention six weeks of calling, to prove that his home was not in a flood plain.
CONSISTENCY COUNTS The consumer protection bureau proposed that the letters notifying homeowners about force-placed insurance be standardized and mailed twice, at 45 and 15 days, before any insurance is put in place.
Mortgage servicers like Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have long argued that this is exactly what they do. And this is true. They send many letters. Correspondence is not the problem; getting the insurance removed is.
I checked in with James Yates, a professor of education at the University of Texas, Austin, whom I spoke with in January. Mr. Yates, who has lived in his house in Lake Travis for 21 years, has disputed the flood insurance that CitiMortgage had bought for him for the last three years. While he has paid his mortgage on time, the bank first applies the payment to the force-placed insurance and then puts what is left toward the mortgage. Because of this, Citi considers Mr. Yates delinquent on his payments, and he has had to hire a lawyer.
CitiMortgage has ''continued every month to send the same computer-generated, certified letter announcing that my loan 'is in foreclosure,' '' Mr. Yates said in an e-mail this week.
To prevent similar situations, the consumer protection bureau wants letters notifying consumers about force-placed insurance to state how much that insurance will cost.
MAKE PENALTIES REAL The consumer protection bureau takes a carrot-and-stick approach toward the issue of getting force-placed insurance removed in a timely manner.
The bureau's preliminary plans say that when a consumer presents proof of insurance, the mortgage servicer needs to terminate the policy and refund within 15 days any premiums that were paid.
But that doesn't deal with the issue of how servicers respond to consumers, since long delays in talking to someone to get the issue resolved are a big problem. Not only do the delays add to consumer frustration but they also increase the chances that people will give up and pay the bill.
Rick Pullen, for instance, opted to pay the $1,500 annual premium for force-placed flood insurance on his seventh-floor condo in Fort Myers, Fla. Mr. Pullen said in January that the amount was enough to sting but not enough to make him go through hours of phone calls to have the charge removed.
The stick is the penalties in the Dodd-Frank law. When consumers provide proof of insurance but servicers fail to refund their money, the fines start at $5,000 a day for negligence and go up to $1 million a day for what the law calls ''knowing violations.''
Also, the proposals do not seem to take into account the costs that borrowers must incur to prove that they have the insurance they are supposed to have. Mr. Hart is out the $150 he spent for a surveyor, and if Mr. Yates prevails in his case he will have to cover the legal costs of far more than that.
ACCOUNT FOR ABSURDITY The bureau's preliminary plans do not address the most confounding element of force-placed insurance -- dealing with how arbitrary and, at times, ridiculous it is.
Uyen Tieu spent two years fighting to have a force-placed flood insurance policy removed from the mortgage on the condo she owns in Manhattan with her husband. She tried to explain to her bank, Chase, that while her apartment building was in a flood plain, her condo was on the fourth floor. (Flood policies cover damage when water rises from the ground; a wind policy would cover the damage if her windows were blown in and rain filled her apartment.)
When logic failed to persuade Chase, she produced the building's flood insurance policy. But the bank did not deem the amount sufficient. After several months, she gave up and paid the $2,250 a year Chase charged her.
In February, however, Chase refunded her money -- after I called to ask the bank for an explanation. That call was noted in the letter the bank sent with her refund.
Of course, most people do not have a journalist calling on their behalf. So they have to hope that whatever rules the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau passes will be enforced and go far enough.

HEADLINE: Solid Results At 2 Banks Bode Well For Industry

BYLINE: By NELSON SCHWARTZ and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Revenue is back.
Hard hit by new regulations and a sluggish economy, banks have struggled to revive top-line performance since the financial crisis, even as profits improved. But two of the nation's largest lenders, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, reported strong revenue growth on Friday, a surprise that could bode well for the rest of the industry and the broader economy.
''For the expansion to be sustained, it is important that the banking sector be healthy and willing to extend credit,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. ''We're seeing the banking sector turn more expansionary.''
Indeed, Federal Reserve data show that total bank lending grew at an annualized rate of 5.4 percent in the first two months of 2012, compared with a rate of 4.2 percent in the second half of 2011. 
Still, bank stocks were down sharply on Friday in part on concerns that the first-quarter gains may be fleeting and over the European debt crisis.
At JPMorgan, the country's biggest bank by assets, revenue rose 6 percent, to $26.71 billion, compared with the quarter a year ago. It was partly because of strong demand for mortgages, business loans, as well as healthy trading volumes on Wall Street. That was $2 billion more than analysts had expected.
For Wells Fargo, which recently supplanted Bank of America as the nation's leading mortgage lender, home loans were also a source of strong growth, as was lending to corporations. Revenue at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent, to $21.64 billion, the highest level in more than two years. Until now, the bank's revenue had steadily declined for several quarters. In the first quarter of last year, for instance, the bank's revenue dipped 5 percent.
''There is nothing not to like here,'' said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. Unlike the first quarter of 2011, earnings growth came largely from underlying operating strength, while one-time gains from the release of reserves for credit losses actually dropped.
Banks in recent quarters have bolstered profits by reclaiming billions of dollars they had reserved for expected losses from unpaid loans to businesses and consumers. JPMorgan Chase released $1.7 billion from reserves compared with $2.6 billion a year ago, while these gains totaled $400 million at Wells Fargo compared with $1 billion a year ago.
''Core earnings were stronger than we were looking for,'' Mr. Kotowski said. ''Most of the loan portfolio was growing and credit quality was well-behaved.''
Despite the better-than-expected results, bank stocks suffered profit-taking on Friday after a strong run recently. The market also declined after news that the Chinese economy was slowing and Spanish borrowing costs were spiking. Shares of JPMorgan Chase dropped 3.6 percent, to $43.21, while Wells was down 3.5 percent, to $32.84.
Some analysts question whether the revenue recovery is sustainable. The revenue gains, some say, could be fleeting because banks still face a sluggish economic recovery and a new round of federal regulations that restrict the fees they can charge consumers. And the improvements stem in part from the booming refinancing business, which will most likely slow once interest rates climb.
''I think people will be wary of reading too much into it,'' said Jim Sinegal, an analyst at Morningstar. ''It would be more encouraging if it was a sustainable recovery in the mortgage business.''
The reports started a series of earnings announcements by the big banks that will continue next week as Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs disclose results, and the revenue line will most likely be a focus at the other banks.
Last year, for example, total industry revenue fell 2 percent, to $652.9 billion, according to Matthew Anderson, managing director at Trepp, a data provider for the banking industry. Mr. Anderson added that margins remained compressed in traditional businesses like lending, forcing banks to look elsewhere for growth, including by imposing new fees on account holders and focusing on more volatile trading activities, where results can vary sharply from quarter to quarter.
That certainly was the case at JPMorgan's investment bank. Stronger capital markets helped lift revenue 68 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011, hitting $7.32 billion, while profits in that unit jumped 29 percent, to $1.68 billion.
The company also kept a tight lid on expenses at the investment bank. The amount set aside for compensation fell to $2.9 billion from $3.29 billion in 2011. The employee count dropped to 25,707 from 26,494. Based on those figures, average compensation declined to $112,800, from $124,300 a year ago.
JPMorgan was helped by growth in many of its businesses, as consumers gradually began to spend more and businesses increased borrowing. Business loans were up 23 percent over the period a year ago, while credit card spending increased 12 percent and mortgage applications surged 33 percent. Deposits in branches increased 8 percent.
The increase in mortgage applications helped turn around results in JPMorgan's retail mortgage business, which reported a profit of $1.75 billion, in contrast to a loss of $399 million a year ago.
''It's the combination of a strengthening economy and for us, consistent investments in the business that improved our market share in mortgages, credit cards and the commercial bank,'' said Douglas L. Braunstein, chief financial officer for JPMorgan Chase.
During a conference call with journalists, the company's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was largely upbeat about the broader economy. ''No one knows the future, but in short, business is in good shape,'' he said. While recent government employment data has been slightly weaker than expected, Mr. Dimon did not consider it to be a trend. ''I wouldn't overreact to monthly data if I were you. It looks O.K.,'' he said.
Wells Fargo credited its revenue gains to strong mortgage banking returns and improvements in bond trading. Revenue in the community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo's retail branches and consumer lending business, jumped 6 percent, or $764 million. The bank's home mortgage originations amounted to $129 billion, up from $84 billion in the period a year earlier.
The flood of losses from soured loans has also slowed. Allowance for credit losses at Wells Fargo totaled $19.1 billion, down from $22.4 billion in the period a year earlier. The bank's reserve for bad loans fell to $18.9 billion in this year's first quarter, a $3.1 billion drop from $22 billion in the first quarter of 2011.
The gains extended to the wholesale banking division, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division. Revenue jumped about 11 percent in that unit.
''It's growing because the economy is growing and we're taking more share from our competitors,'' said the bank's chief financial officer, Timothy J. Sloan, in an interview. ''We feel good about being able to grow this over time.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Behind Instagram Feat, Networking the Old Way

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA, NICOLE PERLROTH and JENNA WORTHAM; Evelyn M. Rusli and Nick Bilton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Past midnight, in a dimly lighted warehouse jutting into the San Francisco Bay, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger introduced something they had been working on for weeks: a photo-sharing iPhone application called Instagram. What happened next was crazier than they could have imagined.
In a matter of hours, thousands downloaded it. The computer systems handling the photos kept crashing. Neither of them knew what to do.
''Who's, like, the smartest person I know who I can call up?'' Mr. Systrom remembered thinking. He scrolled through his phone and found his man: Adam D'Angelo, a former chief technology officer at Facebook. They had met at a party seven years earlier, over beers in red plastic cups, at the Sigma Nu fraternity at Stanford University. That night in October 2010, Mr. D'Angelo became Instagram's lifeline. 
''Adam spent like 30 minutes on the phone with us,'' Mr. Systrom recalled, ''walking us through the basic things we needed to do to get back up.''
Mr. Systrom, now 29, offered this as a parable for the roomful of would-be entrepreneurs who came to hear him talk at Stanford last spring: in the intensely competitive start-up scene here, success is as much about who you know as what you know. ''Make sure to spend some time after the talk getting to know the people around you,'' he told his audience.
Those people, he might have added, might one day shape your destiny. They might one day press money into your palm. They might nudge you to quit your day job and gamble on a vague idea. This week, barely 18 months after that night in the warehouse, Instagram was scooped up by Facebook for $1 billion, turning Mr. Systrom, Mr. Krieger and several of their friends-turned-investors into multimillionaires.
The extraordinary success of Instagram is a tale about the culture of the Bay Area tech scene, driven by a tightly woven web of entrepreneurs and investors who nurture one another's projects with money, advice and introductions to the right people. By and large, it is a network of young men, many who attended Stanford and had the attention of the world's biggest venture capitalists before they even left campus.
Among this set, risk-taking is regarded as a badge of honor. Ideas are disposable: if one doesn't work, you quickly move on to another. Timing matters. You make your own luck.
''There is some serendipity for entrepreneurs, but the people who are the rainmakers are the ones who entrepreneurs need to meet in order to make those connections that lead to success,'' said Ted Zoller, a senior fellow at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation who studies economic development around entrepreneurship. ''The social ties that you make are directly correlated to success.''
For Mr. Systrom, the connections forged at Stanford were crucial.
Mr. D'Angelo, a 2006 graduate of the California Institute of Technology, helped him find engineers, set up databases and flesh out features. Soon after Instagram came out of the box, he put his money into it. So did Jack Dorsey, 35, a founder of Twitter; Mr. Systrom had been an intern at the company that became Twitter.
A colleague at Google, where Mr. Systrom worked straight out of college, introduced him to Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist who had already invested millions in Facebook. In the spring of 2010, even before Instagram was born, Mr. Andreessen wrote him a check for $250,000.
The hothouse for many of these vital connections was a competitive work-study program for budding entrepreneurs called the Mayfield Fellowship Program. Mr. Systrom was a 2005 fellow; Mr. Krieger followed two years later. It was equally important in putting the two men in direct contact with new, hot start-ups in the Bay Area, along with venture capitalists looking to seed newer, hotter start-ups.
''There's ample opportunity to meet V.C.'s and make connections,'' recalled Becky Neil, who was in the Mayfield program with Mr. Systrom in 2005. ''We treat them as our peers.'' (Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger declined to comment for this article, citing regulatory restrictions in advance of Facebook's public offering.)
Mr. Systrom grew up in a Boston suburb and attended the Middlesex School, a private academy in Concord, Mass., with 375 students and nearly that many acres.
In 2002 he enrolled at Stanford, majoring in management science and engineering, a program created for those who wanted to be knee-deep in the business world. He joined the Sigma Nu fraternity, which, as Ms. Neil recalled, was known for its relatively tame parties, the kind that didn't end with anyone being rushed to the hospital. They were promoted with music videos, some of which feature an impish Mr. Systrom.
His peers recall Mr. Systrom as having an eye for photography and design, with class presentations that were among the most beautiful. He was naturally gregarious and also keen to be an entrepreneur. He briefly ran a Craigslist-type marketplace catering to Stanford students. As early as 2005, recalled one classmate, Alex Gurevich, Mr. Systrom had his eyes on mobile phones as the wave of the future.
Mr. Systrom wasn't quite ready to break out on his own.
After graduation, he went to work for Google in neighboring Mountain View. By the standards of his peers, it was considered a good and safe job, though not terribly cool. And he joined years after Google went public, which was too late to make a windfall. He lasted there less than three years and moved on to Nextstop, a travel recommendation site that was founded by former colleagues at Google and was eventually acquired by Facebook. But Mr. Systrom, as Mr. Gurevich recalled, was ''antsy.'' He had made enough investor contacts from his Stanford days, and by early 2010, he had a germ of a business idea.
His big break, if there was one, came at a party at the Madrone Art Bar in January 2010, with a start-up called Hunch as the host. There he met Steve Anderson, 44, founder of Baseline Ventures and an experienced investor who had by then banked on Twitter. Mr. Systrom pulled out his iPhone and showed him something he was building, called Burbn after his liquor of choice.
As Mr. Anderson recalled it, Mr. Systrom had a prototype and a vague idea. He wanted to build a service that let people share their location with friends, like the popular app Foursquare, with some photo tools attached to it. He was testing the prototype with friends.
''We knew mobile was going to be important, and we knew there was an opportunity to create compelling experiences for mobile devices,'' Mr. Anderson remembered of their initial conversations. ''But we didn't know a heck of a lot more than that.''
Mr. Anderson worried about one thing: the echo chamber that can plague a one-person start-up. He suggested that Mr. Systrom find a business partner. Mr. Systrom agreed. Within days, Mr. Anderson wired $250,000 to a newly hatched company, set up by a lawyer whom he had recommended to Mr. Systrom. Mr. Andreessen would soon add $250,000 from his firm. Mr. Systrom could then quit his day job.
His search for a partner naturally led him to the Mayfield network and to Mr. Krieger, an immigrant from Brazil known as Mikey and, in Mr. Gurevich's words, ''a stud engineer.''
Mr. Krieger brought different skills. He had majored in symbolic systems, an interdisciplinary program that blends coding with psychology, linguistics and philosophy. One of Mr. Krieger's projects, as his professor Clifford Nass recalled, was to design a computer interface to gauge human emotion.
''He clearly was very interested and thoughtful about psychology,'' Mr. Nass said. ''You see that in Instagram. It's not a technology triumph. It's a design and psychology triumph.''
The two men began working out of Dogpatch Labs, housed in an old pier, with fishing nets on the walls and long tables that functioned as shared office space for aspiring tech companies. Julian Green, who briefly worked out of Dogpatch, recalled that the two men were unusually obsessed with design detail. Once, he said, they spent two hours perfecting the rounded corners of the app's icons.
One of the crucial lessons of Instagram is that its founders did not spend a lot of time fussing over their original idea.
Soon after they started working together in March 2010, Mr. Krieger and Mr. Systrom decided that Burbn would not work. It had too many features. It was too close to what Foursquare was already doing. They quickly moved on -- pivoted, in Silicon Valley jargon. They decided that photos, popular with Burbn users, would be front and center.
The release of the iPhone 4 gave them a perfect hook: it had a high-performing camera and could display higher-resolution images. Users could take a picture, tweak it, write a caption and send it out to the world. They gave it a new name: Instagram.
''We renamed because we felt it better captured what you were doing -- an instant telegram of sorts,'' Mr. Systrom wrote on Quora, a question-and-answer site that his friend Mr. D'Angelo had started. ''It also sounded camera-y.''
The men worked into the wee hours on Oct. 6, 2010, to get Instagram up and running. At 4 a.m. Mr. Systrom wrote on his Twitter feed, ''Well there goes that night of sleep.''
Rob Abbott, one of the advisers at Dogpatch Labs, who was keeping them company that night, said, ''I remember them just sitting side by side, phones all over the desk, and cans of Red Bull.''
Instagram took off like a rocket, in part because Mr. Systrom had whipped up demand. As he explained in an interview with the Internet television network Revision3 in January, Mr. Systrom let some influential technology bloggers and contacts, like Mr. Dorsey of Twitter, try a test version of the app before its official release. Soon Mr. Dorsey was using it to send photos to his Twitter followers, and word spread.
But the frenzy was as much blessing as curse. The heavy load prompted an all-night effort to switch to Amazon.com's rent-a-server service, which made it easy to add capacity to keep up with growth.
Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger soon took to carrying MacBook Airs and wireless cards everywhere. If there were glitches, they could quickly get online and troubleshoot. ''Which happened a lot, due to the influx of traffic,'' Mr. Abbott said.
From 25,000 users in the first 24 hours, Instagram grew to 300,000 by Week 3, and then into the tens of millions.
With its quirky borders and filters that gave photos extra punch or a nostalgic glow, it tugged at heart and soul. Celebrities got on board, including the pop star Justin Bieber last July. On Twitter, he posted an Instagram photo of traffic in Los Angeles. Teenage girls screamed -- and then checked out Instagram. An Android version of the app, released this month, brought in one million people in its first 24 hours.
The founders kept their team lean, adding just 11 people since the app's initial release, including several Stanford graduates. Investors lined up at the door.
Benchmark Capital, whose partners Mr. Systrom had met while in college, led an investment round of $7 million in February 2010. Mr. Dorsey and Mr. D'Angelo joined in. Last week came a second round of financing that valued the company at $500 million. Mr. Systrom told associates in recent months that he was not interested in selling.
Then Mark Zuckerberg called.
When he and Mr. Systrom talked last Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief, was blunt: Facebook wanted to buy Instagram. Over the next 48 hours, the two companies hammered out the details for a $1 billion cash-and-stock deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.
To toast the occasion, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote a lengthy post on his personal Facebook page, calling the transaction an ''important milestone'' for the company, which has been eager to get a stronger foothold in mobile apps. The deal, and the speed with which it came together, implies that Mr. Zuckerberg saw Instagram's meteoric rise as a potential threat, whether as a stand-alone service or in the hands of one of its rivals like Google or Twitter. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.
Mr. Systrom did not end up beating Foursquare. As it happened, he and Dennis Crowley, one of Foursquare's founders, grew up in neighboring towns in Massachusetts. Over Christmas break two years ago they met at a local pub. Last month they met up on a business trip to London, where they met the prime minister, and decided to take a short vacation to Scotland together, complete with Scotch tasting.
Mr. Systrom may have lost one connection in the deal: Mr. Dorsey of Twitter. His company, according to several people briefed on the matter, had expressed interest in buying Instagram in recent months. Mr. Dorsey once used Instagram daily to send photos to Twitter, but he has not been back since the deal was announced, perhaps a sign that he is not happy to see it in the hands of a competitor. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.
The Instagram team showed up at Facebook this week, as documented by a Facebook vice president on -- where else -- Instagram. Whether Mr. Systrom will stay there for long is anyone's guess. With a public offering imminent, there is the risk that Facebook may soon become what Google was -- a safe place to be, but not terribly cool. And Mr. Systrom may again get antsy.

HEADLINE: In California, Economic Gap Of East vs. West

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- For decades, California has been seen nationally and by its own residents as a state divided into north and south, urbane tree-huggers versus car-obsessed beach hoppers. But the more meaningful division, it turns out, may be between east and west.
Communities all along the state's coastline have largely bounced back from the recession, some even prospering with high-tech and export businesses growing and tourism coming back. At the same time, communities from just an hour's drive inland and stretching all the way to the Nevada and Arizona borders struggle with stubbornly high unemployment and a persistent housing crisis. And the same pattern holds the length of the state, from Oregon to the Mexican frontier.
''This is really a tale of two economies,'' said Stephen Levy, the director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. ''The coastal areas are either booming or at least doing well, and the areas that were devastated still have a long way to go. The places that existed just for housing are not going to come back anytime soon.'' 
Nick DePasquale, who runs a Ford dealership here, can see it clearly. When he looks at the sales figures for dealerships less than 100 miles away, Mr. DePasquale sees signs of hope. Sales are up, if not drastically, at least enough to show that more people there are trading in their aging vehicles for spiffier models.
But when he glances at his own bottom line, the reality is grim. Less than five years ago, he was selling 300 cars a month. These days, the number rarely budges above 75. Even if customers come in looking to buy, few of them are able to get a loan approved, if their credit is pockmarked with defaults and foreclosures. ''We're trying to climb out of the depths, but we were about the first in this mess and it looks like we will be the last ones out,'' Mr. DePasquale said. ''There aren't enough people feeling good enough to buy a new car around here.''
Asked if he could imagine anything changing soon, he let out a little chuckle and said, ''The hottest-selling thing in this city is a $5,000 used car, and we don't have a lot of those on this lot.''
San Bernardino County, which with Riverside County makes up the Inland Empire, a sprawling area now scattered with vacant homes built in the last decade, posted an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent in March. Compared with Orange County, on the more prosperous, western side of California's vertical divide with an unemployment rate of 8 percent, it can feel like another world.
The disparities have played out in all kinds of ways. The Inland Empire and the San Joaquin Valley, in the center of the state, have some of the highest rates of poverty in the country. El Centro, on the state's southeast edge, has the highest unemployment rate for any metropolitan area in the country, nearly 27 percent. Stockton, 550 miles to the north and also on the eastern side of the divide, became the first city to test the state's new process for possible bankruptcy.
By 2009 the per capita income in the San Francisco Bay Area was 86 percent higher than the Inland Empire, a gap that had grown since 1969, when the per capita income was 41 percent higher than in the Inland Empire. While suburbs in the eastern parts of the state were some of the fastest-growing areas in the nation in the last decade, that growth has slowed to a near halt.
Investors are moving in to snap up foreclosed homes selling for a quarter of what they once did, but a housing glut remains. And the psychological toll in the area is almost palpable: While people here read about an upswing in other parts of the state and country, they look around their blocks and see friends out of work, shuttered stores and vacant lots. In January, Forbes magazine named Riverside the hardest city in the country in which to find a job.
During the boom times, many middle-class workers who lived along the coast moved east, eager to gobble up affordable housing in exchange for a difficult commute. By some estimates, roughly a third of working adults who live in the Inland Empire worked in neighboring counties along the coast.
''During the first part of the century, when things were booming again, we saw the coastal areas moving inland and there was a lot of discussion about how jobs would follow,'' said Hans Johnson, a researcher with the Public Policy Institute of California. ''But people were just following the building of roofs, so what you end up with in a bust, areas that were dependent on growth suffer tremendously when it dries up.''
The Valley Restart Shelter in Hemet, a small city in western Riverside County, used to draw the chronically homeless. Now, many residents are laid-off teachers, former loan officers and construction workers who have been jobless for two years or more.
''Because jobs are so scarce, it all just seems to snowball and people don't feel like they can get their hands around a path to their own recovery,'' said Linda Rogers, who has run the shelter for more than a decade. ''The people we see now are people who went from having a house to having a smaller house to having an apartment to having cars to having a job to having just nothing. They are willing to take anything, but anything just doesn't seem to be out there.''
By contrast, business owners in Orange County are more optimistic than they have been since 2004, according to a survey by the business school at California State University, Fullerton.
Joseph Cervantes, a senior executive vice president at R. D. Olson Construction, said that for the last several years it was focused on renovating hotels in Orange County, because building new ones seemed out of the question. But this year he completed a 130-room Residence Inn in San Juan Capistrano, a few miles from the shore. The hotel caters to upscale business travelers -- one of its selling points is a putting green -- and has been at 81 percent capacity since it opened in February. ''That's a crazy high demand we could only hope for a couple of years ago,'' Mr. Cervantes said. ''Clearly it hit the market at the right time.''
The differences between the west and east are not limited to the economy; several studies have shown that the coastal areas are more politically liberal than their inland counterparts. New environmental laws, for example, may be embraced in cities focused on preserving the beach, but viewed as anathema to some inland political leaders who see regulations as a path to driving businesses out of the state.
Perhaps no politician exemplifies the divide better than Jeff Stone, a conservative Riverside County supervisor who last summer proposed a bill to split off his county and 12 others to form a 51st state, South California.
Many leaders in the state ignore his area's plight, he said. ''I'm not optimistic to think that our beauty is enough to sell Southern California,'' Mr. Stone said. ''Here we see nothing but more chain restaurants because the mom-and-pop places can't make it anymore. The folks in Sacramento just have their hands out and don't realize how much we are struggling.''
Correction: April 18, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the economic problems in California, as measured between east and west instead of the state's usual north-south divide, misstated the location of Hemet. It is in western Riverside County, not eastern. The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on April 14 about the economic problems in California, as measured between east and west instead of the state's usual north-south divide, referred incorrectly to data looking at the gap between the per capita income in the San Francisco Bay Area compared with the Inland Empire. The article erroneously used dollar figures -- saying that the gap between the two communities grew to more than $40,000, and that it was $26,000 four decades ago -- rather than using the per capita income index used by the researchers. (By 2009, the San Francisco Bay Area per capita income was 86 percent higher than the Inland Empire, a gap that had grown since 1969, when the per capita income was 41 percent higher than in the Inland Empire.)

HEADLINE: On the Way to International Talks, Making a Stop for Domestic Concerns

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
CARTAGENA, Colombia -- President Obama arrived here on Friday for a two-day meeting with more than 30 other leaders of Western Hemisphere nations -- but not before making a stop with domestic political overtones in the election battleground state of Florida, to preview the meeting's trade-and-jobs theme.
Mr. Obama's visit to the port of Tampa, where he promoted the importance of United States exports against a backdrop of cargo containers, was his second trip to Florida in a week and his seventh since he filed for re-election a year ago. 
The president was eager to link his foreign travel, which holds little interest for many Americans, with the economic issues that voters do care about, and which are likely to determine the winner of the November election.
''I'm willing to go anywhere in the world to open up new markets for American businesses,'' Mr. Obama said in Tampa.
''A lot of the countries in the region are on the rise,'' he said. ''In Latin America alone, over the past decade, tens of millions of people have stepped out of poverty and into the middle class. So they're now in a position to start buying American products. That means they've got more money to spend. We want them spending money on American-made goods.''
Mr. Obama said 40 percent of goods leaving Tampa are bound for Latin America, and about the same percentage of total United States exports are to countries in the hemisphere, including Canada. That trade supports nearly four million American jobs, he said.
''Soon, there are going to be millions of new customers for American goods in South Korea, in Colombia, in Panama,'' Mr. Obama said, citing trade agreements completed late last year with those three countries. ''Soon there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul that are imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago.''
Those trade pacts remain unpopular with some of the president's union allies.
Mr. Obama got in a jab at China's trade practices, which are likely to be an issue in the presidential race given the attacks on Beijing from his likely presidential rival, Mitt Romney, during the campaign for the Republican nomination.
''Now, one of the ways that we've helped American businesses sell their products around the world is by calling out our competitors, making sure they're playing by the same rules,'' Mr. Obama said. ''For example, we've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration. We just brought a new case last month.''
The president also announced a plan to extend export-promotion services and counseling to small businesses in the United States, and to coordinate them with similar government networks in Latin American countries. Typically, government export promotion and subsidies benefit large, multinational corporations.
''This initiative is going to help our small businesses -- Latino-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, African-American-owned businesses,'' Mr. Obama said. All are constituencies important to his political success.
Administration officials suggested that the president had not decided on another issue of interest to American organized labor: whether Colombia has met its commitment to stop violence against unionists in that country. The pledge was a side agreement to the free-trade pact with the United States that was essential to securing union acquiescence to the pact, as well as the votes of Congressional Democrats.
This month, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard L. Trumka, wrote to Mr. Obama urging him not to find that Colombia had met its obligations under the labor agreement.
''We're still working,'' Mr. Obama's deputy national security adviser, Benjamin J. Rhodes, told reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to Cartagena. ''We're hopeful that we can resolve all those issues in the near-term future.''
After a dinner on Friday night hosted by President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, the leaders of the participating countries will hold meetings on Saturday and Sunday. While Mr. Santos and other Latin American leaders also want to discuss economic issues -- and to highlight the growth that has made them more partners than supplicants in their trade and investment relations with the United States -- they are expected to force a discussion Mr. Obama is not eager for in an election year, on decriminalization of drugs.
Their push is based on the widespread belief that the military approach of the American-led war on drugs in the region has failed.
Administration officials, led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on a recent visit to Honduras, have said the White House is willing to listen and to discuss decriminalization, although they underscored Mr. Obama's opposition.

HEADLINE: House Republicans to Tackle Ambitious Budget

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans return from spring recess next week to face the difficult -- some say impossible -- task of filling the gaping holes in the House-passed budget, including figuring out how to slash income tax rates without costing the government any money and finding nearly $3 trillion in savings from entitlement programs over the next decade.
The budget, which passed the House last month and has since become a central focus of the presidential campaign, has faced blistering criticism for steep cuts to federal programs, including a blast from President Obama, who called it ''thinly veiled social Darwinism.'' 
But the deep reductions that Mr. Obama spelled out for higher education, medical research, crime fighting and Head Start are more supposition than reality until the details are filled out. And the charge that such cuts would merely pay for still more tax cuts for the rich is expressly denied by Republican leaders who foresee no change in revenue under the budget.
Now the real work begins. Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the House Ways and Means chairman, will hold meetings with Republican the rank and file next week to map out an overhaul of the tax code that strips it down to just two personal income tax rates -- 25 percent and 10 percent -- and a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, and to pay for it by curtailing or ending tax deductions and credits.
A half-dozen committees will begin drafting legislation to meet a budget-mandated $261 billion in savings over the next decade to stave off scheduled across-the-board cuts to the military in January. First up will be the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, with a bill to curb medical malpractice suits and save the government $39.7 billion over 10 years. On Wednesday, the Financial Services Committee will vote on legislation to save $35 billion over a decade by eliminating a fund designed to prevent future bank bailouts, ending a foreclosure reduction effort, slicing $4.9 billion from the federal flood insurance program, and putting the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under Congressional control and cutting its budget by $5.4 billion.
Also on Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee will draft a measure to save $53 billion over 10 years, in part by grabbing back overpayments for subsidized insurance purchases under the new health care law and by requiring parents to present a Social Security number to claim child care tax credits.
The Agriculture Committee must slice $33.2 billion from its programs, most likely focusing on nutrition and food stamps. The House Energy and Commerce Committee must find nearly $100 billion in savings when it meets in two weeks. Much of it will come from repealing parts of the president's health care law and curbing medical liability lawsuits.
Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, said: ''President Obama's own secretary of defense has said the defense sequester would 'hollow out' our armed forces. We have a responsibility to show a better, smarter option.''
Even with these efforts, critics say the budget is far less groundbreaking than its supporters and opponents say it is. For all his big numbers on spending reductions and tax changes, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, included few details or instructions to make them happen.
The attainability of his deficit reduction targets are ''impossible to know unless you start to describe what kind of cuts are really required,'' said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who supports the ambition of the budget but faults its partisan tilt.
For instance, to meet its deficit reduction targets, the House budget calls for nearly $1.9 trillion in savings from entitlement programs outside Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, so called other mandatory spending, but it instructs committee chairmen to draft legislation securing a tiny fraction of that amount.
The budget describes significant changes to Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. Medicare would be transformed from a government-run insurance program to a menu of private insurance plans subsidized by the government. Medicaid and food stamps would be converted to block grants to the states, which would be allowed to impose work requirements and time limits. But nowhere are the relevant committees mandated to actually draft the legislation to make any of that happen. Mr. Camp has already indicated he has no intention of drafting Medicare legislation that has no chance of becoming law. And Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, has already said he has no intention of passing a budget this year.
The House Appropriations Committee would have to find cuts from domestic discretionary programs through 2022 totaling $1.44 trillion below program growth through inflation, 25 percent, or $1.2 trillion -- 21 percent -- below caps agreed to last summer, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research organization. But that cutting would not kick in until 2014, when appropriators would have to cut domestic spending by 24 percent. For fiscal 2013, the budget that must be finished before the election, the cut is a more manageable 9.8 percent below inflation growth and 7.5 percent below agreed-upon levels.
The two biggest question marks are on a tax overhaul and the black box of ''other mandatory'' cuts. On taxes, collapsing the current six tax brackets into two, with the highest bracket dropping to 25 percent from 35 percent, would cost the Treasury revenue totaling $4.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Democrats and some tax experts say that paying for that with loophole closings cannot be done, unless Republicans plan to gut tax programs for the working poor, like the earned income credit.
But Sage Eastman, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Camp was eager to prove them wrong. Donald Marron, a former Bush administration economist and president of the Tax Policy Center, tallied $7.7 trillion in ''tax expenditures'' over the next five years.
''I'll say emphatically we can do it,'' Mr. Eastman said.

HEADLINE: Texas Board Approves Rules on Use Of Stem Cells

BYLINE: By MINJAE PARK. 
Minjae Park writes for The Texas Tribune, which produces a twice-weekly local section in the Texas editions of The New York Times.

 BODY:
The Texas Medical Board on Friday approved controversial new rules on the use of adult stem cells, raising concerns that Texans could receive therapies that have not yet been proven to work and that could be unsafe.
The new rules allow doctors to perform stem cell procedures as long as they are done for research and receive approval from an institutional review board, which can be private and profit-making. The rules also require that patients sign informed consent forms.
The approval process, which took months, was set off by Gov. Rick Perry, who reported relief from back pain after being injected with his own stem cells last summer before he began his presidential bid. Mr. Perry directed his staff to help push through the legislation on which the new rules are based. 
Researchers said the evidence of success of stem cell injections is anecdotal, and they advocate waiting for clinical trial results before allowing doctors to charge patients for the procedures, which typically cost tens of thousands of dollars.
''I think there are some real problems with these rules,'' said Leigh Turner, a professor at the University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics, who commented on the rules before the board. ''The protective mechanism that they're focusing on isn't going to do very much.''
The rules' supporters acknowledged the need for changes, like a better definition of stem cells, but they said the rules would protect Texas patients more effectively. Procedures are being performed now without oversight.
''Doing something at this point is better than doing nothing,'' said Mario Salinas, director of Texans for Stem Cell Research, adding, ''This is just the first step.''
Mr. Perry received a stem cell injection in July to treat his back pain. That same month, he sent a letter to the medical board chairman commenting on the ''revolutionary potential that adult stem cell research and therapies have on our nation's health, quality of life and economy.'' The rules approved on Friday do not address the use of embryonic stem cells -- a far more controversial procedure that has drawn moral and religious objections.
Though bone marrow transplants, which use blood-forming stem cells, have been used effectively to treat a variety of ailments for decades, experts say other procedures remain experimental. The medical board's proposed rules, which appeared last month in The Texas Register, a state publication, attracted criticism from Nature, the international journal, which wrote in an editorial that the board should ''make clear the need for clinical validation of adult stem cells.''
Because the rules had already been published in The Texas Register and stakeholders had provided feedback, the medical board could not make major changes on Friday and faced a simple choice: accept or reject the rules.
Even some board members who voted to accept the rules agreed that they were not perfect. But they said the rules improved on the current situation by adding a layer of protection for Texas patients.
''Right now, we've got essentially an emergency state, where there are a lot of concerns about the way stem cells are being used,'' said Dr. Stanley Wang, a board member. He added that the new rules add at least the layer of institutional review board approval before a doctor can act.
Dr. William Smythe, a board member who voted against the rules, agreed that guidelines are needed, but objected to the use of the procedures without additional research.
''If Texas wants to be a leader in this area, there are other ways to do this,'' Dr. Smythe said. ''You want to add a layer of protection? Put a moratorium on the use of these agents until they're proven.''

HEADLINE: Rocket Failure May Test Leader of North Korea

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and DAVID E. SANGER; Choe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, and David E. Sanger from Cambridge, Mass. Rick Gladstone and William J. Broad contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- For the new North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, the spectacular failure of a rocket meant to put a satellite into orbit was more than a $1 billion humiliation. It could be the first test of whether anyone will dare challenge his rule, and raises the question, American officials said, of whether he will be tempted to recover by staging a larger provocation.
Mr. Kim wanted to mark his formal ascension to top political power -- timed to the country's biggest holiday in decades, the 100th anniversary of the birth of his grandfather and North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung -- with fireworks, real and symbolic. Instead, the rocket carrying the satellite splintered harmlessly into the gray-blue waters of the Yellow Sea, and the North Korean government apparently concluded it had no choice but to tell its citizens the embarrassing news, which was bound to get around in a country that now has at least one million cellphones. It was the first time the country had admitted such a defeat. 
For President Obama and his allies, though, the bigger question was not the fate of an aging rocket technology, but the future of a young dictator. The failure injected new unpredictability at an already uncertain time, when Kim Jong-un is trying to consolidate power, and raised new questions only weeks after Mr. Obama suggested that it was unclear who was really running North Korea.
There was considerable speculation on Friday among American and South Korean officials that Mr. Kim and his military, to re-establish some credibility, would stage a new nuclear test, for which preparations have been evident on satellite photographs for several weeks. ''The North Koreans have tended to pursue patterns of provocative actions,'' Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told reporters aboard Air Force One.
The embarrassment means the United States probably has more time before it has to worry about the North's ability to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile, one that could reach the West Coast. Until now, the American assessment had been that the North could have that capability within five years. (The technology to launch a small satellite into orbit is virtually identical to the missile technology to launch a warhead, so the rocket failure Friday suggests problems with the missile program.)
But American officials said that was little solace. There is a risk, even if a remote one, that the North will repeat the kind of attacks on a border island and a South Korean Navy vessel in 2010 for which it has been blamed.
The very fact that the rocket test happened meant that the young Mr. Kim, believed to be about 28, was either willing to defy China, which warned against the test, or was overruled by others in the power structure. The first option is worrisome, because it would suggest that, as the Chinese claim, they have very little influence. The second could suggest a struggle for influence, if not actual leadership. In an opaque country that is fiercely armed and is believed to have a half-dozen or more nuclear weapons or the plutonium to produce them, the idea of power struggles makes officials nervous.
''Frankly,'' one senior American intelligence official said before the launching's failure, ''I'd rather have an unstable Kim Jong-un in charge than a free-for-all where you are wondering who's really in control of the arsenal.''
Recent machinations over a deal in which the North promised to suspend some nuclear work for American food aid, then reneged quickly on a pledge to suspend long-range missile tests, at least raised the possibility that such a power struggle could be under way. And despite American officials' worries, there is one situation in which it could lead to more moderate behavior: if the failed missile launching emboldens those who have long believed in reaching some accord with the West and now can make the case that hard-liners fumbled the provocation, which in the end scuttled the agreement to bring in much-needed food.
The launching drew swift, if predictable and somewhat toothless, international condemnation; the United Nations Security Council has prohibited such tests by the North for years, and Pyongyang has ignored it for just as long. But whatever steps the Security Council takes are likely to be weak -- there are few sanctions left that have not already been attempted, and there are fears that stronger action could simply push the North to conduct a nuclear test, as it has done when condemned in the past.
Despite the embarrassing setback, Mr. Kim was installed hours after the rocket fizzled as the new head of the National Defense Commission, his country's highest state agency, during a parliamentary meeting. That was the last among the top military, party and state posts that have been transferred to him after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in December.
For the launching, North Korea has recently completed a new site near the western border with China -- at a cost of $400 million, according to South Korean estimates. The rocket itself cost another $450 million, the South Korean government believes. And the lost American food aid was estimated to be worth $200 million, driving the effective cost of the test above $1 billion in a country that cannot feed its own people.
The rocket reached only about 94 miles in altitude, far less than the 310 miles required to place a satellite into orbit and, as North Korean officials liked to say, present ''a gift'' to the closest the North Koreans have to a deity: Kim Il-sung.
In a socialist country steeped in the traditions of a Confucian dynasty, it is of paramount importance for the country's new leader to embellish his rise to power with events that show his loyalty to his forefathers while demonstrating his own abilities to lead, analysts said. This launching was supposed to represent that moment: Both Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il, ever fearful of an attack from the United States, had dreamed of North Korea having an effective nuclear deterrent, and that requires functioning missiles that could be fitted with weapons and reach the West.
''The main drive behind the rocket launch was domestic politics,'' said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul and a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. ''They wanted to introduce the Kim Jong-un era with a big celebratory bang. They wanted to make their people believe that they were now a powerful nation.''
The government, more famous for shutting off its country from the outside world, had intensified the prelaunching publicity. It trumpeted the satellite program as a key achievement of Kim Jong-un's, claiming that he had personally directed a previous satellite launching in 2009. It also invited dozens of foreign journalists to visit the launching site and command and control center.
South Korea did not lose the opportunity to jab at the North's hurt pride. ''It is very regrettable that North Korea is spending enormous resources on developing nuclear and missile capabilities while ignoring the urgent welfare issue of the North Korean people,'' said its foreign minister, Kim Sung-hwan.
Others were struck by the enormous loss of face for the country's leadership.
''It is hard to imagine a greater humiliation,'' a North Korea expert, Marcus Noland, wrote on his blog at the Web site of the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
''The North Koreans have managed in a single stroke to not only defy the U.N. Security Council, the United States and even their patron China, but also demonstrate ineptitude,'' Mr. Noland wrote. ''Some of the scientists and engineers associated with the launch are likely facing death or the gulag as scapegoats for this embarrassment.''
Launching failures are not uncommon even for rich and technologically advanced nations. ''This stuff is really hard to do,'' David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., said in an interview.
But in the myth-filled world of the Kim dynasty, there is little room for failure. The North's two previous attempts to put a satellite into orbit failed, according to American officials, but both times the government insisted that the satellites were circling the earth, broadcasting songs about its great leaders.
Why the government changed its strategy this time, and told its people what happened, remains one of many unknowns about the North. Some analysts attributed it to the realization that the news would seep into the country anyway with so many cellphones smuggled from China, and North Korean merchants regularly crossing the Chinese border to bring home goods in short supply at home. Others speculated that it could not keep up a pretense with so many foreign reporters on hand.
One thing that is certain: the timing could not have been worse. The government announcement on television interrupted a show staged specifically to celebrate Kim Il-sung's centenary. The show's theme: his guiding principle of juche, or self-reliance, in defiance of the world.

HEADLINE: City's Top Technology Official Resigns Amid Clashes Over Troubled Projects

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
New York City's chief technology official resigned after clashing repeatedly with a deputy mayor over the management of several costly, ambitious and troubled projects that have bedeviled the Bloomberg administration, people briefed on the confrontations said on Friday.
The departure of the technology official, Carole Post, was announced on Thursday, a day before Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the city would challenge a judge's order to release what is said to be a sharply critical consultant's report on an over-budget, much-delayed modernization of the city's emergency calls and dispatching system. 
The 911 system overhaul was one of a number of technology projects that were signature initiatives of the Bloomberg administration, but encountered cost overruns and performance issues.
City Hall aides said Ms. Post, who is the commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, should not be blamed for the mismanagement of the $2.3 billion 911 project, whose woes predated her arrival in the job by several years.
But the city's deputy mayor for operations, Caswell F. Holloway, grew increasingly frustrated by and impatient with Ms. Post's department's work on major initiatives, individuals involved in the city's technology operation said.
Mr. Holloway, in a telephone interview, denied that he had lost confidence in Ms. Post, but acknowledged, ''We ask tough questions.''
''She and I have a very good working relationship,'' he said. ''Carole has the same high standards for projects that I do.''
Ms. Post, who is to remain in her job until her replacement is named, is leaving, the city said, to become an executive vice president and the first chief strategy officer at New York Law School, where Mayor Bloomberg's former counsel, Anthony W. Crowell, is president and dean.
Efforts to reach her Friday were unsuccessful; a City Hall spokesman said she was traveling out of the country.
Mr. Holloway said Ms. Post was leaving only because of the attractiveness of the law school's job offer.
''Look, people are going to take great opportunities as they come, and you know, this is an example of that,'' he said.
But in meetings over several months last year and as recently as March 27, people briefed on them said, Mr. Holloway, a hard-charging infighter who formerly led the city's Department of Environmental Protection, voiced concerns about the cost of an upgrade to CityNet, the city's internal data network; continuing problems and shortcomings with CitiServ, a data center that was supposed to consolidate dozens of city agency servers; and a shortage of users for NYCWin, a secure municipal wireless network.
The wireless network, for example, which cost $500 million to build and costs $40 million a year to operate, is underused and arguably outdated.
CityNet has experienced interruptions in service, despite a system of redundant fiber optic rings intended to enable it to withstand a breakdown. And the $95 million CitiServ project has confounded agency officials, with DoITT struggling to migrate old systems into the new data center.
The technology department is officially referred to by its acronym, DoITT, but is sometimes derided as ''Don't Do It'' by city workers who seek to avoid working with the department.
Mr. Holloway pressed Ms. Post repeatedly on how the department's record of outages and incidents compared with the private sector. And he insisted that she come to meetings accompanied by lower-level managers who could give specific answers to his detailed questions; a change in practice when compared with her warm one-on-one meetings with Mr. Holloway's predecessor as deputy mayor, Stephen Goldsmith.
Ms. Post handled Mr. Holloway's interrogations ''stoically,'' said a DoITT staff member who was briefed on the conversations, but others in the department, the staff member said, described feeling ''annihilated'' by them.
In December, Mr. Holloway requested a 90-day study by McKinsey, the consulting firm, of how the city manages technology projects. Mr. Holloway asked the city's Economic Development Corporation to hire McKinsey to do the study, saying that the consultants brought special expertise to the job because they had worked on CitiServ earlier. On Dec. 24, its minutes show, the corporation retroactively granted its president the power to hire McKinsey on a sole-source basis, without competition.
A draft of the McKinsey report recommends that DoITT be left in charge of areas where it does well, like supporting users and maintaining systems, but questions the agency's ability to guide major technological changes, according to people who have been told about the report.
Mr. Holloway said Friday that DoITT would ''continue to have a role'' in overseeing the city's information-technology infrastructure ''and some role in overall IT project management,'' though he said there ''could be some adjustment of certain elements of what's where.''
In a radio appearance Friday morning, Mr. Bloomberg dismissed the pending report about the city's emergency system as ''just a bunch of stuff thrown together'' and said media coverage of his fight to suppress it was exaggerated and ''ginned up'' by city labor unions.
But the continued problems, and the departure of Mr. Bloomberg's third DoITT chief, highlighted what some observers say is the mayor's disappointing performance on technology projects. Mr. Bloomberg earned his billions by introducing information technology to the financial world, and he has not been shy about promoting his competence in technical matters.
To Fred Siegel, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who studies city politics, that makes City Hall's technology hiccups ''all the odder.''
''If it occurred with someone else, you could understand it,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''But Bloomberg made his money this way; these are matters he understands deeply.''
''No mayor could be in a better position to do these things,'' Mr. Siegel added, ''so his inability to do so is hard to fathom.''

HEADLINE: Ducking The Crisis In Medicare

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner, a contributing opinion writer, was a counselor to the Treasury secretary in the , Obama administration.

 BODY:
NESTLED within the many commendable aspects of President Obama's health care plan -- including the individual mandate -- sits a problem that has gone virtually unnoticed by commentators obsessed with the Supreme Court's review of the law: how to pay for it.
About 65 percent of the cost of the Obama health care law is supposed to be met by Medicare expense reductions and tax increases totaling roughly $1 trillion over 10 years. The deficiency with this plan is that it amounts to double-counting, using urgently needed Medicare economies to finance the new law. 
Don't get me wrong: We need to extract all sensible savings from Medicare and consider revenue increases to ensure its solvency as baby boomers swell its rolls. Thanks to escalating health care costs and repeated sweetening of benefits without commensurate increases in revenues, Medicare was underfinanced by a staggering $37 trillion as of Sept. 30.
That's the amount -- about two and a half times the annual output of the United States economy -- that would have to be deposited into the Medicare trust funds to adhere to the principle that members of each generation would contribute enough to Medicare while they were working to pay for their care after age 65.
But the politics of Medicare have been poisonous, so toxic that Democrats haven't been willing to engage seriously on the issue, while Republicans have advanced a proposal that would eviscerate Medicare rather than preserve it.
The current effort to trim Medicare costs, through initiatives like limiting payment increases to health care providers, amounts to picking the low-hanging fruit. What comes next will surely be more painful and contentious.
Given that context, the government's accounting practice -- counting $748 billion of cost savings and $259 billion of revenue increases toward both Medicare and the cost of the Obama plan -- is particularly troubling. Moreover, this problem is largely hidden from public view.
Under Washington's delusional rules, budget crunchers in both the White House and Congress credit this $1 trillion twice: once in calculating that the care law will generate more revenues than costs, and again in concluding that the Obama plan will chip away at the Medicare problem.
Unfortunately, the real world does not permit the luxury of double-counting. The truth is that the law will either be fully paid for or it will begin to address the Medicare problem -- but not both.
There's no doubt that both parties have similarly gamed the system over the years. Back in 1997, $247 billion of expected Medicare savings was funneled into tax cuts and a children's health plan as part of a deficit reduction package negotiated by President Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker.
That bit of history merits close attention, because those efforts to cap reimbursements to providers proved unrealistic and were mostly never realized.
While the Obama legislation employs cutting-edge ideas for managing Medicare's outlays, the program can't be saved just by squeezing reimbursement rates to hospitals, laboratories and the like. In assessing the new law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services warned of exactly these risks.
To properly address the competing needs of the Affordable Care Act and Medicare, let's start with more transparency. The government should act like a company that provides investors with separate profit and loss data for different divisions -- without double-counting. Next we need a better plan for financing the health care law, which will be challenging because actually paying for federal programs (that is, increasing taxes) has become a no-go zone in Washington.
That's further complicated by the admirably redistributionist nature of the Obama law. The preponderance of the Affordable Care Act's costs go toward extending insurance coverage to an estimated 30 million Americans making less than $44,000 per year (or $89,000 per year for a family of four), about 10 percent of the population.
Meanwhile, a hefty chunk of the new revenues comes from increased taxes on the earnings and other income (like dividends and interest) of affluent individuals, and an excise tax on employers offering so-called Cadillac health plans.
It's fine to ask the wealthiest to pay disproportionately for important social programs. But the top taxpayers, who are already on the hook for around $260 billion of the law's costs, can't be expected to shoulder the entire $1 trillion burden that would flow from intellectually honest accounting.
At a time of trillion-dollar deficits, new initiatives must be paid for in reality, not just the world of Washington arithmetic. The effort to curb Medicare costs must continue and accelerate -- but all sides need to be more honest by counting these savings just once, not twice.

HEADLINE: Why North Korea's Rocket Mattered

BYLINE: By SUNG-YOON LEE. 
Sung-Yoo Lee is a scholar of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts.

 BODY:
MEDFORD, Mass.
SPECTACULAR failure though it was, North Korea's latest rocket launching calls for punitive measures from America and its allies. Bad engineering is no reason for complacency; the benchmark for American policy must be North Korea's intent. And for decades, that government has been determined to develop nuclear-tipped long-range missiles that would give it leverage over the United States on a host of issues.
It's predictable that the misfire has triggered over-analysis and scapegoating, with calls for calm and tales of an internal power struggle between ''hawks'' and ''doves'' in the new Kim Jong-un government. Others say America and South Korea should re-engage the government in Pyongyang. Both views ignore the fact that Kim Jong-un is following a path of alternating provocations and peace offensives paved by his grandfather Kim Il-sung and perfected by his father, Kim Jong-il. 
No government enjoys total unanimity. But the notion that in totalitarian North Korea, a few disgruntled military men might put their foot down and reverse a course of engagement set by their leader is foolish. It ignores the nature of the power structure in the North. For more than a half-century, the Kim clan has kept the military in line through vicious purges, competition that fosters loyalty to the leader, selective rewards and a multilayered security apparatus. While a military clique may one day challenge or even overthrow Kim Jong-un, the notion that the military wields a veto now is a mirage that plays into North Korea's stratagems.
And for those inclined to believe that the North can be persuaded to change its behavior with inducements, consider this: Except for the invasion of the South in 1950, North Korea has never suffered a lasting or devastating penalty for its many attacks and provocations. On the contrary, it has often been rewarded for false pledges.
From January 1968 to December 1969, North Korea acted with impunity: It sent commandos into Seoul in a failed effort to kill the South Korean president, Park Chung-hee; it seized the United States Navy spy ship Pueblo and its crew, killing one sailor and holding 82 prisoners for 11 months until it got an apology from the Johnson administration; it shot down an American reconnaissance plane, killing 31 servicemen aboard, on Kim Il-sung's birthday in 1969; and it ambushed and killed four American soldiers patrolling the military demarcation line in October 1969.
A thaw followed in the early 1970s, thanks to American rapprochement with China. Talks between North and South ensued. Kim Il-sung called for diplomatic talks with America. But then North Korea resumed attacks. In 1974 it made another attempt on President Park's life, in which his wife died. In 1976 North Korean guards hacked two American soldiers to death.
In 1983, as North Korea sought talks with America, its agents targeted the South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan, with a bomb in Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar). He survived, but 17 other South Korean officials died. In 1998 North Korea fired a missile over Japan while America, South Korea and Japan were sending energy aid. In 2006 it test-fired a long-range missile on July 5 and staged its first nuclear test three months later. In 2009, it launched a long-range rocket in April and tested a nuclear device on Memorial Day.
In all of these episodes, North Korea was never penalized in any meaningful way. Indeed, several provocations were followed by blandishments -- rewards, in effect -- in the form of food, fuel and cash from North Korea's risk-averse adversaries in Seoul and Washington.
This record shows that North Korea doesn't respond to either rhetorical hostility or diplomatic civility. Its latest ballistic stunt followed a long pattern of ignoring outside warnings. But the American response should not also be the usual -- strong on rhetorical condemnation, weak on punitive action and generous in damage-control concessions. North Korea clearly seeks to continue this profitable cycle by dangling before America the possibility of denuclearization, even as it conducts missile and nuclear tests.
Now, as Kim Jong-un is believed to be preparing for another nuclear test, the question remains how much longer America and its allies will take before devising a new collective strategy -- one that does not settle for short-term diplomatic gains at the cost of long-term strategic interests.
They can start by responding to the failed launching on Friday as if it had succeeded. The Obama administration is correct to cancel food shipments, which were contingent on a halt to missile and nuclear tests. But it should go further and act with its allies to hit the Kim government itself -- by tightening economic sanctions aimed at the privileged few at the top of the Kim dynasty's power structure; by not relenting in that pressure for the mere privilege of talking with North Korea; and by taking new measures to counter the propaganda apparatus with which the government controls the long-suffering North Korean people.
That may not stem North Korea's provocations in the short term. But the alternative is, at best, another half-century of putting up with provocations from the North or, far worse, a major nuclear crisis that ends in a devastating war.

HEADLINE: Political Memo: His Attack Plan Set, Obama Seeks Positives

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
President Obama's campaign has left no doubt about how it intends to run against Mitt Romney, portraying him as a bazillionaire elitist and conviction-free flip-flopper who has allied himself with the Republican Party's most extreme positions.
-After a year in which he was excoriated on an almost-daily basis by Mr. Romney and the others seeking the Republican nomination, Mr. Obama is now letting loose his competitive, street-ball side, mocking his opponent's vocabulary and suggesting a Republican victory would lead to social Darwinism. The comments by a Democratic strategist Wednesday night about Ann Romney's work history were condemned by Mr. Obama and his inner circle but only reinforced the sense that a lot Democrats are primed to play rough in 2012.
To conservatives, it is all just more evidence that hope and change was never more than bait-and-switch. To some liberals, it is about time the White House showed a willingness to brawl. Moderates and independents who had hoped for some ideological accommodation have long since resigned themselves to an era of post-postpartisanship. 
But the edgier and more negative tone coming from the president's re-election is highlighting another issue. Successful campaigns tell positive stories even while they are in knife fights, and even as it steps up an effort to define Mr. Romney on its terms, the White House is working to make a positive case for Mr. Obama, one built around themes of fairness and security.
Judging by the difficulties he has had selling his policies and himself for the last three years, going positive in an effective way could prove to be more challenging for Mr. Obama than going negative.
It was almost an article of faith among Democrats following the 2008 election that Mr. Obama would hold an inherent advantage over Republicans in his ability to inspire voters.
Yet the same man who even in the view of his opponents spoke eloquently to the nation's yearning for a new direction in the last campaign has proved inconsistent after taking office when it came to summoning goose-bump-inspiring magic.
He and his team were soundly defeated in the messaging wars with conservatives when it came to his two signature pieces of legislation, the economic stimulus bill and the health care overhaul. In key battles, liberals faulted him as being too timid, moderates and independents as exceeding the mandate voters had given him. New slogans came and went with the seasons.
The president even lost the ability at times to define himself on his terms, leaving him fending off accusations that he was foreign born, a socialist, a Muslim and an apologist for the United States. By turns pragmatic and ideological, he struggled to find a clear, coherent narrative to explain to the American people what he stood for and where he was leading them.
All of which makes his effort to articulate a reason why voters should give him another four years -- other than the fact he is not Mr. Romney -- even more vital to his prospects. And in a series of speeches beginning late last year and getting more attention in recent weeks, he has tested the following strategies and themes he is now carrying into the general election.
RAISE THE STAKES - It is axiomatic that incumbents who have presided over tough times want to avoid having the election be a referendum on their performance and seek instead to frame it as a choice between competing visions. In Mr. Obama's case, that means making the election not about still-high unemployment rates and month-to-month job growth but about something much bigger: the best way to assure the future of the middle class and the American dream of upward mobility.
''This is the defining issue of our time,'' Mr. Obama said in a speech in Florida this week, stressing policy initiatives that would make the rules of the game more ''fair'' to those being left behind in what he described as a rich-get-richer economy. ''This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and everybody who's aspiring to get into the middle class.''
REBUT THE RIGHT - Mr. Obama has long since given up on his initial strategy of ignoring the sometimes baseless but often effective conservative criticism against him. His public appearances now feature statements that amount to specific rebuttals of that criticism and efforts to define him as mainstream in his background and values.
To the assertion that he is a socialist: ''I believe deeply that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history.'' To claims that he does not believe in American exceptionalism: ''Nobody does it better,'' he said, referring to the ability of the United States to compete in the global economy. To the implication that he is somehow not a real American or does not share core American values: ''My mother and the grandparents who raised me instilled the values of self-reliance and personal responsibility that remain the cornerstone of the American idea.''
TURN LIABILITIES TO ASSETS - If the unemployment rate is a symptom of the economic problems that threaten Mr. Obama's re-election, the broader underlying cause is the sense among voters that economic upheaval has left them vulnerable and that it is harder for most people to get ahead. Rather than trying to convince voters that things really aren't so bad, Mr. Obama is increasingly embracing their angst and trying to turn it to his advantage by talking about his agenda as one that will increase their security.
''What, if anything, can we do to restore a sense of security for people who are willing to work hard and act responsibly in this country?'' he asked in a speech last week.
THREAD THE NEEDLE - In 2008, Mr. Obama assembled a broad coalition of liberals and moderates to propel him to an easy victory. But he faces a more difficult task this time energizing the left, which is looking for reassurance that he is dedicated to progressive issues, while also appealing to the center, which wants to see partisanship in Washington give way to results.
Here, he is still working to find the right balance, reflecting the challenge for both parties of coping with a politics of austerity.
His dire assessment of the effects of the Republican budget proposed by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin signaled to liberals, following his failed negotiations for a budget deal with the Republican leadership, that he will fight aggressively against deep spending cuts. But his tone - making fun of Mr. Romney for calling the Ryan budget ''marvelous'' and suggesting that Republicans would pit Americans against each other in a fight for survival - drew criticism from some centrist quarters.
So he has begun invoking Republicans - Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Eisenhower most frequently - in the service of progressive goals, from regulating the financial and corporate worlds to building roads and improving education.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama, Like Buffett, Had Lower Tax Rate Than His Secretary

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For months, President Obama has marveled that the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, citing it as an egregious example of an unjust tax code. It turns out that another famous and well-compensated American does, too: Mr. Obama.
The president and his wife, Michelle Obama, reported adjusted gross income of $789,674 in 2011, and paid just over 20 percent of it in federal taxes, according to income tax returns and gift-tax returns released by the White House on Friday. The White House confirmed that Mr. Obama's secretary, Anita Decker Breckenridge, paid a ''slightly higher'' tax rate than her boss in 2011, on a salary of $95,000. 
That, said a spokeswoman, Amy Brundage, ''is exactly why we need to reform our tax code and ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share.''
On Monday, at the president's urging, the Senate will take up the proposed ''Buffett Rule,'' a minimum tax for the wealthiest Americans. In his references to Mr. Buffett and his secretary, Mr. Obama always notes that like Mr. Buffett, he has done well, does not need tax loopholes, and could afford to pay more.
In fact, the president's income declined nearly $1 million from the previous year, when he was reaping larger amounts from sales of his best-selling books. Although he is still comfortably in the 1 percent, he has fallen out of the $1 million-a-year bracket that would make him subject to the Buffett Rule.
It goes to show how a tax filing can be sliced and diced, particularly in an election year in which Mr. Obama has taken up taxes and economic inequality as a cudgel in his battle with his likely Republican opponent, Mitt Romney.
The Obama campaign -- which posted Mr. Obama's tax return on its Web site along with his previous 10 returns -- assailed Mr. Romney for his refusal to disclose more about his taxes. The campaign has also drawn attention to the tax rates paid by Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, who derive the bulk of their income from investments, which is taxed at a lower rate than wage income.
''On the eve of April 17th, Governor Romney has yet to provide tax returns from the period in which he made hundreds of millions as a corporate buyout specialist,'' the Obama campaign manager, Jim Messina, said in a statement. ''Mitt Romney's defiance of decades of precedent set by presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle, including his own father, begs the question -- what does he have to hide?''
Late on Friday, Mr. Romney's campaign announced that he had filed with the Internal Revenue Service for a six-month extension to file his 2011 return. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman, said Mr. Romney would file his return ''sometime in the next six months, and prior to the election.'' It will be filed, she said, when ''there is sufficient information to provide an accurate return.''
In January, under pressure from his Republican rivals, Mr. Romney released documents estimating that he had earned $20.9 million in 2011 and paid about $3.2 million in taxes, for an effective tax rate of about 15.4 percent. On a form requesting the extension, he estimated his taxes to be $3,226,623.
In 2011, Mr. Obama and his wife reported paying $162,074 in income taxes, an effective tax rate of 20.5 percent. That is a lower rate than in 2010, when the Obamas reported paying $453,770 in federal taxes on adjusted gross income of $1,728,096 -- an effective tax rate of just over 26 percent.
It is also lower than the rate paid by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose returns were also released Friday. Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, reported adjusted gross income of $379,035 and paid $87,900 in federal tax, an effective tax rate of 23 percent. That is roughly the same as what the couple reported last year.
In a statement, the White House suggested that Mr. Obama believed he should pay a higher rate, noting that his administration is pushing the Buffett Rule to ''ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share while protecting families making under $250,000 from seeing their taxes go up.''
The Obamas reported donating $172,130 -- about 22 percent of their adjusted gross income -- to 39 charities. Their largest donation was a contribution of $117,130 to the Fisher House Foundation. Mr. Obama gives after-tax proceeds from his children's book to a scholarship fund for the children of fallen and disabled soldiers.
The president's large number of charitable donations reduced his effective tax rate since they are deducted from taxable income, but not from his adjusted gross income. Mr. Obama still earned about half his income from book sales, the White House said in a statement, though those sales are down.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about personal tax disclosures by President Obama and his rival candidate, Mitt Romney, described imprecisely the reason for Mr. Romney's relatively low effective tax rate. The bulk of his earnings came from investment income that is taxed at preferential rates; it was not from ordinary interest, which is usually taxed at higher rates.

HEADLINE: Party May Be Long-Term Loser in Chinese Scandal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and SHARON LaFRANIERE; Jonathan Ansfield and Didi Kirsten Tatlow contributed reporting, and Li Bibo contributed research.

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
BEIJING -- The scandal that climaxed here on Tuesday when Communist Party leaders suspended the Politburo member Bo Xilai and accused his wife of murder seems poised to destroy a charismatic party leader who challenged President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's vision for China.
But for the Chinese leaders who purged Mr. Bo, there are threats as well. 
In the view of some analysts and party insiders, that same scandal has raised the notion of high-level misconduct among China's elite to a level that some say could have far-reaching and unpleasant implications for stability. It could cast a long shadow over one of the party's linchpins: the notion that a handful of all-powerful officials and retired elders are better qualified to pick their successors than are ordinary citizens.
''I think that this could have a deep and delegitimizing impact on China, not now, but in the long run,'' Joseph Fewsmith, a Boston University scholar of elite Chinese politics, said of the Bo family scandals.
''This has got to be shocking to the people of China,'' he said. ''I think the party has lost a lot of credibility.''
How revelations of murder and potential cover-up in the party's highest echelons will resonate is unclear. But it seems plain that Mr. Bo's rivals within the elite are trying to make the most of his travails.
To date, the party's vague wording indicates that Mr. Bo is at least accused of obstructing justice in the investigation of his wife, Gu Kailai, and that Ms. Gu faces homicide charges. Ms. Gu stands accused of ordering the murder of a British businessman and onetime family friend, Neil Heywood, after a business dispute that belies Mr. Bo's assurance last month that she was but a housewife and helpmate.
But an emerging drip of corruption-related disclosures this week, largely in a Chinese news media that normally exists in a state-dictated chokehold, points to an orchestrated campaign to paint Mr. Bo and his relatives as mired in graft and greed.
The effect could be to neuter a politician whose populist policies of wealth redistribution and corruption-fighting had endeared him to citizens of Chongqing, where he was the Communist Party secretary until last month, and were gaining traction elsewhere in the nation.
''It was very brutal, very tough,'' said Jing Huang, a scholar of Chinese politics who heads the Center on Asia and Globalization at the National University of Singapore. ''This sends a message to anyone who is behind Bo to back off. They are making Bo the poster child of corruption and crime.''
Beyond Mr. Bo's destruction, however, lies a larger question of how China's leaders address a growing perception that this is a society rotting from the top, an impression that the spectacular Bo scandal can only reinforce.
The state-controlled capitalism pushed by Chinese leaders has created an economic colossus, but at the cost of a steadily widening gap in both wealth and privilege between the rich and poor. Mr. Bo, though generally a supporter of the Chinese economic model, sought to build a political base made of ardent socialists by emphasizing the need to ensure more social welfare for the middle and lower classes.
Citizens are both boiling over about and wearily resigned to corruption and impunity among their elites, a ubiquitous topic on the microblogs that increasingly are the national water cooler.
High-level corruption within China is not a rarity. In the last 17 years, the party bosses of Beijing and Shanghai have been removed and later imprisoned for graft. Internal cables from the United States Embassy in Beijing, released last year by the WikiLeaks project, detailed allegations of favoritism at the government's highest levels.
In the Politburo's all-powerful Standing Committee, for example, they suggest that Mr. Bo's foremost patron Zhou Yongkang is tied to China's oil industry, that Jia Qinglin, the nation's fourth-ranked leader, is linked to Beijing real estate and the wife of the prime minister, Mr. Wen, is a major figure in gem trading.
Mr. Bo's downfall has far broader resonance, not only because it involves a leading national figure and murder -- and murder of a foreigner, no less -- but because such scandals can no longer be confined, even in China's walled-off cyberworld.
The Communist Party is doing all it can to cast the case in the opposite light: that the party should be congratulated for confronting accusations of murder against the spouse of a Politburo member and meting out justice with an even hand.
Chinese officials said this week that they had closed 42 Web sites and censored 210,000 online comments since mid-March in a campaign to suppress ''Internet-based rumors,'' a principal target of an online crackdown related to the Bo family scandal. But in a wired world, even ordinary Chinese increasingly know better.
Some experts, like Mr. Fewsmith of Boston University, compare the Bo scandal to the case of Lin Biao, a hero of the Communist revolution whom Mao Zedong once tapped as his successor, but who died in a suspicious plane crash after a falling-out. Mr. Lin's death, he said, was a tipping point for many Chinese who decided that Mao's aim was not to better people's lives, but to gain still more power.
The Bo affair presents China's leadership with a crucial and similar choice between burying serious political problems and settling them openly, said Cheng Li, a scholar of China's leadership at the Brookings Institution.
''It's not about ideological disputes. It's not about Bo's personality or his ego or his ambition. It's about the very legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party,'' Mr. Li said. ''People will ask, 'How can it be possible that a soon-to-be top leader of the country could be involved in a murder?' How the system could produce this kind of crisis is a wake-up call.''
Online Correction: April 14, 2012, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the span of time over which the Communist Party bosses of Beijing and Shanghai were removed from their posts and imprisoned. It was in the last 17 years, not in the last decade.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Taxes

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and the weekend happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
It turns out that President Obama's secretary paid a "slightly higher" tax rate than her boss in 2011, Mark Landler reports. The disparity shows how a tax filing can be sliced and diced, particularly in an election year in which Mr. Obama has taken up taxes and economic inequality as ammunition in his battle with his likely Republican opponent, Mitt Romney.

        
House Republicans return from spring recess next week to face the difficult task of filling the gaping holes in the House-passed budget, Jonathan Weisman reports. It has become a central focus of the presidential campaign, criticized for deep cuts to federal programs and blasted by President Obama as "thinly veiled social Darwinism."

        
Mitt Romney touched a fundamental nervewith the National Rifle Association on Friday: its fear that a second term for President Obama would give him another chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice, Trip Gabriel writes. Mr. Romney's speech at the annual gathering was also aimed at closing a bit of the culture gap with gun owners, and securing support from a powerful group that has not always warmed up to him.
Weekly Address

        
With the deadline approaching for Americans to file their taxes, President Obama used his weekly address to make another push for Congress to pass the "Buffett Rule," which would ensure that the wealthiest Americans pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes. "Right now, we've got significant deficits to close," he said. "We've got serious investments to make to keep our economy growing. And it's about whether we as a country are willing to pay for those investments." The Buffett Rule is also about addressing inequality in the nation's tax code, a theme the White House will carry into campaign season. "That's all there is to it," Mr. Obama said. "It's pretty sensible. Most Americans support this idea. One survey found that two-thirds of millionaires do, too. So do nearly half of all Republicans. We just need some Republican politicians to get on board with where the country is."
Around the Web

        
Bella Santorum, 3-year-old daughter of Rick Santorum, is the National Rifle Association's newest member, Politico reports.
Happenings in Washington

        
A wreath will be laid Saturday in front of Ford's Theater to commemorate the 147th anniversary of President Lincoln's assassination.

        
The annual "Blessing of the Fleets" ceremony will be held at the United States Navy Memorial on Saturday afternoon.

HEADLINE: Sunday Breakfast Menu, April 15

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Timothy F. Geithner, Reince Priebus and President Obama join the Sunday shows this week to talk about the economy and the presidential race. 

 BODY:
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, joins three Sunday shows this week and will discuss March's jobs report and the Obama administration's proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy. He will appear on ABC's "This Week," NBC's "Meet the Press" and CBS's "Face the Nation."
With President Obama in Colombia meeting with leaders at the Summit of the Americas, Univision's "Al Punto" and Telemundo's "Enfoque" will air interviews with Mr. Obama, discussing the summit meeting as well as immigration, the economy and the presidential race.
The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, joins CNN's "State of the Union" to talk about unifying his party after Rick Santorum's decision last week to end his presidential bid. Mr. Priebus will also be on Univision to weigh in on the importance of the Hispanic vote, which Republicans are targeting with Hispanic directors in six battleground states.
As Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama start focusing on the general election, two of their top advisers - Ed Gillespie from Mr. Romney's campaign and David Axelrod from Mr. Obama's - meet on "Fox News Sunday" to talk about the race. Also, David Plouffe, senior White House adviser, will be on Bloomberg's "Political Capital."
Meanwhile, the shows are buzzing about the fight for women voters. The battle intensified last week when a Democratic strategist criticized Ann Romney, reviving the debate over the politics of motherhood. On NBC, Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, and Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, talk about how the gender gap will affect the presidential race, while CNN features Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington.
On CBS, Senator John McCain of Arizona, former presidential nominee, weighs in on the battle for women voters. Mr. McCain, who is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will also share his views on the recent developments in Syria and the failed rocket launch in North Korea.
Talking about the hotly contested Senate races this year, Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Rob Jesmer, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, join C-Span's "Newsmakers."
And with George Zimmerman in custody and charged with second-degree murder in the Trayvon Martin case, the actor Bill Cosby will talk about the shooting on CNN. TV One's "Washington Watch" will also feature a discussion of the case.

HEADLINE: Serene, for all Its Hip-Hop Cred

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
SINCE 1962, Anita Friday's home on 205th Place has provided her a vantage point for the waves of change that have come in succession to Hollis, her family's corner of Queens. At the start the population was predominantly white, said Ms. Friday, 80, who is black, and who recalled that over her first decade as a resident, most of her white neighbors moved away to Long Island.
Even as the racial makeup shifted, though, Hollis kept hold of its essence as an orderly and largely working-class community -- one where people ride a bus to the subway to get to work, and where houses and lots are small, and most lawns neatly trimmed.
Ms. Friday is a former president of her block association and a retired federal government employee. Her husband, Reedy, who died in 2002, worked for TWA at Kennedy Airport. Neighbors, she said, have included postal and subway workers. In recent years, they have come from farther-flung places: Haiti, Panama, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic. 
A few blocks away on 205th Street, Ava Winston, who has lived in Queens all her life, said she had moved to Hollis about four years ago so her children could be within walking distance of school.
''The blocks are pretty quiet,'' she said. ''Everybody around here works.''
Ms. Winston's street is also known as Run-DMC JMJ Way, after the rap group, which made the neighborhood famous with songs like ''Christmas in Hollis'' and ''Hollis Crew.'' Joseph Simmons, known in the group as Run, grew up on the street, as did his brother Russell Simmons, the music impresario, who has recalled Hollis in the 1970s and '80s as a middle-class neighborhood increasingly plagued by drugs. Run-DMC's D.J., Jason Mizell -- also known as Jam Master Jay -- lived in the area until his murder in 2002 in nearby Jamaica. One side of the Hollis Superette, on the corner of 205th Street and Hollis Avenue, bears a mural commemorating his life.
Yvonne Reddick, the district manager of Community Board 12, which represents the area, describes Hollis today as a neighborhood with many longtime residents, where absentee landlords are relatively rare. ''It's a stable community,'' she said. ''It's a community where the homeowner takes pride.''
In Ms. Friday's opinion, however, some pockets of the neighborhood have changed for the worse. A passageway trestle under the Long Island Rail Road tracks that many pedestrians use as a conduit to Jamaica Avenue is covered in pigeon droppings and has needed cleaning for well over a decade, she said. And Hollis Avenue, the main commercial street, feels desolate at times.
''We don't have the things that we had when we moved here,'' Ms. Friday said, recalling the days when the avenue had a bakery, a movie theater and a deli, among other thriving businesses. Now, many retail spaces are empty, and many businesses -- including the movie theater -- have been replaced by storefront churches.
''We have to go out of our neighborhood to get something like some good Italian pastries or whatever,'' Ms. Friday said. Thinking of how busy the street used to be, she added, ''It makes you sad.''
But most residential blocks remain attractive, and her house held much of its value even in the bad real estate market. Houses in Hollis do not stay empty long, she said. New people are always there, waiting to buy.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Covering a little more than one and a half square miles, Hollis has about 34,000 residents, according to 2010 census data. The neighborhood straddles the Long Island Rail Road tracks; the blocks to the north include Hollis Park Gardens, a subsection bounded by Hillside Avenue, Jamaica Avenue, and 192nd and 195th Streets where houses date to the 1920s and lots are 100 feet deep and 60 to 100 feet wide. According to Asad Bajwa, an associate broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, Hollis lots tend to run 20, 25 or 30 feet wide.
Another subsection, this one nameless, lies west of Farmers Boulevard, marked by tall trees that shade the houses on many blocks.
Most properties, whatever their exact location, are detached and designed for single families -- though there are a few apartment buildings and some attached houses. In addition to Hollis Avenue, Farmers Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue have modest commercial districts.
Mr. Bajwa said Hollis, like many of its neighbors, had suffered in recent years from the economic downturn. Foreclosures and short sales have become more common, he said, and sales data indicate that inventory is still increasing while prices decrease.
Still, he added, ''it avoided the worst, because if you go right south of there, to South Jamaica, other markets got hit much worse.''
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Eddie Saeed, an agent at Elliman, says single-family houses generally sell in the $400,000 range. Two-family houses, which are rare, sell at a premium, he said. For example, a typical two-family house, comparable in size to a $400,000 one-family, might sell for $600,000.
Mr. Bajwa says sale prices are down 25 to 30 percent in recent years. The few attached or semiattached houses, which tend to be on the small side, now sell in the $270,000 range.
There are also some pricing anomalies, Mr. Saeed said. He is marketing a seven-bedroom one-family house on a 60-by-100-foot lot. The price is $699,000, ''which is on the high side,'' he said, ''and the sellers know it.'' Their optimism has not yet been rewarded, though he noted that someone had offered $600,000 in cash. The sellers turned it down.
For owners more eager to sell, Mr. Saeed said: ''It's a popular neighborhood. If you list a house priced right, you can sell it within 60 to 90 days.''
Rentals are rare. The few one-bedroom apartments on Craigslist or Streeteasy cost $1,000 to $1,250 a month.
WHAT TO DO
There are no large parks in the neighborhood, though the 358-acre Cunningham Park, one of the largest in Queens, is not far to the north along Francis Lewis Boulevard. It has sports fields, wooded trails and access to part of the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway, a paved bicycle path that began life as a major thoroughfare but was shut down in 1938.
Among the businesses on Hollis Avenue are Tastee Jerk, a West Indian restaurant, and other Caribbean dining options. A guided-tour company, Hush Tours, takes busloads of the curious through the neighborhood as part of a survey of Queens hip-hop landmarks.
THE SCHOOLS
Most elementary students in the southeastern corner of the neighborhood are zoned to attend Public School 134, on 109th Avenue. The school earned a C on its most recent city progress report, with 33 percent of tested students deemed proficient in English, 35.3 percent in math. Students to the southwest attend P.S. 118, on 109th Road, which also got a C, with a 37.9 percent proficiency rating in English, 35 percent in math.
Much of the northern part is zoned for P.S. 35, on 90th Avenue. Its most recent city grade was a D; 47.4 percent of tested students were proficient in English, 57.2 percent in math.
Middle schools include Intermediate School 238, on 182nd Street, which got a B on its progress report, with 37 percent deemed proficient in English, 53.1 percent in math. Intermediate School 192, on 204th Street, scored a C, with a 20.1 percent proficiency rating in English, 29.2 percent in math. The Pathways College Preparatory School, which serves Grades 6 through 12, shares the building. Its middle school scored a C, with 34.9 percent of tested students proficient in English, 46.4 percent in math.
In the Pathways school's high school, SAT averages among college-bound seniors were 401 in reading, 397 in math and 393 in writing, versus 436, 460 and 431 citywide.
THE COMMUTE
The nearest subway is the F train at Hillside Avenue and 179th Street. Farther to the west, the E, J and Z trains stop in downtown Jamaica. All are reachable, from Hollis, by buses that run along Hillside, Hollis and Jamaica Avenues. The ride to Midtown Manhattan by bus and subway takes well over an hour.
The trip to Penn Station from Hollis's Long Island Rail Road station, at 193rd Street and Woodhull Avenue, is quicker: about half an hour. But it costs more: $8.75 for a regular ride during peak hours, or $193 for a monthly pass.
Many residents own cars, but the commute to Manhattan can be challenging. It involves the Van Wyck and the Long Island Expressways; there can be long delays during rush hours, and potentially any other time.
THE HISTORY
The name Hollis comes via Frederick W. Dunton, the first developer of the area, which was once known as East Jamaica. He was a native of Hollis, N.H. The Long Island Rail Road station was built in 1885 but burned in an arson in 1967. It was replaced by a small shelter in the 1990s.

Sam Dillon is a former education reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
ON the day in November 1989 that the Berlin Wall came down, Michael Legutke, a linguist working for the West German government, was in Casper, Wyo., leading a training workshop for the state's German teachers. When the TV news affiliate learned there was a real live German, right there in Casper -- and one who had grown up in East Germany and spoke flawless English -- he was recruited to do a live feed. Dr. Legutke found himself facing a camera, taking turns offering news commentary with Tom Brokaw in Berlin. Moved by the images of East Germans streaming through the breached wall into the west, Dr. Legutke wept during the broadcast.
The drama of Berlin's reunification and Communism's collapse focused worldwide interest on all things German, and German classes in American public schools saw significant enrollment increases. But by the mid-1990s, the surge ended. The United States was turning its attention to Asia and the Mideast; Arabic and especially Chinese began displacing German and several other European languages once at the core of the American curriculum.
Ever since, the precarious future of the German language in North America has been a concern for the Berlin government, which has turned to Dr. Legutke and Daniel S. Hamilton, a Johns Hopkins professor, to strategize on how to bolster German instruction here. 
''In the U.S., German is on the defensive,'' they conclude in a new study that could serve as a blueprint for other languages threatened by tectonic shifts in American demographics. ''It is under increasing attack from many directions and for many different reasons.''
Among the most intractable challenges cited are the aging of German teachers here -- 40 percent are more than 50 years old, according to the American Association of Teachers of German -- and the evolution of America's student population from largely white to multiracial. Traditionally, few minorities study German, and fewer still teach it. Of 1,424 teachers surveyed by the study, 1,366 were white, eight were black and six were Hispanic. Students, the study says, ''must see black, Hispanic, Indian or other people of color who speak fluent German and can serve as role models.''
The study also argues that a well-financed Chinese government campaign to expand Mandarin instruction across the United States has taken a toll on German: ''China pursues a very active policy of subsidies, with the avowed goal of anchoring Chinese instruction in the U.S. educational landscape.''
And then there is the character of the American student: ''The U.S. is a country of immigrants and foreign-language speakers, but not a country of foreign language learners. A large majority of the population do not see foreign-language skills as relevant for their own economic, intellectual and social progress.''
Of course, Germany, with the largest economy in Europe, remains an industrial, cultural and scientific powerhouse. And after Spanish and French, German is still the third most-studied language in the United States, with half a million elementary, secondary and university students enrolled in classes. (Spanish is in a class by itself, with more than 7 million students; French has more than 1 million.)
But enrollments have declined. In 1990 about 133,000 American college students were learning German; a decade later, 96,000 were, according to the Modern Language Association. For most of the last century it was a foregone conclusion that schools would offer German -- the language of parents and grandparents -- along with Spanish, French and perhaps Latin and Russian. But a study financed by the federal Department of Education found that only 14 percent of high schools taught German in 2008, down from 24 percent in 1997.
The same survey saw a drop in the proportion of high schools teaching French, from 64 percent to 46 percent, and the French government now has its own effort to increase student enrollments. Italy, too, has mobilized. The College Board suspended its Advanced Placement test in Italian in 2009 because of low student participation. The program returns in May, with money collected by the Italian government and private concerns.
But the Germans have special reasons for worry.
Attracting diverse students is difficult, the study says, because of ''the general impression that German is a difficult language'' compared with other European languages. Also, many American students -- not only minorities -- associate Germany with the Third Reich and the Holocaust, and as a land of blue eyes and blond hair, beer and oompah music.
The story of Eddy Enriquez Arana, a German instructor at Pennsylvania State University, Mont Alto, proves that German can attract diverse students. Born in Guatemala, Mr. Enriquez first started learning the language from German exchange students he befriended while in high school in California. Later he studied the language in Austria and Germany, and fell in love with the culture.
''I've become an advocate for German,'' he says. But he acknowledges that persuading minority students to take German is not easy. ''Very occasionally, an African-American student will take German'' at his college, he says. ''But not very often.''
Margaret Hampton, an African-American professor of German at Earlham College in Indiana, who first became immersed in German on a semester abroad in Vienna, has worked for 20 years on a minority recruitment task force. She believes that students will be more interested if they are shown Germany's multicultural society, and has produced teaching materials that examine the contributions of diverse groups to modern Germany.
For the past three summers, Dr. Hampton has led groups of educators to Berlin to interview Jews about their struggles to rebuild their communities in post-Holocaust Germany; Afro-Germans who trace their roots to Germany's 19th-century African colonies; and Turkish-Germans whose ties to Germany date to a labor agreement that brought thousands of Turkish laborers to Germany in the 1960s. ''If there's any area where we need to give ourselves an F,'' she says, ''it's on recruiting minority students.''
Robert Williams has grappled with these hurdles teaching German for the past decade at Fairfax High School in Virginia. ''Kids come in with a negative image of Germany and the Germans,'' he says.
Fairfax High is a suburban school where 42 percent of students are white, 24 percent Asian, 18 percent Latino and 10 percent black. When Mr. Williams started teaching there in 2002, only a handful of the 75 students enrolled in German were Asians or Hispanics, and there was one lone African-American. He has made it a point to emphasize Germany's diversity, showing videotapes of people speaking the language who don't look traditionally German, including President Obama's half-sister, Auma Obama, a Kenyan who lived in Germany and speaks fluently; and the actor Boris Kodjoe, who is the son of a German psychologist and a Ghanaian physician. Some Korean students signed up after seeing a poster on his office door showing Asian youths studying German in Berlin.
''This tells students, 'Hey, Germany today is different; not just white people speak German,' '' Mr. Williams says. This year he teaches five classes totaling 125 students. Roughly 60 are white, 20 are Asian, a dozen are black, and another dozen are Latino. That mix does not completely reflect the school's diversity. ''But every year I get closer,'' he says.
Still, Mr. Williams is looking over his shoulder -- at Chinese. In 2000, about 100 students in the Fairfax district were studying Chinese, compared with 2,400 students enrolled in German. In the 11 years since, German enrollments have crept up modestly, to 2,650 students. Chinese enrollments have exploded, to 4,800 students.
Many districts have seen similar surges. Hanban, an agency of China's Education Ministry, is rolling out an ambitious, long-term Mandarin expansion plan. It has recruited hundreds of young Chinese teachers to work in American public schools, their salaries subsidized by the Chinese government, an enticing offer to school superintendents with tight budgets. And it has flown thousands of superintendents and other school administrators to visit schools across China, at Beijing's expense. Many of those educators, on returning home, have organized Mandarin classes in their districts for the first time, often deciding to phase out an existing language to make room. Not infrequently, that has been German.
Parthena Draggett, the world language department chairwoman at Jackson High School, in Massillon, Ohio, and a curriculum coordinator from the same district toured China with 400 other American educators as part of a Hanban-sponsored trip in 2009. In an interview days after their return, Ms. Draggett gushed about China's friendly people and growing economy, and about expanding Jackson's fledgling Mandarin program, begun in 2007 with Hanban support.
Unfortunately, expanding Chinese meant phasing out German, which was less popular than Spanish or French.
''There's nothing wrong with German,'' Ms. Draggett says today. ''But look at where languages are spoken -- French all across the Mideast, and Spanish all around us.'' Jackson High stopped offering German I classes in fall 2010, and will stop teaching it altogether in 2013.
It was partly in reaction to these Chinese initiatives that Dr. Hamilton, who served in the United States Embassy in Berlin during the 1990s, convened several dozen German and American educators in 2010 to discuss German's future. They gathered in Bemidji, Minn., where he runs Concordia College's German immersion summer camp each summer. The German government made clear its own concerns by sending its ambassador in Washington.
A follow-up conference in New York City last fall came up with the slogan ''Just Add German'' for a media campaign to persuade students that a minor in German would improve their marketability in a global economy.
''Adding German to a degree in engineering or computer technology makes an unbeatable combination,'' says Eva Marquardt, a director at the Goethe Institute who organized the New York conference.
Last year, the German Foreign Office contracted Dr. Legutke, a professor of linguistics at the University of Giessen, and Dr. Hamilton to carry out their study. Dr. Hamilton worked the East Coast, Midwest and South. Dr. Legutke surveyed the West, where he spoke with many dispirited educators. In the Tualatin-Tigard district, outside Portland, Ore., Tualatin High had stopped teaching German in 2007, and Tigard High had just begun shutting it down. ''Several teachers reported on local battles trying to save a German program, and losing,'' he says.
Their study makes some 80 recommendations. They include creating stipends to help minority high school students pay for summer language study in Germany, incorporating language training into German-supported soccer camps, and organizing internships with German companies for American students. It also recommends borrowing tactics from Beijing. The young teachers who have fanned out across the United States under China's guest teacher program have projected an attractive image of China, charming thousands of students into trying Mandarin. German students seeking a teaching degree could to do their student teaching in American classrooms -- to ''represent young Germany'' and ''get Americans excited about German.''
The study's sense of urgency is palpable. ''One must adjust to new times,'' it says. And a new world.

 BODY:
MORE than 200 people showed up for an open house at a town house in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, last month, and the crowd, filled with stroller-pushing parents and young children, was so lively that an ice cream truck pulled up to join the happening.
The house, at 214 Kane Street, went into contract quickly, after the owners sifted through 14 offers, nearly all of them above the $1.875 million asking price.
In the West Village a few weeks earlier, more than 300 people lined up on a Sunday afternoon to see a sunny fifth-floor walk-up with two bedrooms, 15-foot ceilings and a $997,500 price tag. Eleven offers later, it went into contract about 20 percent above the list price.
Even though the most recent market reports show Manhattan real estate prices holding steady, as they have for more than two years, other signs indicate that the New York City market may finally be willing to stop flirting with recovery and commit wholeheartedly. 
To start with, open house traffic for some properties has reached levels not seen even at the height of the market in 2007 and 2008. But buyers haven't just decided to start looking at properties again; they're actually buying. Bidding wars have become more common.
On the development front as well, sponsors say the pace of sales has picked up with the warmer weather. The number of new building permits for residential units, which dwindled to a trickle in 2010, has seen an impressive increase. For the first two months of 2010, no residential building permits were issued. For the same period in 2011, permits were issued for 52 units. This January and February, the number increased nearly 800 percent, to 457 units.
Developers also say that banks that had steered clear of construction loans for residential buildings have started to loosen their purse strings, although they are still unlikely to approve loans for condo projects with more than 100 units.
''If you were not cognizant of the underlying state of the American economy and you lived in New York -- in this bird cage we call home -- you would think everything is just rosy,'' said Jeffrey E. Levine, the chairman of Douglaston Development. But given that the federal debt looms large and given that interest rates will eventually rise, he said that ''there's no way of knowing if the recovery is as broad or as deep as we'd like it to be.''
Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, warned that buyer exuberance could be short-lived. With Wall Street bonuses much smaller than in years past, the surge in buying is not likely to last long, he said.
''Also, once we hit summer, we're going to see a lot more distressed properties hitting the market,'' he said. ''Even though Manhattan is not a hotbed of foreclosure, the world around us will be, so there'll be more negativity in the air.''
Despite all this, many brokers are optimistic about a busy spring season. Having grown accustomed to staging open houses for four or five people at best, they are savoring the wave of enthusiasm. The new normal for open house traffic is about 20 visitors, and it seems to extend to all apartment sizes.
Of course, age-old maxims still hold, so spaces encumbered by less-than-ideal locations or inflated prices, or places that don't show well, remain unlikely to generate much interest.
Judith Furgiuele, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, said she was stunned late last month when an open house for a $1.625 million three-bedroom listing on the Upper West Side drew about 150 people, even though it had been ''priced very well because the owners had already bought something.'' Several other apartments in the building were holding open houses that day, so she suspects there was some overflow traffic.
''But at one point,'' she said, ''as we were trying to handle all these people, I said I thought it was the only listing in Manhattan, and one buyer said to me, 'It kind of is.' ''
The number of new listings coming to market in Manhattan has indeed dropped. For the first three months of 2012, the Corcoran Group counted 5,349 new listings, nearly 16 percent fewer than the 6,406 new listings over the same period last year.
Much of that drop may be ascribed to the construction slowdown in recent years. Corcoran estimates that the number of new units dropped 47 percent, to 2,700, in the first quarter of this year, from 5,056 for the same period in 2011. Brokers say that certain neighborhoods and types of homes seem to be experiencing the shrinking supply more severely.
Meryl Blackman, the agent at Halstead Property representing the owners of the Cobble Hill town house that drew 14 offers, said the limited number of single-family town houses available in brownstone Brooklyn had definitely helped prompt the multiple bids.
''We had more kids and pregnant moms waiting to get into the open house than I've ever seen,'' she said.
Many of the offers were above the $1.875 million list price. Ms. Blackman sat down with the owners, James and Ann Raimes, and went through each one, beginning with the lowest bid. She started reading heartfelt letters from prospective buyers explaining why the house was ideal for their young families. ''But I burst into tears at one point and told her to not read any more,'' Ann Raimes said.
Along with limited supply, pent-up demand may also be driving the new activity.
When the financial crisis hit, buyers held back, waiting for the market to hit bottom. More recently, they waited in anticipation of a double-dip recession. ''But now people are realizing that while the economy may not be as strong they want it to be, the big fear of it collapsing has gone by the wayside,'' said Frans Preidel, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens.
Mortgage brokers, too, have seen an increase in buyers entering the market. Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, said that while the recent uptick in interest rates ''will slow down people who are thinking about refinancing, it helps people who are thinking about buying to get off the fence.''
Most of the deals her firm handles are still for refinanced loans, but she said the percentage had dropped to 60 percent from 70, with buyers seeking new loans accounting for the shift.
The increased demand is not just at the high end. Doug Perlson, the chief executive of the brokerage RealDirect, said he had observed more activity even in the studio market. He has a client who lost a studio in a bidding war and is now in contract on a second apartment after another bidding war, both at 200 East 27th Street, a postwar building in Kips Bay.
''These properties typically take several months to sell and usually don't get multiple bids,'' Mr. Perlson said. Many of the buyers he has encountered, he said, ''have decided to buy because their rent has just been raised 10 to 12 percent and the math just doesn't work for them to keep renting anymore.''
Charlie Homet, an executive vice president of Halstead, said that while open houses are much busier these days, ''not everybody's buying; there's still a little bit of hesitancy to pull the trigger.''
That was not the case, though, at a listing he had for a West Village two-bedroom that drew more than 300 pairs of eyes at its first open house.
Mr. Homet shares the listing with Ari Harkov, a Halstead senior vice president who spent most of the open house holding people back, because the 850-square-foot apartment can only hold about 50 people at one time. ''It was like a really fun cocktail party where you wanted to get to the kitchen, but you could only see it from the living room,'' Mr. Harkov said. ''I felt like a bouncer at a nightclub. ''
Buyers tried to make offers on the spot, but he asked them to please put them in writing. Several bids came in that night, and the sellers received a total of 11 offers after asking for best-and-final offers. They had a signed contract five days after the open house.
Managing the multiple offers was tricky, Mr. Harkov said, ''because it's obviously not 2007, and people were not accustomed to the kind of bidding we had.'' He and Mr. Homet compiled a spreadsheet with all the bids, sorting by price, level of financing, and closing date.
The apartment is now in contract with an all-cash client who is represented by Martine Capdevielle, a vice president of Sotheby's International Realty. Ms. Capdevielle said that pricing the apartment just under $1 million had helped create a buzz for the listing, since ''it's impossible to find a two-bedroom two-bath in the West Village for that amount.'' Her buyer, who is from France, is unfazed by the fifth-floor walk-up, she said, and besides ''in New York, it's a give-and-take, you can't have everything.''
Most buyers in the last two years have been averse to buying property that needed significant renovation, but Dan Critchett, a sales associate at Stribling & Associates, said he had seen a distinct shift in buyer behavior.
Mr. Critchett represents an Upper West Side apartment first listed in 2010 at $2.287 million and reduced to $1.99 million by late 2011. Nearly 100 people saw the apartment, a Classic 6, in that year, with several offers coming in at the $1.5 million range. ''The market clearly wanted a huge discount for anything that needed work,'' he said. The 1,800-square-foot apartment needs a new kitchen and would require redesigning to become a true three-bedroom, he said.
At Mr. Critchett's urging, the owners took the apartment off the market in December, painted it and weeded out some furniture, then relisted it in February at $1.899 million. Two open houses each drew more than 30 people and the offers started to roll in, all of them close to the asking price.
''It was a very different market,'' Mr. Critchett said. ''This was a new crop of buyers who weren't afraid of renovating and who realized there aren't that many apartments of this size that are in move-in condition.''
A new sense of urgency has been felt at new developments as well.
Ken Horn, the president of Alchemy Properties, said that open house traffic had picked up at his finished projects, Griffin Court in Hell's Kitchen and Isis Condominium on the Upper East Side. Two projects under construction, one on West 15th Street and one in Cobble Hill, also have waiting lists with about 100 names of prospective buyers.
''If you roll the clock back one and half years,'' he said, ''you would have no one on a waiting list. No one would even call until the building was up and done.''
He and other developers said that construction financing, which had all but dried up with the financial crisis, may be starting to flow again.
Skyline Developers, which has owned the site on the southeast corner of Third Avenue and 79th for several years, announced last month that it had closed on a $112 million construction loan with Wells Fargo and was beginning construction on a 19-story tower with 45 condos.
''We had been waiting for the right time to move forward,'' said Don Becker, a Skyline executive. The bank made it clear that it was doing such large deals only with established clients, he said. Still, ''we're starting to see banks become more competitive'' and more willing to negotiate on interest rates and other loan terms.
However, Mr. Levine of Douglaston Development said that most banks would still lend money only to developers with good track records and for projects with 40 to 100 units. ''The days of doing a 600-unit site like the Edge are behind us for the moment,'' he said, referring to Douglaston's condominium tower on the Williamsburg waterfront.
If 422 West 20th Street is any indication, smaller projects in prime locations can be a good bet. Seven hundred people arrived on its opening weekend late last month, and all but 7 of its 36 units were in contract two weeks later.
Kelly Mack, the president of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is overseeing the marketing of the property, said that when she showed up at 8:30 a.m. to help set up for the first open house, about a dozen people were already lined up and waiting for the 11 a.m. opening. ''That was a complete shock,'' she said. ''I didn't see that even at the height of the market.''
The building was once a dormitory for the General Theological Seminary, and the apartments range from 600-square-foot one-bedrooms, for $670,000, to 1,600-square-foot three-bedrooms for about $2.1 million. ''That covers a very underserved market in that location,'' she said.
Sharon E. Baum, the director of Corcoran's Exclusive Properties Division, said that she, too, had detected a change in the city's real estate attitude.
Shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, Ms. Baum traded in the Rolls-Royce that she had used to ferry clients to apartments around town, because while ''people were still wealthy, they felt embarrassed to talk about it.'' Her driver has since been driving a black Mercedes-Benz sedan, which Ms. Baum says is roomy and much easier to park.
Today, any discomfort with luxury brands and ostentatious spending has all but disappeared, she said, because ''people have to get on with their lives.''
Besides, she added, she never did get rid of the rubber floor mats with the double R insignia. ''And we have the Rolls-Royce umbrella in the car,'' she said. ''We didn't totally give it up.''

HEADLINE: Failure Is Not an Option

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
JAMES FRANCO, America's favorite graduate student, has been hailed as a multitasking savant for his intellectual pursuits: fiction writing at Columbia University and Brooklyn College, poetry at Warren Wilson College, filmmaking at New York University. Not to mention current studies in English at Yale, and digital and media art at Rhode Island School of Design.
But some wonder how he has managed to juggle the likes of John Milton and Andre Bazin while maintaining a thriving acting career. The answer, it seems, is that he hasn't -- at least, not entirely.
''You know what I got a D in at film school?'' he asked, sheepishly amused, in a 2010 interview with Showbiz411. ''Acting class,'' he said, adding: ''I did all my work and finished the film that was required that year.'' He acknowledged, though, ''I missed a lot of the classes.'' 
The class in question was ''Directing the Actor II,'' a seminar taught by Jose Angel Santana, an assistant professor and then head of the acting program in N.Y.U.'s graduate film division. ''In the two classes he attended, he actually made a contribution,'' Mr. Santana says now.
In August, Mr. Santana was relieved of his teaching duties, a year before his three-year contract was up. In December, he filed a lawsuit in Supreme Court in Manhattan against N.Y.U. for wrongful termination, citing blowback from Mr. Franco's D as one reason. An N.Y.U. spokesman, John Beckman, takes issue: ''We don't believe he did a good enough job in his assignment. It certainly had nothing to do with any grade he gave to any student.''
In an e-mail, Mr. Franco said: ''I was not in the least bit surprised by the D. He told me at the beginning of the semester that I would get a D if I decided to go to Utah to shoot '127 Hours.' '' And this: ''Grades are meaningless in M.F.A. programs. No studio and no editor is not going to take your movie or book because you got a bad grade in a class.''
However the case plays out, it raises larger questions about grading in master's programs. After all, if missing all but two classes isn't grounds for failure, what is?
Not much. Indeed, it's almost impossible to fail a graduate course, even for students who are not Oscar nominees. A no-credit F at N.Y.U., Mr. Santana explains, could affect a student's ability to graduate: ''I didn't think that was warranted'' for Mr. Franco.
Robert Neuman, former academic dean of students at Marquette University and author of ''Are You Really Ready for College? A College Dean's 12 Secrets for Success,'' says that before there's an F, there will be a W -- for ''withdraw.'' ''You probably aren't going to find graduate school transcripts with F's on them,'' he says.
Research corroborates this. According to Christopher Healy, an associate professor of computer science at Furman University who compiles grade distributions, about 75 percent of grades in master's programs are A's, 22 percent are B's and 3 percent are C's. Less than 1 percent are D's or F's.
''At the graduate level, the percentages of C, D, F grades has always been low,'' he says. ''The big change has been the boundary between A and B grades. A's have gone up from about 50 percent 40-plus years ago.'' In 2008 at the University of Utah, for example, 73 percent of grades were A's, compared with 45 percent in 1965.
Certainly, C's, D's and F's are more common among undergraduates. Educators say that the grad-school grade distribution is due in part to the fact that graduate students are older adults (average age: 32) who want to be there. But it's also a result of escalating grade inflation and the practice of passing even students with lackluster performance.
Schools, of course, are businesses, and master's programs lucrative, so keeping customers is essential. At the N.Y.U. graduate film school, tuition hovers around $50,000 annually for the three-year program. ''There's pressure to retain students,'' Mr. Santana says. ''Once the class is formed in the beginning of an academic year, that class is formed for the next three years. You can't enter the program midstream. So if you lost any amount of students, you're losing $150,000 for three years.''
Rachel Louise Snyder, an assistant professor of literature in American University's M.F.A. program, which is pass/fail, believes the economic downturn may have intensified fear among faculty members of the consequences of failing students. ''No one has ever come up to me and said explicitly, 'You must pass these students,' '' she says. ''But the expectation is that they're adults, they're paying money, and as long as they're doing minimal work, they should pass. My guess is that probably most grad schools do that.''
To that end, schools go out of their way to help floundering students succeed. That includes giving extra credit options, or letting the student take an incomplete and make up the class at a later time. Rather than let students fail, many schools will suggest a leave of absence. Or ''counsel them out.''
At Harvard Business School, for example, which is pass/fail, only about 3 to 4 percent of students ''hit the screen,'' Harvard parlance for being brought up for review by a faculty-administrative committee. ''Each case is examined individually to find out the root of the student's problem, and recommendations are made or support is provided,'' says Brian C. Kenny, a spokesman. ''Oftentimes, rather than flunking out a student, which is very rare, we will encourage them to take a semester or even a year off. Most students who do that return to graduate.''
The top 15 to 25 percent at Harvard Business end up in Category I, the next 65 to 75 percent in Category II, and the bottom 10 percent in Category III. Rarely does anyone end up in Category IV, or failure.
Dr. Neuman is a fan of counseling out. ''Schools that advise you are really trying to help you,'' he says. ''Five, 10 years later they may decide to go back. They don't want to have a bad grade on record.''
Anthony Gutierrez, 27, was given a chance to plead his case. Admitted in 2009 as a conditional student in global and strategic communication at Florida International University, he was required to maintain a 3.25 grade-point average. Instead, he ended up with a 3.20 -- hardly terrible, but below the requirement.
At the time, he had been taking classes in music production at Miami Dade College, and was studying for an online master's degree in entertainment business, doing an internship at Sony Music, and working as a marketing promoter. Like many graduate students trying to balance family, work and school, he was overextended and exhausted. He had one semester left, and was set to move to New York for a job.
He told the dean of students: ''I am one of those students you're going to talk about.''
The school was unimpressed. And so Mr. Gutierrez left, dejected and fretting over what to tell his mother. But then one of his teachers, Fernando Figueredo, went to bat for him.
''We let Anthony stay, following the appeals process available to all students,'' Mr. Figueredo says. ''The dean of the graduate program agreed with our recommendation and allowed him to remain, based on his continued improvement in grades, which he did the following semester.''
Professors and administrators do have genuine compassion for their students, who spend exorbitant sums for that piece of paper -- without which they may be saddled with debt and have no means to pay it back.
But there are frustrations as well. An adjunct at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, which is graded pass/fail, recalls a student who missed class repeatedly and did not hand in a final project. ''I gave her an F, but the chair of the department said that students had to do a lot worse to fail. He was implying that if you have a pulse you can pass.''
Bill Grueskin, dean of academic affairs in that school, says no statistics are available on how many students have failed. But he says students in danger of failing are notified in writing, and ''some kind of plan is put in place to try to correct the performance in such a way that they can pass.''
Richard Ingersoll, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania, says the issue is often discussed by the faculty, and is a source of disagreement. ''The tension is: How high a bar do we set, how many do we counsel out and how many do we allow to continue?'' he says. ''It's hard to weed out students because we faculty have different ideas of how rigorous are our standards.
''Because of the funding and the investment of the institution,'' he adds, ''from my viewpoint having rigorous standards is all the more important.''

HEADLINE: How Green Are Electric Cars? Depends on Where You Plug In

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
IT'S a lot like one of those math problems that gave you fits in sixth grade: a salesman leaves home in Denver and drives his electric car to a meeting in Boulder. At the same time, a physicist driving the same model electric car sets out from her loft in Los Angeles, heading to an appointment near Anaheim.
For both, the traffic is light, and the cars consume an identical amount of battery power while traveling the same number of miles. Being purely electric, they emit zero tailpipe pollutants during their trips.
The test question: are their carbon footprints also equal? 
The answer may be a surprise. According to a report that the Union of Concerned Scientists plans to release on Monday, there would be a considerable difference in the amount of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide -- that result from charging the cars' battery packs. By trapping heat, greenhouse gases contribute to climate change.
The advocacy group's report, titled ''State of Charge: Electric Vehicles' Global Warming Emissions and Fuel Cost Savings Across the United States,'' uses the electric power requirements of the Nissan Leaf as a basis for comparison. The Leaf, on sale in the United States for more than a year and the most widely available electric model from a major automaker, sets a logical baseline.
The California part of the story is upbeat: a hypothetical Los Angeles Leaf would be accountable for the release of an admirably low level of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, about the same as a gasoline car getting 79 miles per gallon. But the Denver car would cause as large a load of greenhouse gases to enter the atmosphere as some versions of the gasoline-powered Mazda 3, a compact sedan rated at 33 m.p.g. in combined city and highway driving by the Environmental Protection Agency. In simple terms, the effect of electric vehicles on the amount of greenhouse gases released into the environment can span a wide range, varying with the source of the electricity that charges them. California's clean power makes the Leaf a hero; the regional mix of coal-dependent utilities serving Denver diminish the car's benefits as a global-warming fighter.
The U.C.S. report, which takes into account the full cycle of energy production, often called a well-to-wheels analysis, demonstrates that in areas where the electric utility relies on natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or renewable sources to power its generators, the potential for electric cars and plug-in hybrids to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is great. But where generators are powered by burning a high percentage of coal, electric cars may not be even as good as the latest gasoline models -- and far short of the thriftiest hybrids.
With gasoline hovering around $4 a gallon and mass-production E.V.'s like battery-powered versions of the Ford Focus and Honda Fit (as well as plug-in hybrids like the Chevrolet Volt, Toyota Prius PHV and Ford Fusion Energi models) either on sale now or coming soon, the report arrives at an ideal time. Its analysis can help shoppers make informed decisions.
It also fills a gap: many of the existing studies on electric-car efficiency were completed before models like the Leaf came to market; others have expressed their results in science-lab terms like pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per year, not especially useful to consumers. Automakers have not always helped their customers understand the issues, either, typically painting electrics and hybrids with a green brush and an idealistic setting.
The attempt to forge a simple message has created mistaken impressions, too. During a discussion with business leaders and journalists at the French consulate in New York early this month, the chief executive of Nissan and Renault, Carlos Ghosn, doubled down in declaring an environmental edge for electrics over the best gasoline models.
''Even if you could use electricity only from coal,'' Mr. Ghosn said, ''you're still better off using an electric car than using gasoline.''
It is a position that Nissan says it has held since the Leaf program began, yet the studies that the company offers in support of its position show electrics outperforming only vehicles with fuel economy ratings from about 27 to 36 miles per gallon.
Assembled over nine months in 2011, the U.C.S. report provides clarification in several ways, examining charging costs under various conditions and offering comparisons among the Leaf, the Mitsubishi ''i'' electric and the Volt plug-in hybrid. Most revealing, perhaps, is the geographical breakdown of electricity generation.
In a worst-case situation, with electric power generated from a high proportion of coal -- as it is in a wide swath of the country's midsection -- an electric car or a plug-in hybrid will generate slightly more full-cycle global-warming emissions, as the report calls the greenhouse gases, than the best gasoline-engine subcompact. In areas where the cleanest electricity is available -- regions served by hydroelectric, natural gas or nuclear generating plants -- greenhouse gas emissions may be less than half that of today's best gasoline-engine vehicles.
Put another way, for 45 percent of the United States population, an E.V. will generate lower levels of greenhouse gases than a gasoline-engine vehicle capable of 50 m.p.g. in combined city-highway driving. Cities in this group include the predictable -- Seattle, for example -- as well as the less obvious, like Buffalo or New Orleans.
About 37 percent of Americans live in regions where a Leaf's greenhouse gas emissions would equate to a gasoline-powered vehicle rated at 41 to 50 m.p.g. Some 18 percent of the population lives in regions with a comparatively dirty power supply, where the well-to-wheels carbon footprint of a Leaf would be the equivalent of a vehicle rated at 31 to 40 m.p.g., typical of models like the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus and Hyundai Elantra.
Here's another way to look at it: if one region were completely dependent on coal for power, its electric cars would be responsible for full-cycle global-warming emissions equivalent to a car capable of 30 m.p.g. in mixed driving. In a region totally reliant on natural gas, an electric would be equivalent to a 50 m.p.g. gasoline-engine car.
The report divides the United States into 26 regions. Each region comprises a single interconnected electricity grid, though several utility companies may operate within a region. Because the utilities sell power among themselves, the emission levels for one city or utility cannot be pinpointed for every hour of every day, but regional analysis provides an approximation of average emissions over time.
The report's analysis is based on the E.P.A.'s 2007 Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database, the most recent compilation of data available. For each region, the average amount of global-warming emissions generated to produce a kilowatt-hour of electricity was calculated, taking into account emissions resulting from the transportation of fuel to the power plant.
To convert those power plant emission levels to an m.p.g. figure, calculations were based on the power draw of the Nissan Leaf: 0.34 kilowatt-hours per mile. The Volt, which draws 0.36 kilowatt-hours per mile, requires slightly more power.
The report makes it possible to compare electrics with conventional hybrids that rely solely on a gasoline engine to charge their battery. In the dirtiest regions of the country, the hybrid would generate lower levels of full-cycle emissions than the electric car, but a breakdown of the data shows that more than half of Americans live in regions where an electric car has lower well-to-wheels carbon emissions than today's best full-hybrid vehicles, while 17 percent live in areas where they would be equal.
Of course, conventional gas-powered vehicles are getting cleaner as engineering advances improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. On the other hand, electrics and plug-ins will become cleaner without technology changes as coal-burning power plants are replaced with natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind or solar facilities.
Don Anair, a senior engineer in the U.C.S. clean vehicles program, said utilities in the dirtiest electric-grid regions of the United States generate 2 .5 to 3 times more global-warming emissions than those in the cleanest regions, so there is much room for improvement. But he sees the industry trending in the right direction.
''A number of old coal-fired power plants are now being retired,'' he said. ''Given emission standards recently introduced by the current administration, any new coal-fired plants would be far cleaner than their predecessors.''
According to 2010 data from the United States Energy Information Administration, 45 percent of the country's electricity is generated by burning coal, the dirtiest fuel. Natural gas, a much cleaner fuel, accounts for 24 percent of electricity production, a figure that is shifting rapidly with price swings. Nuclear plants generate 20 percent of the nation's power, while wind, solar and geothermal sources provide 3 percent.
While the report puts hard numbers on the current situation, it also points out the need for fundamental changes.
''To prevent the worst consequences of global warming,'' the report concludes, ''the automotive industry must deliver viable alternatives to the oil-fueled internal-combustion engine -- i.e., vehicles boasting zero or near-zero emissions.''

Maybach 62 (AU2) MAP: Carbon In, Carbon Out: Sorting Out the Power Grid: On Monday, the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group, will release a report that compares the carbon footprints of electrically powered cars with gasoline models. On this map, the numbers following the city names indicate the miles-per-gallon equivalent, in terms of the amount of greenhouse gases generated in charging the battery, of driving an electric Nissan Leaf there. The darkest regions on the map are served by utilities burning a high percentage of coal to generate power
in those regions, charging an electric car sends as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as driving a car rated at 31 to 40 m.p.g., about the same as a current compact model. In the lightest areas of the map the electricity is generated by cleaner fuels, so the equivalent miles per gallon is higher than the best of today's hybrids. Cities marked with an asterisk are served by utilities that are situated in a different electrical grid region. Readers in those cities can use the ZIP code lookup tool on the Energy Department's Alternative and Advance Vehicles Web page to determine the fuels used to generate local power. (AU1)
 CHART: When It Comes to Carbon Dioxide, Lower Is Better and Zero Is Perfect: The amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases produced by a gasoline-powered car is directly proportional to its fuel economy, expressed by government regulators in grams of carbon dioxide per mile (or in Europe, grams per kilometer). To calculate greenhouse gases generated by charging the battery of an electric or plug-in hybrid car, the Union of Concerned Scientists used electric-utility emissions data gathered by the Environmental Protection Agency. From that, an equivalent miles-per-gallon figure was calculated. This chart shows the full-cycle range of greenhouse gas emissions for today's electrically powered vehicles and for a sampling of 2012 hybrid and conventional gasoline-powered models. (AU2)

HEADLINE: 'It Ain't About the Record'

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

 BODY:
HUNTINGDON, Tenn. -- It was early on a Friday morning, and there was an emergency in Carroll Academy's Room 5. A student named Destiny was sitting alone, crying. With cameras in every classroom, she could be seen on the monitor in the security office.
The girls basketball team at Carroll Academy had lost the night before, 69-9, at home to University School of Jackson, a private college-preparatory school about 45 minutes away.
Destiny, a 17-year-old senior with a crossover dribble, a silky shooting touch and a habit of drug use, was the only one of the nine Carroll Academy players with any previous high school basketball experience. There were games this season when Destiny scored all the team's points. There were times in every game when her passes, delivered at the velocity of someone playing dodge ball, bounced off teammates' hands, leaving Destiny in a quiet fit of grimaces and upturned palms.
On the court the previous night, her street-tough persona boiled toward reckless anger. Defended tightly, often by two opponents, she was all elbows and sneers. 
Coach Tonya Lutz did not like what she saw and benched Destiny in the second half. Randy Hatch, the school administrator, did not like what he saw, either.
He had a hunch. And he had a tip. He ordered a drug test for Destiny the next morning.
That was why she was crying in Room 5.
''I'm not going to be able to pass my drug screen,'' she said when Lutz, Hatch and the school's security director, Patrick Steele, came into the room. And before she was escorted to the restroom to urinate into a cup, she pressed her face into Lutz's shoulder and sobbed.
Learning to Be Survivors
Carroll Academy is in Huntingdon, about 100 miles east of Memphis and 100 miles west of Nashville in West Tennessee. It is a strictly run day school with about 80 students operated by the Carroll County Juvenile Court, filled with teenagers trying to work their way back to their home schools with the velvet-hammered guidance of parole officers and people like Lutz, Hatch and Steele.
Among the nine girls on the Carroll Academy basketball team, only one lives with both her mother and her father. A seventh grader, she lived with her parents and two younger siblings at a grandmother's house, having been evicted from one trailer and waiting to move into another.
A few of the players moved more than once during the season. A couple have lived for weeks or months in abandoned houses without water, electricity or heat. Few of the parents have steady jobs, and at least one is in jail.
One girl spent time in rehabilitation for alcoholism. At least one regularly smoked marijuana with her mother at one house and her father at another. Two worried aloud about their mothers' regular use of homemade methamphetamine, in a county where the judge signs two or three search warrants each week to break up meth labs. Most of the girls are on medication themselves, for attention-deficit disorder, bipolar disorder or depression. Some say their parents sometimes take the pills instead.
Few had played team sports. Fewer still had played on a basketball team. Most did not know one another, their lives scattered across small, depressed towns and rolling hills in West Tennessee.
The reasons for being ordered to Carroll Academy varied. Three of the girls on the team were kicked out of their home schools for a year, part of a zero-tolerance policy, after taking their parents' prescription pills to school. A few were habitual truants. A few had habits of rage --fighting at school or uncorking violent tempers at home.
For nine girls, ages 13 to 17, basketball is a way to keep their after-school time occupied, to provide them supervision, to give their worlds a bit of structure and to teach them about teamwork and trusting others.
''I want to teach them to be survivors,'' said Judge Larry Logan of Carroll County Juvenile Court, who helped start the school in 1994 and sends many of the students there as part of their sentence. ''If you get knocked down, get back up. It's a good habit to have.''
For girls unaccustomed to positive reinforcement, it is reasonable to wonder about the value of losing, game after game after game, by scores this season like 80-8 and 65-7.
''If I looked out and I could see in their eyes that they're depressed about losing, and hated to come out here, it wouldn't be worth it,'' said Hatch, a 54-year-old lifelong resident of Huntingdon who long served as Carroll Academy's boys and girls basketball coach, as he watched a game from the stands. ''But they put it behind them quicker than anybody.''
He looked out at the girls, running up and down the court, gamely chasing a team they would never beat.
''But they got experience at it,'' Hatch said.
House Arrest, and a 6-Player Team
Destiny admitted that she had smoked marijuana a couple of nights earlier. A drug bust with several older friends in a Walmart parking lot resulted in Destiny's being sent to juvenile court last year. While she was on probation, she said, threatening text messages to another girl landed her at Carroll Academy.
Destiny bounces between homes. Her father is the youngest of 16 children in a family that has supplied top athletes to nearby Clarksburg High School for generations. He lives with his parents, works odd jobs and has never seen Destiny play, she said.
Destiny's mother works as a nurse. She recently gave birth to her fourth child from three men she had married, at least one of whom beat Destiny, Destiny's parole officer said.
Yet Destiny does not hold a grudge. Whenever she is told that her mother is outside, waiting to give her a ride home, Destiny's face brightens like a full moon.
Lyda Allen, Destiny's maternal grandmother, was often the only relative of any of the nine girls cheering them from the mostly empty bleachers.
''If this place wasn't here, God knows where she would be,'' Allen said of Destiny. ''I don't know about the others, but the parents are probably the reason why most of these kids are here. But I'm not going to give up on Destiny.''
Hatch was not, either. He held Destiny's fate. He could send her to months of drug rehabilitation at a facility far away, which would then release her back to Carroll Academy. But Destiny was a senior. When she turned 18 in June, she could walk away from school without her diploma. Further trouble after that would probably land her in jail.
Hatch quizzed her. A county parole officer tabbed to run Carroll Academy when it opened 18 years ago, he used his arsenal of knowledge, instinct and bluffs. He spoke with a serious tone and a gentle expression.
You were out with older kids, weren't you? Yes, she said. You broke curfew, didn't you? Yes, she admitted.
''I knew that, too,'' Hatch said.
He dismissed Destiny to class, leaving her to worry what her future held.
When the team gathered that night for another game, Lutz felt a strange vibe. She asked the girls to raise their hands if they would fail a drug test. Two did: Summer, a 17-year-old senior with a baby, and Alleyah, a tiny 14-year-old eighth grader.
They were tested. The others were not.
''There ain't no reason to lie,'' said Summer, who cried because she feared being separated from her 8-month-old son, DaMarion. ''They're going to find out about it anyway.''
Summer failed. Alleyah passed. (The theory was that she either smoked synthetic marijuana, sold over the counter despite concerns about its health dangers, or unsuspectingly smoked some other herb.)
Hatch put them on house arrest for the weekend, meaning they -- and their parents -- would be in violation of their court orders if the teenagers wandered away. Lutz suspended all three girls for that night's game against Gleason High.
But they would not be kicked out of Carroll Academy.
The suspensions left Lutz with six players. Constance, a soft-spoken, 5-foot-2 eighth grader with a penchant for throwing things in anger -- most recently her mother's collection of porcelain figurines, leaving craters in the walls -- managed a first-quarter free throw.
Leslee, a fast-talking ninth grader who usually started, fouled out in the third quarter. Two other girls were hurt badly enough in collisions to stop the game, but they managed to stay on the floor to the end.
Carroll Academy lost, 44-1.
''It ain't about the record,'' Hatch said. ''You have nine girls. My job, and Tonya's job, and everyone's job, is to go 9-0 with them. If you go 8-1, you've had a losing season.''
THE LADY JAGUARS: Part 1: Carroll Academy is a day school in Huntingdon, Tenn., operated by the Carroll County Juvenile Court and financed mostly by the state's Department of Children's Services. The region is beset by high unemployment, rampant prescription drug abuse and the proliferation of methamphetamine labs. The Carroll County Juvenile Court judge, who has authority over the school, and Carroll Academy's director gave The New York Times unrestricted access to explore the school through its girls basketball team, whose players have little experience with organized sports and myriad troubles outside of school. For this five-part series, The Times spoke with the girls, many of their parents and relatives, school administrators and coaches.

Destiny had to take a drug test, admitting, ''I'm not going to be able to pass.'' Her future at the school, and on the team, was uncertain.
Sometimes, Destiny scored all of the team's points. Tight defense could be frustrating.
 Lunchtime is mandatory quiet time. For Destiny, it can be time for schoolwork, too. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY RUTH FREMSON/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (SP5) MAP (SP5)

HEADLINE: Truly Food for Thought

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL. 
Jan Ellen Spiegel is a frequent contributor to the Connecticut pages of The Times.

 BODY:
THE study of food has had a home in higher education for generations. Agriculture was a founding mission of the land-grant university system started in the 1860s. Nutrition programs are commonplace. Culinary schools were around long before Julia Child turned Le Cordon Bleu on its butter-sauced ear.
But in an era of widespread interest, if not downright concern, about how that ear of corn, destined for a pot of boiling water on a perfect summer evening is grown, processed, marketed, distributed and used -- and what it means for health, commerce, the economy and even the ecological state of the planet -- colleges and universities have come to realize that the classic food disciplines simply will not do anymore.
And so food studies was born. 
This new academic field, taking shape in an expanding number of colleges and universities, coordinates the food-related instruction sprinkled throughout academia in recognition that food is not just relevant, but critical to dozens of disciplines. It's agriculture; it's business; it's health; it's the economy; it's the environment; it's international relations; it's war and peace.
Food studies is being embraced by students interested in new careers in food safety reform, local-food businesses and anti-obesity, equity and climate efforts, as well as those seeking broader contexts for traditional disciplines like culinary arts and farming.
For Sarah Jacobson, the food studies program at the University of New Hampshire, called EcoGastronomy, was a way to bring more relevance to her interests in nutrition and sustainable food systems. The program -- started in 2008, and with more than 60 enrolled last fall already past its five-year goal of 50 students -- is a dual major that includes electives from a dozen different departments and a required semester studying at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Italy.
Ms. Jacobson already has a degree in animal sciences but is doing this second bachelor's to add context and information to what she feels is often outdated dietetics training (consider the well-worn mantra that there is no ''good food'' or ''bad food,'' just moderation).
''Most nutrition majors think about the food and not the system that's producing food,'' she says. ''I did not want to simply navigate through what I call a broken food supply. By bridging dietetics and sustainable food systems, I can help change the food system.''
That means instead of working in a traditional clinical setting, she will take her training to so-called food deserts, where low-income people cannot get fresh food, let alone afford it. Ms. Jacobson has already brought food stamps to a farmers market in New Hampshire.
''People are working with food and working with agriculture in ways you never thought of before,'' she says. ''It's not just the traditional jobs anymore.'' (Good Food Jobs, a Web site started in 2010 to dovetail with the field, has postings for hundreds of jobs, among them sustainable farming internships, nonprofit business management and community garden advising.)
The first food studies programs began in the mid-1990s at New York University and Boston University. While there is more published scholarship and better-trained faculty today, there have been growing pains as schools try to stitch together a field of study across departments that have not always communicated, through bureaucracies that often move slowly, and against old notions that certain aspects of food are not worthy of serious study. One result has been an array of program and degree structures, based on different goals and what programs are in place.
Indiana University, for example, houses its food Ph.D. and undergraduate minor in the anthropology department, because using an existing framework made them easier to set up. That is a lesson the University of California, Davis, learned the hard way. It took 10 years before it finally got its major in sustainable agriculture and food systems up and running last fall.
Schools also are tailoring programs to their geographic areas and demographics. The University of Vermont, given its land-grant status, takes an agricultural angle. It established a minor in 2007 and will begin a master's program in the fall, spurred by the observation that issues around food had become too complex to view through a single academic lens.
At the New School, which started a food studies program in 2008, classes have urban bents (''Food and Migration,'' ''Urban Agriculture'') that accommodate three core areas: culture and communications; policy and politics; and nutrition, public health and environment.
Andrew F. Smith teaches contemporary food controversies at the New School -- think additives, genetically modified food and one of the newest concerns, cloned food -- as well as food history.
''Historically you've had nutrition programs,'' he says. ''Historically you've had anthropologists looking at food. You might have some historian come along and look at sugar and how sugar has impacted things. But you don't have a place in a university where everybody gets together and talks about food in itself with all of its different dimensions.''
For example, the rise of canned and frozen foods allowed more women to enter the workforce around World War II. In a traditional history class, that would be one sentence. But a look at history through food would explore the changing roles of women, increased leisure time, the invention of refrigerated trucking (and thus a better ability to transport food), and what that did to the labor force, as well as the need for new quality control.
Sara Minard has seen the before and after of the food studies trend. As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin considering a thesis on African-American customs and practices, she was told that there was no faculty to support her and that she was on her own. She opted for an existing major. In 2009, when she heard about Indiana's food anthropology Ph.D. program, ''I was in there in a week.''
Ms. Minard's specialty is food waste -- a growing concern over the vast quantities of usable food that is jamming landfills and producing contamination while many go hungry. She has begun photographing lunch plates at fraternities and sororities, before and after, to monitor waste patterns. One discovery: ''Young ladies in sororities do not like to eat egg yolks,'' she says. ''But they will eat ice cream.''
''People laugh when I talk about what I'm studying. You get that smirky look. 'Oh, that's nice.' But when I explain it, the smirk goes away.''

HEADLINE: Disaster Reignites Debate Over Battle at Earth's Ceiling

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- In the snowy wastes of Siachen, where Pakistani and Indian soldiers face off in a high-altitude battle zone ringed by Himalayan peaks, the fight is against the mountain, not the man.
In outposts up to 22,000 feet above sea level, the temperature can plunge to 58 below, and linger there for months. Patrolling soldiers tumble into yawning crevasses. Frostbite chews through unprotected flesh. Blizzards blow, weapons seize up and even simple body functions become intolerable.
Some soldiers go crazy and end up ''staring into space,'' as one veteran put it, unhinged by the dazzling whiteness of rock, sun and snow.
Then there are the avalanches. 
The latest occurred on April 7, when a giant wall of snow crashed down on the Pakistani side of the battlefield, swamping the battalion headquarters of 6 Northern Light Infantry, where 124 Pakistani soldiers and 14 civilians were stationed. The avalanche buried a cluster of buildings in 80 feet of snow; a week later, rescuers have yet to pull out a single person, dead or alive.
The battalion's fate drew an anguished reaction across Pakistan and swung a spotlight onto an often-forgotten corner of the 65-year-old conflict over Kashmir, the disputed mountain territory that lies at the emotional heart of the conflict with India. And it reinvigorated an incendiary question: Is Siachen, a glacier on Kashmir's northern edge, worth fighting over?
''It is time for both countries to step back from this madness,'' said Mehmood Shah, a retired army brigadier who was once involved in talks to end the standoff. ''Every day, people die in this conflict. Going on is in nobody's interest.''
Many critics echoed that view, describing the conflict as a pointless and sinfully expensive battle for a piece of Himalayan real estate that, while stunningly beautiful, is unfit for human habitation. About 3,000 Pakistani soldiers have died at Siachen since 1984, of whom about 90 percent perished from weather-related causes, said the Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas.
Military analysts estimate the deployment costs Pakistan $5 million a month; Indian costs are higher still because of higher troop numbers and because supplies are transported by helicopter.
Still, many military strategists and security hawks in both countries insist the fight must go on. In any peace negotiation with Pakistan, wrote Vikram Sood, a former chief of Indian intelligence, Siachen should be the ''last issue on the table, not the first.''
Pakistani military photographs of the rescue operation, released in recent days, paint a dispiriting picture of the scene: white-suited rescuers, aided by sniffer dogs, digging amid driving snow; bulldozers tapping into an immense snowdrift. A three-person American military rescue team has arrived to help, and was due to travel to Siachen; German and Swiss experts are already on site.
The effort is now focused on burrowing a 130-foot tunnel toward the troop barracks, where soldiers were sleeping when the avalanche hit. Ominously, the army has already released pictures of those inside: mostly soldiers in their 20s, wearing green berets and striped neck-scarves. Few Pakistanis dare hope any will emerge alive; as many see it, the mountain has won yet again.
''Damn you, Siachen,'' Kamran Shafi, a former army officer and a prominent columnist, wrote Friday in The Express Tribune, echoing a widely shared sentiment.
While India and Pakistan have fought over Kashmir since 1947, the battle for Siachen erupted in April 1984, when Indian commandos captured the peaks overlooking the 49-mile Siachen Glacier, the world's second-longest outside a polar region.
The dispute stemmed from a mix of bad politics and worse cartography: a 1972 agreement between Pakistan and India that demarcated the Line of Control was ambiguously worded, allowing both countries to claim the glacier. Fighting raged for almost two decades until 2003, when Pakistan and India agreed to a cease-fire that, despite occasional flare-ups, has largely held. Still, up to 8,000 soldiers from both sides, mostly Indians, remain stationed in the battle zone, according to unofficial estimates, facing each other across an expanse of rock and snow.
For those who have served in Siachen, it is an unforgettable experience.
''It was something completely out of this world,'' said Major Khan, a retired army officer who served in Siachen twice, and who spoke on the condition that his first name be omitted.
Nothing was easy there, he said. Fearing frostbite, most soldiers went to the bathroom -- small outdoor huts cobbled together from mountain stones -- once a day and bathed only every few months. Major Khan's appetite vanished, causing him to shed 37 pounds in three months. ''You feel you are a caveman, because that's the way you live,'' he said.
During a stint on the front lines in 2003, his job was to send shells whistling toward Indian positions. But the thin air meant shells traveled unpredictably and were prone to buffeting by gusts. The punishing conditions created a strange solidarity with the enemy -- who in some areas was just 200 yards away, Major Khan said.
''We could hear each other talking, and we used to exchange greetings at special times -- Eid for us, and Diwali for them,'' he said, referring to major Muslim and Hindu religious holidays.
On one occasion, he said, Indian soldiers offered his men the chance to use their satellite phone to call home. ''Obviously we never went, but that was the atmosphere: fighting but also friendly,'' he said.
The hardest part of the deployment was the psychological strain, he said. Cut off from the outside world in such harsh conditions, often for months at a time, some soldiers developed mental illnesses, he said. ''I saw people getting lost, just looking at space,'' he said. ''The isolation was affecting their brain.''
Even now, some of his former comrades are struggling to recover, he said: ''Their families used to complain that they would sit somewhere and stare at the roof. And that would go on for many years.''
The avalanche occurred on the eve of a visit to India by President Asif Ali Zardari, the first by a Pakistani head of state in seven years. Although ostensibly a private visit, Mr. Zardari had lunch with the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the visit gave a tangible fillip to gently warming relations between the two archrivals.
Recent months have seen quiet progress in strengthening economic ties; on Friday, the Indian and Pakistani commerce ministers met in New Delhi to announce new developments. Optimists hope that trade ties could leverage a diplomatic or military breakthrough.
But hopes that the latest episode, or talks over tea, could lead to a troop withdrawal from Siachen are tempered by decades of mistrust and a peace process that has moved as slowly as the glacier itself.
It would be a mistake to see Siachen as the ''low-hanging fruit'' of the Pakistan-India conflict, said Ejaz Haider of the Jinnah Institute, a research and policy organization based in Islamabad.
''Who wants war? Nobody. But if you want peace, you need to prepare for war,'' said Mr. Haider, whose brother and father have served in Siachen. ''That, unfortunately, is the reality.''

HEADLINE: Mixing Golf and Ravioli With Business

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
This interview with Annette Catino, president and C.E.O. of QualCare Inc., an alternative employer health insurance plan based in Piscataway, N.J., was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.
Q. Do you remember the first time you were somebody's boss?
A. I was 16, and I was a pharmacy technician. It was pretty simple work back in the '70s. You had to be able to read the doctor's handwriting, pull the drugs off the shelf and count the pills. And I did that so well that they made me the manager of all of the evening and weekend technicians.
Q. Was that an easy transition for you?
A. I've always been comfortable telling people what to do. From an early age, it was kind of second nature to me to be able to say, ''We need to accomplish this today, this tomorrow.'' 
Q. And where did that comfort level come from?
A. My father was the owner-operator of a gas station. He was a very good mechanic, but he was a terrible businessman. In the early days, I helped him do his books. He would come home with all this paperwork and he'd say, ''Oh, would you count this money for me?'' Or he'd say, ''Would you add up this column for me?'' I just had a knack for it. I was about 10 years old.
Q.And what about high school and college?
A. In college, I worked 40 hours a week while I was taking a full-time curriculum. I had tremendous discipline then because I knew I had to put myself through college.
I had the good fortune of having an economics professor who opened up this whole world of health care for me. She said a couple of things to me: one, that it's an industry with no women in leadership, and 20 years from now it's going to be 20 percent of the gross national product. And she said, ''It's going to open doors that a lot of other industries won't open for women, so I think that's where you should go.'' Then, once I started working in a hospital, I just knew health care was where I needed to be.
Q.Why did you decide to go into business for yourself?
A. I worked my way up to a chief operating officer job at a hospital by the age of 30. I figured I could be the C.E.O., but the C.E.O. wasn't going anywhere. So I started looking elsewhere for opportunities, and I kept getting interviewed for the C.E.O. job but never got hired. In that era, it was still a male-dominated industry. I saw an opportunity to create an alternative employer health insurance plan. And now, nearly 20 years later, we have almost 1,000 people who work for me.
Q. What do you consider the most important leadership lessons you've learned?
A. Early on, it was clear to me that if I was going to build a successful business, it was going to be about building relationships. I figured out that relationships were built in business on the golf course, and that's when golf started becoming such an important part of my culture, even though I had never golfed before. I had never been an athlete.
I never played anything, not even miniature golf. But I started with lessons at a local driving range with a golf pro. Then I started to play in these golf outings and saw the kind of relationship-building that it allowed me to do. I started to get competitive, and I took more lessons. I was introduced to an L.P.G.A. pro, and she started giving me lessons and I got better. The next thing I knew, I said: ''You know what? I need to bring her in to teach my management team because I can't be the only one out playing golf with people. First of all, I've got a lot to do, and I need other people to build that skill set.'' So it became part of our culture that my management team took up golf.
Q. How good a golfer are you now?
A. I have a 13 handicap.
Q.And were the people on your management team golfers?
A. When the company was still relatively small, I had four or five key managers I needed to help me build relationships. But a few of them weren't even golfers, didn't even have clubs. So I said: ''We're going to give you lessons. I'll help you get golf clubs. If I've got to buy you golf clubs, whatever I've got to do, you need to have the full package so that I can send you out with a customer.''
As I started adding people to the team, it became a part of my interview process. ''Do you golf? Do you like to golf? Do you want to like to golf? Well, you're going to have to like to golf because that's part of what we do here.'' Today, we participate in golf outings throughout the tristate area for charitable events probably every Monday from April 1 through the end of October.
I'm very competitive, and when I play golf with mostly men, I don't play from the forward tees. I play from the white tees because I don't want to miss the action. I don't want to miss the dialogue. I don't want to miss the competitiveness that's going on at the tee. I don't care if I'm a little shorter than they are. That's O.K. I'll make it up. I want to be there with them. I want them to see that I can keep up with them.
Q. How many times do you play a week?
A. In the season, I play three to four times a week. I play every Monday, I play Saturday and Sunday and then I'll usually play one other day during the week with a customer or someone.
Q.Tell me a little bit more about the culture of your company.
A. I'm a very family-oriented person. So your family's very important to me, and what you do with your family is very important to make sure that you have balance. I want your family to know how we work together. I will do things with my management team, like invite them over to my home to help them learn how to make raviolis. They come over with their kids and they come over with their significant other, and we're in the kitchen and we're all learning how to cook as a team. I call it QualCare Cooking School.
So we'll have 20 people over. My kitchen will be a mess, but when we're done, everyone's family will know how important working with these other people is. I want their family to see that, because we do spend a lot of time with each other and the kids are always saying, ''Dad, why do you have to work late tonight?'' So doing things like cooking school helps them understand that.
We also do a lot of things with our employees to help them relieve their stress. We are in the health care business, but we're on the side of the business when people only call us when somebody's sick, or there's some problem or some issue.
For the people on the phone handling that customer who's under stress, we want to relieve their stress. So we do things like we have pajama day, where everybody comes to work in their pajamas. It's like a casual day, and they have fun. We do Disco Friday, too -- on some Fridays during the busiest times of the year, we'll put music on in the hallways and people just dance.
Halloween, from our first year, has been a big part of the company. People get dressed up. They put on entire plays in the office and they compete against each other. It's all about teamwork, building camaraderie and having fun. We close down the night before Halloween day, and I walk in the next morning and the entire 100,000 square feet of space is decorated, and people do skits all day long.
Q.Anything unusual about how you run meetings?
A. I have a rule. I don't think a meeting should run longer than an hour. And if I don't have an agenda in front of me, I walk out. Give me an agenda or else I'm not going to sit there, because if I don't know why we're in the meeting, and you don't know why we're there, then there's no reason for a meeting. It's very important to me to focus people and to keep them focused, and not just get in the room and talk about who won the Knicks game last night. That's not what it's about.
Q.What if the meeting runs longer than an hour?
A. After an hour, I will get up and walk out of a meeting. I know that things should not take that long.
Q.How do you hire? What questions do you ask?
A. When I'm considering somebody for an executive-level position, I usually do three interviews. The first interview is all about you as a person. I want to know about who you are -- not what you are -- and what made you what you are. What's your family like? How did you grow up? Where did you go to school? What are the kinds of things that influenced you?
Q. And what are you listening for?
A. I want to know what kind of values you have. I'm listening for things that are important to you. I'm listening for things that you have fun doing, because I think people should work hard and play hard. I want you to tell me a little bit about what excites you outside of work.
The second interview is about your technical competence. How smart are you? What have you done? What experience do you have? What are your success stories? What have been your failures? Because I'm a big believer that you learn as much from failure as you do from success. So I want to know the things that you did wrong or the things that didn't work well in your career that might have helped build your character.
And the third time we get together, it's really about, ''All right, now you know a little bit about me. Hopefully, you've done your research. Do you think we could work together?'' It's really about trying to make sure that there's a fit between the two of us.
This interview has been edited and condensed. A longer version is at nytimes.com /businessday.nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Young, Black, Male, And Stalked by Bias

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
The door to the subway train slides open, revealing three tall, young black men, crowding the entrance, with hooded sweatshirts pulled up over downward-turned faces; boxer shorts billowing out of over-large, low-slung jeans; and sneakers with the laces untied.
Your response to the look -- and to this trio on the subway -- depends in part on the context, like the time of day, but especially on how you feel about young, male blackness. 
If it unsettles you -- as it does many people -- you never get beyond the first impression. But those of us who are not reflexively uncomfortable with blackness can discern the clues that tell who these kids are. They may be tall, but their hormonally pockmarked faces, narrow hips and the cartoon-patterned underwear show that they are probably 15 years old, at most. The grimy black book bags, barely visible against the black hoodies, make them students on the way to school.
Young black men know that in far too many settings they will be seen not as individuals, but as the ''other,'' and given no benefit of the doubt. By the time they have grown into adult bodies -- even though they are still children -- they are well versed in the experience of being treated as criminals until proved otherwise by cops who stop and search them and eyed warily by nighttime pedestrians who cower on the sidewalks.
Society's message to black boys -- ''we fear you and view you as dangerous'' -- is constantly reinforced. Boys who are seduced by this version of themselves end up on a fast track to prison and to the graveyard. But even those who keep their distance from this deadly idea are at risk of losing their lives to it. The death of Trayvon Martin vividly underscores that danger.
Very few Americans make a conscious decision to subscribe to racist views. But the toxic connotations that the culture has associated with blackness have been embedded in thought, language and social convention for hundreds of years. This makes it easy for people to see the world through a profoundly bigoted lens without being aware that they are doing so.
Over the last three decades, a growing body of research has shown that racial stereotypes play a powerful role in judgments made by ostensibly fair-minded people. Killers of whites, for example, are more likely to receive the death penalty than killers of blacks -- and, according to the psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt, juries tend to see darker defendants as more ''deathworthy'' in capital cases involving white victims.
As Vesla Weaver, a political science professor at the University of Virginia, has written, ''virtually every aspect of life and material well-being is influenced by skin color, in addition to race.'' Studies have shown, for example, that darker-skinned blacks are punished more severely than others for the same types of crimes; deemed less worthy of help during disasters like Hurricane Katrina; disfavored in some hiring decisions; and more likely to be unemployed.
THESE preconceptions are at work even in the early grades at school, where voluminous data show that children of color are far more likely than their white peers to be suspended, expelled or declared ''disabled'' and shunted into special education.
The power of stereotypes has always been easily illustrated in studies. But media accounts of the 911 calls made over the last several years by George Zimmerman, now charged with second-degree murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin, offer a glimpse of a man who seemed gripped by fears that he began to associate almost exclusively with black children and teenagers.
The 911 calls began at least eight years ago, with Mr. Zimmerman reporting on a range of non-emergencies, including the existence of potholes or someone driving slowly through the neighborhood. By late 2011, his calls were often about black youths and men, with complaints about suspicious activity or just loitering.
By the time he went on neighborhood watch patrol with his 9-millimeter pistol and spied Trayvon Martin, Mr. Zimmerman saw not a teenager with candy, but a collection of preconceptions: the black as burglar, the black as drug addict, the black ''up to no good.'' And he was determined not to let this one get away.
As recently as a few years ago, this case probably would not have been noticed outside Florida, which has a long and bloody history of sacrificing black lives without consequence. The country is right to focus on this case and to look for ways to prevent it from happening again.
People who are seeking to affix blame for this tragic death do need to bear one thing in mind. Gun laws that allowed a community watch volunteer to run around armed are, of course, partly responsible. But Trayvon Martin was killed by a very old idea that will likely take generations and an enormous cultural transformation to dislodge.

HEADLINE: NATO Finds Crucial Flaws In Libya Action

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT; C. J. Chivers contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite widespread praise in Western capitals for NATO's leadership of the air campaign in Libya, a confidential NATO assessment paints a sobering portrait of the alliance's ability to carry out such campaigns without significant support from the United States.
The report concluded that the allies struggled to share crucial target information, lacked specialized planners and analysts, and overly relied on the United States for reconnaissance and refueling aircraft.
The findings undercut the idea that the intervention was a model operation and that NATO could effectively carry out a more complicated campaign in Syria without relying disproportionately on the United States military. Even with the American help in Libya, NATO had only about 40 percent of the aircraft needed to intercept electronic communications, a shortage that hindered the operation's effectiveness, the report said.
Mounting an operation in Syria would pose a bigger challenge than the seven-month campaign that drove Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya from power, American officials said. Syria has a more capable military as well as a formidable array of sophisticated Russian-made air defenses that Pentagon officials say would take weeks of airstrikes to destroy. 
Also, the Syrian opposition is more disjointed and dispersed than Libya's, making allied efforts to coordinate with the rebels more difficult, a senior NATO official said.
''If anything were to be envisaged over Syria, even in purely hypothetical terms, it would also rely heavily on U.S. capabilities,'' said one senior European diplomat who reviewed the 37-page NATO report, which was completed in late February.
The report, whose findings and recommendations are expected to be endorsed by NATO ministers at a meeting in Brussels this week, is consistent with preliminary assessments that European and Canadian planes carried out the bulk of the combat flights to protect Libyan civilians, while the United States provided military support that was essential in accomplishing the mission.
But the report and more than 300 pages of supporting documents, copies of which were obtained by The New York Times, offer telling new details about shortcomings in planning, staffing and conducting the combat mission, as well as how commanders improvised to adjust.
The report also spotlights an important issue for the alliance that dates to the Balkan wars of the 1990s: that the United States has emerged ''by default'' as the NATO specialist in providing precision-guided munitions -- which made up virtually all of the 7,700 bombs and missiles dropped or fired on Libya -- and a vast majority of specialized aircraft that conduct aerial intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, or I.S.R. in military parlance.
''NATO remains overly reliant on a single ally to provide I.S.R. collection capabilities that are essential to the commander,'' the report said.
In this criticism, however, several American and other allied officials said they saw a silver lining. The NATO report played a significant role in helping the alliance agree in February to acquire its own dedicated air-to-ground surveillance system to track and target hostile ground forces, the officials said.
The assessment also helped spur a French-led initiative backed by the Obama administration to establish a hub for allied surveillance aircraft, including Predator and Global Hawk drones, at an Italian air base in Sicily. This concept is modeled after a similar approach NATO has developed in Afghanistan, and it is expected to be approved by allied leaders at a NATO summit meeting in Chicago next month.
In addition, European defense ministers agreed last month on an ambitious proposal to expand the allies' aerial refueling fleet, another American-backed measure that NATO officials will highlight in Chicago.
''NATO always draws the lessons from its operations, and we're already doing that with Libya,'' Adm. James G. Stavridis, an American officer who is the alliance's senior military commander, said in an e-mail statement.
Most of the recommendations, particularly those that involve buying expensive aircraft and technical equipment, could take years to put in place.
And those solutions will not address the immediate concerns raised by advocates of using allied air power to stop the slaughter of civilians in Syria.
Two of those advocates, Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, toured a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey before a fragile, United Nations-brokered cease-fire took hold last week. They once again called on the international community to arm the Syrian rebels and to intervene militarily to create and protect havens for Syrian civilians and rebels receiving training.
''Airstrikes would help to establish and defend safe havens in Syria, especially in the north, in which opposition forces can organize and plan their political and military activities against Assad,'' Mr. McCain said last month at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.
President Obama has requested that the Pentagon begin preparing preliminary military options in Syria -- a routine step for military contingency planning during crises overseas -- but the administration still believes that using diplomatic and economic pressure is the best way to stop the violent repression by the Syrian government.
The report, completed on Feb. 28 by NATO's Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Center in Portugal, identified 15 political, organizational and equipment lessons learned, including several shortcomings.
Information about targets in Libya was drawn largely from the databases of individual nations, and much of this could not be shared rapidly among NATO members and partners because of ''classification or procedural reasons,'' the report found.
''Nations did not effectively and efficiently share national intelligence and targeting information among allies and with partners,'' the report said. ''The inability to share information presented a major hindrance to nations deciding if a target could be engaged'' based on information from another country.
The NATO command in Italy suffered from serious shortages of political and legal advisers, intelligence analysts, logistics planners, linguists, and specialists in selecting targets, called targeteers. ''Many targeteers had not been adequately trained on deliberate, dynamic or time-sensitive targeting,'' the report said, adding that many specialists were assigned to the command for only a few weeks.
The report was silent on the controversies that have followed the campaign. These included questions surrounding at least scores of civilian deaths caused by NATO action, which have been documented by independent researchers and the United Nations alike, and accusations by survivors and human rights organizations that alliance naval vessels did not assist boats in distress carrying migrants who later perished at sea.
Fred Abrahams, a special adviser for Human Rights Watch, said the report was consistent with the alliance's refusal to acknowledge clear mistakes, and revealed a ''willful decision not to look at civilian casualties.''
''It's not lessons learned, it's lessons lost,'' he said by telephone from New York. ''There is no reason whatsoever, in an otherwise effective campaign, not to look back and explore the areas where things went wrong.''
The report also passed over a number of tactical details without examining the rationale for them or their potential risks and consequences. It noted, for example, that the alliance itself did not have what it called ''boots on ground'' but did not disclose that forward air control teams -- troops on the ground to help guide planes to intended targets -- were used later in the conflict by member nations, or that the anti-Qaddafi forces were providing targeting recommendations to NATO via informal means, sometimes even by way of Twitter or e-mail.

HEADLINE: A Second Opinion: The Post-Baccalaureate

BYLINE: By CECILIA CAPUZZI SIMON. 
Cecilia Capuzzi Simon covers education from Washington, D.C., and teaches writing at American University.

 BODY:
THREE years ago, Molly Grassini was living the life of a struggling actor, landing roles in small theater productions, acting in a Web series and bouncing between auditions in Los Angeles. The closest she came to a career in health care was a featured part in a Vitamin Water ad.
So it may seem a leap that the onetime actress, at 26, has her sights set on medical school. But the death of her older brother had ignited an interest in medicine, and a wish to ''honor'' him. ''I couldn't live that fantasy anymore,'' she says of acting. ''I wanted work that would ground me in the world at large.''
Ms. Grassini is about to accomplish Step 1 in her professional transformation. In May, she will complete a post-baccalaureate pre-med program at Columbia University, where she has progressed through a tightly scripted roster of every foundational science and math course that she did not take while singing, dancing and acting her way through an undergraduate degree in fine arts at New York University. With these prerequisites in hand, Ms. Grassini expects to gain admission to medical school in 2013. 
Like Ms. Grassini, many older students (mean entry age: 28) are relying on post-bac programs to resuscitate -- or initiate -- dreams of practicing medicine. More than 15 percent of last year's new crop of medical students had gone through such a program, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the number of programs has mushroomed. Today, there are about 135 listed with the association, an increase of more than 45 percent over 2009.
Dr. Darrell G. Kirch, who heads the A.A.M.C., says that post-bac programs fill a critical role in the medical field. ''In the absence of these programs, a number of people who would be great doctors would give up,'' he says.
''Post-BAC pre-med'' can refer to any of a number of programs of study taken up after a student has earned a bachelor's degree. Some are master's level and assume some proficiency in prerequisite science courses. But the most popular and fastest-growing programs are like Columbia's, which delivers a rigorous lineup of prerequisite undergraduate courses with wraparound support, including MCAT preparation, advising and health care volunteer work. They hope to help would-be doctors (and dentists and veterinarians) put forward the best package of grades and experience when applying to medical schools.
At Columbia, enrollment grew to 606 students last year, from 282 in 2000. Washington University in St. Louis introduced its post-bac in 2006; since then, enrollment has tripled. Goucher College received 400 applications for 30 spots in its 2012 class.
The programs can be expensive -- usually the same rate as the undergraduate per-credit tuition. For Columbia's two-year program, that means $57,000 in tuition, plus an estimated $43,000 for room, board and expenses. At the University of Connecticut, tuition for a full-time, two-year post-bac program will total $21,884 in the fall.
Students can take courses on their own, of course. If they do, Dr. Gerald Soslau, vice dean of the Drexel University College of Medicine,recommends that students take two science courses per semester, at a four-year college, to show medical schools they can handle the academic load.
What a student misses by going alone, however, is the support provided by an academic adviser who will act as sounding board, guide and writer of the all-important letter of recommendation to medical school committees. Some programs have agreements with medical schools that offer qualified post-bac students early admission.
Columbia created the first post-bac program, in 1955, in its School of General Studies, intended for a postwar generation that was re-creating itself professionally.
Forty years ago, Southern Illinois University and Wayne State University in Detroit were pioneers in the profession's efforts to recruit and train minority students who show promise in undergraduate pre-med curriculums but do not have the G.P.A. or MCAT scores to get them into medical school. Of the programs listed on the A.A.M.C. site, about 40 identify themselves as for ''groups underrepresented in medicine.''
But in the past decade, it has been the older student looking for a second career in medicine that has driven the growth in the number and profile of the pre-med post-baccalaureates: about 80 programs are listed specifically for career-changers who lack science prerequisites; about 80 are labeled ''academic record enhancers,'' for recent graduates who took math and science but did poorly, or failed to get into med school the first time around. The programs are not interchangeable: programs intended to enhance grades assume a second pass at the material, and undergraduate and post-bac grades in those subjectsare usually melded to present to medical schools.
Students with none of the undergraduate courses that medical schools require should expect to take a minimum of two semesters each of chemistry, organic chemistry, biology and physics. (Post-bacs are typically full time and run 11 months to two years; some programs, like Drexel's, offer evening classes; Northeastern University has an online option.)
Among the post-bac A.A.M.C. categories, career changers are the most academically successful, with matriculants earning an average MCAT score of 30.5 (out of 45); students in record-enhancer programs average 27.5. By contrast, the mean MCAT score for all pre-med matriculants is 31.1.
The laggard economy (what else?) is at least in part responsible for the post-bac boom. It is no coincidence, for example, that Columbia's post-bac applications and ranks grew with former financiers and lawyers when the banking industry started its downward spiral. Or that many enterprising schools created programs (some better than others, experts warn) to tap into demand from the downsized looking for career fulfillment.Or that applications to medical school hit a record last year -- almost 44,000 for less than half as many spots.
As Betsy Merideth, director of Goucher College's 28-year-old program, points out, many enrolling in medical school are banking on job security. ''I know unemployed lawyers,'' she says, ''but there's no such thing as an unemployed doctor.''
But those focused solely on finances are not necessarily the candidates who will make it into the selective post-bac programs that medical schools like to see on applications. Neither are they likely to get rich in practice given the current state of health care.
As Ms. Grassini notes, the time and money needed for a post-bac is worth it only if you are getting into medicine for altruistic reasons. ''Health care as a career choice can be good if you want to help people,'' she says. ''If you are looking for notoriety or the big bucks, that's a tougher road and maybe you should have been a doctor at a different time.''
Ms. Grassini's motivation -- the ''inciting incident'' that led her to medicine -- is rooted in her 26-year-old brother's medical tragedy. He had been treated at an alcohol rehabilitation center and given a drug that landed him in a hospital emergency room with a near-fatal allergic reaction. It was supposed to be removed from his prescription list, but once back at the center, it was mistakenly given to him again. That dose killed him. The negligence had outraged her.
The theater world had begun to feel ''fake,'' she says. ''I would leave auditions and ask myself, 'What am I doing?' '' -- especially when compared to the ''real-life medical drama'' she had lived. She started to reconsider her choice of acting.
To test the waters, she volunteered at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. That experience made up her mind.
The transition has not been easy. Adapting to a rigorous and unrelenting courseload of physics, math and science was at first a stretch compared to writing the papers and scripts that had dominated her time as an undergraduate. ''It was not how my brain was wired,'' she says.
Still, she had a love of science, and figured out how to process and memorize a lot of information quickly. After isolating herself the first year to focus on studies, she has since loosened up. She has even found art in chemistry class, where she has employed her drawing skills.
''Some of the compounds are really beautiful,'' she says.
The post-bac ranks are filled with stories like Ms. Grassini's. Medical schools like what older students can bring to a class and to the profession. ''In general, they are more self-aware, more focused, more empathetic because of the rich experiences they had before medical school,'' says Dr. Rafael Rivera, director of admissions at N.Y.U. School of Medicine. Their personal stories and motivations, he adds, ''weigh heavily'' on an admissions committee's considerations.
''We spend a lot of time with these applicants trying to clarify 'Why medical school, and why now?' '' he says. But an interesting life story and noble intentions alone are no guarantee of admission. Medical training is a long journey -- often 10 years can elapse between medical school, internships and fellowships before one is a practicing physician. Unlike the medical student straight out of college, older students often must work out sacrifices in established personal lives and finances once they embark on medical education.
And, to be blunt, they have fewer years to practice than their traditional counterparts.
There are no surveys on admit rates for students coming from post-bac programs, but consider: At N.Y.U., of 698 post-bacs who applied for the class entering in 2011, 24 were accepted -- a 3.4 percent admit rate. That compares with a 5.6 percent admit rate for those not from post-bac programs. This year applications to N.Y.U. medical school from post-bacs are up 25 percent from two years ago -- 18 have been accepted and the school is awaiting their responses.
''The post-bac is a big risk to take,'' says Marissa Lipton, who at 26 is in her second year of med school at the University of Connecticut, where she also completed her post-bac. As a psychology major at Tufts, she thought about medicine but did not want to be hemmed in by the prerequisites, which would have taken up about a quarter of her schedule.
Facing graduation, Ms. Lipton thought carefully about how best to maximize her odds of getting into med school before starting down that path. A Connecticut native, she was aware of the post-bac program at UConn and its reputation for placement, especially into its own med school.
''I didn't want to spend two years of very hard work without the reward,'' Ms. Lipton says. ''If I was going to go back and do that, I wanted to make sure my goal was attained.''

The show stars Ms. Dunham, Zosia Mamet and Jemima Kirke (above, from left) and Allison Williams. '' 'Girls' offers romantic failure wrapped in the trappings of failure,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. She added, ''The depiction of slacker life in New York, which includes tattoos, drugs, casual sex and abortions, is presented with wry humor, but it could easily be interpreted as a cautionary tale written by the religious right: the lifestyles of these modern women, untethered to responsibility, faith or morality, are parables that could scare Amish youth away from Rumspringa and wayward Mormons back into their temple garments.''

HEADLINE: Selling the Farm

BYLINE: By KYLE SPENCER

 BODY:
FORGET the cheese brick and salami round that Dad picks up on alumni weekends. Today's college farm cultivates exotic fruits, expensive Asian greens and grass-fed beef. Students are developing product lines for high-end tastes, and honing not just basic husbandry skills but also marketing savvy in the interest of turning their acreage into profit centers.
''Most small farms lose money,'' says Sean Clark, the farm manager at Berea College and an editor of ''Fields of Learning: The Student Farm Movement in North America,'' published last year. ''The whole idea is to show students how to make money on a small amount of acreage,'' he says.
At California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, whose popular Farm Store has become a financial buoy in a sea of state budget cuts, profits are being funneled back into a cash-strained agricultural school. At other campuses, the money goes to repair tractors or update solar-powered greenhouses. 
These college farms are steeped in the grow-local sustainability practices that appeal to the green-minded consumers around college towns. Warren Wilson College raises grass-fed cattle and free-roaming pigs. That has attracted the attention of foodies in Asheville, N.C., a progressive enclave eight miles away. ''People in Asheville are really educated about good food,'' says Lily Walton, an environmental studies major with a concentration in sustainable agriculture, who runs the meat sales operations. Ms. Walton works 15 hours a week on the farm to defray the cost of tuition. This past fall, the school made a whopping $80,000 on its sale of beef quarters, pork loins and charcuterie.
Jenn Halpin, the farm manager at Dickinson College, puts the movement in perspective. ''This isn't just about being economically viable,'' says Ms. Halpin, who also teaches in the environmental studies department. ''It's also about finding ways to connect with your community.''
LITTLE PIGGIES GO TO MARKET
Students in the agriculture and natural resources department at Berea College in Kentucky had been raising and selling hogs for years. Student wages go toward room and board at this tuition-free college, but for the school it was a loss all around: the pigs were not profitable.
Last year, students vowed to change that. They reduced their herd by half, to 250 hogs. Next, they limited the number of whole hogs sold, and focused on ways to package their meat. They spent months testing recipes for spicy breakfast sausages and juicy chorizo, bringing their samples to the farmers market and asking customers to weigh in. Now, they sell bacon, hams and homemade sausages, making twice as much with half as many pigs, at the Berea Farmers Market.
''We're learning how to do something on a small scale that is still diverse and profitable,'' says Emily Grace Sarver-Wolf, a junior agriculture and natural resources major.
Reducing the herd has had the added benefit of creating more humane grazing practices. Before, the livestock had spent most of their short lives huddled in a crowded concrete building. Now, Berea pigs roam sloping meadows and nibble on pesticide-free grass.
HOT, BOK AND POLY
Discerning shoppers crowd Cal Poly Pomona's 2,500-square-foot Farm Store on Saturday mornings for hydroponically grown bok choi, kai choi, variegated lemons and fresh juices made from student-grown valencia oranges.
This year, the store is expected to make a profit of $64,000, a 23 percent increase from last year. This is no accident. Students and staff members have worked hard to turn the store into a destination by offering hard-to-find items like the Buddha's Hand, a large, tentacled citrus fruit thought by bakers to render the best lemon rind.
The key, students say, is to grow and sell produce that is exotic enough to charge more but not so exotic that no one wants to buy it.
Kirk Weatherton, a plant science major who manages a section of the university's hydroponic greenhouse, got the balance right earlier this year when he decided to grow the hottest pepper he could find, settling on the bhut jolokia, or ghost pepper. It is a small, fire-engine-red Indian fruit that is hundreds of times hotter than the jalapeno. ''It was a side project that got really, really big,'' he says. The pepper sold out every morning by 9:30.
Gift boxes of navel oranges, kiwis and other campus-grown fruit can be ordered by phone at (909) 869-4906 or online at www.csupomona.edu.
HERBALISM
Here's how students at Warren Wilson College turned All-Heal, its natural version of Neosporin, into a moneymaker. The five-member herb crew consulted an herbalist, adding chickweed and calendula for their curative powers. They found a more descriptive name in Wonder Balm, redesigned the label and sizes, and raised the price of a two-ounce bottle to $6, from $4.
''We thought all this would help emphasize that it is a unique handmade product,'' says Meredith Corey-Disch, who graduated in December with a degree in global studies and served on the herb crew. (All students are assigned to one of 120 work crews and log 15 hours a week in exchange for $3,480 toward school expenses.) The refreshed aromatic balm was unveiled at the annual December fair, along with a new line of naturally scented soaps, herbal teas and other ointments. The crew sold 55 jars in three hours and made $2,000. ''That was the most we've made in the history of the fair,'' says Hannah Schiller, a sociology and anthropology major at the North Carolina college. ''It was a really special semester for all of us because we'd created products people really wanted to buy, and we'd made a profit.'' To order: (828) 771-3066.
FARM-FRESH DRESSING
At Dickinson College's 50-acre organic farm, high-tunnel greenhouses extend the growing season, so Katelyn Repash had a bright idea: ''to make more use of the fresh vegetables and herbs we had on hand,'' Ms. Repash says. She spent many solitary hours in Dickinson's freshly renovated test kitchen chopping, stirring and tasting. She created a big-selling line of tangy seasonal salad dressings packed with bell peppers, beefsteak tomatoes, basil and arugula.
Ms. Repash graduated last year and now works at a livestock farm in Maryland. Her successors have concocted a Red Devil hot sauce, named for the school's mascot, that has done so well that they are increasing hot pepper production this spring by 300 percent. Students have recently completed testing a rich, herb-laced pasta sauce that awaits U.S.D.A. approval. The vinaigrettes ($4.75 a bottle) are available at the farmers market in downtown Carlisle, Pa.

HEADLINE: The Downside of Cohabiting Before Marriage

BYLINE: By MEG JAY. 
A clinical psychologist at the University of Virginia and author of ''The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter -- and How to Make the Most of Them Now.''

 BODY:
AT 32, one of my clients (I'll call her Jennifer) had a lavish wine-country wedding. By then, Jennifer and her boyfriend had lived together for more than four years. The event was attended by the couple's friends, families and two dogs.
When Jennifer started therapy with me less than a year later, she was looking for a divorce lawyer. ''I spent more time planning my wedding than I spent happily married,'' she sobbed. Most disheartening to Jennifer was that she'd tried to do everything right. ''My parents got married young so, of course, they got divorced. We lived together! How did this happen?''
Cohabitation in the United States has increased by more than 1,500 percent in the past half century. In 1960, about 450,000 unmarried couples lived together. Now the number is more than 7.5 million. The majority of young adults in their 20s will live with a romantic partner at least once, and more than half of all marriages will be preceded by cohabitation. This shift has been attributed to the sexual revolution and the availability of birth control, and in our current economy, sharing the bills makes cohabiting appealing. But when you talk to people in their 20s, you also hear about something else: cohabitation as prophylaxis. 
In a nationwide survey conducted in 2001 by the National Marriage Project, then at Rutgers and now at the University of Virginia, nearly half of 20-somethings agreed with the statement, ''You would only marry someone if he or she agreed to live together with you first, so that you could find out whether you really get along.'' About two-thirds said they believed that moving in together before marriage was a good way to avoid divorce.
But that belief is contradicted by experience. Couples who cohabit before marriage (and especially before an engagement or an otherwise clear commitment) tend to be less satisfied with their marriages -- and more likely to divorce -- than couples who do not. These negative outcomes are called the cohabitation effect.
Researchers originally attributed the cohabitation effect to selection, or the idea that cohabitors were less conventional about marriage and thus more open to divorce. As cohabitation has become a norm, however, studies have shown that the effect is not entirely explained by individual characteristics like religion, education or politics. Research suggests that at least some of the risks may lie in cohabitation itself.
As Jennifer and I worked to answer her question, ''How did this happen?'' we talked about how she and her boyfriend went from dating to cohabiting. Her response was consistent with studies reporting that most couples say it ''just happened.''
''We were sleeping over at each other's places all the time,'' she said. ''We liked to be together, so it was cheaper and more convenient. It was a quick decision but if it didn't work out there was a quick exit.''
She was talking about what researchers call ''sliding, not deciding.'' Moving from dating to sleeping over to sleeping over a lot to cohabitation can be a gradual slope, one not marked by rings or ceremonies or sometimes even a conversation. Couples bypass talking about why they want to live together and what it will mean.
WHEN researchers ask cohabitors these questions, partners often have different, unspoken -- even unconscious -- agendas. Women are more likely to view cohabitation as a step toward marriage, while men are more likely to see it as a way to test a relationship or postpone commitment, and this gender asymmetry is associated with negative interactions and lower levels of commitment even after the relationship progresses to marriage. One thing men and women do agree on, however, is that their standards for a live-in partner are lower than they are for a spouse.
Sliding into cohabitation wouldn't be a problem if sliding out were as easy. But it isn't. Too often, young adults enter into what they imagine will be low-cost, low-risk living situations only to find themselves unable to get out months, even years, later. It's like signing up for a credit card with 0 percent interest. At the end of 12 months when the interest goes up to 23 percent you feel stuck because your balance is too high to pay off. In fact, cohabitation can be exactly like that. In behavioral economics, it's called consumer lock-in.
Lock-in is the decreased likelihood to search for, or change to, another option once an investment in something has been made. The greater the setup costs, the less likely we are to move to another, even better, situation, especially when faced with switching costs, or the time, money and effort it requires to make a change.
Cohabitation is loaded with setup and switching costs. Living together can be fun and economical, and the setup costs are subtly woven in. After years of living among roommates' junky old stuff, couples happily split the rent on a nice one-bedroom apartment. They share wireless and pets and enjoy shopping for new furniture together. Later, these setup and switching costs have an impact on how likely they are to leave.
Jennifer said she never really felt that her boyfriend was committed to her. ''I felt like I was on this multiyear, never-ending audition to be his wife,'' she said. ''We had all this furniture. We had our dogs and all the same friends. It just made it really, really difficult to break up. Then it was like we got married because we were living together once we got into our 30s.''
I've had other clients who also wish they hadn't sunk years of their 20s into relationships that would have lasted only months had they not been living together. Others want to feel committed to their partners, yet they are confused about whether they have consciously chosen their mates. Founding relationships on convenience or ambiguity can interfere with the process of claiming the people we love. A life built on top of ''maybe you'll do'' simply may not feel as dedicated as a life built on top of the ''we do'' of commitment or marriage.
The unfavorable connection between cohabitation and divorce does seem to be lessening, however, according to a report released last month by the Department of Health and Human Services. More good news is that a 2010 survey by the Pew Research Center found that nearly two-thirds of Americans saw cohabitation as a step toward marriage.
This shared and serious view of cohabitation may go a long way toward further attenuating the cohabitation effect because the most recent research suggests that serial cohabitators, couples with differing levels of commitment and those who use cohabitation as a test are most at risk for poor relationship quality and eventual relationship dissolution.
Cohabitation is here to stay, and there are things young adults can do to protect their relationships from the cohabitation effect. It's important to discuss each person's motivation and commitment level beforehand and, even better, to view cohabitation as an intentional step toward, rather than a convenient test for, marriage or partnership.
It also makes sense to anticipate and regularly evaluate constraints that may keep you from leaving.
I am not for or against living together, but I am for young adults knowing that, far from safeguarding against divorce and unhappiness, moving in with someone can increase your chances of making a mistake -- or of spending too much time on a mistake. A mentor of mine used to say, ''The best time to work on someone's marriage is before he or she has one,'' and in our era, that may mean before cohabitation.

IN INDIA-PAKISTAN CONFLICT,
DEATHS ON A GLACIER
In the snowy wastes of Siachen, where Pakistani and Indian soldiers face off in a high-altitude battle zone ringed by Himalayan peaks, the fight is against the mountain, not the man. Avalanches are common, and the most recent one on April 7 buried 124 Pakistani soldiers and 11 civilians. It also reinvigorated questions of whether the region is really worth fighting over. Page 6

HEADLINE: Executive Pay, Revisited

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Rich Game of Thrones'' (April 8), which described pay for chief executives of big companies in 2011: 
The idea of basing executive pay on performance, as more companies seem to be doing, does have a dangerous side. Just look at the end of retiree health benefits, or at the freezing and disappearance of pension funds, at many corporations. Those things can happen when companies want to make sure they meet financial ''performance goals'' in a sluggish economy.
Who knows how workers will suffer next so that executives can reach their performance objectives and find the carrot at the end of the stick. Maybe more jobs will be moved overseas? Maybe more companies will file temporary bankruptcy to seek protection from paying bills?
I firmly believe that hardworking, honest chief executives deserve their paychecks, but that performance shouldn't be the only criterion in setting that pay. Let's not repeat history.
Joseph Eisenberg
Alstead, N.H., April 10
To the Editor:
No one seriously argues that chief executives really need so much money -- it is the measurement that counts. So I have a proposal:
First, limit C.E.O. pay to, say, 250 times what the median employee makes. That should be enough for the executives to buy some extra homes. Then, to further reward these lions of capitalism, use the extra money they now make to hire professional adulators -- like singers, jesters, playwrights, poets and painters -- to proclaim their praises.
That way, C.E.O. egos would be satisfied, many more people would be employed in fields where money is now hard to come by, and our ancestors could read or touch lasting monuments to executive glory. Corey Rosen

HEADLINE: The Amazing Matzo Stimulus

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
When Aron Streit started making matzo in 1916, unleavened bread was a serious growth business, at least on Manhattan's Lower East Side. By the late 1920s, Streit could afford to build a special machine that mixed, kneaded and cooked dough. A decade later, his family added the cotton gin of kosher food -- an automated conveyor belt with a Rube Goldberg-esque basket system that moved the matzo to a packaging area on a higher floor. They even opened a retail store next door that allowed customers to watch it in action.
Visiting the Streit's Matzos factory became such a tradition for Jews in the neighborhood that many refused to buy any other brand -- and so did their children and so on. And partly because of this loyalty, the company hasn't had to significantly upgrade its technology since World War II. ''Nothing changes,'' Aron Yagoda, Streit's great-grandson, says. ''As long as they don't change Passover, we have built-in sales.'' 
During the eight-day Passover holiday, which ends this week, religious law mandates that all Jews give up any bread product or grain-based food other than matzo. As a result, each spring ushers in a matzo stimulus. And I wondered, as both an economics reporter and a Jew, whether it was good to sell something that about 2 percent of the U.S. population has to buy for one week a year but isn't all that popular at any other time or with any other group? Can a matzo manufacturer remain profitable this way forever, or like Apple, does it need to eventually reach beyond a group of religious followers and appeal to the mainstream?
According to the marketing firm Lubicom, around $130 million worth of matzo is sold each year. During Passover, about 20 percent of it is sold by Streit's. Most manufacturers would love to take in around $17 million for a single holiday without needing to invest in new equipment. But Yagoda says it's not so easy. Sales are stable, but flour and labor costs continue to rise, and operating a manufacturing business in Lower Manhattan is logistically complicated. When I asked Yagoda, who now runs the company with his cousins, why he hasn't moved to a new industrial site in a lower-cost state, he insisted that Streit's would be acting disloyal if it didn't offer the exact same matzo, made in the exact same oven (with the exact same New York City tap water), that his customers' grandparents bought.
Streit's is stuck, Yagoda says, but happily stuck. He's content to have a smaller profit margin each year and bring home less than his parents and grandparents did. (''If they could eat steak, we're eating hamburger,'' he says.) It seems reasonable to imagine that in a decade or maybe two, Streit's will go out of business. But the friction of tradition has already kept the company alive decades longer than comparable businesses. What other globally traded mass-production food comes out of the Lower East Side?
Streit's supervising rabbi referred to the company's biggest rival, somewhat menacingly, as ''Big M.'' Manischewitz, which controls about 40 percent of the Passover matzo market, has nearly the exact opposite strategy. Four years ago, Paul Bensabat and Alain Bankier -- Jewish immigrants from Morocco with years of food-industry experience -- saw a raging food trend hiding just beneath the thin, crumbly surface. Sure, core customers may see matzo as a reminder of the meager bread the Israelites had to eat when they fled Pharaoh. But to others, Bensabat and Bankier thought, matzo is a nonfat, additive-free, vegan, low-carb bread substitute! Just as significant, kosher food was suddenly becoming popular among non-Jews for the first time in a few thousand years. A survey by Mintel, the market-research company, confirms that two-thirds of people choose kosher products because they believe (not always correctly) that they are made with high-quality ingredients. More than 50 percent (totally incorrectly) buy it for health reasons. Manischewitz strategically redesigned its boxes, adding green labels toting the healthful qualities, and created dozens of new products, like organic matzo (which tastes exactly like regular matzo), sesame-seed matzo crackers (which are completely addictive, actually) and matzo-meal red-velvet cake mix (crumbly, but surprisingly tasty).
At first I thought that Manischewitz was stuck between two business-killing extremes. On one side are the problems that have plagued Streit's -- a traditional business serving aging customers. But if Manischewitz develops a non-Jewish base, I assumed, it would entice bigger companies -- like Kraft or Sara Lee -- to utilize their existing resources and enter the market themselves.
But Bankier said I was missing Manischewitz's major competitive advantage -- barrier to entry. In other words, it's really hard and expensive to make matzo that follows kosher law. In 2009, Manischewitz opened its brand-new manufacturing line, which produces 30 tons of matzo a day and is around two city blocks long. The main machine was designed by a team of engineers who worked with a rabbi, who added complications raised by various Talmudic interpretations. One rule states that the matzo dough needs to be in an oven within 18 minutes of mixing. Another excludes all the additives that allow bread machines to run quickly. A few times a week, something slows the machinery down enough that one of the five supervising rabbinical law experts insists on a thorough cleaning to eliminate any potentially leavened dough.
Perhaps the most expensive wrinkle of all is that every worker on the line (very few of whom are Jewish) needs to understand kosher law, too. This not only requires training programs but also forces Manischewitz to pay more so it has better educated, happier and more loyal workers. After all, one disgruntled employee with a bag of bacon bits could destroy Manischewitz's 124-year-old brand.
So it's actually the big snack brands that are stuck. To get in the matzo game, they would have to make a huge investment in new machinery, Jewish law expertise and worker training. Alternately, they could make a nonkosher flatbread knockoff and lose out on that significant kosher-loving base. In either case, Manischewitz would have to become a huge business before it attracted any real competition, and by then the company would be so rich that it probably wouldn't mind.
The matzo business offers a lesson for how companies can succeed in an increasingly competitive, global marketplace: do something that's really, really hard. If your business is easy to replicate, then someone, somewhere (probably China) is going to undercut you. But these days many are succeeding by following the matzo principle: fashion houses are scouring the latest microtrends for inimitable looks; industrial manufacturers are making hugely difficult custom products like aircraft engines. If your business is really easy to do, don't gloat. You might be out of a job soon.
Deep thoughts this week: 1. How can any company survive without innovating for 70-plus years? 2. Who knew that kosher food was so chic? 3. Making something annoyingly complicated can really pay off.
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST, BADDEST MATZO PRODUCTION LINE Matzo is a hard business. So when Rabbi Yaakov Horowitz was planning the Manischewitz production line, he traveled the globe. ''I incorporated the best parts of matzo plants worldwide,'' he says, ''while adding some innovations.'' Here's what he came up with, in line with kosher law. 1. The Water Tanks The water must sit in a holding tank overnight before it can be mixed with flour. 2. The Wall Clock Once the water hits the flour, the clock counts down from 18 minutes. If the dough hasn't hit the oven, it's dumped. 3. The Dumping Lever Mashgichim (kosher inspectors) watch the matzos go by to ensure they meet religious specifications. 4. The Rollers Since matzo cannot include softening agents, the hard sheets of dough must pass through four rolling machines. 5. A 150-Foot-Long Oven More than 100 burners bake the dough at a temperature of more than 600 degrees.

HEADLINE: Stores, and More, for Breast-Feeding Moms

BYLINE: By NICOLE LAPORTE

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
TWENTY-FIVE or so years ago, Wendy Haldeman, a nurse and lactation consultant, was standing in a Toys ''R'' Us parking lot when a female acquaintance ran up, yanked up her shirt and cried out, in reference to one of her exposed breasts: ''What is this on my nipple?''
Of such strange encounters, business plans are born. 
Today, Ms. Haldeman and her business partner, Corky Harvey, are the founders and co-owners of the Pump Station and Nurtury, a breast-feeding resource center and baby boutique in Santa Monica, Calif. Their service has managed to survive in an industry that has become dominated by megastores like Target and Babies ''R'' Us and online retailers like Diapers.com.
Besides the ease of online shopping, Diapers.com offers 24-hour delivery at no shipping cost. And Target has started carrying more specialized baby care items like breast pumps and nursing bras -- products that had long been the purview of stores like the Pump Station.
But the Pump Station survives by offering a service that is not in danger of being co-opted by giants anytime soon: assistance and education for nursing mothers. Other businesses around the country with a similar theme include the Upper Breast Side in Manhattan, DayOne in the San Francisco area and Isis Parenting in the Boston area.
Ms. Haldeman leads a monthly breast-feeding class that is consistently sold out; she packs 30 breast-feeding consultations into her five-day workweek. Ms. Harvey, who teaches a baby care class, has a similar schedule.
Over the last decade, as baby products have ballooned into a $9.8 billion industry, stores like the Pump Station have become more than just resource centers for nursing mothers. With an avalanche of baby care items on the market -- how to decide between the Binky Most Like Mother Latex Pacifier and an Ortho-Pro Pacifier? -- many parents are bewildered. And the Internet itself can be cluttered with conflicting information on sleep training and other baby care methods.
When mothers turn to the Pump Station, they are often seeking a path through the chaos, along with products approved by a trusted source.
''When someone is sitting here going, 'Oh my God, there are 20,000 bottles out there,' we can tell them, 'But this bottle is going to be fabulous and will allow Dad to feed the baby and you to go back to work,' '' says Cheryl Petran, the Pump Station's chief executive officer and a former buyer for Target and Montgomery Ward.
Felina Rakowski-Gallagher, owner of the Upper Breast Side, says people shop at her store in large part to hear what she thinks. ''If you're coming here instead of going to a pharmacy or going online,'' she says, ''you're coming because you want an opinion.''
The Pump Station has commodified its owners' tastes into a list of ''Corky and Wendy's Top 25 Recommended Baby Care Products.'' The items, including the Skip Hop diaper bag and the Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder -- can be bought in the store or on the Web site.
''We do the research; we check it out,'' Ms. Haldeman says. ''Is this a good product? Is it safe? Is it ethical? Is it good for moms and babies? And then we'll bring it in.''
Customers are willing to pay more for this Good Housekeeping-like stamp of approval, Ms. Petran says. ''Pricing isn't much of an issue'' at the Pump Station, she says, even though many items can be found for less on sites like Amazon.com.
The store offers a community environment of moms interacting with other moms. (On any day, there may be a stroller jam of women in commiseration as they browse for organic swaddling blankets.) Such an environment has helped the Pump Station expand locally in a shifting economy. A branch opened recently in Westlake Village; there is also a location in Hollywood.
''Hundreds of years ago, you sat by the campfire and talked about breast-feeding. You had that support, that community,'' Ms. Petran says. ''You just don't have that anymore. So moms come here, and it is the proverbial campfire, where you can talk and share. 'Am I doing this right? Am I not doing this right?' That's a part you're not going to get sitting in an aisle at Target.''
AN increase in breast-feeding rates has also helped business. According to the most recent information available from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 75 percent of babies in the United States were breast-fed at birth in 2008, compared with 70 percent in 2000. Nursing is particularly popular with the Pump Station's biggest demographic: white, college-educated women over 30.
Demand was even high in 1986, when Ms. Haldeman and Ms. Harvey began renting breast pumps out of their houses and consulting with new mothers about how to breast-feed. When their husbands became tired of panicked women knocking on their doors at 2 a.m. with nursing questions, they moved to a 200-square-foot office.
''We had 50 breast pumps to rent,'' Ms. Haldeman says. ''We were open part time; we had a part-time secretary. And in three years, we were renting 1,000 pumps'' at a time. As the business grew, ''Moms said, 'Wouldn't it be great if you had nursing bras?' '' Ms. Haldeman recalls. ''So we said, 'O.K.' We started bringing in nursing bras. Then they said, 'Wouldn't it be great if you had some baby clothes?'
''As women made requests, we kept trying to meet their needs. That's what we've always done, to this day.''
And what about the woman in the parking lot from all those years ago?
Ms. Haldeman says she politely suggested that they go sit in the woman's car so she could examine her.
''My daughters were with me,'' Ms. Haldeman says, laughing. ''They were just horrified.''

HEADLINE: Nigeria's Population Is Soaring In Preview of a Global Problem

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
LAGOS, Nigeria -- In a quarter-century, at the rate Nigeria is growing, 300 million people -- a population about as big as that of the present-day United States -- will live in a country roughly the size of Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada. In this commercial hub, where the area's population has by some estimates nearly doubled over 15 years to 21 million, living standards for many are falling.
Lifelong residents like Peju Taofika and her three granddaughters inhabit a room in a typical apartment block known as a ''Face Me, Face You'' because whole families squeeze into 7-by-11-foot rooms along a narrow corridor. Up to 50 people share a kitchen, toilet and sink -- though the pipes in the neighborhood often no longer carry water.
At Alapere Primary School, more than 100 students cram into most classrooms, two to a desk. 
As graduates pour out of high schools and universities, Nigeria's unemployment rate is nearly 50 percent for people in urban areas ages 15 to 24 -- driving crime and discontent.
The growing upper-middle class also feels the squeeze, as commutes from even nearby suburbs can run two to three hours.
Last October, the United Nations announced the global population had breached seven billion and would expand rapidly for decades, taxing natural resources if countries cannot better manage the growth.
Nearly all of the increase is in sub-Saharan Africa, where the population rise far outstrips economic expansion. Of the roughly 20 countries where women average more than five children, almost all are in the region.
Elsewhere in the developing world, in Asia and Latin America, fertility rates have fallen sharply in recent generations and now resemble those in the United States -- just above two children per woman. That transformation was driven in each country by a mix of educational and employment opportunities for women, access to contraception, urbanization and an evolving middle class. Whether similar forces will defuse the population bomb in sub-Sarahan Africa is unclear.
''The pace of growth in Africa is unlike anything else ever in history and a critical problem,'' said Joel E. Cohen, a professor of population at Rockefeller University in New York City. ''What is effective in the context of these countries may not be what worked in Latin America or Kerala or Bangladesh.''
Across sub-Saharan Africa, alarmed governments have begun to act, often reversing longstanding policies that encouraged or accepted large families. Nigeria made contraceptives free last year, and officials are promoting smaller families as a key to economic salvation, holding up the financial gains in nations like Thailand as inspiration.
Nigeria, already the world's sixth most populous nation with 167 million people, is a crucial test case, since its success or failure at bringing down birthrates will have outsize influence on the world's population. If this large nation rich with oil cannot control its growth, what hope is there for the many smaller, poorer countries?
''Population is key,'' said Peter Ogunjuyigbe, a demographer at Obafemi Awolowo University in the small central city of Ile-Ife. ''If you don't take care of population, schools can't cope, hospitals can't cope, there's not enough housing -- there's nothing you can do to have economic development.''
The Nigerian government is rapidly building infrastructure but cannot keep up, and some experts worry that it, and other African nations, will not act forcefully enough to rein in population growth. For two decades, the Nigerian government has recommended that families limit themselves to four children, with little effect.
Although he acknowledged that more countries were trying to control population, Parfait M. Eloundou-Enyegue, a professor of development sociology at Cornell University, said, ''Many countries only get religion when faced with food riots or being told they have the highest fertility rate in the world or start worrying about political unrest.''
In Nigeria, experts say, the swelling ranks of unemployed youths with little hope have fed the growth of the radical Islamist group Boko Haram, which has bombed or burned more than a dozen churches and schools this year.
Internationally, the African population boom means more illegal immigration, already at a high, according to Frontex, the European border agency. There are up to 400,000 undocumented Africans in the United States.
Nigeria, like many sub-Saharan African countries, has experienced a slight decline in average fertility rates, to about 5.5 last year from 6.8 in 1975. But this level of fertility, combined with an extremely young population, still puts such countries on a steep and disastrous growth curve. Half of Nigerian women are under 19, just entering their peak childbearing years.
Women Left Behind
Statistics are stunning. Sub-Saharan Africa, which now accounts for 12 percent of the world's population, will account for more than a third by 2100, by many projections.
Because Africa was for centuries agriculturally based and sparsely populated, it made sense for leaders to promote high fertility rates. Family planning, introduced in the 1970s by groups like Usaid, was initially regarded as foreign, and later on, money and attention were diverted from family planning to Africa's AIDS crisis.
''Women in sub-Saharan Africa were left behind,'' said Jean-Pierre Guengant, director of research at the Research Institute for Development, in Paris. The drastic transition from high to low birthrates that took place in poor countries in Asia, Latin America and North Africa has yet to happen here.
That transition often brings substantial economic benefits, said Eduard Bos, a population specialist at the World Bank. As the last large population group reaches working age, the number of adults in the labor force is high relative to more dependent groups -- the young and the elderly -- for a time. If managed well, that creates capital that can be used to improve health and education and to develop new industries.
And that has happened elsewhere. Per-capita gross domestic product in Latin America, Asia and North Africa increased between three and six times as population was brought under control, Dr. Guengant said. During that same period it has increased only marginally in many African countries, despite robust general economic growth.
In Nigeria, policymakers are studying how to foster the transition, and its attendant financial benefits, here. In the ramshackle towns of the Oriade area near Ile-Ife, where streets are lined with stalls selling prepaid cellphone cards and food like pounded yam, Dr. Ogunjuyigbe's team goes door to door studying attitudes toward family size and how it affects health and wealth. Many young adults, particularly educated women, now want two to four children. But the preferences of men, particularly older men, have been slower to change -- crucial in a patriarchal culture where polygamy is widespread.
At his concrete home in the town of Ipetumodu, Abel Olanyi, 35, a laborer, said he has four children and wants two more. ''The number you have depends on your strength and capacity,'' he said, his wife sitting silently by his side.
Large families signal prosperity and importance in African cultures; some cultures let women attend village meetings only after they have had their 11th child. And a history of high infant mortality, since improved thanks to interventions like vaccination, makes families reluctant to have fewer children.
Muriana Taiwo, 45, explained that it was ''God's will'' for him to have 12 children by his three wives, calling each child a ''blessing'' because so many of his own siblings had died.
In a deeply religious country where many Roman Catholics and Muslims oppose contraception, politicians and doctors broach the topic gingerly, and change is slow. Posters promote ''birth spacing,'' not ''birth control.'' Supplies of contraceptives are often erratic.
Cultural Factors
In Asian countries, women's contraceptive use skyrocketed from less than 20 percent to 60 to 80 percent in decades. In Latin America, requiring girls to finish high school correlated with a sharp drop in birthrates.
But contraceptive use is rising only a fraction of a percent annually -- in many sub-Saharan African nations, it is under 20 percent -- and, in surveys, even well-educated women in the region often want four to six children.
''At this pace it will take 100-plus years to arrive at a point where fertility is controlled,'' Dr. Guengant said.
There are also regional differences. The average number of children per woman in the wealthier south of Nigeria has decreased slightly in the last five years, but increased to 7.3 in the predominantly Muslim north, where women often cannot go to a family planning clinic unless accompanied by a man.
The United Nations estimates that the global population will stabilize at 10 billion in 2100, assuming that declining birthrates will eventually yield a global average of 2.1 children per woman. At a rate of even 2.6, Dr. Guengant said, the number becomes 16 billion.
There are signs that the shifting economics and lifestyles of middle-class Africans may help turn the tide, Dr. Ogunjuyigbe said. As Nigeria urbanizes, children's help is not needed in fields; the extended families have broken down. ''Children were seen as a kind of insurance for the future; now they are a liability for life,'' he said.
Waiting in a women's health clinic, Ayoola Adeeyo, 42, said she wanted her four children, ages 6 to 17, to attend university, and did not want more children.
''People used to want 6 or 7 or even 12, but nobody can do that now. It's the economics,'' said Ms. Adeeyo, elegant in a flowing green dress and matching head wrap. ''It costs a lot to raise a child.''
Dr. Eloundou-Enyegue worries that Africa's modestly declining birthrates reflect relatively rich, educated people reducing to invest in raising ''quality'' children, while poor people continue to have many offspring, strengthening divisions between haves and have-nots. ''When you have a system with a large degree of corruption and inequality, it's hard not to be playing the lottery because it increases the chances that one child will succeed,'' he said.
In Nigeria's desperately poor neighbor, Niger, women have on average more than seven children, and men consider their ideal to be more than 12. But with land divided among so many sons, the size of a typical family plot has fallen by more than a third since 2005, meaning there is little long-term hope for feeding children, said Amadou Sayo, of the aid group CARE.
Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of the United Nations Population Fund and a former Nigerian health minister, said he is optimistic for a turnaround if governments better support education for girls and contraceptive services. ''We can see rapid changes, but that's up in the air, because you have to be aggressive and consistent.''
Birthrates have edged down to about four children per woman in Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana.
One recent morning in Lagos, hundreds of patients waited at the Ketu district clinic for treatments like measles vaccines, malaria pills and birth control.
''Of course when the population grows so quickly, that stresses hospitals,'' said Dr. Morayo Ismail -- although migration from rural areas has also swelled Lagos's population. A mother of one herself, Dr. Ismail said many poor women still want four or more children.
That evening at the clinic, Bola Agboola, 30, gave birth to her second child. After nurses swaddled the boy, dispensed with the placenta and declared Ms. Agboola well, they whooped, praising God.
Then, as Ms. Agboola's husband entered, some started another chant: ''Now start another one. Start another one.''

DRIFT
The Unmooring of American Military Power
By Rachel Maddow
275 pp. Crown Publishers. $25.
Some readers will come to Rachel Maddow's first book expecting an entertaining left-wing screed against the military. They may be surprised to discover instead a lively but serious argument about American history.
Fox News fans will be taken aback to find a blurb from none other than Roger Ailes, that conservative channel's creator, declaring that ''Drift'' offers ''valid arguments'' and is ''a book worth reading.'' Meanwhile, devotees of Maddow's liberal MSNBC show may raise their eyebrows at her declaration that ''my generation of veterans'' is ''a huge part of why I'm bullish on America's capacity to adapt, lead and succeed in the 21st century.'' 
If the book lures readers briefly from their political silos, it will be because Maddow's thesis crosses ideological lines. Like the Tea Partiers, she believes that the United States must return to the lost principles of the nation's founders -- in this case a suspicion of standing armies and a deep reluctance to go to war. ''America's structural disinclination toward war is not a sign that something's gone wrong,'' she declares. ''It's the way the founders set us up.''
Maddow cites Thomas Jefferson, in a presidential message to Congress: ''Were armies to be raised whenever a speck of war is visible in our horizon, we never should have been without them.'' She quotes James Madison saying that ''the Constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the /Legislature.''
But especially in the last half-century, Maddow argues, the decision to go to war has become too easy. Congress's constitutional prerogative to declare war has routinely been ignored. Only a tiny fraction of the American population serves or sends a family member to war, permitting a majority to remain oblivious to its grisly human price.
Contractors supply the battlefield support that once was the work of soldiers. A bloated security industry profits from the near-permanent state of conflict, sharing proceeds with pliable members of Congress. And now robotic drones carry out combat from an antiseptic distance.
The book is a reminder that before Maddow became a face on nighttime television, she was a Rhodes scholar who earned a doctorate in politics at Oxford. But ''Drift'' is not heavy reading, and her cheerfully snarky voice is instantly /recognizable.
Maddow delights to discover one Representative Newt Gingrich condemning President Ronald Reagan for his role in the Iran-contra affair: ''He is not going to regain our trust and our faith easily.'' She recounts with gusto the staggeringly poor planning for the 1983 invasion of Grenada. She collects hair-raising stories of nuclear weaponry gone awry, including the midair collision in 1966 that dropped four hydrogen bombs on Spain, scattering radioactive debris and leading the Pentagon to quietly ship 1,400 tons of contaminated Spanish soil to South Carolina.
Her narrative is so beguiling that a reader may overlook its weaknesses. Congress, after all, did approve the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Drones raise all kinds of questions, but even the highest estimates of civilian casualties in Pakistan are minuscule compared with what would result from a conventional war. It may be true that military spending has been ''supersized'' over the last decade, but it is below the cold war average as a percentage of the economy.
Yet as the United States extracts itself from two wars of uncertain achievement -- and with politicians, not generals, threatening military action against Iran -- ''Drift'' is a thought-provoking and timely book. And many readers, conservative and liberal alike, will embrace one of Maddow's practical prescriptions: that taxes should be raised or war bonds sold to pay for any conflict, since ''going to war, being at war, should be painful for the entire country, from the start.''

REAGAN AND THATCHER
The Difficult Relationship
By Richard Aldous
Illustrated. 342 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95.
In 1950, a 24-year-old industrial research chemist named Margaret Roberts stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate in the British general election. ''We believe in the democratic way of life,'' she told the voters. ''If we serve the idea faithfully, with tenacity of purpose, we have nothing to fear from Russian Communism.''
At the time, Ronald Reagan was a modestly successful movie actor serving as president of the Screen Actors Guild, and a Democrat. After working in television he moved into politics, now a Republican, establishing his national reputation with a speech during the 1964 presidential campaign, much as Barack Obama did with a convention speech 40 years later. He was elected governor of California in 1966, nearly wrested the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, gained it four years later and was elected president.
By the time Reagan reached the White House, Mrs. Thatcher -- as Miss Roberts had been since her marriage to an affluent and genial businessman -- had achieved an even more dramatic and unlikely triumph. She entered Parliament in 1959, worked her way up the ministerial ladder and showed her steel in 1975 when she challenged and deposed Edward Heath, the woefully unsuccessful Tory leader. 
She then won the general election in May 1979, and was installed at Downing Street as prime minister, ready to greet the new president when he was inaugurated in 1981. Reagan was re-elected and spent eight years in the White House; Thatcher won two more elections and was prime minister for more than 11 years. Together they dominated the 1980s. It is a remarkable story, which deserves the fresh account that Richard Aldous, a professor of history at Bard College, gives it in ''Reagan and Thatcher.'' His book casts new light on the heroic version in which two great leaders continued the struggle for freedom waged for generations past by ''the English-speaking peoples.''
One comparison in particular was continually made, from their first meeting. In April 1975, Reagan was touring Europe ahead of his first presidential run. The Labour prime minister and the foreign secretary, Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, declined to see the former governor, but the new Tory leader of the opposition received him, and they took to each other. She had in tow Winston S. Churchill, M.P., Sir Winston's grandson (and Pamela Harriman's son), an unfortunate inheritor of a great name whose career never came to much, but who served as a useful mascot on such occasions. As Aldous notes, ''Churchillian rhetoric would become a consistent and well-/choreographed feature of Reagan and Thatcher's shared public performances,'' and at the time of Reagan's death, the journalist Harold Evans claimed that ''the relationship between Thatcher and President Reagan was closer even than Churchill and Roosevelt.''
In reality, behind the mutual applause and historical echoes, there were many tensions and even conflicts. Thatcher's first years at Downing Street were fraught, and her prospects of re-election looked precarious in the spring of 1982, when disaster, in the form of the Argentine seizure of the Falklands, turned into her greatest triumph -- with no help from Washington, at least to begin with, and in particular none from Jeane Kirkpatrick.
One of the first generation of neoconservatives, Kirkpatrick had been appointed American ambassador to the United Nations by Reagan. She held the dubious view that Latin America was ''the most important place in the world for us,'' and believed that the administration should do business with Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri and his colleagues in Buenos Aires, who were ''authoritarian'' rather than ''totalitarian'' (meaning that the Buenos Aires junta tortured and ''disappeared'' opponents in merely authoritarian fashion).
After his intended final posting as ambassador in Paris, the unusually able and amiable Sir Nicholas Henderson had retired, but Thatcher had shrewdly recalled him and sent him as ambassador to Washington, where he played a crucial role in smoothing Anglo-American relations. Henderson was astonished by how lukewarm the Americans were at first over the Falklands, and surprise turned into outrage when Kirkpatrick dined at the Argentine Embassy on the night of the invasion. As Henderson said, it was as if he had joined the Iranians for tea on the day that 52 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran.
Even when fighting began the Americans shilly-shallied. The low point came when the United States joined Britain in vetoing a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, only for Kirkpatrick immediately to announce that this was a mistake and that she should have abstained. ''Not only had the United States sought to /double-cross Britain; it had done so incompetently,'' Aldous writes. After the Argentines were routed, Reagan spoke to the prime minister, Henderson recalled, about the need for magnanimity, a word he ''kept trying to put in Mrs. Thatcher's vocabulary, quite unsuccessfully.''
A year or more later came the somewhat farcical triumph of American arms in Grenada following a Marxist putsch there. This little Caribbean island was technically under British sovereignty, and the complete failure even to consult Downing Street in advance enraged Thatcher. To a degree her American devotees never appreciated, she genuinely believed in international law. You cannot just ''walk into independent sovereign territories,'' she said at the time. If the United States was going to claim a new right to invade countries whose regimes it disliked, then ''we are going to have really terrible wars in the world,'' words that sound remarkably prescient after Iraq.
Many other problems remained. Aldous's account is valuable and well informed, if on occasion a little flat, but it has some serious omissions. Most notably there is very little about that epicenter of global conflict we call the Middle East. The American intervention in Lebanon, which ended in 1983 with the killing of hundreds of Marines and an undignified withdrawal, seemed to Thatcher ''a naive failure,'' which added to her growing sense of ''amateurishness and disarray'' surrounding American policy in the Middle East.
But there is more to it, and Aldous could have mentioned Thatcher's visit to Washington in 1986 when she gave a tongue-lashing to George Shultz, the secretary of state. Were the Israelis ever going to leave the West Bank, she asked, or did they regard it as part of their historic territory? And she added that peace would never come to the Middle East until justice was done for the Palestinians, which itself would not happen as long as Washington gave uncritical support to every Israeli action. This is something else her neocon claque will not wish to dwell on.
But the most serious of all /Anglo-American rifts erupted over the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars. Behind this far-fetched scheme was an ultimate goal, ''to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons.'' As Reagan explained that to the prime minister, ''Thatcher was horrified.'' The disagreement came to a head with the Reykjavik summit in October 1986. When Thatcher grasped the extent of Reagan's willingness to compromise with Mikhail Gorbachev, she was ''incandescent,'' one of her cabinet ministers said. Or as she herself later wrote, she felt ''as if there had been an earthquake beneath my feet.''
Again, it's easy to forget how much defense policy divided Europe, including the British, from the United States: in this as in many other matters they simply did not (and do not) share the same interests. The truth was that no American president, not even an anti-Communist idol like Reagan, relished the prospect of seeing his country obliterated in order to defend Western Europe. For her part, Thatcher held that not only had deterrence worked by preventing nuclear war; nuclear weapons had, she told Reagan, ''also given us 40 years of unprecedented peace in Europe,'' and for that reason she had no wish at all to see them abolished.
Even then, when Reagan became ensnared in the Iran-contra imbroglio, Thatcher offered him a shoulder to cry on. And in the end, events caught everyone out, in a way that made Star Wars and Reykjavik seem footnotes of history. After Reagan had snubbed Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader visiting Washington, he publicly welcomed Thatcher's third election victory in June 1987. A day after she was re-elected, Reagan stood at the Brandenburg Gate and said, ''Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' It was indeed torn down, by the Berliners, in November 1989 -- almost 40 years after young Miss Roberts's brave and farsighted statement that ''we have nothing to fear from Russian Communism.'' How much the collapse of Soviet Russia was really the achievement of Thatcher and Reagan is impossible to quantify, but the rough and ready rule in politics is that if things go well on your watch, you take the credit, whether or not you really deserve it.
As to the claim that Thatcher and Reagan were ''even closer than Churchill and Roosevelt,'' along with all those endless invocations of World War II, culminating in an exhibition of ''The Art and Treasures of Winston Churchill'' at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley when Thatcher was guest of honor there in 1993, Aldous points out a fine irony. It was in the very decade when Thatcher and Reagan were in power that historians began seriously to deconstruct the wartime relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt -- and to show how complex and tense it had been.
A public display of amity concealed acute disagreements, inspired by widely divergent interests and even something close to mutual dislike. After all, as the historian Walter Russell Mead has written, Roosevelt was the most Anglophobic American president of the 20th century, and one of his great achievements was, in John Maynard Keynes's phrase, to ''pick out the eyes of the British Empire'' economically during the war.
Funnily enough, it was Gorbachev who reminded Thatcher of what her predecessor Lord Palmerston had said: Nations have no eternal friends and no eternal foes, only eternal interests. But then she scarcely needed reminding. This was a principle she understood very well, and she was at heart no sentimentalist, even about those she fulsomely praised. As ''Nico'' Henderson later said (off the cuff and off the record), ''If I reported to you what Mrs. Thatcher really thought about President Reagan, it would damage Anglo-American relations.''

HEADLINE: Where Your Money Goes

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
IN December, when President Obama was considering what the government should do to promote college affordability, he convened a White House round table with 10 college presidents, the head of a prominent education foundation, and Jane Wellman, whose tiny Delta Project on Postsecondary Education Costs, Productivity and Accountability has produced some of the best-regarded data and reports on the issue.
Ms. Wellman, a self-described data geek, started the Delta Project (named for the mathematical symbol for change) in 2006, not long before the recession and shriveling state revenues dragged the problem of spiraling tuition into the national spotlight. Since then, Ms. Wellman has been an oracle of the college-cost conundrum, consulting with chancellors and legislators and policy makers, offering plain talk on what needs to be done to ensure that higher education is widely accessible and affordable. 
Now the project is merging its database into the National Center for Education Statistics; the policy analysis is moving to the American Institutes for Research.
Ms. Wellman is by no means abandoning the field, however. She will continue as an adviser, while serving as executive director of the National Association of System Heads, a group for those who lead public universities and community colleges.
Q. What are the big things that need to be done to stop college costs from going up so fast?
We've got to change how we think about a lot of things that have been on autopilot, starting with things that people think of as fixed costs. Health care costs are growing faster than any other item. Right now, the math on this is that every dime in new tuition revenue that's coming in is going out the door to pay for health care benefits, and frequently that's health care benefits for people students will never see in the classroom. We should be cutting employee benefits, restructuring administrative and support costs, and changing the way we provide academic services. And there's no reason we should have as many payroll, procurement or I.T. offices as we do.
Q. There has been a lot of criticism lately of the high salaries of university presidents, which are going up far faster than pay for professors, and of administrative bloat generally. Are those real problems?
It's a real symbolic problem, a messaging problem. But if you took those presidential salaries that people think are too high, and reallocated them, it wouldn't make that much difference in the overall budget. And do I think those leaders are working hard? Yes. Do they deserve what they're paid? Yes. Particularly in public institutions, the leadership jobs are really tricky. You're a pincushion for everybody, particularly in this political environment.
Q. Another element of academia that has been coming under fire is the tenure system.
People frequently talk as if it's all about tenure, but there's been a snowballing of habits and practices that are academically questionable. What the evidence shows is that we've done more to cut costs in the faculty area than elsewhere in the budget, and we've done it by bringing in more adjuncts and part-timers. So there's a handful of professors with tenure, who don't teach very much, and then there's lot of people who have no benefits who do more of the teaching. I think it's probably hurting academic quality, especially at institutions where the students are not well prepared. The attrition is mostly in the first two years, and that's mostly where the adjuncts are.
Q. Where should we be putting more of our higher-education money?
Community colleges should get more attention and more resources. There's a real change under way, a good one, in paradigms: for a long time we've used community colleges as filters, and expected students to fall out. Now we are setting expectations that students will go further, and the numbers are improving, with more and more students getting to the finish line of some kind of credential. Not everybody needs a degree. If you spend a year getting a certificate, that may be enough to lead to a job.
There's a big problem in that the public institutions that serve the most people have the least money, the poorest students and the greatest needs. And they've historically been dependent on public financing, which isn't going to be there in the future as it used to be.
Q. Why are states backing away from their support of higher education? Do they not see it as important to the economy?
Well, it was either that or cut prisons. I think the case can be made that higher education is a much better use of funds. But the conversation is so siloed that people don't think of comparing that way. The average cost of prison is $35,000 and recidivism is 41 percent. In higher ed, our numbers are much better. Attrition is about a third, across all institutions, and the financial impact is much less than a third, since most students leave the cheaper institutions and the cheaper courses.
If we don't fix our funding model, that will become the reason we fail in educational attainment. Fixing the budget is a matter of choice, a public responsibility that elected officials can do something about.
Meanwhile, this generation is at risk of being less educated than the one before. I don't care if we're behind Finland in educational attainment, but that one bothers me.
This interview has been edited and condensed.

HEADLINE: Paperwork Buries Veterans' Claims

BYLINE: By AARON GLANTZ. 
aglantz@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Even after Ian Rodriguez left the Marine Corps in 2006, he still felt like he was in Iraq.
The burly veteran, who played defensive end on the College of San Mateo football team before joining the military, would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night at home in San Bruno and grab his girlfriend, putting both hands around her neck.
''I had no ill will toward her,'' Mr. Rodriguez, 28, said in an interview, ''but while I was asleep I felt like I was still back there, and I acted it out.'' He said he slept with a .40-caliber Glock pistol under his pillow and drank a bottle of whiskey every night to help him forget the war and fall asleep.
In December 2006, Mr. Rodriguez filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs, arguing that he deserved a monthly disability check and priority mental health care from the agency because of post-traumatic stress disorder. More than five years later, he is still waiting for a final determination on his case. 
Mr. Rodriguez is one of 870,000 veterans nationwide who are waiting for a decision on a disability claim from the V.A. The waiting list has more than doubled since President Obama took office, despite the appropriation of more than $300 million for a new computer system and the hiring of thousands of claims professionals nationwide.
The problem is particularly acute in the Bay Area, where, according to figures provided by the V.A., returning soldiers wait an average of 313 days for a decision. Eighty percent must wait at least 125 days. Of the nearly 60 V.A. offices around the country, the Oakland office is the slowest.
''The place is filled with paper, piles of it, everywhere,'' said Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat from San Mateo who toured the Oakland office last month as part of a meeting with the agency's regional director on behalf of a group of constituents with claims dating as far back as six years.
According to Ms. Speier, the backlog in Oakland has grown so severe that all new claims are immediately sent to V.A. offices in Lincoln, Neb., and Muskogee, Okla., where the backlog is less serious.
''It is an epidemic of delay,'' Ms. Speier said. ''I did not exactly leave invigorated.''
The Bay Citizen was denied a request to tour and photograph the department's Oakland office and interview its director, Douglas Bragg. Mr. Bragg was unavailable for comment, according to Jessica Arifianto, an agency spokeswoman, but she released a statement from the office.
''We are continuously working to improve our timeliness and performance in our service to our veterans,'' it said, citing ''ongoing efforts'' to improve the quality and timeliness of ratings decisions, including hiring additional staff members, using simpler forms and forming quality control teams.
The statement said the office was ''taking steps'' to meet a goal set by Eric Shinseki, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, to process all disability claims in fewer than 125 days with 98 percent accuracy by 2015.
On a tour of a V.A. facility in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Mr. Shineski said that, nationally, he expected waiting times to be cut in half over the next year as the new strategies are implemented.
So far, however, there is little evidence of progress. According to government records, the number of V.A. disability claims, and the resulting backlog, has grown every year since Mr. Obama took office.
While the agency has modestly increased the number of claims processed each year, the number of new claims filed has increased by 48 percent over the last four years as a flood of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans return home and file disability claims seeking compensation for wounds suffered in the line of duty (677,000 as of October 2011).
At the same time, 231,000 Vietnam veterans have filed fresh disability claims related to diseases that the government only recently acknowledged stemmed from the spraying of the toxic defoliant Agent Orange.
''They build a technology infrastructure but haven't pulled the trigger,'' said Tom Tarantino, a former Army captain who works as a deputy policy director for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ''So all the extra money and full-time employees have done is prevent the problem from going way into the red. If they hadn't been doing what they were doing, it would be a total disaster.''
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of veterans wait. ''The V.A. is this monster paperwork machine,'' said Mike Grabski, 32, an Army veteran of the war in Afghanistan who has been waiting since December 2009 for his disability paperwork to go through.
Mr. Grabski, who lives in Napa, is unemployed and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2007, Mr. Grabski's friend, Staff Sgt. Larry Rougle, was killed by Taliban fighters. ''Seeing your best friend full of holes is not fun,'' he said.
Mr. Grabski said that in addition to post-traumatic stress disorder, he sustained a mild traumatic brain injury, shoulder and knee injuries and hearing loss related to bomb blasts during his tours as a paratrooper in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also suffers from asthma, which he said worsened as a result of his service.
''It's been a constant heartache,'' Mr. Grabski said of the disability claims process. ''The money would be nice, but it's not about the money. It's about the care. I've got issues that need attending to.''
For Mr. Rodriguez, the Marine Corps veteran from San Bruno, the money is important. He filed his initial disability claim for post-traumatic stress disorder in December 2006 and received a 30 percent rating from the V.A. 403 days later, in January 2008.
Mr. Rodriguez said the rating, which entitles him to $389 a month in disability payments, is not generous enough to allow him to take off from work to attend counseling and group therapy sessions that the V.A. offers during business hours. He said he wants the department to give him a 70 percent disability rating, which would entitle him to $1,272 in compensation monthly.
In an interview, Mr. Rodriguez said he still experiences frequent flashbacks and intrusive feelings of guilt and grief, prompted by his experiences conducting house-to-house searches during his deployment in Iraq in 2004, as well as by a stint in New Orleans, where he deployed to collect bodies after Hurricane Katrina.
''If they upgraded my claim, I would be able to go to group therapy every day,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, ''and I hope I would get better.''
In handing down its initial 30 percent rating in 2008, the agency did not dispute Mr. Rodriguez's description of his condition, but wrote that ''to assign a greater evaluation, there must be reduced reliability and productivity.''
Michael Blecker, the executive director of Swords to Plowshares, a nonprofit veterans services organization that is helping Mr. Rodriguez with his appeal, said disability is not only about the ability to work. ''It's about somebody's quality of life and making them whole from what they lost in the war,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Competition Is Healthy for Governments, Too

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He is advising , Mitt Romney in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
SHOULD governments -- of nations, states and towns -- compete like business rivals?
The question is simpler to ask than to answer. But it reflects why conservatives and liberals disagree on many big issues facing the nation.
Most everyone agrees that competition is vital to a well-functioning market economy. Since the days of Adam Smith, economists have understood that the invisible hand of the marketplace works only if producers of goods and services vie with one another. Competition keeps prices low and provides an incentive to improve and innovate.
Granted, competition is not always good for producers. I produce economics textbooks. I curse the fact that my competitors are constantly putting out new, improved editions that threaten my market share. But knowing that I have to keep up with the Paul Krugmans and the Glenn Hubbards of the world keeps me on my toes. It makes me work harder, benefiting the customers -- in this case, students. The upshot is that competition among economics textbooks makes learning the dismal science a bit less dismal. 
For much the same reason, competition among governments leads to better governance. In choosing where to live, people can compare public services and taxes. They are attracted to towns that use tax dollars wisely. Competition keeps town managers alert. It prevents governments from exerting substantial monopoly power over residents. If people feel that their taxes exceed the value of their public services, they can go elsewhere. They can, as economists put it, vote with their feet.
The argument applies not only to people but also to capital. Because capital is more mobile than labor, competition among governments significantly constrains how capital is taxed. Corporations benefit from various government services, including infrastructure, the protection of property rights and the enforcement of contracts. But if taxes vastly exceed these benefits, businesses can -- and often do -- move to places offering a better mix of taxes and services.
This lesson is on the minds of policy makers today. Over the last few decades, corporate tax rates have fallen around the world. As of April 1, when Japan cut its tax rate, the United States was left with the world's highest statutory corporate tax rate. This is one reason corporate tax reform is now high on the policy agenda. President Obama has proposed cutting the rate to 28 percent from its current 35 percent, while Mitt Romney -- for whom I am an adviser -- has proposed cutting it to 25 percent. While their proposals differ in some key details, it is noteworthy that they agree on the direction this rate should head.
Conservatives applaud such competition among governments. They are skeptical of government power, and they see competition as a check on its potential abuse. Because people and capital will flee from places where their tax dollars do not deliver commensurate value, government officials have little latitude to pursue personal agendas that are substantially adverse to any group of citizens.
This logic leads naturally to the principle of federalism. Because exiting a state or locality is easier than leaving the nation, some policy options should be available to state and local governments but not to the federal government. The founding fathers were no fools.
HEALTH care reform is a case in point. Anyone who finds the Massachusetts health insurance mandate objectionable can easily move to live-free-or-die New Hampshire. A national mandate leaves people with fewer options. This is one way the health reform advanced by Mr. Romney as governor differs from that pursued by President Obama, and why the Massachusetts law raises fewer constitutional objections than does the national one.
While conservatives embrace governmental competition, liberals have good reason to worry about it. The left has a more expansive view of the role of public policy. Liberals want the government not only to provide public services but also to redistribute economic resources. In the words of President Obama, they want to ''spread the wealth around.''
Yet redistribution is harder when people and capital are free to move to other jurisdictions that offer better deals. If you are going to take from Peter to pay Paul, Peter may well decide to leave. It is perhaps no surprise that state and local tax systems are less progressive than the federal one.
Whether competition among governments is good or bad comes down to the philosophical questions of what you want government to do and how much you fear government power. If the government's job is merely to provide services, like roads, schools and courts, competition among governmental producers may be as good a discipline as competition among private producers. But if government's job is also to remedy many of life's inequities, you may want a stronger centralized government, unchecked by competition.
These are two fundamentally different visions. The next election, and to some degree every election, is about which one voters find more compelling.

HEADLINE: Romney vs. Romney

BYLINE: By GEOFFREY KABASERVICE. 
Geoffrey Kabaservice's latest book is ''Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party.''

 BODY:
THE REAL ROMNEY
By Michael Kranish and Scott Helman
Illustrated. 401 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99.
It's unlikely that Mitt Romney saw the film ''The Graduate'' when it appeared in 1967. He was a 20-year-old Mormon missionary in France at the time, isolated from the cultural influences that shaped most Americans of the baby-boom generation, and his taste in movies ran to more wholesome fare like ''The Sound of Music.'' If he had seen it, though, one doubts that he would have scoffed along with his contemporaries during the scene in which a smarmy businessman declares that the key to the future is ''plastics.'' He might have considered it useful career advice. 
Critics have noted Romney's plastic qualities ever since he entered politics: the elasticity of his views, the android awkwardness of his interactions with voters, his slick evasions and platitudes, his sculptured features and molded hair, and his apparent lack of appetites and passions. But plastic is also durable and indispensable, and although a majority of Republican voters in the primaries so far have preferred Anyone but Romney, he appears poised to win the party's presidential nomination. Despite the growing possibility that Romney may soon occupy the nation's highest office, he remains an enigma to most Americans, and his campaign seems predicated on the hope that voters will see in his smooth surfaces whatever they want to see.
The great service of this new biography by the Boston Globe journalists Michael Kranish and Scott Helman is that it humanizes Romney. The authors sniff over their subject with bloodhound thoroughness, dredging up old report cards, housing deeds, and family records and videos. They interview seemingly everyone who had contact with Romney in every phase of his life. They conclude that he is in many ways an admirable man, deeply devoted to his religion and family and possessing stellar qualities that made him a success in business and public service, including his leadership of the 2002 Winter Olympics and his governorship of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.
But ''The Real Romney'' leaves an unsettling impression. Romney's peculiar misfortune is that the things that defined him have become liabilities in his presidential pursuit, leading him to minimize or repudiate his own beliefs, legacy and accomplishments. Even as he shifts into the front-runner's role, he is running on who he is not -- namely, Barack Obama -- rather than on who he is, and cannot stand openly for the things that matter most to him. If Obama is our first post-racial president, Romney, with his strategy of absences and denials, bids to become our first postmodern president.
Romney's political problems begin, in a basic sense, with his family history. The authors trace the intertwined histories of Romney's ancestors and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, beginning with his great-great-grandfather Miles Archibald Romney, who became an early convert to Mormonism in 1837. Mitt's great-grandfather had undertaken the pioneer journey to the Utah Territory as a boy, and when he refused to abandon what Mormons considered the divinely ordained practice of ''plural marriage'' -- he had three wives at that point -- he fled federal agents to establish a colony in Mexico; the family remained there after the Mormon Church agreed to ban po/lygamy in 1890 as a condition of Utah's gaining statehood. Mitt's grandfather was not polygamous and returned destitute to the United States after Mexican rebels confiscated the colony's property. Mitt's father, George Romney, was elected governor of Michigan in 1962, ran unsuccessfully for president in 1968, and became a member of Richard Nixon's cabinet as secretary of housing and urban /development.
It's an exotic but unquestionably American success story, even though the first generations of Mormon Romneys spent their lives in bitter conflict with the United States. Mitt Romney takes evident ''pride in his standing'' as a member of ''one of Mormonism's first families,'' according to Kranish and Helman. He has given the church millions of dollars and has occupied high positions in its hierarchy. He abides by his faith's prohibitions on alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and profanity. The authors portray him as an adoring husband, a devoted father and a doer of many unpublicized good deeds.
Mormonism's emphasis on family, patriotism, community and hard work explains much of Romney's worldview. The church's generous support of Mormons in need, financed by the 10 percent tithe on members like Romney, may give him the idea that the poor are well taken care of in America. And his criticism of ''the bitter politics of envy'' echoes his father's complaint that his family was forced from his childhood home ''because the Mexicans were envious of the fact that my people . . . became prosperous.'' Romney's plastic image to some extent stems from his difficulty in relating to people outside Mormon circles, though within those circles he is seen as warm, funny and charming.
His upstanding life fails to win Romney the political credit that would normally extend to such a paragon, because many people do not understand or approve of the religion that inspires him. Over the last several years, about a quarter of Americans have told poll takers they would not vote for a Mormon. Liberals are skeptical of a religion that until 1978 refused to grant full membership to anybody with even one drop of African blood and still bars women from the priesthood. Mormon leaders have supported extreme right-wing organizations like the John Birch Society, denounced the theory of evolution, condemned much of American popular culture, and led the fights against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and the gay marriage movement over the past decade. Christian conservatives might be expected to support Mormonism's political agenda, but many believe that the religion is not Christian but a heretical and even satanic cult. Because of this opposition from both left and right, Romney is forced to play down his distinctive heritage, resorting instead to generalized expressions of faith and patriotism.
A similar bipartisan mistrust extends to Romney's accomplishments in business and politics. Kranish and Helman illuminate Romney's work for Bain & Company and its private equity offshoot, Bain Capital. Prudence, aptitude for data-driven analysis and providence enabled Romney and his team to report what the authors call ''the highest returns in the business in the 1990s'' and gave Romney a fortune that they estimate as ''at least $250 million, and maybe much more.'' But many Americans have reservations about leveraged-buyout firms like Bain that acquired struggling companies using borrowed money, saddled them with enormous debt, and often walked away with incredible profits no matter whether the companies prospered or went bust. Even many Tea Party conservatives resent the ''creative destruction'' that the financial industry brought to bear on companies and communities, and see the loopholes that allowed investors like Romney to pay taxes at lower rates than many working-class Americans as further evidence that the economic system is rigged in favor of the 1 percent.
In 1994, when he was trying to displace the liberal icon Ted Kennedy from the Senate, Romney cast himself as what Kranish and Helman characterize as ''a passionate supporter of abortion rights,'' as well as a ''socially innovative'' advocate of gay rights (although not gay marriage), progressive taxation and gun control. He retained these positions as the Republican governor of a Democratic state. His signature political accomplishment was the bipartisan passage of breakthrough health care reform, which the authors deem an overall success, particularly in achieving near-universal insurance coverage for Massachusetts residents.
Romney's quest to become the presidential nominee of the conservative-/dominated Republican Party, though, has required him to jettison his past positions as well as distance himself from his health care program, which was the model for President Obama's. The authors manfully resist the urge to call Romney a hypocrite for these reversals. They suggest that he has been ''applying a business model to politics,'' and that in business, ''changing positions in an evolving market can be the secret of survival.'' Unfortunately, he has not so far succeeded in showing that ''his shifts were not expedient but reasoned and heartfelt.'' As a result, Romney hasn't convinced conservatives he has seen the light, while moderates and liberals hope he doesn't really believe in the increasingly extreme positions he has espoused.
The argument that Romney is not a moderate at heart emerges most clearly in the book's comparisons between him and his father, who was a leader of the moderate wing of the Republican Party in the 1960s and '70s. This is ironic, since Mitt has said he ''grew up idolizing'' his father, and the authors imply that his motivation for wanting to be president is ''avenging his father's loss'' in 1968. But Romney appears to have little in common politically with his father, and his candidacy in no way aims to uphold the moderate legacy his father embodied.
George Romney was born into exile and raised in poverty, and he worked his way to prosperity in the automobile industry. As chairman of the American Motors Corporation, he was wealthy but nowhere near as rich as his son became and, unlike his son, was known for refusing bonuses that would have made his income too many multiples of the average worker's salary. Civil rights for African-Americans was George Romney's lifelong, passionate cause, undertaken in defiance of his church as well as the conservative wing of his party; Mitt has shown scant inclination to follow his father's example. Where George saw the dissent and protest of the 1960s as legitimate responses to real social and political problems, Mitt saw only inexplicable disorder and lack of proper deference toward authority.
George Romney governed at a time when Republican moderation meant something. He stood not only for pro-business fiscal conservatism but for civil rights and civil liberties, Republican outreach to minorities and labor, an internationalist but noninterventionist foreign policy, wise public investments in infrastructure and education, and government programs to promote equal opportunities for all Americans. If his son has the courage to champion such positions in the face of conservative opposition within his party, he has given little indication of it in his campaign so far.
On the evidence in this biography, Mitt Romney is not so much a plastic politician as a personally upstanding and generally conservative man who will do whatever it takes to be elected president. His idiosyncratic background and deliberate efforts to obscure his beliefs and accomplishments mean that his election would not represent a victory for the conservative movement, but most likely would significantly advantage the right nonetheless. The blurred outlines of ''the real Romney'' may come into focus only if and when he occupies the White House.

HEADLINE: The Soft Middle of Francois Hollande

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
Even after a precampaign diet last year -- less wine, less cheese and especially less chocolate -- Francois Hollande, the Socialist who is currently favored to become the next president of France, still has a soft face and looks slightly sloppy in his medium-gray suits. He used to be referred to as ''Flanby,'' after a brand of wobbly caramel pudding, just one of a string of insulting nicknames for a convivial man considered always at the second rank of politics. He has been called ''a living marshmallow'' and ''Mr. Little Jokes,'' and just last year, Martine Aubry, the head of the Socialist Party, described him as a couille molle, a nasty way of saying he has no guts. Recently, a frustrated Nicolas Sarkozy, fighting hard to be re-elected, fumed: ''Hollande is useless! He's useless, do you understand?'' 
A name that stuck for a long time is ''Mr. Royal,'' given to him after his former partner and mother of his four children, Segolene Royal, became a minister and then defeated him to become the Socialist candidate in 2007. This time, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was considered the obvious choice atop the Socialist ticket, until he was accused (the charges were dropped) of raping a maid in New York City. Only after Strauss-Kahn's downfall did Hollande -- who at 57 has never held a ministerial portfolio and who, from 1997 to 2008, presided over a badly bruised Socialist Party -- look like a truly viable candidate.
And he's still an extremely unlikely one, especially during this time of economic crisis, of anxiety about Islam and immigration and of confusion about France's reduced role in the world. One reason for his success, surely, is that the French have grown tired of Sarkozy -- his crass friends and his adolescent behavior. But it's also that Hollande provides a quainter and, for many, more comfortable vision of what a French politician should be.
Campaigning at Paris's Agricultural Salon, where the urbane Sarkozy always looks out of place and once famously lost his temper, telling a heckler, ''Get lost, you poor idiot,'' except in more profane terms, Hollande looked content among the farmers, chickens, goats and cows. ''He's the first one who has listened to me,'' said Simon Ouin, who teaches farming. ''The others, they run away. Everyone told me that he would listen to us, and it's incredible.''
Hollande says he is a ''normal man,'' a description mocked by Sarkozy, an immigrant's son who is hardly normal by French standards. Sarkozy speaks bluntly, he pushed for tax cuts for the rich and for corporations and he is viewed as slightly ''American'' in his politics and his manner. By contrast, Hollande wears his previous indignations proudly, as a mark of earned strength. ''To be elected, it's necessary to have been beaten; to be loved, it's necessary to have suffered,'' he once said. ''The scars, the blows, the fact that nothing has been given to you -- people appreciate it.''
With his distaste for the rich and his lack of ostentation, Hollande also represents a return to traditional French politics. He prepared himself for power in the most typically French way possible, graduating from the country's finest schools, or les grandes ecoles. The French elite is formed in these institutions more narrowly than America's ruling class is formed in the Ivy League, and its members remain close, whether they favor the left or the right. Hollande's class at L'Ecole Nationale d'Administration included Jean-Maurice Ripert, a senior diplomat; Dominique de Villepin, a former foreign minister; the chairman of a major insurance company; the head of the French stock market; numerous former ministers; and Segolene Royal. It did not include Sarkozy, who failed to work his way through les grandes ecoles and is said to resent their graduates even now.
Hollande broke from his father's far-right politics, but he never presented himself as much of a rebel. His big youthful adventure consisted of traveling through Europe with his friends in an old Peugeot J7, a French version of the VW bus, while listening to the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. And in 1974, he got a travel grant from business school to go to the United States for the summer, studying the supreme American invention of fast food -- particularly McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which hadn't yet established themselves in France. He drove from New York to San Francisco in what he remembered as ''a very difficult period for the United States.'' ''Nixon was being pursued,'' he said, ''the dollar was very low, there was a doubt about America, the exit from Vietnam, but I saw the potential.''
He wrote a report saying that fast food would come to France. ''I could have made a fortune in cheeseburgers, but I finally chose politics,'' he said when I spoke with him in Marseille. And here his girlfriend, the journalist Valerie Trierweiler, interjected, with a small sigh, ''And since then he has kept a certain taste for hamburgers.''
Pascal Perrineau, a renowned political scientist, notes that the left now represents no more than 42 percent of the vote in France. So Hollande needs votes from the center and even the far right to win. And he has been falling in the polls. He led by double digits at the start of the campaign, but Sarkozy has been steadily inching upward and now has a chance to win the first round, which has 10 candidates. For the second and decisive round on May 6, when Hollande and Sarkozy are expected to go head to head, Hollande still leads by around 7 percent, but that margin, too, is expected to tighten.
Sarkozy's strategy is much like George W. Bush's in 2004. He's trying to avoid making this a referendum on his last term and wants to make it a choice between a decisive leader capable of steering a country through great upheaval and someone who is compared to caramel pudding. Sarkozy has tried to push the debate away from economic issues, which generally favor the austerity-averse Hollande, and toward crime, terrorism and Islam, hot-button topics that unite the right and create anxiety among the middle class (particularly after the March 19 killings in Toulouse, which Sarkozy compared to 9/11).
During our interview, as Trierweiler fed him throat lozenges for a voice strained by campaigning, Hollande criticized Sarkozy's approach. ''Fear helps him,'' he said. ''Because people who are afraid don't like change. But does he reassure them? That's the question.''
A close friend and adviser of Sarkozy's told me he still believes that his candidate will lose. But he notes that Hollande, like Mitt Romney, inspires little passion. Perrineau concurs -- two-thirds of voters who say they will vote for Hollande in the runoff say it is a vote against Sarkozy. Hollande, who has run a very timid campaign, may be liked, but the French still wonder if he's tough enough, if he's ''presidentiable.''
This doesn't bother Hollande. He described how no one thought Francois Mitterrand, France's first and only Socialist president, had a chance of winning. ''Often people told me, 'Oh, la, la, Francois Mitterrand, what charisma, what a president!' But before he became president, they used to call him badly dressed, old, archaic, he knows nothing about the economy.'' But the day he was elected, Hollande said, Mitterrand was transformed.
''In a moment, you are invested, you incarnate France -- that changes everything.''

HEADLINE: Nearsighted Voters

BYLINE: By LARRY M. BARTELS. 
Larry M. Bartels is a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University.

 BODY:
Economic conditions alter the outcomes of presidential elections, but economic conditions during certain time periods matter much more than others. Economic voters are shortsighted, it turns out, and their myopia makes American electoral accountability surprisingly haphazard. 
Sixty years of political history suggest that income growth in the months leading up to Election Day has a strong, consistent impact on the incumbent party's re-election prospects -- what happens in the rest of a president's term is mostly irrelevant. If the last 15 presidential elections are a reliable guide, income growth between now and Nov. 6 will matter more to voters than how the economy has fared through President Obama's first 39 months in the White House.
In 2004, Louis Uchitelle, an economics reporter for The Times, likened this pattern to a children's game of musical chairs: ''If the economy is flourishing in the final weeks of a campaign, when the music stops, the incumbent is likely to be re-elected.'' Unfortunately, Mr. Uchitelle's metaphor seems apt. Income growth rates fluctuate substantially, and more or less randomly, from month to month. In other words, whether the economy happens to flourish or lag in the months just before an election is hardly more meaningful than whether Jacob or Jenny happens to be closer to the last empty chair. It is a bizarre way to pick the leader of the free world.
But here's the weirdest part. An additional percentage point of real income growth in the second quarter of a presidential election year increases the incumbent party's expected popular vote margin by more than 5 percentage points. In President Obama's case, this three-month period began April 1. Income growth in the rest of the election year also seems to matter, though the effect is somewhat smaller, about 3 or 4 percentage points for every additional percentage point of growth.
Income growth earlier in the president's term seems to have little or no impact on the election outcome. In fact, income growth in the first year of a president's term probably reduces his expected vote margin, perhaps because voters make some allowance at election time for the good or bad economic conditions a president has inherited. If this ''inheritance'' effect manifests itself in 2012, it may provide a significant boost to Mr. Obama's re-election chances, since real income growth in 2009 was the worst by far in the past 60 years.
It is hardly surprising that voters' moods and their assessments of the incumbent president are strongly colored by current economic conditions. From the standpoint of good government, however, their myopic focus on current conditions seems quite counterproductive. On one hand, myopic economic voting provides little electoral incentive for presidents to generate income growth through most of their terms, and a perverse incentive to artificially boost election-year growth with tax cuts and other gimmicks. On the other hand, myopic economic voting seems unlikely to contribute to post-election prosperity, since income growth between now and Election Day will shed little real light on whether the economy would fare better over the next four years under Mr. Obama or Mitt Romney.

HEADLINE: Coming: 'Taxmageddon'

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
The Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
ON Jan. 1 of next year, the federal tax bill for a typical middle-class household -- making in the neighborhood of $50,000 -- is scheduled to rise by about $1,750. This increase, which would come from the expiration of both the Bush tax cuts and the Obama stimulus, would follow a decade of little to no income growth for many people. As a result, inflation-adjusted, after-tax income for the median household could fall next year to its 1998 level, in spite of the continuing economic recovery.
The middle-class tax increase is just the beginning of budget changes set to take effect at the start of 2013. Poor families would see their taxes rise somewhat, too. Total federal taxes for top-earning families would rise by tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Spending cuts would also take effect, squeezing domestic programs -- education, transportation, scientific research -- and the military.
All in all, the end of 2012 will be unlike any other time in memory for the federal government. 
The tax increases and spending cuts are the result of Washington's having previously kicked the can down the road, to use a phrase that is popular here. Rather than pass a plan to cut the deficit, policy makers have put off tough decisions. With the Bush tax cuts, lawmakers deliberately made them temporary, to avoid running afoul of budget rules intended to hold down the deficit.
Not surprisingly, leaders of both parties now say they are opposed to letting the changes happen on Jan. 1. Economists are also frightened of what such a sharp shift in government policy might do to a still fragile economy. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, has referred to the various expirations as ''a massive fiscal cliff.'' Congressional aides, quoted in The Washington Post, call it ''taxmageddon.''
The problem, as always, is that the two parties cannot agree on what changes should take place. The combination -- of political stalemate and potential economic cataclysm -- will create an extraordinary period after this year's election. A lame-duck Congress and Mr. Obama, either re-elected or defeated, will have less than two months to agree on an alternative plan, or the tax increases and spending cuts will take effect.
Optimists -- yes, there are still some -- say that the prospect of the tax hikes and cuts could finally nudge the two parties to the kind of deficit solution that many experts prefer. It involves sweeping tax reform that would close loopholes, reduce marginal rates, simplify the tax code and perhaps even lift long-term economic growth. Such tax reform has always been easy to put off, but the compromises it requires may end up being easier to accept than taxmageddon.
YET there is still a basic contradiction with which most politicians and voters have yet to grapple, the same contradiction that has helped create this strange situation in the first place. Talking in exasperated tones about the importance of fiscal responsibility is easy. Cutting the deficit is hard, because it involves unpopular tax increases or unpopular spending cuts -- and huge cuts if the solution involves only spending, not taxes, as many Republicans urge.
Either way, the changes will affect the vast majority of Americans, given that the deficit reflects a basic disconnect between the government we have and the taxes we are willing to pay. Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare may become less generous. The Pentagon may no longer be able to get just about whatever it wants. Taxes may have to rise from their recent levels, which have been lower, as a share of the economy, than at any point in 60 years. That could mean higher rates. Or, if tax reform actually happens, it could mean smaller tax breaks for health care, housing and retirement savings.
The looming end of billions of dollars in popular government benefits may seem ridiculous. And the fact that Washington keeps delaying a serious deficit plan until another day may seem equally ridiculous. But they make perfect sense in a country where hypothetical solutions are a lot more popular than any actual ones.
Nothing highlights the paradox quite like tax reform.
Most people seem to want tax reform. In a 2011 Pew Research Center poll, 59 percent of respondents said the tax code was so flawed that Congress should ''completely change it.'' President Obama and Representative Paul Ryan, the architect of the Republican budget plan, each claim to be more in favor of tax reform than the other one.
The notion of tax reform also has widespread support from economists, liberal and conservative. As they define it, reform would reduce marginal tax rates while eliminating or reducing various tax breaks. The tax code would then be flatter and simpler. Individuals and companies would not have to spend so much time and effort filling out their tax returns and figuring out which provisions helped them -- an especially appealing notion this time of year.
Nobody knows for sure, but many economists believe that tax reform could lift economic growth, by freeing people to spend and work in the ways they think make the most sense, rather than in ways that happen to reduce their tax bill. Mr. Ryan's plan would cut the top rate to 25 percent, from 35 percent, and still leave overall tax collection roughly where it has been, by eliminating tax breaks.
What's missing from these plans is any detail on which tax breaks would be eliminated. Corporate lobbyists, like those at the Business Roundtable, offer an especially telling contrast: they urge the government to reform the tax code while continuing to push for loopholes that benefit them and generally refusing to name loopholes they would close.
The tax breaks that cost the government the most money turn out to be overwhelmingly popular. The three largest are those for health insurance provided by employers, mortgage interest and 401(k)'s. Corporate tax breaks are smaller, but the biggest corporate breaks are often popular, too, like the one for research and development.
''Tax reform is vital but difficult,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the former economic adviser to Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton. ''When people think of tax expenditures, they think of standing up to the oil industry. But a ton of it is things like I.R.A.'s.''
He added: ''The moment you start to look at the expenditures you'd eliminate, you're struck by how much pain there is for modest rate reductions.''
Optimists who believe tax reform could happen look to 1986, when President Ronald Reagan and a bipartisan Congress lowered rates and eliminated loopholes. However, there are at least two major differences between then and now. Most of the loophole closing in 1986 affected companies, not individuals. And policy makers spent months and months working together to put the law together.
None of that will be possible in the eight weeks between Election Day 2012 and Jan. 1, 2013. ''Tax reform is a process, not an event,'' said Donald Marron, a former aide to President George W. Bush who now runs the Tax Policy Center in Washington. Mr. Marron called full-scale tax reform ''really unlikely.''
What, then, will happen later this year?
Much will depend on who wins the presidential election. (Neither party is likely to have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.) If Mr. Obama wins re-election, he and his aides say, he will not extend all the Bush tax cuts, as they agreed to do in 2010.
They instead plan to insist on a deficit plan that combines spending cuts with higher taxes for the affluent, who have received the largest tax cuts in recent decades. Mr. Obama, according to a senior adviser speaking last week, views taxmageddon as a chance to force the Republicans to acknowledge that even they do not support the spending cuts necessary to balance the budget without tax increases on the wealthy.
For the White House, the best case might pair an extension of the Bush tax cuts for several more months with a legislative framework for a new tax code that reduces tax breaks for the affluent. The top rate might not rise, but taxes on the rich would. Policy makers would work out the details in early 2013.
The so-called Buffett Rule, a focus of Mr. Obama's last week, is a model for such a tax system. It does not specify which tax breaks would shrink for households with more than $1 million in income but rather caps the total value of such tax breaks. Martin Feldstein, a Republican economist, has proposed a similar cap for all taxpayers. The approach is meant to avoid a political war of attrition over every large, popular tax break.
Of course, Republicans have shown scant sign of wanting to compromise on high-end taxes, even after election losses, as in 2008. If they hold firm once again, Mr. Obama will have to choose between standing down (once again) and allowing taxes to rise on every household when the economy is still likely to be weakened.
Complete gridlock will include not only the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the payroll-tax cut from the Obama stimulus but also a sharp increase in the Alternative Minimum Tax and cuts to national-security and domestic programs, prompted by Congress's failure of last summer to reach a deficit deal. Together, the changes would reduce the deficit by more than 60 percent in the 2014 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but would inflict obvious pain.
With Mitt Romney in the White House and a Republican House, the uncertainty might be less. Unless Congressional Republicans and a defeated Mr. Obama somehow came to a deal, they could wait for him to leave town before retroactively extending the Bush tax cuts, so long as they could win over a small number of Democratic senators. Republicans could likewise undo the Pentagon cuts.
To hold down the deficit, Mr. Romney and Congress could then cut domestic programs, including Medicaid, more sharply than Mr. Obama has. But recent history -- both Mr. Reagan's administration and the second Mr. Bush's -- suggests that Republicans would probably not find enough spending cuts to offset their tax cuts and instead would accept larger deficits.
In the short term, it might not matter. The deficit is falling already, as the economy slowly emerges from the financial crisis, and foreigners remain happy to lend money to Washington at very low interest rates. Many economists think the state of the economy, not the deficit, is the bigger immediate problem.
Eventually, though, the deficit will start growing again, and sharply. The baby boomers are retiring, and health care is getting only more expensive. The era of falling taxes and growing benefits cannot last forever. The fiscal chaos that awaits at the end of this year is a preview of the choices to come.

HEADLINE: White House Welcomes Donors, And Lobbyists Slip in Door, Too

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE and MICHAEL LUO; Kevin Quealy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Last May, as a battle was heating up between Internet companies and Hollywood over how to stop online piracy, a top entertainment industry lobbyist landed a meeting at the White House with one of President Obama's technology advisers.
The lobbyist did not get there by himself.
He was accompanied by Antoinette C. Bush, a well-connected Washington lawyer who has represented companies like Viacom, Sony and News Corporation for 30 years. A friend of the president and a cousin of his close aide Valerie B. Jarrett, Ms. Bush has been to the White House at least nine times during his term, taking lobbyists along on a few occasions, joining an invitation-only forum about intellectual property, and making social visits with influential friends.
At the same time, she and her husband, Dwight, have donated heavily to the president's re-election effort: Mr. Bush gave $35,800 on the day of his wife's White House meeting last year, and Ms. Bush contributed the same amount a month later. In November, they hosted a $17,900-a-plate fund-raiser at their home, where Mr. Obama complained that the nation's capital should be more ''responsive to the needs of people, not the needs of special interests.'' 
''That is probably the biggest piece of business that remains unfinished,'' the president said, as about 45 guests dined under a backyard tent.
Although Mr. Obama has made a point of not accepting contributions from registered lobbyists, a review of campaign donations and White House visitor logs shows that special interests have had little trouble making themselves heard. Many of the president's biggest donors, while not lobbyists, took lobbyists with them to the White House, while others performed essentially the same function on their visits.
More broadly, the review showed that those who donated the most to Mr. Obama and the Democratic Party since he started running for president were far more likely to visit the White House than others. Among donors who gave $30,000 or less, about 20 percent visited the White House, according to a New York Times analysis that matched names in the visitor logs with donor records. But among those who donated $100,000 or more, the figure rises to about 75 percent. Approximately two-thirds of the president's top fund-raisers in the 2008 campaign visited the White House at least once, some of them numerous times.
The reasons someone might have gained access to the White House and made a donation are wide-ranging, and it is clear that in some cases the administration came down against the policies being sought by the visitors. But the regular appearance of big donors inside the White House underscores how political contributions continue to lubricate many of the interactions between officials and their guests, if for no other reason than that donors view the money as useful for getting a foot in the door.
Timing of Donations
Some of the donors had no previous record of giving to the president or his party, or of making donations of such magnitude, so their gifts, sometimes given in close proximity to meetings, raise questions about whether they came with expectations of access or were expressions of gratitude.
Dr. William C. Mohlenbrock, chairman of a health care data analysis firm, Verras Ltd., gave occasionally to political candidates over the years, mostly small amounts to Republicans. But last May he contributed the maximum allowable gift, $35,800, to the Obama Victory Fund, which benefits the president's campaign and the Democratic Party. Later in the year, with help from a Democratic consultant, he landed a meeting with a top White House aide involved in the health care overhaul, but failed to persuade Medicare officials to require more health data collection as part of the new regulations.
Joe E. Kiani, who heads a medical device company, Masimo Corporation, stepped up his giving to Democrats last year as medical device makers campaigned unsuccessfully for the repeal of an excise tax imposed on the industry. Mr. Kiani had several meetings with White House officials last year, including two with lobbyists from his company and another with representatives from his industry's trade association. In the midst of these gatherings, he donated $35,800 to the victory fund.
Administration officials insisted that donations do not factor into White House visits, and they cited steps taken to curb the influence of money in politics, including a ban on executive branch employees' accepting gifts from lobbyists and on appointees' lobbying the White House after they leave. Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, pointed out that Mr. Obama was the first president to release the visitor logs regularly, and added that ''being a supporter of the president does not secure you a visit to the White House, nor does it preclude you from one.''
''The people selected for this article are contributors to the president,'' Mr. Schultz said, ''but this article excludes the thousands of people who visit the White House every week for meetings and events who did not contribute to the president, many of whom may not have even supported the president.''
'How This Business Works'
Most donors, including Dr. Mohlenbrock and Mr. Kiani, declined to talk about their motivations for giving. But Patrick J. Kennedy, the former representative from Rhode Island, who donated $35,800 to an Obama re-election fund last fall while seeking administration support for a nonprofit venture, said contributions were simply a part of ''how this business works.''
''If you want to call it 'quid pro quo,' fine,'' he said. ''At the end of the day, I want to make sure I do my part.''
Mr. Kennedy visited the White House several times to win support for One Mind for Research, his initiative to help develop new treatments for brain disorders. While his family name and connections are clearly influential, he said, he knows White House officials are busy. And as a former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he said he was keenly aware of the political realities they face.
''I know that they look at the reports,'' he said, referring to records of campaign donations. ''They're my friends anyway, but it won't hurt when I ask them for a favor if they don't see me as a slouch.''
Others, like Ms. Bush, rejected the notion that their donations were tied to access. Her husband said it was a coincidence that his contribution last May -- made at a Democratic fund-raiser -- came on the same day his wife was at the White House. And Ms. Bush noted that most of her meetings occurred before she made her donation in June. She added that as a longtime lawyer with the firm Skadden Arps, it should not be surprising that her work would occasionally take her to the White House.
''Communications law is what I do for a living,'' Ms. Bush said. ''Yes, I'm an Obama supporter, but in the end I'm a communications law expert. I had the same clients in the Bush administration as well as the Obama administration.''
Although those in office invariably deny it, the notion that access is available at a price is a well-founded reality of Washington. Memorably, President Nixon was caught on tape remarking that $250,000 should be the minimum donation for an ambassadorship. The Clinton White House offered major donors coffees with the president or sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom. More recently, Republicans in Congress have raised questions about whether Democratic donors who invested in the solar energy company Solyndra and other troubled firms influenced the administration's support of those businesses, pointing to White House visits and other official contacts. The administration denies there was any wrongdoing.
At a minimum, it is standard for administrations to recognize generous supporters with sought-after invitations to special events. The Obama White House logs are filled with the names of donors welcomed for St. Patrick's Day receptions, Super Bowl parties and concerts. Last year, several major Democratic donors rounded out the guest list for a film screening with the first lady.
But in addition to social events, business is also carried out in the White House and its executive offices. The logs suggest some Obama fund-raisers and donors have been trafficking in ties they forged to the administration, helping clients get a seat at the table.
When Los Angeles officials wanted White House backing for a program that would speed up local transit projects, they turned last spring to a California political operative, Kerman Maddox, a top Obama fund-raiser and party donor. ''We thought he could help our outreach in Washington,'' said Richard Leahy, chief executive of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
In an internal memo justifying Mr. Maddox's hiring, the authority wrote that he had ''direct access to the Executive Oval Office'' and cited his position on the Obama campaign's National Finance Committee. Mr. Maddox's company Web site prominently features photographs of him with the Obamas.
One day after the authority signed off on his contract, Mr. Maddox made a $10,000 donation to the Obama re-election effort; he donated an additional $6,000 in June. In August, Mr. Maddox landed a meeting for himself and the authority officials with Melody Barnes, then director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, one of several meetings the officials were able to get.
The administration had previously been supportive of Los Angeles County's efforts to accelerate its transit projects, but the following month, Mr. Obama also announced, as part of his jobs package, a proposal to significantly expand a Transportation Department loan program. The plan, which has drawn bipartisan support, is something Mr. Maddox's clients had sought. Mr. Maddox, soon donated an additional $11,250 to the victory fund. He said in an e-mail that his donations were tied to fund-raising events and had nothing to do with visiting the White House.
Navigating Washington
Noah Mamet, another veteran Democratic fund-raiser and consultant, emphasizes on his firm's Web site that he and his partners ''are not lobbyists.'' Instead, they help their clients ''strategically navigate the worlds of politics, philanthropy and business.'' Mr. Mamet, who donated $35,800 last year, and his partners have visited the Obama White House more than a dozen times, including at least four occasions on which they accompanied clients to meetings with administration officials. Mr. Mamet declined to comment.
Lamell McMorris, a Chicago native and longtime Obama supporter who appears in White House visitor logs 20 times, runs a Washington consulting firm that, as recently as last year, was registered to lobby. He also operates a sports management company, and has taken clients like the football player Cam Newton and the New Jersey Nets guard Anthony Morrow to the White House for private tours. Mr. McMorris did not reply to requests for comment.
With many of these meetings, it is often difficult to discern what exactly was being discussed. Clues can sometimes be gleaned by looking at the positions and interests of other attendees -- who often include lobbyists.
David Beier, who oversees government affairs at the pharmaceutical company Amgen, has had nearly a dozen meetings at the White House, according to the visitor logs. On a single day in February last year, Mr. Beier, Amgen's chief executive, Kevin W. Sharer, and lobbyists from the Podesta Group, the firm led by the Democratic fund-raiser Tony Podesta, had four meetings with top White House officials, including Ms. Jarrett, Pete Rouse and Austan Goolsbee. Mr. Beier -- who was registered to lobby for Amgen for 10 years until last year -- donated $35,800 in January, his largest such contribution. The donation came two weeks after he and Mr. Podesta visited the White House for another meeting with an economic official.
Amgen declined to comment, but lobbying disclosure reports show that the company hired the Podesta Group to press the White House and Congress on Medicare coverage and reimbursement for drugs for end-stage renal disease, among other issues.
As for Ms. Bush, a former Senate staff member whose stepfather is the Democratic power broker Vernon E. Jordan Jr., she declined to comment on the nature of her visits. But the purpose of some of them can be inferred from the more detailed records of meetings she had around the same time with officials at the Federal Communications Commission. Those agency meetings -- some of which included the same Sony and Viacom lobbyists whom she accompanied to the White House -- were mostly about shaping regulations to discourage piracy of digital media.
She also helped Viacom fight an F.C.C. complaint that one of its Nickelodeon shows, Zevo-3, was little more than a vehicle for the show's marketing partner, Skechers. Writing to the agency for Viacom, Ms. Bush argued that the cartoon show, which features characters with special powers who previously appeared in Skechers commercials, intentionally distances itself from the footwear Skechers sells.
''In particular,'' she wrote, ''the characters in Zevo-3 do not derive any powers from their shoes, do not go out of their way to refer to their shoes and do not indicate that their shoes bear any relation to their roles on the program.''

HEADLINE: Disruptions: Innovation Isn't Easy, Especially Midstream

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: Why could a small start-up build Instagram, a photo app, and sell it for $1 billion while companies like Eastman Kodak, steeped in photography and the emotionalism of photography, could not? Culture got in the way. 

 BODY:
In Instagram's early days, in offices in the South Park neighborhood of San Francisco, basking in the blue glow of half a dozen computer screens, sat an old Polaroid camera. It was a Rainbow SX-70 OneStep Land Camera.
Most of Instagram's 30 million users wouldn't recognize this instant film camera - even though Edwin Land's creation was once a big deal, featured on the cover of Time magazine in 1972 - but they would recognize the echoes of the camera's design in Instagram's logo.
In fact, Instagram's personality and style were developed in some way from old film camera companies. The application's filters that convert pictures to look like snapshots from yesteryear were inspired by classic Brownies and Instamatics and disposable point-and-shoots.
So why was a small start-up with only 13 employees able to build Instagram while a company like Eastman Kodak, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection, was not? It's easy to imagine how things would be different at Kodak had it dreamed up the idea.
Leica, Nikon, Canon, Pentax and Olympus - all of which are still in business, though for how long is yet to be determined - didn't build Instagram, either. (Polaroid disappeared long ago, though its brand name persists in different forms.)
Michael Hawley, who is on Kodak's board, said the answer could be summed up in one word: culture.
"It's a little like asking why Hasbro didn't do Farmville, or why McDonald's didn't start Whole Foods," said Mr. Hawley, formerly of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Cultural patterns are pretty hard to escape once you get sucked into them. For instance, Apple and Google are diametrical opposites in so many ways, have all the skills, but neither of them did Instagram, either."
Neither could Facebook. If it could, it wouldn't have paid $1 billion to acquire the small team of engineers and access to the program's 30 million users.
The challenge of creating something small and disruptive inside a large company is one that many face today.
Clayton M. Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, explored this problem in his 1997 book, "The Innovator's Dilemma," and found that "it was as if the leading firms were held captive by their customers, enabling attacking entrant firms to topple the incumbent industry leaders each time a disruptive technology emerged."
In a 2008 talk at the Yale School of Management, Gary T. DiCamillo, a former chief executive at Polaroid, said one reason that the company went out of business was that the revenue it was reaping from film sales acted like a blockade to any experimentation with new business models.
"We knew we needed to change the fan belt, but we couldn't stop the engine," he said. "And the reason we couldn't stop the engine was that instant film was the core of the financial model of this company. It drove all the economics." The same was true of Kodak and its reliance on its own cash cow: silver halide film.
It is a cyclical problem all successful companies eventually face as the technology around them changes, but they cannot change.
Even if Polaroid or Kodak could have developed Instagram, it's likely that the project would have been killed anyway. What would be the reaction of almost any executive presented with a business plan to save the company with an iPhone app that had no prospect for revenue?
Companies that try to change the fan belt while the engine is still moving usually end up losing a few fingers. Many people thought Netflix was going to defy the innovator's dilemma as it weaned its customers from physical DVDs to digital downloads last year. It fumbled, and the company's market value was sliced to just over $4 billion, from $16 billion, during the three months it tried to make this transition.
The most perplexing part of Polaroid's fall and Instagram's rise can be seen with the founding thesis of both companies. In the early days of Polaroid, Mr. Land said photography should "go beyond amusement and record-making to become a continuous partner of most human beings." His goal was to build a business that would allow anyone to feel an emotional connection to photography. This was exactly what Instagram figured out, too. And it's what Facebook was unable to solve on its own.
Since it may be impossible to change the fan belt, buying a new engine, even for $1 billion, starts sounding pretty smart.

HEADLINE: Geithner Faults Romney on Jobs Numbers

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama administration accuses the Romney campaign of playing fast and loose with the facts. 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner was cautious on Sunday when asked about the nation's economic progress and trends in gas prices but he pulled no punches when asked about the continued assertion by Mitt Romney and his advisers that the vast majority of job losses under President Obama have involved women.
"It's a ridiculous argument, ridiculous," Mr. Geithner told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "This Week." "It's been largely debunked this week by the people who have looked at it. It's a ridiculous way to look at the problem." He used similarly direct language in separate appearances on NBC and CBS.
Democratic advisers spent much of the past week pushing back on Mr. Romney's assertion that 92.3 percent of job losses since Mr. Obama took office have involved women - a claim that several independent fact-finding organizations have termed technically correct but highly misleading.
As Mr. Geithner noted, the recession began under President Bush, and millions of men lost jobs in a first wave of layoffs hitting male-dominated sectors like construction and manufacturing. A second and much smaller wave, roughly coinciding with Mr. Obama's arrival in office, has largely affected areas such as education, where women dominate.
But the Romney campaign showed on Sunday that it is not ready to relinquish its 92.3 percent weapon as it continues a head-on effort to reduce Mr. Obama's sizable lead in the polls among women voters
Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney adviser, repeated that number in an appearance on "Fox News Sunday." When the moderator, Chris Wallace, suggested that fact-finding groups had deemed it "a little bit of an accounting trick," Mr. Gillespie shot back: "Those independent fact-finders aren't very independent. If you look at their bona fides, they tend to come from left-leaning organizations."
Mr. Gillespie might have been referring in part to an analysis by the PolitiFact web site that largely dismissed the Romney claim. An editor's noteat the site says that the Romney campaign had complained after PolitiFact's initial report on the subject that it relied partly on the evaluations of two economists with ties to the Obama administration.
PolitiFact says that it then interviewed four other economists with no ties to either campaign and found "no reason to change our ruling, which remains at 'mostly false.'"
TheWashington Post fact-checker gave the 92.3 percent assertion a rare rating of "true but false," saying, "at this point this figure doesn't mean very much."
The Associated Press called it "dubious at best."
AndThe New York Times noted that by the time Mr. Obama took office, men had already lost some 2 million jobs more in the recession than women had.
In an e-mail on Sunday, Mr. Romney's press secretary, Andrea Saul, insisted that the data supported his argument.
"No amount of spin by the Obama campaign can hide the enormous damage this president has done to American women," she wrote. "If they move the starting point to the beginning of their so-called recovery, they will find women have benefited from less than one-eighth of the meager job creation. The President should stop making excuses for his failures - he is entitled to his own spin but not his own facts."

HEADLINE: Library Chief Defends Plan To Renovate

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The New York Public Library is engaged in a public-relations blitz to address criticism from scholars and writers who object to the library's plan to reimagine its Fifth Avenue flagship building at an estimated cost of $300 million.
In the past few weeks the library's president, Anthony W. Marx, has written articles for The Huffington Post and Inside Higher Ed, appeared on radio and television and assembled an advisory panel that includes people skeptical of the plan.
The library's efforts are the sort of salesmanship that traditionally accompanies any new ambitious undertaking. But they are also an acknowledgment that the plan, which includes the sale of two prominent Manhattan branches, is a dramatic reshaping that has, at the very least, upset library traditionalists. 
Several scholars have published criticisms of the project, known as the Central Library Plan. On Friday others began circulating a letter of protest among academics; more than 200 have signed so far, including Mario Vargas Llosa, the Nobel Prize-winning writer, and Lorin Stein, the editor of the Paris Review. ''We are alarmed by the Central Library Plan, which seems to us to be a misplaced use of funds in a time of great scarcity,'' the letter says. ''We think the money raised can be better used to preserve and extend what already exists at 42nd Street.'' Mr. Marx said the issues raised by critics would be considered. ''The scholarly community is concerned and we are concerned,'' he said.
The project would convert the main library, now strictly a reference operation, into a hybrid that would also contain a circulating library, many computer terminals and possibly a cafe. The Mid-Manhattan branch and the Science, Industry and Business Library would be sold and their operations folded into the main building. To accommodate the new services, up to half of the three million volumes in the stacks under the main reading room would be moved into storage in New Jersey.
Critics say that the money would be better spent refurbishing deteriorating branch libraries, and that the changes will diminish the library's role as a leading reference center, essentially turning it into a glorified Starbucks. Of particular concern: how long it will take the library to retrieve books from storage.
''The library is being repositioned less as an institution that thinks of research and scholarship than as a kind of fashionable place for intellectuals that is more about entertainment than depth of knowledge,'' said Ilan Stavans, a professor in Latin American and Latino culture at Amherst College, where Mr. Marx was formerly president.
''Research is going to pay a heavy price with this change,'' he added.
Monica Strauss, an art historian, said: ''The age of the book is not yet over. It may be over in 40 years, but it's not over now.''
Mr. Marx said in an interview that the plan -- which had languished due to the economic downturn -- incorporates a continuing commitment to books and research and represents an effort to meet the needs of the general public better.
''The project will produce a greater single facility that includes the crown jewel of the branch system -- Mid-Manhattan,'' Mr. Marx said. ''People come from all over the city now to use the library, and the system will end up with significant additional resources.''
Renovating just Mid-Manhattan, as some have suggested, would cost about $150 million and require closing the library for about two years, Mr. Marx said; selling it, along with the science library, will infuse the system with $10 million to $15 million in annual operating savings that can be spent on other priorities, like research acquisitions.
''We see this as an investment in the research collection,'' Mr. Marx said.
Designed by the British architect Norman Foster, the renovation is to be financed with $150 million from the city, proceeds from the sale of the two libraries and private donations.
Joan Scott, a social science professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, who helped draft the letter of opposition, called the plan disturbing.
''The idea that these reforms are going to make it more democratic doesn't make sense to me,'' she said.
Critics question how users of the libraries to be sold will fit inside the main building (its number of annual visitors -- 1.6 million -- is expected to more than double) and whether books moved to New Jersey really will be available within 24 hours, as the library has promised. Off-site books currently often take longer than that to obtain.
''Is it necessary?'' Stanley N. Katz, a professor at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, said of the plan. Mr. Marx's advisory panel includes prominent academics like Annette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard law professor; David Nasaw, a history professor at the CUNY Graduate Center; and Anthony T. Grafton, a Princeton University history professor. In a column for the university's newspaper this month, Mr. Grafton wrote, ''My stomach hurts when I think about N.Y.P.L., the first great library I ever worked in, turned into a vast Internet cafe.''
(In a subsequent interview Mr. Grafton said he was encouraged by Mr. Marx's assurance that at least two million books would remain in the library.)
Some of the critics said they were concerned that the library is not airing the advisory panel's discussions about the plan or the sorts of feedback it has been getting on its Web site.
One panelist and a critic of the plan, Caleb Crain, a former fellow at the library's Scholars and Writers center, said the library had asked him not to write about the panel's first meeting, on April 5, on his blog, steamthing.com, because the other panelists had not been consulted. In addition, he said, the library has asked him not to attend the next meeting, on Thursday, at which the panel will discuss whether to allow news coverage.
Mr. Marx said he would be willing to post online questions and comments about the plan and sought in an interview to counter other concerns.
The library would not become too crowded, he said, because the renovation would create up to 20,000 square feet more public space than is currently available at the Mid-Manhattan, science and main libraries combined. Turning the stacks into space for a circulating library makes sense, Mr. Marx said, because the stacks are nearly 100 years old, and there is minimal humidity and fire control. The library will study which volumes should go to storage for reasons like low use. Half of the library's research collection is already in storage, he said, and most major research libraries have off-site locations. The books moved out will for the first time have bar codes, making them easier to locate for delivery, Mr. Marx said, and can be ordered online from home, including on Saturdays.
He said that he would be open to the idea of using the space under Bryant Park to store 1.2 million to 1.5 million more volumes, but that this would cost an additional $20 million.
As for the branches, he said, a separate $300 million has been spent on them over the last 10 years, with $125 million to $150 million more to be spent over the next five.
''The world of libraries is changing,'' Mr. Marx said. ''And we have to change with it.''

HEADLINE: Europe's Economic Suicide

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On Saturday The Times reported on an apparently growing phenomenon in Europe: ''suicide by economic crisis,'' people taking their own lives in despair over unemployment and business failure. It was a heartbreaking story. But I'm sure I wasn't the only reader, especially among economists, wondering if the larger story isn't so much about individuals as about the apparent determination of European leaders to commit economic suicide for the Continent as a whole.
Just a few months ago I was feeling some hope about Europe. You may recall that late last fall Europe appeared to be on the verge of financial meltdown; but the European Central Bank, Europe's counterpart to the Fed, came to the Continent's rescue. It offered Europe's banks open-ended credit lines as long as they put up the bonds of European governments as collateral; this directly supported the banks and indirectly supported the governments, and put an end to the panic. 
The question then was whether this brave and effective action would be the start of a broader rethink, whether European leaders would use the breathing space the bank had created to reconsider the policies that brought matters to a head in the first place.
But they didn't. Instead, they doubled down on their failed policies and ideas. And it's getting harder and harder to believe that anything will get them to change course.
Consider the state of affairs in Spain, which is now the epicenter of the crisis. Never mind talk of recession; Spain is in full-on depression, with the overall unemployment rate at 23.6 percent, comparable to America at the depths of the Great Depression, and the youth unemployment rate over 50 percent. This can't go on -- and the realization that it can't go on is what is sending Spanish borrowing costs ever higher.
In a way, it doesn't really matter how Spain got to this point -- but for what it's worth, the Spanish story bears no resemblance to the morality tales so popular among European officials, especially in Germany. Spain wasn't fiscally profligate -- on the eve of the crisis it had low debt and a budget surplus. Unfortunately, it also had an enormous housing bubble, a bubble made possible in large part by huge loans from German banks to their Spanish counterparts. When the bubble burst, the Spanish economy was left high and dry; Spain's fiscal problems are a consequence of its depression, not its cause.
Nonetheless, the prescription coming from Berlin and Frankfurt is, you guessed it, even more fiscal austerity.
This is, not to mince words, just insane. Europe has had several years of experience with harsh austerity programs, and the results are exactly what students of history told you would happen: such programs push depressed economies even deeper into depression. And because investors look at the state of a nation's economy when assessing its ability to repay debt, austerity programs haven't even worked as a way to reduce borrowing costs.
What is the alternative? Well, in the 1930s -- an era that modern Europe is starting to replicate in ever more faithful detail -- the essential condition for recovery was exit from the gold standard. The equivalent move now would be exit from the euro, and restoration of national currencies. You may say that this is inconceivable, and it would indeed be a hugely disruptive event both economically and politically. But continuing on the present course, imposing ever-harsher austerity on countries that are already suffering Depression-era unemployment, is what's truly inconceivable.
So if European leaders really wanted to save the euro they would be looking for an alternative course. And the shape of such an alternative is actually fairly clear. The Continent needs more expansionary monetary policies, in the form of a willingness -- an announced willingness -- on the part of the European Central Bank to accept somewhat higher inflation; it needs more expansionary fiscal policies, in the form of budgets in Germany that offset austerity in Spain and other troubled nations around the Continent's periphery, rather than reinforcing it. Even with such policies, the peripheral nations would face years of hard times. But at least there would be some hope of recovery.
What we're actually seeing, however, is complete inflexibility. In March, European leaders signed a fiscal pact that in effect locks in fiscal austerity as the response to any and all problems. Meanwhile, key officials at the central bank are making a point of emphasizing the bank's willingness to raise rates at the slightest hint of higher inflation.
So it's hard to avoid a sense of despair. Rather than admit that they've been wrong, European leaders seem determined to drive their economy -- and their society -- off a cliff. And the whole world will pay the price.

HEADLINE: Many U.S. Immigrants' Children Seek American Dream Abroad

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Samir N. Kapadia seemed to be on the rise in Washington, moving from an internship on Capitol Hill to jobs at a major foundation and a consulting firm. Yet his days, he felt, had become routine.
By contrast, friends and relatives in India, his native country, were telling him about their lives in that newly surging nation. One was creating an e-commerce business, another a public relations company, still others a magazine, a business incubator and a gossip and events Web site.
''I'd sit there on Facebook and on the phone and hear about them starting all these companies and doing all these dynamic things,'' recalled Mr. Kapadia, 25, who was born in India but grew up in the United States. ''And I started feeling that my 9-to-5 wasn't good enough anymore.''
Last year, he quit his job and moved to Mumbai. 
In growing numbers, experts say, highly educated children of immigrants to the United States are uprooting themselves and moving to their ancestral countries. They are embracing homelands that their parents once spurned but that are now economic powers.
Some, like Mr. Kapadia, had arrived in the United States as young children, becoming citizens, while others were born in the United States to immigrant parents.
Enterprising Americans have always sought opportunities abroad. But this new wave underscores the evolving nature of global migration, and the challenges to American economic supremacy and competitiveness.
In interviews, many of these Americans said they did not know how long they would live abroad; some said it was possible that they would remain expatriates for many years, if not for the rest of their lives.
Their decisions to leave have, in many cases, troubled their immigrant parents. Yet most said they had been pushed by the dismal hiring climate in the United States or pulled by prospects abroad.
''Markets are opening; people are coming up with ideas every day; there's so much opportunity to mold and create,'' said Mr. Kapadia, now a researcher at Gateway House, a new foreign-policy research organization in Mumbai. ''People here are running much faster than the people in Washington.''
For generations, the world's less-developed countries have suffered so-called brain drain -- the flight of many of their best and brightest to the West. That has not stopped, but now a reverse flow has begun, particularly to countries like China and India and, to a lesser extent, Brazil and Russia.
Some scholars and business leaders contend that this emigration does not necessarily bode ill for the United States. They say young entrepreneurs and highly educated professionals sow American knowledge and skills abroad. At the same time, these workers acquire experience overseas and build networks that they can carry back to the United States or elsewhere -- a pattern known as ''brain circulation.''
But the experts caution that in the global race for talent, the return of these expatriates to the United States and American companies is no longer a sure bet.
''These are the fleet-footed; they're the ones who in a sense will follow opportunity,'' said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington that studies population movements.
''I know there will be people who will argue all about loyalty, et cetera, et cetera,'' he said. ''I know when you go to war, loyalty matters. But this is a different kind of war that affects all of us.''
The United States government does not collect data specifically on the emigration of the American-born children of immigrants -- or on those who were born abroad but moved to the United States as young children.
But several migration experts said the phenomenon was significant and increasing.
''We've gone way beyond anecdotal evidence,'' said Edward J. W. Park, director of the Asian Pacific American Studies Program at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
Mr. Park said this migration was spurred by the efforts of some overseas governments to attract more foreign talent by offering employment, investment, tax and visa incentives.
''So it's not just the individuals who are making these decisions,'' he said. ''It's governments who enact strategic policies to facilitate this.''
Officials in India said they had seen a sharp increase in the arrival of people of Indian descent in recent years -- including at least 100,000 in 2010 alone, said Alwyn Didar Singh, a former senior official at the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs.
Many of these Americans have been able to leverage family networks, language skills and cultural knowledge gleaned from growing up in immigrant households.
Jonathan Assayag, 29, a Brazilian-American born in Rio de Janeiro and raised in South Florida, returned to Brazil last year. A Harvard Business School graduate, he had been working at an Internet company in Silicon Valley and unsuccessfully trying to develop a business.
''I spent five months spending my weekends at Starbucks, trying to figure out a start-up in America,'' he recalled.
All the while, Harvard friends urged him to make a change. ''They were saying: 'Jon, what are you doing? Go to Brazil and start a business there!' '' he said.
Relocating to Sao Paulo, he became an ''entrepreneur in residence'' at a venture capital firm. He is starting an online eyewear business. ''I speak the language, I get the culture, I understand how people do business,'' he said.
Calvin Chin was born in Michigan and used to live in San Francisco, where he worked at technology start-ups and his wife was an interior decorator. Mr. Chin's mother was from China, as were his paternal grandparents. His wife's parents were from Taiwan.
They are now in Shanghai, where Mr. Chin has started two companies -- an online loan service for students and an incubator for technology start-ups. His wife, Angie Wu, has worked as a columnist and television anchor.
''The energy here is phenomenal,'' Mr. Chin said.
The couple have two children, who were born in China.
Reetu Jain, 36, an Indian-American raised in Texas, was inspired to move to India while taking time off from her auditing job to travel abroad. Everywhere she went, she said, she met people returning to their countries of origin and feeling the ''creative energy'' in the developing world.
She and her husband, Nehal Sanghavi, who had been working as a lawyer in the United States, moved to Mumbai in January 2011. Embracing a long-held passion, she now works as a dance instructor and choreographer and has acted in television commercials and a Bollywood film.
''We're surrounded by people who just want to try something new,'' Ms. Jain said.
For many of these emigres, the decision to relocate has confounded -- and even angered -- their immigrant parents.
When Jason Y. Lee, who was born in Taiwan and raised in the United States, told his parents during college that he wanted to visit Hong Kong, his father refused to pay for the plane ticket.
''His mind-set was, 'I worked so hard to bring you to America and now you want to go back to China?' '' recalled Mr. Lee, 29.
Since then, Mr. Lee has started an import-export business between the United States and China; studied in Shanghai; worked for investment banks in New York and Singapore; and created an international job-search Web site in India. He works for an investment firm in Singapore. His father's opposition has softened.
Margareth Tran -- whose family followed a path over two generations from China to the United States by way of Cambodia, Thailand, Hong Kong and France -- said her father was displeased by her decision in 2009 to relocate.
''It's kind of crazy for him that I wanted to move to China,'' said Ms. Tran, 26, who was born in France and moved to the United States at age 11. ''He wants me to have all the benefits that come from a first-world country.''
But after graduating from Cornell University in 2009 at the height of the recession, she could not find work on Wall Street, a long-held ambition. She moved to Shanghai and found a job at a management consulting firm.
''I had never stepped foot in Asia, so part of the reason was to go back to my roots,'' she said.
Ms. Tran said she did not know how long she would remain abroad. She said she was open to various possibilities, including moving to another foreign country, living a life straddling China and the United States or remaining permanently in China.
Her father has reluctantly accepted her approach.
''I told him, 'I'm going to try to make it in China, and if things work out for me in China, then I can have a really great career,' '' she said. ''He didn't hold me back.''

HEADLINE: Making Visas-for-Dollars Work

BYLINE: By ANN LEE. 
Ann Lee is a senior fellow at Demos and the author of ''What the U.S. Can Learn From China.''

 BODY:
AMONG the most popular tools for attracting foreign investment to the United States is the EB-5 program. It seems like the perfect win-win: any foreigner who invests between $500,000 and $1 million here, and creates at least 10 domestic jobs from that investment within two years, gets a green card. 
Given how many high-worth investors are clamoring to enter the United States, the program could have a significant effect on American unemployment. Indeed, it has brought in some $1 billion over the last fiscal year, and the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness has called for the program to be ''radically'' expanded over the next few years.
Unfortunately, the program is so rife with fraud and corruption that it could actually have the opposite impact and deter investment. To regain its credibility, the program must make a number of changes to enable more transparency and demand more competence from its operators.
The most egregious problems with the EB-5 program can be found in its 218 regional centers, which work with private-sector brokers to identify local investments and direct foreign participants to them. Examples abound of centers and brokers playing down risky investments and misrepresenting how the program works, including a promise that EB-5 investments are guaranteed by the federal government -- when the government in fact does nothing of the sort. Many investments have failed to create the required 10 jobs and even gone bankrupt, leaving the investor without his money or his green card.
While many EB-5 regional centers have solid records, a disturbing number have directed investor money to risky projects and companies that pay little to no return, overseen by brokers who get a commission regardless of how the investment plays out.
Aside from accusations of outright fraud, there is also a clear lack of understanding among government administrators about how to manage an investment program. As a result, they often approve businesses that are simple to understand, like a condo development or a grocery store, but whose business models don't generate enough profit to hire workers, while rejecting more sophisticated businesses that stand a greater potential of generating profits and jobs.
For the time being, these problems haven't turned the tide of interest in the EB-5 program. But that could change: recent high-profile investigations by Reuters and Businessweek, as well as a warning against fraudulent brokers by the Chinese Supreme People's Court, could start having a significant deterrent effect, especially since other countries, like Canada, are following America's lead with their own versions of the program.
Fortunately, the solutions are straightforward. The federal government needs to rein in freewheeling brokers with heavier penalties for misrepresenting investments, hire more business-savvy administrators and make the entire process more transparent, so that applicants know why their money was accepted or rejected.
The EB-5 program has a lot of promise to reduce unemployment, and the White House is right to call for its expansion. Rather than end it, let's fix it.

HEADLINE: In Ad Campaign, SAP Looks Beyond Business Customers

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
Software companies don't have an easy time marketing themselves to a mass audience, especially when the software is a complicated business product meant for cloud computing or data analytics. 
Despite that hurdle, the business software company SAP will announce a new global advertising campaign this week called ''Run Like Never Before'' intended to reach not just high-level executives and I.T. managers, their usual customers, but small and midsize businesses, and maybe even a stray consumer.
''It is recognizing that I.T. isn't the purchaser of all the products that we sell,'' said Jonathan Becher, the chief marketing officer at SAP. The campaign was created by Ogilvy & Mather, part of WPP. The ads are meant to highlight the speed with which SAP's suite of technologies can help companies do business better. In the last few years, SAP has made a series of acquisitions to broaden its product base, including Sybase, which makes mobility and data management software, Business Objects, an analytics software company, and SuccessFactors, a cloud-computing company.
''We're talking about some pretty abstract technologies,'' said Chris Curry, creative director at Ogilvy & Mather. ''Really what that translates to is getting new product out the door faster, allowing somebody to have a better work life,'' he said.
The campaign will include television, print, mobile and digital ads that will begin in the United States, Brazil and Germany on Tuesday. The ads were shot in various locations around the world including China, India and South Africa.
The television spot starts with a grinding guitar riff and shows everything from fishermen pulling in their catch to a man in the back of a taxi typing on a tablet computer and a father checking his cellphone during his son's cricket game. The messages on the screen say, ''Run without warehouses,'' ''Run 10 years of numbers in seconds'' and ''Run without missing out.'' ''The imagery represents all the categories that SAP is involved in,'' Mr. Curry said. ''It's not just people in offices.''
Visitors to Yankee Stadium in New York City on Friday got a preview of the TV ad, which was shown during the game. Print ads will run in magazines like the Harvard Business Review and The Economist.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Disruptions: Innovation Isn't Easy, Especially for an Industry Giant

BYLINE: By NICK BILTON. 
Email: bilton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In Instagram's early days, in offices in the South Park neighborhood of San Francisco, basking in the blue glow of half a dozen computer screens, sat an old Polaroid camera. It was a Rainbow SX-70 OneStep Land Camera.
Most of Instagram's 30 million users wouldn't recognize this instant film camera - even though Edwin Land's creation was once a big deal, featured on the cover of Time magazine in 1972 - but they would recognize the echoes of the camera's design in Instagram's logo. 
In fact, Instagram's personality and style were developed in some way from old film camera companies. The application's filters that convert pictures to look like snapshots from yesteryear were inspired by classic Brownies and Instamatics and disposable point-and-shoots.
So why was a small start-up with only 13 employees able to build Instagram while a company like Eastman Kodak, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection, was not? It's easy to imagine how things would be different at Kodak had it dreamed up the idea.
Leica, Nikon, Canon, Pentax and Olympus - all of which are still in business, though for how long is yet to be determined - didn't build Instagram, either. (Polaroid disappeared long ago, though its brand name persists in different forms.)
Michael Hawley, who is on Kodak's board, said the answer could be summed up in one word: culture.
''It's a little like asking why Hasbro didn't do Farmville, or why McDonald's didn't start Whole Foods,'' said Mr. Hawley, formerly of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Cultural patterns are pretty hard to escape once you get sucked into them. For instance, Apple and Google are diametrical opposites in so many ways, have all the skills, but neither of them did Instagram, either.''
Neither could Facebook. If it could, it wouldn't have paid $1 billion to acquire the small team of engineers and access to the program's 30 million users.
The challenge of creating something small and disruptive inside a large company is one that many face today.
Clayton M. Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, explored this problem in his 1997 book, ''The Innovator's Dilemma,'' and found that ''it was as if the leading firms were held captive by their customers, enabling attacking entrant firms to topple the incumbent industry leaders each time a disruptive technology emerged.''
In a 2008 talk at the Yale School of Management, Gary T. DiCamillo, a former chief executive at Polaroid, said one reason that the company went out of business was that the revenue it was reaping from film sales acted like a blockade to any experimentation with new business models.
''We knew we needed to change the fan belt, but we couldn't stop the engine,'' he said. ''And the reason we couldn't stop the engine was that instant film was the core of the financial model of this company. It drove all the economics.'' The same was true of Kodak and its reliance on its own cash cow: silver halide film.
It is a cyclical problem all successful companies eventually face as the technology around them changes, but they cannot change.
Even if Polaroid or Kodak could have developed Instagram, it's likely that the project would have been killed anyway. What would be the reaction of almost any executive presented with a business plan to save the company with an iPhone app that had no prospect for revenue?
Companies that try to change the fan belt while the engine is still moving usually end up losing a few fingers. Many people thought Netflix was going to defy the innovator's dilemma as it weaned its customers from physical DVDs to digital downloads last year. It fumbled, and the company's market value was sliced to just over $4 billion, from $16 billion, during the three months it tried to make this transition.
The most perplexing part of Polaroid's fall and Instagram's rise can be seen with the founding thesis of both companies. In the early days of Polaroid, Mr. Land said photography should ''go beyond amusement and record-making to become a continuous partner of most human beings.'' His goal was to build a business that would allow anyone to feel an emotional connection to photography. This was exactly what Instagram figured out, too. And it's what Facebook was unable to solve on its own.
Since it may be impossible to change the fan belt, buying a new engine, even for $1 billion, starts sounding pretty smart.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Raising the Memory of the Titanic, and a City's Role in Its Creation

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS DALBY

 BODY:
BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- One hundred years after the Titanic slid beneath the icy Atlantic, this city, where the doomed ship was built, noted the occasion on Sunday by unveiling a memorial to the victims in a ceremony that was part of an effort to shape a shared history in what is still a deeply divided society.
Hundreds of people gathered to remember the 1,512 men, women and children who perished when the passenger liner sank on its maiden voyage about 350 miles southeast of Newfoundland on April 15, 1912. Among the crowd were relatives of the 28 victims from Belfast who never completed the 3,000-mile journey to New York. 
In the keynote address, the lord mayor of Belfast, Niall O' Donnghaille, tried to explain why it had taken so long for a city so closely associated with the Titanic to remember it with a memorial. He called the discovery of the wreck by Robert D. Ballard and his team of explorers in 1985 the beginning of a ''healing'' process.
''For more than 70 years, Belfast's rightful place in the Titanic story was barely acknowledged by people of this city,'' he said. ''The human stories of those who built the ship and those who lost their lives were quietly set aside, the memory too painful, the loss too personal.''
But some here have pointed to a host of other reasons for what Brian Kelly, a historian at Queens University in Belfast, called ''a collective amnesia.''
Mr. O' Donnghaille's ancestors would have had little chance of securing a trade in the shipyards near the working-class Catholic neighborhood where he grew up. Harland and Wolff, the shipyard where the Titanic was built, illustrated the city's divide: the better-paid jobs were the preserve of Protestants, while Catholics were lucky to find menial labor.
More than 10,000 men worked to build the Titanic. The launching was a sign of Belfast's industrial prowess, and the sinking was not only a blow to its pride but also a threat to its economy. Then, months after the disaster, this part of Ireland became embroiled in a bitter battle over its status within the United Kingdom.
More recently, of course, Northern Ireland has suffered through 30 years of bitter conflict. The fighting has played out against the backdrop of increasing economic irrelevance as the heavy industries that once supported the economy moved to Asia and other low-cost locations. Under such pressures, the people of Belfast have long considered the Titanic a taboo subject, bad publicity for a city and region that could hardly stand more.
But in the past few years, Belfast has been setting aside thoughts of industrial failure and civic divisions and embracing the Titanic as a unifying symbol, as well as a commercial opportunity.
Much of the ceremony on Sunday was somber and stately. A highlight involved 12-year-old Jack Martin, named after a great-great-uncle who died on the Titanic, as the boy unveiled a granite plinth bearing five bronze plaques engraved with the names of the dead.
But other events were more festive, including a rock concert and a gala ball. Vendors are also trying to cash in on the fascination with the ship, selling everything from Titanic-themed potato chips to T-shirts emblazoned with slogans celebrating the notoriously black local humor, like ''It was all right when it left here.''
A more permanent sign of the official efforts to fashion an inclusive image for a new Northern Ireland is the Titanic Belfast, an exhibition center on part of the site of the former Harland and Wolff shipyard that is advertised by the tourism board as ''the world's largest Titanic state-of-the-art visitor experience.'' It opened a few weeks ago in a ceremony that included Protestant and Catholic leaders.
As is the case with other parts of Britain, the economy of Northern Ireland continues to teeter on the edge of recession. The problems have been made worse here by the economic collapse in the neighboring Irish republic. Northern Ireland and Ireland's fortunes have become even more entwined, particularly in the area of tourism promotion, since the 1998 signing of the Good Friday Agreement, which set a blueprint for Protestant-Catholic peace.
The Titanic exhibition center's nine galleries chronicle the life of the ship from its planning, construction and launching to its catastrophic maiden voyage and the discovery of the wreckage. The center cost about $120 million to build, with the bulk of the money coming from taxpayers. It already ranks among the most expensive buildings in Europe, and projections say it will need to draw 290,000 visitors a year to break even.
The building is the cornerstone of a large urban rehabilitation project that includes plans for apartments and businesses on the site of several former shipyards, most of which have been derelict for decades. Harland and Wolff is still operating, but its employees now refurbish wind turbines and refit ships.
The company's famous twin Gantry cranes, known as Samson and Goliath, are still part of the Belfast skyline. But the shipyard, which reached a peak of about 35,000 workers around World War II, now employs a work force that is just a fraction of the 15,000 employees who were there in 1912.
The new Titanic Quarter, as the shipyard district has been renamed, and the tourism push, have been supported by the power-sharing government established under the Good Friday agreement as part of the effort to build a new society that prevails over the old divide -- and embraces the Titanic as part of the city's legend that Catholics and Protestants can share.
Yet despite the generally positive local reviews of the center, some in Belfast offer a dose of skepticism about its long-term benefits.
Dr. Kelly, the historian, said expectations about the number of visitors were unrealistic. ''It seems to be a case of everyone is on board and nobody wants to be the one to question it,'' he said.
In a memorial lecture in Belfast last week, Dr. Ballard, the explorer, emphasized the human aspect of the tragedy.
''Titanic didn't sink right away,'' he said. ''It was a beautiful night, the sky was clear, the sea was calm, the band was playing and the deck of the Titanic became a morality play. I think everyone is fascinated by all the different things that took place in that three hours, and everyone wonders what they would do.''

HEADLINE: More Blacks in Management Would Be a True Robinson Tribute

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
On Sunday, Major League Baseball celebrated another Jackie Robinson Day. Sixty-five years ago, Robinson broke the majors' racial barrier.
Since 2004, Jackie Robinson Day has been a national day of introspection and respect. The celebration has also become an outlet for hand-wringing about the ''problem'' of the diminishing African-American presence in the major leagues.
We've all seen the numbers: African-Americans made up about 8.5 percent of the players in the majors last year, down from 18 percent 20 years earlier. There are fewer African-American starting pitchers now than there were 50 years ago.
The decline is often explained away by a combination of cultural shifts and economics. 
Baseball is a father-son sport. Many black fathers, for a variety of reasons, are not in their sons' lives.
Baseball, with the cost of equipment and travel for competition, is an expensive sport.
Baseball is a sport of skill more than athleticism, and the skills must be learned early on in youth systems that may be beyond the reach of those who live in economically depressed areas.
Basketball and football have siphoned off top black athletes.
Baseball, under the leadership of officials like Jimmie Lee Solomon, is making efforts to bolster blacks' participation. Solomon oversees Major League Baseball's Urban Youth Academies and the Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities program, called R.B.I. But even Solomon says the African-American presence may never hit double digits again.
Given the dire predicament of many young black men in the United States, the larger question is whether the African-American community really needs another center fielder, another slugger.
About a third of African-American men are under the supervision of the criminal justice system, and about 12 percent of African-American men in their 20s and 30s are incarcerated.
The Schott 50 State Report on Public Education and Black Males details, among other things, that only 47 percent of black males graduate from high school. New York State's graduation rate for its Regents diploma is only 25 percent for black male students. And, according to a report by the University of California, Berkeley, Center for Labor Research and Education, African-American unemployment remains in the 15 to 16 percent range, 6 or 7 percentage points higher than the rest of the United States work force.
Given these realities, one can make the argument that any avenue of employment and advancement should be pursued -- sports included. Major League Baseball, our nominal national pastime, should certainly be a viable option. But there needs to be a focus beyond the playing field, on management, where decisions are made that can affect the numbers on the field.
Solomon, who played football at Dartmouth and earned a law degree from Harvard, cautioned against jettisoning playing positions that could lead to a career in the industry. Baseball needs a healthy pool of players who can be a prime source for front-office positions throughout the sport.
Bob Watson held a number of executive positions in baseball after his playing career and was the general manager of the Yankees when they won the World Series in 1996. ''We need to cultivate managers, minor league directors and executives,'' he said. ''To attract young African-Americans and inspire them, they need to see people who look like them.''
A few years ago, Carl Crawford said he thought the weeding-out process for African-American baseball players began in high school. College may not be that welcoming, either.
Julian McWilliams, an African-American player at Temple who is injured this season, said that college baseball coaches could make the game a difficult path for some black players to follow.
''They sometimes take away from the essence of the sport,'' said McWilliams, a junior in eligibility and a senior academically, adding, ''A lot of young blacks play on the premise of baseball being a rhythm game, based on rhythm, based on how you feel.''
''That's the way black people were able to succeed in baseball for a long time. Because they felt good, they made it look good -- they played the game with soul,'' he said. But he said that expression was stunted at the college level.
Historians have noted that Jackie Robinson and later Willie Mays and Latin players introduced a new spirit into the major league game.
This is accepted in basketball and football. Not so much in college baseball.
McWilliams said that in his generation, the rise of the N.B.A. had something to do with the decline in popularity of baseball in the inner city.
''The Jordan era had something to do with it, the Kobe era had something to do with it,'' McWilliams said. ''Everyone wanted to be like Mike or Kobe or LeBron James. I wanted to be like Jeter.''
He also said the father-son relationship was important in nurturing the initial spark of a connection to baseball. ''A lot of times in the black community, there are not a lot of father figures in urban areas,'' he said.
McWilliams credits his father, Morris, for steering him to and keeping him in baseball. ''The reason I started playing baseball is because he played it, and we would go outside and have a game of catch,'' McWilliams said. ''So I feel it starts from an early age.''
McWilliams has made an unusual journey through baseball.
In 2002, he was a member of the Harlem Little League team, coached by his father, that reached the Little League World Series in South Williamsport, Pa. The team's World Series run, and Julian's subsequent years attending camps and clinics, opened his eyes to the economic realities of youth baseball.
Those realities chased a number of promising African-American players out of the game from ages 13 to 18, McWilliams said. ''I remember that some of the kids on the white teams brought their individual hitting coaches with them,'' he added.
At 13, McWilliams played with the New York Gothams, an elite travel team. Three years later, he played for the New York Nines, an even more selective team and part of an organization run by baseball scouts. McWilliams said he was the only African-American on his team. He ultimately earned a scholarship to Ohio University, although he transferred after a year.
There are a number of ways to encourage, if not boost, the participation of young athletes in baseball. The first is drop the residency requirements in Little League Baseball for ages 5 through 8, the crucial time when kids learn to love the game and pick up the fundamentals.
Major League Baseball should also escalate its timetable for adopting a global draft with one pool of players. Under the current system, teams find it cheaper to sponsor baseball academies outside the United States to mine talent. That allows each team to have its own stash of players that it has identified. These players are a relatively cheap substitute for players born in the United States and Canada.
If baseball is really serious about a stronger African-American presence, it would push hard for a global draft.
Such a draft would create one caldron of talent from which all teams would choose. This is the N.B.A. system that has proved so effective. The difference is that the N.B.A. uses colleges as ''academies'' where players' skills are honed -- at no cost to the teams. Come draft day, they take turns selecting the best players.
After he retired from baseball, Jackie Robinson spent his life championing social causes and especially pushing to increase the number of African-Americans in leadership and executive positions. On Oct. 15, 1972, he spoke before Game 2 of the World Series in Cincinnati and concluded his remarks by saying that he wanted one day to see an African-American manager in the dugout.
Nine days later, he died.
In the wake of celebrating yet another Jackie Robinson Sunday and discussing the dwindling numbers of black players, it's prudent to embrace the vision of progress Robinson expressed in Cincinnati. He knew better than most that power and control are the requisites for any group to succeed -- in baseball and in life.

HEADLINE: With Italy And Spain, Further Tests For Europe

BYLINE: By PAUL GEITNER; Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Is the euro crisis back with a vengeance, or do investors have a needless case of anxiety?
Until very recently, the gloom over the Continent had seemed to be lifting, with the conclusion of Greece's second bailout and the calming effect on the financial sector of cheap loans from the European Central Bank. But last week's jump in borrowing costs for Spain and Italy provided a clear signal that the euro's problems are far from solved.
''Financial strains in Europe have eased somewhat since December,'' Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech in Washington on Thursday. ''However, events of the past week remind us that markets remain volatile and that turning the corner is never easy.''
The turn looks tightest in Spain, which is still under intense pressure from the European Union to narrow a gaping budget deficit and clean up its banking system after a housing bubble burst, even as the country slides back into recession, with roughly one in four workers unemployed. 
Yields on Spanish 10-year bonds hit a worrisome level of 6 percent Wednesday for the first time in four months and closed the week nearly that high. At the same time, investors seeking safety drove the 10-year German bond, or bund, to a near-record low of 1.6 percent.
Interest rates on Spanish bonds could climb again this week if two debt auctions, scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday, go poorly.
Italy, which has an even heavier debt load and is further behind on its refinancing needs for this year, is under similar stress.
Neither Spain nor Italy seems a good candidate for meeting the deficit-reduction targets they have agreed to with the European Union, especially if the downturn deepens. Neither do many of the other member states, however, including the Netherlands, traditionally a deficit hawk but now scrambling to find additional savings as its economy falters.
Their deficit-trimming will be detailed in the medium-term budget plans that each European Union member must submit to Brussels by the end of the month for vetting under stricter procedures approved last fall. The procedures are intended to catch the kind of slippage that got the euro zone into its current mess.
The verdicts will be based in large part on official indicators of the region's fiscal and economic health to be released over the next few weeks. Those include final debt and deficit figures for 2011 as verified by Eurostat, the union's statistics agency, to be released next Monday, and the European Commission's spring economic forecast, which covers not only growth and inflation expectations, but also deficit and debt figures, to be released on May 11.
Countries whose budgets are judged to be off-track will face demands for corrective action, which are now supposed to be harder to avoid. That prospect, however, seems certain to renew debate over whether a regional economy teetering on the brink of recession can withstand a new round of austerity.
''On this the market is entirely schizophrenic,'' said Gilles Moec, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''They complain about growth, and they complain about fiscal policy. Well, you can't have both.''
Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING Belgium, agrees that European policy makers are in something of a no-win situation right now. But to bend the rules so soon after tightening them, he added, ''would have an enormous negative impact on credibility.''
While the austerity debate simmers, a more pressing concern is efforts by Italy and Spain to raise financing for government debt they will need to roll over this year. Italy has so far raised only a little more than one-third of the estimated 215 billion euros ($281 billion) it will need this year, according to Reuters calculations. Spain is about half of the way to its goal, the economy minister, Luis de Guindos, said last Tuesday. According to the 2012 budget, the Spanish treasury plans gross issuance of 186 billion euros ($243 billion) of debt this year.
The European Central Bank relieved a great deal of pressure with two rounds of cheap, three-year loans to banks in December and February that pumped 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) into the region's banking system. Many banks, especially in the southern countries like Spain and Italy, turned around and used that money to buy their government's debt.
That debt-buying is now tapering off, said Guntram Wolff, deputy director at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. That raises the question of who might step in to finance these governments. ''Investors are starting to express big doubts,'' Mr. Wolff said.
Few analysts expect the central bank to open the taps again, especially because the earlier moves have already started having unintended consequences. While the loan program was meant chiefly to address an acute financing problem for the banks, it also ended up tying their fate more closely to that of their governments, said Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London.
Now that sovereign yields are rising again, he said, the banks are faced with the prospect of large paper losses on their freshly purchased bond holdings, as well as sinking stock prices.
Many economists say Spain still needs to fully address the impact of a housing bubble that burst in 2008 in the wake of the global financial crisis. Many homeowners struggle to make payments. And real estate prices still have further to fall, which will force the banks to take more write-offs.
The Spanish central bank governor, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, conceded last week that Spanish banks could need more capital if the economy deteriorated.
The banks' ''ever-increasing'' losses ''hang like a sword of Damocles over the public sector,'' according to a paper published on Sunday by Cinzia Alcidi and Daniel Gros at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.
''They cannot and should not go on just writing off the absolute minimum,'' Mr. Gros said in an interview. ''Much better to follow the Irish example and have it over with.''
Deutsche Bank estimates that Spanish banks could need about 50 billion euros in additional capital -- more than the banks could probably raise on their own under current market conditions, and more than the Spanish government could afford.
That leaves the European Union's newly bolstered bailout fund. Mr. Gros suggested it could lend money directly to the Spanish banks to avoid increasing government debt and avert a full-blown bailout.
Still, admitting you need outside help is ''toxic politically'' for any government, said Mr. Moec, the Deutsche Bank economist. ''I don't think they feel cornered yet,'' he added.
Italy does not have a housing crash to cope with, or Spain's high level of private debt. But it has a much higher public debt than Spain, similarly anemic growth and a calcified labor market that Prime Minister Mario Monti, a technocrat appointed in November, has struggled to change against an increasingly hostile political environment.
In the latest display of Italian public anger, thousands of union members turned out on the streets of Rome on Friday to protest plans to raise the minimum age for a state pension.
In such a charged climate, it is little wonder that barbs have started to fly across borders.
Mr. Monti has in recent days sought to blame the problems in Spain for the run-up in Italian bond yields, while French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is running for re-election, has raised hackles in Madrid by suggesting that France could end up like Spain if people voted for his Socialist Party opponent.
On Wednesday, Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, fired back, calling on European leaders to be ''more cautious in their statements.''
''We don't talk about other countries,'' he told members of his Popular Party in Madrid. ''We wish other E.U. and euro zone countries the best.''

HEADLINE: A Patent Dispute Over Thermostats

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Update: Added Honeywell's response to Nest Lab's court filing on Thursday.
The next front in the high-stakes, high-tech patent wars after smartphones? Thermostats.
No, really, and that helps explain why Nest Labs, a hot Silicon Valley start-up, has recruited Richard Lutton Jr., Apple's former chief intellectual property officer.
Nest announced that Mr. Lutton had joined the company as general counsel on Thursday morning, an hour or so after it filed a fiery rebuttal to the patent-infringement suit that Honeywell brought against Nest in February. 
A bit of the back story: Nest is populated with talented recruits from Apple, Google, Microsoft and other technology companies, and it has developed a digital ''learning'' thermostat.
Nest's leaders speak of the thermostat as a device, and a marketplace, ripe for disruptive innovation. A smart thermostat that learns and adjusts to homeowners' comings and goings can deliver big savings to consumers, while delivering the environmental payoff of saving energy and curbing pollution, they say.
Nest introduced its first model last fall to rave reviews and a surge of orders. In February, Honeywell, the thermostat giant with about half of the market in the United States, sued Nest in a Federal District Court in Minnesota.
Honeywell alleges that the design and functions of Nest's thermometer, from its shape to set-up routines, borrow from other companies and, in particular, infringe on seven Honeywell patents.
In its lengthy reply on Thursday, Nest asserts that not only is the start-up not infringing, but that Honeywell's patents are toothless. Clearly, the Nest legal strategy is to try to invalidate the Honeywell patents.
''Honeywell's patents in this case are no good,'' the Nest filing states. ''They are retreads -- already invented by others years before.''
In response to Nest's filing, Honeywell said in a statement Thursday morning that it ''stands by'' its claims of patent infringement, and added that its intellectual property is ''a prized business asset that we protect vigorously.''
The real test of a patent, it is said, comes not in the patent office but in court. That seems to be the likely path in the Honeywell-Nest conflict.
Mr. Lutton said the Honeywell case was a good initial project, but was not why he joined Nest. The real opportunity, he said, was to ''make a difference in building a truly great company,'' which is applying advanced technology to the big economic and social problems of energy and pollution.
Nest, he said, is an innovator, so ''the intellectual property strategy really matters.''
Mr. Lutton, 44, left Apple at the end of last year. He had guided Apple's patent policy for a decade, through the iPod, iPhone and iPad. In 2001, when he began, Apple was filing about 50 patents a year. The current pace is more than 1,000 a year, he said.
His Apple years were a great experience, he said, but he had started to ''feel like it was time for my next act.''
Nest's chief executive, Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who led the design teams on the iPod and iPhone, was a longtime colleague. Mr. Fadell got in touch with Mr. Lutton and introduced him to Nest, its vision and its team. Mr. Lutton has been an adviser to Nest since the start of the year.
The Honeywell suit has apparently not yet had any impact on Nest's business. The start-up is just catching up with back orders and continues to ramp up production at its contract manufacturers. ''We're doing great, busting through our numbers,'' Mr. Fadell said, though the young company has not disclosed sales figures.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 'We're Not Really Bad Kids'

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

 BODY:
HUNTINGDON, Tenn. -- The Carroll Academy girls basketball team had just lost by 59 points to Dresden High School, the top team in the conference. Still, Tonya Lutz, Carroll Academy's coach, lauded her team's effort. Randy Hatch, Carroll Academy's day-to-day director and founder of the basketball program, reached into a pocket and slipped $20 to one of the girls, as he usually does after games.
Together, amid giggles, the nine girls on the team bounced to the snack stand in a single-file line. Patrick Steele, the school's straight-faced security director, followed them. Over the years, Steele has overheard taunts, even racial slurs, directed at Carroll Academy students, boys and girls, from opposing fans. He escorts the players wherever they go -- from the bus to the gym, to the locker rooms and bathrooms, and back to the bus.
The girls returned to the empty bleachers on the visitors' side of the gym, munching on candy and popcorn. They settled in to watch the boys teams play, the second half of the usual girls-boys doubleheader. 
It might be their favorite time of the day. The pressures of their lives melt away amid gossip and sugar.
But first it was Dresden's Senior Night. One by one, every Dresden senior winter-season athlete was introduced to an admiring crowd. Each carried a bouquet of flowers across the court, handed it to beaming parents and received hugs and kisses.
The Carroll Academy girls watched. Destiny broke the mood by pretending to cry.
''Miss Tonya, can we have parents' night, too?'' she asked with a mocking tone. A couple of girls giggled.
''We could do a Senior Night,'' Hatch whispered. ''I could get the sheriff to go round up all their parents.''
Poverty, Drugs, Crime, Hope
That morning, sunlight peeked over the trees and mist loitered over the low spots of winter's dormant cotton fields. The fleet of 10 white Ford vans, driven by Carroll Academy teachers and staff members, pulled out of the parking lot. They splintered across the countryside, through five counties of rural West Tennessee.
This swath of empty landscape is sprinkled with decaying towns. Some carry incongruent names borrowed from Europe -- Paris, Milan, Dresden. Huntingdon, the Carroll County seat, is centered by a stately courthouse in the middle of a picturesque square.
Most of the manufacturing jobs that attracted past generations have dried up. The H.I.S. factory that made Chic jeans and other apparel in nearby Bruceton, employing 2,000 or more for decades, closed more than 10 years ago. Hatch's parents worked at a long-gone shirt factory -- his mother as a seamstress, his father as a sewing-machine mechanic.
Now, double-digit unemployment feels normal. Tennessee's population grew more than 10 percent in the past decade, but it is stagnant in this area. Median household incomes linger in the $30,000 range. About 15 percent of adults have a college degree.
Drug use is rampant, across generations. Tennessee had more methamphetamine-lab seizures in 2010 than any other state, according to the Tennessee Methamphetamine Task Force. Carroll County, with 18 seizures in a population of about 28,000, had about twice as many per capita as the rest of the state.
Prescription-drug abuse is particularly acute in Tennessee. The state perennially has among the highest number of prescriptions per capita in the country. It has the sixth-highest percentage of youth, ages 12 to 17, abusing prescription pain medications, according to the Tennessee Department of Health.
It was across this quiet, complex setting that the Carroll Academy vans meandered. They picked up students, some an hour away, and returned past the scrubby trailers along two-lane roads and the tidy brick homes along High Street, to the school's truck-dock entrance.
The school is a single-story wing of a former hospital. The sign outside reads: ''Carroll Academy. Home of the Jaguars. A State-Licensed Facility for Grades 6-12 Operated by the Carroll County Juvenile Court.''
Most students stay at Carroll Academy for at least six months. Enrollment wavers from about 70 to 100, depending on that week's court docket. The vans drop off up to 14 students at a time. In single-file silence, they slip into a side entrance.
Students are inspected in the school's hallway. There is a dress code: black pants and white, button-down shirts. Boys and girls open their mouths to show there is nothing hidden there. They pull their pants pockets inside-out, lift their cuffs to show shoes and socks.
Rules are strict. No ballpoint pens, because drugs could be stashed inside. No sagging pants, or else a humiliating belt will be fashioned with duct tape. No piercings, jewelry, hats, makeup, cellphones, food. Short hair for boys, ponytails for girls.
Twenty years ago, Judge Larry Logan of Carroll County Juvenile Court was frustrated that he had only two choices for disciplining teenagers. He could put them on probation and hope that was enough to scare them -- and their parents -- straight. Or he could place them in state custody, which means foster care or reform school.
''I hate to send kids to reform school,'' Logan said. ''That kind of means I've given up on them.''
He helped develop a middle road: Carroll Academy. It was initially financed with a $1.45 million grant from Tennessee's Department of Children's Services, although its budget has since been carved to about half that.
About half of the students come through Logan's courtroom in Huntingdon. The rest come from courts in adjoining counties. About 80 percent are boys. All report to probation officers. The goal is to shepherd students through a hierarchy of levels, through good behavior and good grades, and back to their ''regular school,'' as the teenagers call it, in as little as six months.
Carroll Academy students fall into two fairly equal-size camps: those enrolled because they were ''delinquent'' and those categorized as ''unruly.''
The delinquent category includes crimes. A recent snapshot showed that 15 students had taken drugs to school, an offense that gets them kicked out -- and often sent to Carroll Academy -- for a year. Seven students had committed assault, and six were there for vandalism.
The unruly category refers to transgressions specific to minors. Most involve truancy. Seven other students were cited for uncontrollable behavior at home. Three were runaways.
''We're not really bad kids,'' said Leslee, a bright ninth grader who consumed a handful of her stepmother's Xanax and took the rest to school, a tangled episode that landed her and five others at Carroll Academy. ''We're just good kids who made bad decisions.''
Hatch, a county probation officer, was chosen to oversee the school when it opened in 1994. He started basketball teams in 1998. A year later, Carroll Academy was admitted as the smallest member of the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association and joined a conference that includes the area public high schools.
There are always plenty of Carroll Academy boys to play, and the team wins a few games. The girls are different. There may be only 10 or 15 of them enrolled at any time. Unless they have a compelling reason -- a medical issue, for example -- the school assigns the girls to the basketball team. Middle school girls play, too, an exception made for Carroll Academy.
The idea is that structure, adult role models and a way to occupy their after-school hours are good for them. Somewhat unwittingly, the players also become ambassadors to a world that usually sneers at troubled youth.
Before Carroll Academy's first basketball game in 1998, the father of an opposing player stepped out of the stands, grabbed Hatch's arm and asked that the Carroll Academy girls not hurt his daughter.
''Sports were the best thing for us,'' Hatch said. ''For four years, people didn't know what we were doing here. Then we got sports, and people said, 'Oh, they're just like our kids.' ''
'You Didn't Quit'
Carroll Academy -- the Lady Jaguars -- arrived at Dresden and took the court for warm-ups. In their uniforms and sweatsuits, they looked like any other team. They did the three-man weave and layup drills. The starters were introduced, to polite applause, and they shook hands with the Dresden coaches, fist-bumped the officials and high-fived their teammates.
The Lady Jaguars trailed, 28-5, after the first quarter. They trailed by 47-11 at the half.
''Not bad,'' Lutz said during her halftime talk. ''Well, the score's awful.''
The girls sat attentively with their hands up, palms out. It's a rule Lutz imposed for all timeouts and while in the locker room to remind the girls to keep their hands up on defense.
She explained a backdoor screen to run. She told Constance to stay in arm's reach of her opponent. She told Summer to get air under her feet when she shoots.
The final score was 75-16. Lutz seemed pleased. Destiny threw up into a garbage can.
''Ya'll gave me effort,'' Lutz said. ''You didn't die on me. You didn't quit.''
At Dresden High, summers are filled with basketball camps. Conditioning classes are year-round. Players take basketball as a regularly scheduled class every day, along with math, science and history. It is a system designed for basketball success.
Dresden used to take school buses to away games. But so many parents trailed in their cars that Dresden cut the expense. The girls simply go with their moms and dads.
When it was time to leave, the Carroll Academy girls lined up. None of their parents were there. Steele escorted them out of the gym, past the snack stand and out into the cool night. The youngest players loaded equipment in the back of the school van, and everyone climbed in through the side door.
Lutz turned down a two-lane road, popped in an Usher CD and turned the volume knob clockwise. Through the dark, teenage girls sang and shimmied as the day's last van made its way back to Carroll Academy.
THE LADY JAGUARS: Part 2: Carroll Academy is a day school in Huntingdon, Tenn., operated by the Carroll County Juvenile Court and financed mostly by the state's Department of Children's Services. The region is beset by high unemployment, rampant prescription drug abuse and the proliferation of methamphetamine labs. The Carroll County Juvenile Court judge, who has authority over the school, and Carroll Academy's director gave The New York Times unrestricted access to explore the school through its girls basketball team, whose players have little experience with organized sports and myriad troubles outside of school. For this five-part series, The Times spoke with the girls, many of their parents and relatives, school administrators and coaches.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Cutting Welfare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Welfare Limits Left Poor Adrift as Recession Hit'' (front page, April 8) clearly points out the consequences for state governments of denying support to needy families -- encouraging them, in effect, to engage in various criminal acts to support themselves.
In addition, needy families abandoned by the states come to view government as their enemy rather than as their protector, thereby further eroding a commitment to civic virtue.
An adequate cost-benefit analysis should include these kinds of losses against reduced state budgets.

HEADLINE: Opening Up a Path To Four-Year Degrees

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- At the end of his first year at the Community College of Philadelphia, Christopher Thomas decided that his goal -- to go back to school and get a degree -- was no longer worth it. He was in debt from thousands of dollars in student loans. After class, he rode a bus an hour and a half to a suburban restaurant where he worked as a waiter. When the shift ended at midnight, it took him three buses to get home. He couldn't afford a computer, so in the middle of the night, he walked to his aunt's house and used hers to finish his class work.
He got seven A's and a C, but the plan was for eight. 
Mr. Thomas was 36, living in a spare bedroom at his grandmother's house and doing much of his sleeping on the Route 124 bus. ''I'm done,'' he told friends.
But he wasn't. A woman in the college's Institutional Advancement department, Patricia Conroy, kept sending e-mails about a $2,000 scholarship. ''WHY DON'T YOU APPLY FOR THIS,'' she wrote. He won one. Professors spoke about his promise. Friends said it would be a crime.
''My dream of a 4.0 was gone,'' he said. ''I figured what it would take for a 3.9. If I aced out, I still might not make it, but a 3.89 was possible.''
Actually, he finished with a 3.91. This fall he will enter the University of Pennsylvania.
Increasingly, the students here are making that jump. Dawn-Stacy Joyner, a former hospital cook, will also attend the University of Pennsylvania. Nine women graduating this spring have been accepted to Bryn Mawr. Larry Thi, who hopes to become a teacher, transferred to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
''There's been a major acceleration the last few years,'' said Rod Risley, executive director of Phi Theta Kappa, the community college honor society.
It's partly the economic collapse. The Community College of Philadelphia costs $4,400 a year for city residents; the most expensive private colleges are $60,000. Getting an associate degree first can save $100,000.
''These students are choosing community colleges with the intention that this is their path to selective institutions,'' Mr. Risley said.
He had no trouble providing names. Casey Maliszewski went from Raritan Valley Community College in New Jersey to Mount Holyoke, and she is now a graduate student at Columbia. Tamer Shabani also went to Raritan and is at Stanford. Mark Svensson transferred from Rockland Community College to Georgetown.
Indeed, one of my own sons graduated from our local community college and in January entered New York University as a junior.
For elite schools, community colleges offer racial and economic diversity; the college here is 55 percent black. ''Colleges are looking for high completion levels, and the best community college students complete,'' Mr. Risley said.
Since 2005, the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation has given 400 scholarships of up to $30,000 a year to outstanding community college students to continue their studies. Those students have gone on to average a 3.5 G.P.A. and a 90 percent completion rate, according to Emily Froimson, a spokeswoman.
The foundation also gives up to $1 million to four-year institutions to recruit community college graduates. Among the colleges and universities that have been chosen are the University of Michigan; Cornell; Amherst; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of North Carolina; and Bryn Mawr.
Most of the nine here who have been accepted by Bryn Mawr have had their struggles. Taj Meyer had an eating disorder and did not make it through high school. Neither did Adrienne Baugher, who battled addiction. Remi Demarest left home as a girl and was raised by an aunt and uncle. Meg Booth is a single mother.
They range in age from Mary Chessen, 21, who transferred from the Art Institute of Chicago, to Kimberly Stuart, who is 38 and was working as a film grip when she started here in 2007.
Lija Geller flunked out of Temple and was embarrassed to be going here. ''I'd get off the subway at Spring Garden,'' she said. ''The Temple kids stay on to the Cecil B. Moore stop. It felt like they knew I went to community college.''
Ms. Booth and Ms. Baugher have supported themselves by working as waitresses; Ms. Geller spent a year and a half as a dog walker; Ms. Demarest was a receptionist at a nail salon. ''I wanted a second chance,'' she said, ''which is what a community college gives you.''
Bryn Mawr had not occurred to them. ''Not even in my realm of thought,'' said Ms. Baugher, who will major in biology.
In the two decades after graduating from Central High School in Philadelphia, Mr. Thomas worked a series of clerical and administrative jobs.
Starting college at 36, he was hungry for knowledge. He was always a big reader -- Shakespeare, John Steinbeck, Richard N. Wright, Ralph W. Ellison. But not until he took an African-American studies course did he understand how little he knew of Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, James Weldon Johnson. ''I was ashamed when I realized,'' he said.
People have told him that majoring in education would be a waste of an Ivy League degree, but his goal is to return to Central High and teach American history.
It was his developmental psychology professor, Vince Castronuovo, who first put the idea of the University of Pennsylvania in his head. ''He told me it's the place for a guy like you.''
Mr. Thomas was in one of the college's computer centers on March 27 when he got the e-mail saying he had been accepted.
He has been chosen to deliver a speech at his graduation next month, and he recently finished a first draft. A lot of it will be about what determination and the right support can do for a person.
For weeks he has been looking for a part-time job, even for minimum wage. Last week he interviewed at an ice cream shop, but he has not heard anything yet.
He still doesn't own a computer, but he thinks he'll be getting one for graduation. It's supposed to be a surprise, but his aunt let it slip that she didn't know how anyone could make it through college without one.

HEADLINE: For Most, Choice of Stay-at-Home Motherhood Is Far From a Luxury

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Theo Emery contributed reporting from Washington, Dan Frosch from Denver, and Ian Lovett from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
The layoff notice was not a complete surprise. At the shipping center in Denver where Jeanine Maez filled mail orders, the trend had been toward paperless transactions.
But how Mrs. Maez reacted to being unemployed in 2004 was a revelation, even to herself: she decided not to look for a new job in favor of staying home full time with her five children, the youngest of whom, a son, is 11.
''The years of 'winging it' with my husband in terms of taking care of the kids had been too hard, and I was tired,'' she said. ''And my youngest son, who is autistic, needed his mama.'' 
To make ends meet, Mrs. Maez, 44, sold her car, paid off her credit card debt and disciplined herself to spend more modestly on clothes and household goods. Her husband, a private investigator, took a second job selling insurance. ''Whatever it takes to make a buck,'' she said. ''My sweet honey struggles a lot to make it work for us.''
In multiple ways, Mrs. Maez is the face of stay-at-home motherhood in America, where 65 percent of married women who stay home with children under 18 years old live in households that earn less than $75,000 a year, according to the most recent data from the United States Census Bureau.
The political storm over stay-at-home mothers took off last week when the Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen said Ann Romney, the wife of the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, ''never worked a day in her life,'' and it raises the question of just who is the modern stay-at-home mom.
Stay-at-home mothers are younger, less educated and more likely to be Hispanic than they were in previous generations, and perhaps have a more traditional view of family and more limited job skills than other women these days, according to a Census Bureau report that analyzed changes in stay-at-home motherhood from 1969 to 2009. Eighteen percent of stay-at-home mothers lack a high school degree, compared with 7 percent of women in the work force. And black women were about half as likely as white women to be stay-at-home mothers.
Across the country, 70 percent of married women over the age of 25 with children work outside the home. The median income of those households is about $87,700, compared with $64,000 for households where the mother stays at home, according to an analysis by Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College of the City University of New York. ''The biggest difference is education,'' he said.
According to the Census Bureau's 40-year review, ''Those with the least education are now the most likely to stay out of the labor force as stay-at-home mothers.''
Mrs. Maez, who holds an associate degree and is of Hispanic origin, said she regretted that she had been unable to find a profession that would have let her work from home. ''I wish I had more education,'' she said. ''I think that would have made a difference.''
Mrs. Maez cares for her grandson, Angelo, 5, so that her daughter Diana Maez can work. ''I know that she would love to be home with the baby if she could,'' Mrs. Maez said. Diana Maez confirmed that in a separate interview, although she said she liked the self-esteem boost from earning a paycheck as a security guard. ''I'm very fortunate to have my mother to watch my son,'' she said. ''If I had to afford day care, well, I don't know how I could really do that.''
Keaton Koechli, 34, said she had decided to stay home to raise her child after losing her job at a fitness company.
''I got laid off from my job due to budgetary concerns. Then I got pregnant,'' said Ms. Koechli, a great-granddaughter of the silent-film star Buster Keaton. ''I went onto unemployment and had to make a decision about whether I was going to try to find a job and then have to take a maternity leave.''
After looking into day care in Westside Los Angeles, she said, she realized that she would have needed to find a job paying more than she had been making before, and she decided to stay home.
''You have to have a significant income to even afford a good day care,'' she said.
Another issue that Ms. Koechli said was important to her as a mother was maternity leave, which in California is three months. Her husband, she said, is from Canada, where mothers get a year of paid leave.
Natalie Tognetti, 32, who has a bachelor's degree in environmental science, was working as a paralegal full time for about two years before she became pregnant. Her husband is a lawyer for a software firm in Boulder, Colo., and his job has allowed her to stay at home with their three daughters, ages 4, 6 and 7.
Still, despite her husband's good job, Ms. Tognetti, who is pregnant, watches how she spends money on food and family activities, which she conceded she might not have to worry about if she worked.
She said she thought that Ms. Rosen had mistakenly conflated Mrs. Romney's economic status with her decision to stay at home with her children.
''The fact that she is a stay-at-home mom doesn't put her out of touch,'' Ms. Tognetti said. ''I think it's more of a class issue.''
Online Correction: April 15, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the relationship of Keaton Koechli to Buster Keaton. She is a great-granddaughter, not a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Geithner Scolds Romney Over Women and Jobs

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner joined the partisan sparring over women on Sunday, rejecting out of hand the Romney campaign's assertion that the burden of joblessness had fallen disproportionately on women.
Mr. Geithner, who appeared in recorded interviews on three Sunday morning programs to make the Obama administration's case that the economic recovery was gaining speed, was asked on ''This Week'' on ABC about the continued assertion by the presumed Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and his advisers that the vast majority of jobs lost under President Obama had been held by women.
''It's a ridiculous argument, ridiculous,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''It's been largely debunked this week by the people who have looked at it.'' 
Democratic advisers spent much of the past week pushing back on Mr. Romney's assertion that 92.3 percent of job losses since Mr. Obama took office have involved women - a claim that several independent fact-checking organizations have termed as technically correct but highly misleading.
Mr. Geithner noted that the last recession began under President George W. Bush, and that millions of men lost jobs in a first wave of layoffs that hit male-dominated sectors like construction and manufacturing.
A second and much smaller wave, roughly coinciding with Mr. Obama's arrival in office, has largely affected areas like education, where women dominate.
But the Romney campaign showed on Sunday that it was not ready to let up on the issue as it continued a vigorous effort to reduce Mr. Obama's sizable polling advantage among women.
Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney adviser, repeated the figure of 92.3 percent in an appearance on ''Fox News Sunday.'' When the moderator, Chris Wallace, suggested that fact-checking groups had deemed it ''a little bit of an accounting trick,'' Mr. Gillespie replied, ''Those independent fact-finders aren't very independent.'' Some, he said, are ''left-leaning organizations.''
One of the analyses came from the PolitiFact Web site. An editor's note on the site said that the Romney campaign had complained that PolitiFact's initial report relied partly on the views of two economists with ties to the Obama administration.
PolitiFact said that it then interviewed four other economists with no ties to either campaign and found ''no reason to change our ruling, which remains at 'mostly false.' ''
The Washington Post fact-checker gave the 92.3 percent assertion a rare rating of ''true but false''; The Associated Press called it ''dubious at best.''
In an e-mail on Sunday, Mr. Romney's press secretary, Andrea Saul, said that the data supported Mr. Romney's argument.
''No amount of spin by the Obama campaign can hide the enormous damage this president has done to American women,'' she wrote. ''If they move the starting point to the beginning of their so-called recovery, they will find women have benefited from less than one-eighth of the meager job creation. The president should stop making excuses for his failures.''
Mr. Geithner also assessed the broad economic outlook in his television appearances on Sunday, pointing to uncertainties in Europe, Iran and elsewhere that he said were holding back a more forceful recovery.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Camp, Sensing Shift, Bets on a Long Shot, Arizona

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- President Obama's re-election campaign is dispatching workers across Arizona's college campuses and Latino neighborhoods this spring, registering as many new voters as they can in an organized, three-month effort to determine whether they can put this unlikely state into play for Democrats this November.
By any measure the obstacles are considerable: Arizona has voted for precisely one Democratic president since Truman was in the White House. Yet Mr. Obama's aides said in interviews that they thought it was possible they could move the needle of history by winning in 2012 a state that analysts believe is heading Democratic in national elections, but may not be there yet.
Obama strategists are simply following the same techniques they used in 2008 when putting states like North Carolina and Indiana into play. Then, too, there was much initial skepticism, though both states ended up going for Mr. Obama. 
Yet for all those signs of organizing activity -- and the fact that demographic and political changes across the West have made this region increasingly tempting ground for Democrats --Mr. Obama's campaign strategists are not yet convinced he can win the state this November. Mr. Obama's aides said they closely monitored the organizing here and would assess the result of their work over the next few months to see whether it made sense to pour money and resources into Arizona this fall.
Should they succeed, they may well expand the playing map, no minor accomplishment, as some states that Mr. Obama won last time now seem at risk, including North Carolina and Indiana. Perhaps more significant, it would be powerful evidence of the political and demographic changes that seem to be moving slowly across Arizona, as it catches up with the rest of the West, where several states have been trending Democratic.
This is in no small part because of the increase in Latino populations and a series of legislative efforts aimed at immigration -- with the Republican governor and state Legislature of Arizona leading the way -- that polls suggest have created a backlash among many Latino voters.
''It is going to be a swing state,'' said Jim Messina, the president's campaign manager. ''The question is, whether we can get enough people registered to put it in play this year.''
''If you just close your eyes and look at the census numbers, look at the number of unregistered voters, look at how this is the only state in the country that didn't have a primary or a contested general in 2008, so there was no organizing,'' Mr. Messina said as he ticked off the factors that work in their favor. ''And look next door. Look at New Mexico, look at Colorado, look at California. All that stuff is going to come to Arizona. The question is, can we get it there in time? How expensive is it do it?''
It certainly will not be easy, as even Democrats here are quick to say. Bill Clinton is the only Democratic presidential candidate who has won Arizona state since Truman. Republicans enjoy an edge in party registration here; Democrats have lost some ground since 2008 and now trail, if slightly, Republican and independent voters.
Arizona is the home of Barry Goldwater, the godfather of the modern conservative movement. The Tea Party here is strong, and it helped to elect an overwhelmingly conservative state Legislature. It has a Republican governor and two Republican senators. The state has a significant population of Mormon voters, which could prove to the benefit to the likely Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, who is a Mormon.
''The Obama campaign thinks they are going to turn Arizona blue, but that's simply not going to happen,'' said Shane Wikfors, the communications director of the Arizona Republican Party. ''If they want to spend money here in Arizona, good, let them. It will take money away from other places where they could spend money.''
Of course, whatever political or demographic shifts may be going on over the long term, the Obama campaign right now could be trying to do little more than fake Republicans into wasting time and money here, though members of both parties here said that did not appear to be the case.
Evidence of this effort can be seen in communities across the state. A clipboard in her hand and an Obama 2012 button on her shirt, Jessica Ehinger walked along the commons at Phoenix College on a hot Thursday morning, calling out to students heading for class. ''Are you registered to vote?'' she asked. She is one of a handful of volunteers who are making trips to this campus every Thursday -- morning and afternoon.
Obama volunteers are making weekly registration trips to campuses across the state, as well as to supermarkets, libraries and community centers in Latino neighborhoods in Phoenix, Glendale, Guadalupe, Yuma, Mesa and Tucson. There are now four campaign offices in the state and a fifth is about to open in Glendale. Paid Obama staff members moved here nearly a year ago.
It is not hard to understand why the Obama campaign, which has a history of challenging established political wisdom, might be tempted to throw some resources here.
College students in Arizona are legally entitled to residency, and thus are able to vote, after living here for 30 days. The Latino population has nearly doubled over the past 10 years -- it now makes up 30 percent of the overall population, and about 19 percent of the voting age population -- though Democrats have long been frustrated over their lack of success at registering Latino voters and getting them to the polls. The announcement by Richard Carmona, a former United States surgeon general, who is Latino, that he would run as a Democrat for an open Senate seat here has stirred hopes that his presence could pump up Latino participation this fall.
''The Latino community is not going to come on its own,'' said Ruben Gallego, a Democratic state representative from Phoenix. He praised what he described as the far-reaching efforts of the Obama campaign with Latino voters, saying, ''You have got to get the right people to run the campaigns to get them to turn out.''
Mr. Obama lost to John McCain in 2008 by nine points, a not particularly large number, considering that Mr. McCain is from Arizona. Mr. McCain drew 41 percent of the Latino vote, a number that even Republicans here say the party's presidential candidate is unlikely to match.
''Obama might have won Arizona in '08, if it wasn't for the favorite son, McCain,'' said Patrick J. Kenney, director of the School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University. ''I'm just saying that it could be in play. Obama didn't compete here in '08 and John Kerry didn't compete here in '04. So we don't really have a good model of anything really competitive.''
Bruce Merrill, an Arizona pollster and political analyst, said he continued to think this was an uphill fight for the Obama campaign, but far from impossible.
''The Obama people think it's in play: I still think it's a long shot,'' he said. ''But the emerging Carmona candidacy has some potential to mobilize Hispanics more than they have been in the past. The higher the turnout, the more it helps Democrats, particularly in Arizona.
''The Democratic Party is better organized this year,'' he said. ''The party organization and structure here appears to have been significantly upgraded.''
A critical obstacle for Mr. Obama is the economy, which continues to struggle here, and which Republicans argue will hurt him with all groups of voters. ''The fact that Arizona is suffering through with a tough economy, that's not boding well with independent voters,'' Mr. Wikfors said.
The unemployment rate in February was 8.7 percent. That is higher than the 7.6 percent rate in November 2008, but 2 percentage points down from when it broke double-digits in 2010.
The volunteers already turning out for Mr. Obama seem serious. They gathered the other morning in a mostly empty office in central Phoenix for an organizing session and watched a video feature on the woman who provided Mr. Obama the ''fired up, ready to go chant'' on the Obama for President Web Site.
''So are you fired up?'' Ms. Ehinger inquired as the group headed out to Phoenix College.
Mr. Messina said he would make a final decision about Arizona by summer. ''I have no rose-colored glasses on,'' he said. ''I understand how difficult this is. The last time, people said there was no way we could do North Carolina and Virginia. And here we are.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Lawmakers And Romney Face A Delicate Tango

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If Mitt Romney is considering a quick pivot to the center as he heads into the general election, he will find an imposing impediment: fellow Republicans in the House.
As Congress was set to reconvene on Monday, House Republicans said Mr. Romney could go his own way on smaller issues that may help define him as separate from his Congressional Republican counterparts. But, they said, he must understand that they are driving the policy agenda for the party now.
''We're not a cheerleading squad,'' said Representative Jeff Landry, an outspoken freshman from Louisiana. ''We're the conductor. We're supposed to drive the train.''
With Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, Republicans have already set the agenda on the key issue that divides the two parties in an age of austerity: how to manage the federal budget and its related entitlement programs. Mr. Romney has eagerly embraced it, campaigning with Mr. Ryan by his side and calling him ''bold and brilliant.'' 
But a disagreement between the parties over spending levels has paved a path for the sort of clash that led to the near shutdown of the government last year, and it could leave Mr. Romney in the position of having to choose between a loud public battle and a budget compromise with Democrats in the closing weeks of the fall campaign.
Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, and House Republicans diverge on some legislative issues -- notably what to do about Chinese currency manipulation, an issue that has become a centerpiece of the Romney campaign. And that could further highlight the differences within the Republican Party.
In 1999, as House Republicans grappled with far more modest spending cuts, George W. Bush was able to underscore his claim to ''compassionate conservatism'' by denouncing House efforts. ''I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs of the poor,'' he said
Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a Republican House leader at the time, recalled that as a ''defining moment'' for the Bush campaign -- one that blindsided Republicans. As Mr. Romney's designated liaison to Congressional Republicans, Mr. Blunt said that one of his jobs was to make sure no one is surprised like that again.
In the past two weeks, he has set up meetings between Mr. Romney's policy shop and key representatives and staff. They included a meeting between Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, as well as one between the Romney staff and the Republican Study Committee, a group of the most conservative House members.
''There will be issues where the governor needs to steer his own course, no doubt about that,'' Mr. Blunt said. ''My biggest interest is that they have all the information they need to have.''
Congress returns this week after a two-week recess, the first time it will convene since Mr. Romney emerged as the presumed nominee. Both chambers are expected to move quickly to take up a variety of fiscal measures, with the Republican-controlled House voting on small-business tax cuts and beginning planning sessions on a tax overhaul. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, will bring to the floor the so-called Buffett Rule, which would raise the minimum effective tax rate for the wealthy.
Undoubtedly, House Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, will move mountains to make sure House Republicans and the Romney campaign speak and act in lockstep toward the greater goal of defeating President Obama in November and retaining the House. At the same time, Mr. Obama has shown a desire to take advantage of the public's low regard for Congress by likening Mr. Romney's agenda to that of House Republicans.
But Mr. Romney may learn the lesson that has been imparted to Mr. Boehner throughout the 112th Congress -- that the most conservative members will steer their own course, and loudly.
Freshmen as well as veteran members of the Republican Study Committee, led by Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, have shown no hesitation to buck the leadership. And Mr. Romney has even less leverage with them.
Still, party leaders insist that House Republicans and Mr. Romney are united on issues that matter most. ''On the big issues -- spending, taxes, what we do with the deficit -- I just don't see much difference,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the Republican leadership, ''and more importantly, I don't see an escape.''
Indeed, most Congressional Republicans feel certain that the key issues of the campaign will be employment, the economy, the budget deficit and the health care law, matters in which there is little light between Mr. Romney and most Republicans.
''We have led and will continue to lead,'' Representative Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania said of House Republicans.
''Now I believe Governor Romney will have his own ideas and will use his own experience to form his message,'' said Mr. Barletta, who supported Rick Santorum. ''But we all do agree that President Obama's policies have failed, and we will all rally around that.''
But that budget plan leaves little room for Mr. Romney to stray on any proposal that could cost additional money. Both Mr. Romney and House Republicans plan to increase spending on defense, and both have promised to cut tax rates and slash the deficit.
That means sharp cuts to domestic spending. The Ryan plan would cut domestic programs under Congress's discretion, including education, law enforcement and health research -- by 25 percent over 10 years compared with spending if programs were allowed to grow with inflation, or 21 percent below spending caps agreed to in July by Mr. Obama and Congress.
Having taken that politically risky course, Republicans are going to make sure their nominee does not leave them hanging.
''If there was to be a difference of opinion on this, then I think I would make my feelings known,'' said Representative Tim Griffin, Mr. Romney's Arkansas campaign chairman. ''I would say, 'Wait, what are you doing?' If he says something I disagree with, that's his right, but I am going to say I disagree.''
A campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said in a statement: ''Mitt Romney is in this race to turn the economy around and get Americans back to work, and he will need the help of Congress to do that. Governor Romney will welcome the help of Congress to enact his agenda and get the country back on track.''
But disagreements have already begun to develop. On Wednesday, the Romney camp said the candidate had no problem with a Democratic law making it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases -- though House Republicans had denounced it as a trial lawyers' bonanza.
Mr. Romney said one of his priorities as president would be to deal with China's currency manipulation in a manner similar to the one outlined in a bill written by Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, co-sponsored by Senator Lindsey E. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and passed by the Senate last year.
However, House leaders have no intention of bringing that bill -- which would order the Commerce Department to impose tough tariffs on certain Chinese goods, to the floor this year -- and Mr. Boehner has referred to the measure as ''dangerous.''

HEADLINE: North Korean Leader Stresses Need for Strong Military

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- In his first speech in public since assuming the leadership of North Korea, Kim Jong-un said Sunday that his ''first, second and third'' priorities were to strengthen the military, and he declared that superiority in military technology was ''no longer monopolized by imperialists.''
Mr. Kim's speech was followed by what South Korean officials said was the North's biggest display of weapons in a military parade, including a missile the North appeared to be presenting for the first time. While it is not clear whether it was a new long-range missile or a mock-up, its display demonstrates the importance that the North Korean government places on weapons development despite an embarrassing failure of a rocket it launched last week.
South Korean officials would not comment on the North Korean missile, pending further examination. 
Mr. Kim's claim to superior military technology could sound poignant, coming two days after the North Korean rocket carrying a satellite disintegrated in midair. The failure of the rocket indicated that North Korea might still have a long way to go before mastering the technology to deliver warheads atop an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Mr. Kim's speech on the 100th birthday of Kim Il-sung, his grandfather and the North's founding president, was his public political debut. In an unexpected 20-minute speech, broadcast live inside North Korea, Mr. Kim demonstrated a new leadership style but reaffirmed his adherence to the ''military first'' policy of his father, Kim Jong-il, which has left North Korea locked in a prolonged confrontation with the United States and its allies.
His speech was a major departure from the practices of his reclusive father, who cloaked his brutal rule in mystery and who never gave a speech to the general public before his death in December. North Koreans did not even hear Kim Jong-il's voice until a broadcast in 1992, when he shouted one sentence into the microphone while inspecting a military parade: ''Glory to the heroic soldiers of the People's Army.''
On Sunday, facing tens of thousands gathered in a plaza in the capital, Pyongyang, Mr. Kim did not mention the rocket failure. Instead, he exhorted his people to appreciate the achievements of his father and grandfather, crediting them with developing nuclear weapons as a deterrent against American invasion.
''The days are gone forever when our enemies could blackmail us with nuclear bombs,'' he said.
Mr. Kim has been seen but not heard by the public since taking over after his father's death. A thunderous cheer erupted when he appeared on the podium, waving a hand at the crowd gathered beneath in neat rows for the meticulously choreographed festivities. Thousands of balloons were released.
An emotional North Korean television broadcaster marveled at how the young leader had ''the look and voice'' of his charismatic grandfather, who is much revered in the North. Reading a prepared text, Mr. Kim spoke in a calm, measured and somewhat husky voice, occasionally looking up from the text to squint at the crowd under the sun.
The only gesture he made was when he raised a finger to emphasize the last sentence of his speech: ''Let's go on for our final victory.''
Analysts said that Mr. Kim's physical resemblance to his grandfather, his gregariousness in the public eye -- easily mixing with soldiers, workers and aging generals -- and even his willingness to address the nation on state television were carefully cultivated assets for a leader in his late 20s hoping to give his government a more youthful appeal. (The portraits of Marx and Lenin that once adorned prominent buildings in Pyongyang were taken down ahead of the Sunday celebrations, The Associated Press reported from the North Korean capital.)
Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute, a private research institute in South Korea, said Mr. Kim's performance reminded North Koreans of Kim Il-sung, who as a young leader used to meet citizens and give public speeches. ''Kim Jong-il inspired awe and dread among his people and was never a leader friendly with the public,'' Mr. Cheong said. ''Like his grandfather, however, Kim Jong-un has so far tried to look more willing to communicate with his people. We may see him speak in public more often.''
Sunday's speech and parade were the culmination of weeks of festivities intended to infuse the North Koreans with pride that their country, as its propagandists put it, has become a military power despite decades of economic hardship.
''Yesterday, we were a weak and small country trampled upon by big powers,'' Mr. Kim said. ''Today, our geopolitical location remains the same, but we are transformed into a proud political and military power and an independent people that no one can dare provoke.''
He said he was determined to make sure that his people ''will never have to tighten their belt again.'' Yet he did not offer concrete economic programs, other than a vague reference to the need for an ''industrial revolution.'' Neither did he mention that his rocket launching had led to the cancellation of badly needed American food aid.
The United States and its allies have called for censuring North Korea at the United Nations Security Council. But China appealed for all sides to ''remain calm and exercise restraint'' on Sunday after its foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, talked with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the South Korean foreign minister, Kim Sung-hwan, in separate telephone conversations.
Some analysts say that the insecurity created by the rocket failure may push Kim Jong-un to rely more heavily on the military and attempt an even more provocative nuclear test in an effort to be taken seriously. The Korean People's Army, with about 1.1 million troops, has become the backbone of political power under Kim Jong-il's ''military first'' policy.
Kim Jong-un ''is not secure enough'' to endorse a possible demand from moderates in his government for policy shifts after the rocket debacle, said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies. ''He still relies on his dead father's authority to justify his rule.''
Hours after the failure of the rocket marred his ascension to North Korea's highest posts, Mr. Kim promoted 70 officers to the rank of general, the North's main ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, reported Saturday.
Mr. Kim ordered the promotions as one of his first actions after becoming chairman of the National Defense Commission. The post was the last of the top military, party and state titles he has inherited from his father.

HEADLINE: Americas Meeting Ends With Discord Over Cuba

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
CARTAGENA, Colombia -- A summit meeting of Western Hemisphere nations ended without a final statement of consensus on Sunday, after the United States and some Latin American nations remained sharply divided over whether to continue excluding Cuba from such gatherings.
President Obama and President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, the host, each proclaimed the Summit of the Americas a success at a joint news conference afterward, though the gathering yielded no major achievement. The meeting, the first since 2009, served mostly as a forum for leaders from more than 30 nations to air their positions on energy, trade and drug trafficking. 
Mr. Obama and Mr. Santos each lauded their nations' separate accord over labor rights in Colombia, which cleared the way for Mr. Obama to allow the free trade agreement that the two nations concluded last year to take effect on May 15.
The developments made for a decidedly mixed result for Mr. Obama this weekend. By refusing to sign a statement that would have called for the next summit meeting to include Cuba, Mr. Obama avoided antagonizing some Cuban-American voters in Florida, a crucial battleground state in this year's presidential election. But he angered his political allies among American union leaders and liberal groups, who had urged him not to certify that Colombia had met its obligations on labor rights. They cited continued human rights violations and even killings of union organizers in Colombia.
''We regret that the administration has placed commercial interests above the interests of workers and their trade unions,'' Richard S. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said in a statement.
For the American side, the entire summit meeting was clouded by an episode involving a group of Secret Service agents and officers. They were sent back to the United States on the eve of the meeting for investigation of misconduct allegedly involving prostitutes. Mr. Obama, while praising the Secret Service generally, said on Sunday that he expected a ''rigorous'' investigation. He said, ''of course I'll be angry'' if the allegations proved true.
''We're representing the people of the United States,'' he said.
Representative Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, who led a Congressional delegation on the sidelines here, said that the episode was an unwelcome distraction. ''We're trying to have a dialogue about big, important issues,'' Mr. Mack said, ''and those activities are very shameful, and unfortunately have become a big part of the buzz around the summit.''
The issue of Cuba's exclusion from events like the Summit of the Americas gathering has been a perennially divisive one, and increasingly so lately, more than 50 years after the United States imposed its embargo of the island nation after the military takeover by Fidel Castro in 1959. While the push to include Cuba was led by leftist governments in the region, including Venezuela and Bolivia, Mr. Santos also joined in the effort, calling the American position a cold war anachronism.
Mr. Obama himself alluded on Saturday to unspecified regional issues that seemed ''caught in a time warp,'' but at the news conference on Sunday he defended the United States's stance on Cuba, which had support from Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada.
''Cuba, unlike the other countries that are participating, has not yet moved to democracy,'' Mr. Obama said. And referring generally to other Latin American countries' success in overcoming dictatorship and oppression in favor of democracy, Mr. Obama asked ''why we would ignore that same principle here.''
Mr. Obama denied acting out of electoral concern over Florida, saying that his position on Cuba had been consistent through his political career. He cited steps that his administration had taken to broaden relations between the American and Cuban people, including allowing Cuban-Americans to send money more freely to relatives in Cuba and to travel there more easily.
The leftist leaders of Ecuador and Nicaragua stayed away from the meeting, at least partly because of the Cuba issue, which also blocked agreement on a consensus statement at the last Summit of the Americas in 2009. Another obstacle this time was Argentina's unsuccessful demand for language in it that would support its claim of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, a British dependency in the South Atlantic that Argentina calls the Malvinas. In that dispute, which boiled over into a war between Argentina and Britain in 1982, Mr. Obama said the United States remains neutral.
Before his news conference with Mr. Obama, Mr. Santos told reporters, ''The fact there is no declaration is not a failure -- just the opposite.'' He said that ''the fact that these topics were discussed is a success,'' and added, ''Hopefully within three years we will have Cuba as part of the summit.''
With the backing of several other Latin American leaders, Mr. Santos gave prominence on the summit agenda to a discussion of whether the longtime, United States-led ''war on drugs'' ought to be replaced with some potentially more effective strategy, perhaps even decriminalization.
The leaders agreed to direct the Organization of American States to name a group of experts to study the issue. President Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, who favors legalization, said in an e-mail message after the summit that drug use and trafficking was the only topic the leaders discussed at their final closed-door meeting on Sunday. In the discussion, he said, Mr. Obama reiterated his opposition to decriminalization.
''It is a very positive outcome, in the sense that we have to explore what else we can do to find new avenues'' to combat the drug trade, Mr. Perez said.
The attention paid in the American and Latin American media to the drug debate tended to obscure another message that Mr. Santos was eager to convey as host of the summit meeting: Colombia's progress on economic and security issues. ''It was never intended for this issue to be 'the' issue of the summit,'' he said at the news conference, referring to illegal drugs.
Still, Mr. Obama said, ''It is wholly appropriate for us to discuss this issue,'' and he called the exchanges ''good and useful.''
Despite the less-than-showy results, Mr. Obama's decision to spend nearly three days here, in a city that was a major slave-trading port during Spain's colonial rule, was a subject of favorable comment in the Colombian news media. A local reporter, in a question to Mr. Obama, noted that he was the first American president to spend this much time in Colombia.

HEADLINE: The Sweet Spot

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
THE other day Rick Santorum, with rigor mortis setting into his campaign, stepped up to a microphone in Mars, Pa. (Yes, really.) His complaint was a familiar one: For too long the Republican ''aristocracy'' has shoved moderate nominees down the throats of the voters. ''There's one person,'' he declared, referring to Ronald Reagan, ''who understood we don't win by moving to the middle. We win by getting people in the middle to move to us.''
Clearly that strategy didn't work for Santorum. He stuck to his rightist fundamentalism, he was true to who he is, and the Republican middle remained unmoved. Yet many activists in both parties cling, like Santorum, to the hope that they can win from a position of impassioned orthodoxy. And like Santorum, they are usually wrong. Even Reagan moved to the middle from time to time. 
Centrism is easily mocked and not much fun to defend. Many on the left who find Santorum's politics repellent would agree with him that moving to the middle is intellectually uninspiring and morally unsatisfying. Even if you are not someone who thrills to the trumpets of moral clarity or regards ''uncompromising'' as the highest praise, you can see where they're coming from. The politics of the center -- including the professional centrists and trans-partisans of groups like Third Way and Americans Elect -- do not quicken the pulse. White bread, elevator music, No Labels, meh.
The middle matters, though, even if in these hyperpolarized times it doesn't get much respect. It has been a truism of modern politics, at least since ''The Real Majority'' was published in 1970, that elections are usually decided by voters who are not wedded to either party, who don't stay in any ideological lane. These voters are thought to constitute roughly 15 percent of the electorate, give or take a few points. Add enough of them to your loyal base, and victory is yours.
We are now embarked on a race between two candidates who have, at critical points in their careers, demonstrated an ability to win by building on the middle. Which of them can do it again? Who are these voters? And what do they want?
Be warned: political science is an inexact science, if not an outright oxymoron. ''We're trying to make this into 'Moneyball,' '' said John Sides of George Washington University, who regards most theories about the middle with suspicion. ''It's really still a lot of scouts telling you what's in their gut.''
But here are some generalities that pass my own gut check.
The middle is not the home of bland, split-the-difference politics, or a cult that worships bipartisan process for its own sake. Swing voters have views; they are just not views that all come from any one party's menu. Researchers at Third Way, a Clintonian think tank, have assembled a pretty plausible composite profile of these up-for-grabs voters.
Swing voters tend to be fiscal conservatives, meaning they are profoundly worried about deficits and debt.
They are mostly economic moderates, meaning they are free-marketers but expect government to help provide the physical and intellectual infrastructure that creates opportunity.
They are aspirational -- that is, they have nothing against the rich -- but they don't oppose tax increases.
They want the country well protected, but not throwing its weight around in the world.
They tend to be fairly progressive on social issues; they think, for example, that abortion should be discouraged but not prohibited.
Bruce Gyory, who studies voting trends at the State University of New York at Albany, says the swing voters are predominantly white and suburban, have at least some college, and have decent incomes. In this time of precarious jobs, devalued homes and shriveled retirement savings, they are more anxious than angry, more interested in fixing the future than in affixing blame for the past.
Swing voters, I think, are looking not for a checklist of promises but for a type of leader -- a problem-solver, a competent steward, someone who understands them and has a convincing optimism. We don't know exactly how they identify that candidate, but it is some mix of past performance (especially for the incumbent), campaign messaging and chemistry.
Both Mitt Romney and President Obama have some legitimate claim on these voters. They are analytical, pragmatic, upbeat men who won elections by promising to transcend dogma and get things working again. The middle is probably more ideologically attuned to Romney -- at least the old Romney -- but finds Obama more likable, especially after Romney's primary-season impersonation of Lurch from ''The Addams Family.''
For now, the playing field is tilting Obama's way. Voter worry -- as measured by the standard poll question about whether the country is on the right track -- has been diminishing in recent months as the economy continues its slow convalescence. But that is a tenuous advantage. In February my colleague Nate Silver crunched data from the last 16 presidential elections and calculated that if monthly job growth fell below 150,000, Obama could become an underdog. In March that number was 120,000. Uh-oh.
It is always tempting to focus on the easier pickings of the base rather than woo the skeptical, show-me middle. But if this race tightens, as elections tend to do, neither candidate should plan on living by his base alone.
Romney's obvious dilemma is that he has been herded by his right-wing rivals into positions many in the middle would find alienating. On the economy, he played into the caricature of himself as heartless and out of touch. On foreign policy, he has all but made Bibi Netanyahu his running mate; the middle is not keen on new foreign adventures. He allowed the gender gap to grow into a gulf by assailing Planned Parenthood and refusing to stand up with any conviction to the crude misogyny of Rush Limbaugh. The size of the gap is a result of women swing-voters being repelled by Republican attitudes, and so far his attempts to win them back have been inept at best.
My hunch is that Romney will manage to shake off most of his extremist accouterments, because they never seemed to fit him. It is true that if elected, as I have written before, Romney would be obliged to tithe generously to the right, by choosing Supreme Court nominees of the Scalia/Thomas persuasion, for example, and by populating regulatory agencies with polluters and plunderers. But those concerns tend not to alter election outcomes. Even with pro-Obama super PACs painting him as a mean-spirited zealot, Romney should be able to recapture the old campaign aura of a moderate Mr. Fixit. He will certainly try. On entitlements and immigration, as Thomas B. Edsall has said, Romney has already incrementally adjusted course toward the middle.
In the Democratic Party, a battle for Obama's teleprompter is now under way between the moderates and the more orthodox left. The president sometimes, as in his last two State of the Union addresses, plays the even-keel, presidential pragmatist, sounding themes of balance and opportunity. Then sometimes lately he sounds more as if he's trying out for the role of Robin Hood.
The problem isn't that the Buffett Rule is necessarily a bad idea. It isn't that ''social Darwinism'' is a slander on Republicans. (Heck, it may be the only Darwinism Romney believes in.) The problem is that when Obama thrusts these populist themes to the center of his narrative, he sounds a little desperate. The candidate who ran on hope -- promising to transcend bickering and get things done -- is in danger of sounding like the candidate of partisan insurgency. Just as Romney was unconvincing as a right-wing scourge, Obama, a man lofty in his visions but realistic in his governance, feels inauthentic playing a plutocrat-bashing firebrand. The role the middle really wants him to play, I think, is president.

HEADLINE: Trickle of Returning NRIs to Become a Flood

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Children of immigrants to the United States are returning to India and China in significant numbers. 

 BODY:
"Samir N. Kapadia seemed to be on the rise in Washington, moving from an internship on Capitol Hill to jobs at a major foundation and a consulting firm. Yet his days, he felt, had become routine," Kirk Semple writes in The New York Times. 
So Indian-born Mr. Kapadia made an increasingly common decision -- he moved to Mumbai. 
"In growing numbers, experts say, highly educated children of immigrants to the United States are uprooting themselves and moving to their ancestral countries," Mr. Semple writes. "They are embracing homelands that their parents once spurned but that are now economic powers." 
The United States government does not collect data specifically on the emigration of the American-born children of immigrants - or on those who were born abroad but moved to the United States as young children.
But several migration experts said the phenomenon was significant and increasing.
"We've gone way beyond anecdotal evidence," said Edward J. W. Park, director of the Asian Pacific American Studies Program at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
Mr. Park said this migration was spurred by the efforts of some overseas governments to attract more foreign talent by offering employment, investment, tax and visa incentives.
"So it's not just the individuals who are making these decisions," he said. "It's governments who enact strategic policies to facilitate this."

HEADLINE: New York Public Library President is Taking Reader Questions

BYLINE: ROBIN POGREBIN


HIGHLIGHT: The library's president, Anthony W. Marx, says the plan is aimed at helping the library better serve the public. 

 BODY:
The New York Public Library's plan to bring its Mid-Manhattan branch and the Science, Industry and Business Library into its lion-flanked Fifth Avenue landmark building - creating a circulating as well as a research library there for the first time -- has caused concern among academics and writers.
Critics say the library is abandoning its mission as a premiere research institution and that the $300 million projected cost could be better spent rejuvenating many branches around the city.
They are also concerned that researchers will have to wait longer for books that, under the plan, will be moved out of the stacks under the main reading room and into New Jersey storage to make room for new work areas and computer terminals. 
The library's president, Anthony W. Marx, says the plan is aimed at helping the library better serve the public and that consolidating the three branches will produce $10 million to $15 million in annual savings that can be spent on new research materials and building the curatorial staff. 
But nagging questions remain among many of the library's loyal users: Will the main branch become overcrowded? Would a possible new caf increase the amount of distractions and create spill issues? Would the money be better spent rehiring the library staff laid off during the recent recession?
Mr. Marx has recently tried to address these kinds of concerns in articles, on the radio and on TV. Now he has offered to take reader questions about the plan here. Submit them in the comments field below and a selection will be answered later in the week on ArtsBeat.

HEADLINE: To Fight a Dam, Rather Than 'Live on Your Knees'

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: The Goldman Prize goes to Ikal Angelei, a Kenyan activist, for persuading investors to withdraw support for a dam project that would devastate communities dependent on Lake Turkana. 

 BODY:
At a casual glance, Lake Turkana in northern Kenya may not seem a fount of milk and honey. The temperature around the lake hovers around 100 degrees, and tourists are warned not to approach the water because of the crocodiles and vipers lurking among the volcanic rocks. 
Yet Lake Turkana, the world's largest permanent desert lake, is regarded by many anthropologists as the cradle of humankind. Today it serves a vital purpose for local indigenous communities that depend on its waters for fish and other resources; in 1997, citing its rich biodiversity, Unesco listed it as a World Heritage site. 
Ikal Angelei, 31, one of the six winners of this year's Goldman Environmental Prize, grew up playing on Lake Turkana's dusty shores, chatting with old fishermen who sold their daily catch to her family and others. When she graduated from high school, she moved to the capital to study at the University of Nairobi, traveling later to the United States to earn a master's degree in public policy and political science at Stony Brook University on Long Island. 
Then she returned home and began working on community outreach for a group called the Turkana Basin Institute. 
That's when she learned about a proposed dam.

The chairman of the institute, Richard Leakey, approached her with a document outlining the plan for the dam, on the Omo River in Ethiopia - one of Lake Turkana's lifelines. "He said to me, this is your people, your lake, your problem," Ms. Angelei said in an interview. His words stirred her, she said, and she began researching the dam project in her spare time. 
If completed, the Gibe 3 Dam() would be the largest hydroelectric plant in Africa and provide increased electrical power to Kenya and Ethiopia. But in a region more desperate for food than electricity, the dam would take a significant toll on water levels and thus on fisheries, potentially worsening relations between disparate communities that are already enmeshed in resource-based conflicts. 
"At first, I thought, it can't be real," Ms. Angelei said. "I couldn't imagine the area without the lake." Reflecting on her father's own anti-dam activism in the late 1980s, she began making phone calls, sending e-mails, and broadcasting appeals from a local radio station. 
Day by day, her campaign gained resonance as more and more people from divided and marginalized local communities shared their stories with her. In 2009 she founded a grass-roots organization, Friends of Lake Turkana, to provide a unified voice for the peoples of the lake. 
Together they demanded that the Kenyan government and investors in the dam halt the $60 billion project. To Ms. Angelei's surprise, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the African Development Bank all withdrew their financing. Last year the Kenyan Parliament mandated that the government commission an independent environment assessment from Ethiopia. 
"The feeling that the actual construction had lost its funding was amazing -- it gives me hope that we can go on," Ms. Angelei said. 
The struggle is not quite over. China, the last big investor, is still pushing for construction. Ms. Angelei believes that ultimately governments will have to step up to put the Gibe 3 Dam to rest. "China may have green policies they're trying to implement, but as long as there's not a format for holding Chinese companies and banks accountable, then the policies do not work," she said. 
Taxpayers in Western countries could help by holding their governments responsible for backing flawed development projects, she added. 
Although she has frequently been discouraged, Ms. Angelei said, witnessing the struggles of local families and women helped her keep her goal in sight. Often she was approached by strangers who could offer her little more than blessings and encouragement, she said: "It was seeing the look in people's eyes that kept me going." 
For her efforts to protect her community, Ms. Angelei was awarded the Goldman Prize in the African regional category; each year, the prize is also awarded to a recipient in Asia, Europe, an island nation, North America and South or Central America. Each honoree receives an award of $150,000. (The program was initiated in 1990 by Richard and Rhoda Goldman, civic leaders and philanthropists in San Francisco.)
"These are people who normally go unrecognized but do so much of the work," said Lorrae Rominger, the deputy director of the prize program. "Hopefully, when they go back to their country, people will look, listen, stop and want to know more about what they're doing," she said of the recipients. 
As a young woman living in an an area where violence is out of check, Ms. Angelei stood out for "taking this risk upon herself and making such a big difference," Ms. Rominger said. 
Ms. Angelei said that struggling to make a difference is not easy but that not trying means becoming part of the problem. Her father often cited the adage that "it's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees," she said. "Even if you don't win, at least you're opening the platform for others after you."

HEADLINE: Freedom Comes to Washington

BYLINE: KATE MASUR


HIGHLIGHT: The long, surprising history of the 1862 D.C. emancipation act. 

 BODY:
President Abraham Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Emancipation Act into law on April 16, 1862, a step heralded by abolitionists across the country. Never before had Congress passed a measure designed to destroy slavery in a place where it was already entrenched. As one newspaper put it: "The actual interest at stake was not extensive - a citadel never occupies a large proportion of the territory it represents - but the principle involved in the question was vital." The capital's liberation was, Frederick Douglass wrote, "a priceless and an unspeakable blessing" for those it freed and "the first great step towards that righteousness which exalts a nation." 
Groundbreaking as it was, the act contained some provisions that look peculiar in light of later developments. The law provided for compensation to slave owners who remained loyal to the Union, and it suggested that emancipated slaves might benefit from leaving the United States entirely. It appropriated funds for these purposes: $1 million to distribute among loyal slave owners and $100,000 to support freedpeople who wanted to emigrate. 
Such provisions were entirely absent from the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by Lincoln just eight and a half months later, and from the 13th Amendment, which finally made slavery illegal everywhere when it was ratified in December 1865. What changed? A look at how the District of Columbia Emancipation Act took shape in the Senate reveals the complexity of the wartime emancipation debate. 
Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts first introduced legislation to abolish slavery in the capital in mid-December 1861, amid a national scandal about the incarceration of fugitive slaves in the Washington jail. Wilson and other Republican senators believed the Constitution gave Congress virtually unlimited power to legislate for the District of Columbia and that Congress was therefore fully within its rights to abolish slavery there, even if it could not touch slavery in the states. Indeed, for this reason, abolitionists had been attacking slavery in the capital for decades, arguing that it was an embarrassment and an insult to a nation supposedly devoted to human dignity and equality. 
Even among those who favored ending slavery in the capital, however, there was considerable disagreement about how to do it. Lincoln had weighed in on the matter several times before becoming president. As a congressman in 1849, he had drafted legislation for emancipation in the District of Columbia that would be gradual, voluntary and compensated. Adults would remain enslaved, but beginning in 1850 all children born to enslaved mothers would be free and subject to apprenticeship to their owners. Slave owners would be compensated at market value for those liberated. And the gradual emancipation law would only go into effect if the voters of the District of Columbia approved it. Lincoln believed Congress had the power to enact abolition in the capital without voters' consent, he reiterated in his debates with Stephen Douglas, but he did not think it desirable to do so. 
Congress never debated Lincoln's emancipation bill, but its parameters were well known in 1862 as the debate over Wilson's bill got under way. Among the three facets of Lincoln's proposal, the new emancipation bill picked up only one: compensation. The bill mandated a presidentially appointed three-man commission to hear slaveowners' claims for compensation, judge their loyalty to the Union, and assess the value of each slave. Some of Wilson's Republican colleagues complained about using federal funds to pay for slaves; Senator Samuel Pomeroy of Kansas even proposed compensating the slaves themselves for unpaid labor. 
But Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts found a way forward, pitching the measure not as compensation but as ransom. "From time immemorial every Government has undertaken to ransom its subjects from captivity," he said. Just as the federal government had ransomed Americans held in slavery on the North African coast in the late 18th century, so too would it pay for the release of the slaves of the capital. 
In lengthy speeches in late March and early April, senators marshaled their best arguments for and against the emancipation bill, making recourse to examples from world history and precedents from the founding fathers and the Supreme Court. Legislators from the loyal border states and nascent West Virginia adamantly opposed the measure. They had no love for slavery, most of them said, but they felt the measure was divisive, damaging to the tenuous loyalist movements in their states and especially threatening to the economic and social order of nearby Maryland. 
Senator Garrett Davis of Kentucky insisted that it was unconstitutional for Congress to abolish slavery in the capital. Focused on the Fifth Amendment - which prohibited the government from taking "private property . . . for public use, without just compensation" - Davis argued that the government could purchase slaves from their owners, but it could not turn a piece of property into a free person. Even if it could, he added, the bill did not provide for "just compensation" because it limited the amount that owners could be compensated for each slave. 
No one else in the Senate was willing to go to such lengths to defend property in human beings, and no one seemed to agree with Davis that Congress had no authority to abolish slavery in the capital. Democrats and moderate Republicans alike, however, cited Lincoln's earlier proposals - and his current bid to persuade the border slave states to find their own way toward emancipation - as they insisted that the emancipation bill should provide for gradual emancipation and for the consent of local voters. Still, a solid core of Republicans repeatedly voted down such suggestions. Pomeroy audaciously suggested that if local consent was necessary, Congress should seek it from all district residents over age 21, not just from the white men who currently composed the electorate. That idea got nowhere, but neither did border state senators' proposals to seek voters' approval. 
The only substantive amendment to Wilson's bill concerned "colonization," or the proposal that the government should help African Americans leave the United States once freed. Davis had initially introduced the issue, arguing that all persons liberated by the act be required to emigrate. But Senator James Doolittle of Wisconsin offered an alternative, that colonization be voluntary, and pressed his Republican colleagues to see the wisdom of the idea. Doolittle rested his argument on no less a figure than Thomas Jefferson. The author of the Declaration of Independence, he pointed out, had believed that blacks and whites were destined to live separately; that people of African descent would prosper in the tropics, leaving the northern climes for those of European origin. 
Doolittle's proposal to appropriate $100,000 for voluntary colonization received little support at first, but as the debate wore on and Republican newspapers expressed concern that the bill was too radical, several senators came around. Finally, on April 3, the Senate approved Doolittle's colonization provision and then went on to pass the bill itself. 
Colonization had not been part of Lincoln's 1849 proposal, but he had often voiced support for the idea. Lincoln believed all people were entitled to certain fundamental rights. At the same time, like many Americans of his era, he believed that the "races" were separate and distinct groups, and he doubted whether different races could live peacefully together as equals, in the same nation. 
The colonization measure in the District of Columbia Emancipation Act was no anomaly. That summer Congress appropriated an additional $500,000 for the colonization of African Americans freed during the war, and Lincoln urged a delegation of black men from Washington to help the government create a black colony on the Central American isthmus, where African Americans would work in the coal industry and enjoy equal rights amid a racially mixed population. Lincoln appointed Pomeroy to oversee the project, but diplomatic obstacles proved insurmountable. Not a single government-sponsored ship ever set sail for that region. 
The District of Columbia Emancipation Act (together with a supplemental act passed three months later) freed about 3,100 people held in bondage in the capital. Congress abolished slavery in the federal territories that summer, but in the main, it was the vicissitudes of war that would drive emancipation in the coming months. Congress and the president had far more latitude when they acted in the name of military necessity; besides, there were only so many places where the federal government enjoyed virtually unchallenged jurisdiction over slavery. 
So it was that Congress passed legislation instructing army officers not to send fugitives back into slavery and, later, declared that all fugitives coming into Union lines were free. So it was, also, that Lincoln proclaimed emancipation in his capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces, leaving questions of gradualism, compensation and consent behind.

HEADLINE: A Population Antidote: High School for Girls

BYLINE: ELISABETH ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Girls in sub-Saharan Africa who finish secondary school are more likely to understand family planning and acquire skills that could give them some measure of financial independence. 

 BODY:
High school for girls = population control = sustainable growth.
I know this may seem like a simplistic equation. But in interviews on the causes and effects of runaway population growth in Africa for a weekend article in The Times, many experts suggested one singularly effective intervention: make sure that girls to go to high school.
I heard it from Peter Ogunjuyigbe, a demographer in the city of Ile-Ife, Nigeria, who is studying population growth with financing from the Gates Foundation and the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. I heard it from Parfait M. Eloundou-Enyegue, a development sociologist at Cornell. I heard it most forcefully, perhaps, from Babatunde Osotimehin, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, who views population control as tightly linked to female empowerment.
"There are countries where the population is growing faster than the economy," Mr. Osotimehin, a former Nigerian health minister, said in an interview in New York. "We try to work with these countries to make sure girls have access to education to empower women to participate in politics and the economy."
At some point along the population growth curve in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, too many people means not enough resources, marked declines in human health and the destruction of critical natural habitat. 
So how does requiring secondary education for girls lead to smaller families and a more sustainable world? Let me count the ways.
In many African nations, girls are typically only required to attend primary school, if that. That means their schooling ends around age 12 and they are spit out into a world where their future is to be to be married off and start having babies. Not surprisingly, low rates of education for women consistently correlates with high fertility rates. In West and Central Africa over all, 44 percent of girls are married before they turn 18. That figure leaps to 76 percent in Niger, where the fertility rate is the highest in the world (7.3 babies per woman) and many women marry in early adolescence.Girls who finish high school emerge with skills that make them more likely to be employable and capable of attaining a measure of financial independence. They are more likely to make marriage decisions on their own rather than having their families rush to marry them off.Education on sex and family planning is less effective in elementary school, where girls tend to be too immature physically and emotionally to process the information. Instruction in family planning in secondary school enables young women to understand their options.
"If you educate girls to the secondary level, then exposure to pregnancy doesn't happen until they are mature and can made choices," Dr. Osotimehin said. 
The ripple effects of having girls finish high school could be enormous in sub-Saharan nations because the region's population is so young. In Nigeria, for example, about 40 percent of the population is 14 or younger.

HEADLINE: A Population Antidote: High School for Girls

BYLINE: ELISABETH ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Girls in sub-Saharan Africa who finish secondary school are more likely to understand family planning and acquire skills that could give them some measure of financial independence. 

 BODY:
High school for girls = population control = sustainable growth.
I know this may seem like a simplistic equation. But in interviews on the causes and effects of runaway population growth in Africa for a weekend article in The Times, many experts suggested one singularly effective intervention: make sure that girls to go to high school.
I heard it from Peter Ogunjuyigbe, a demographer in the city of Ile-Ife, Nigeria, who is studying population growth with financing from the Gates Foundation and the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. I heard it from Parfait M. Eloundou-Enyegue, a development sociologist at Cornell. I heard it most forcefully, perhaps, from Babatunde Osotimehin, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, who views population control as tightly linked to female empowerment.
"There are countries where the population is growing faster than the economy," Mr. Osotimehin, a former Nigerian health minister, said in an interview in New York. "We try to work with these countries to make sure girls have access to education to empower women to participate in politics and the economy."
At some point along the population growth curve in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, too many people means not enough resources, marked declines in human health and the destruction of critical natural habitat. 
So how does requiring secondary education for girls lead to smaller families and a more sustainable world? Let me count the ways.

HEADLINE: Italian Government Takes Steps to Oust Maxxi Museum Board

BYLINE: ELISABETTA POVOLEDO


HIGHLIGHT: Less than two years after the opening of Maxxi, Italy's national museum of contemporary art, the Italian Culture Ministry last Friday initiated procedures to replace the board of directors of the foundation that manages the museum with a government-appointed administrator. 

 BODY:
ROME -- Less than two years after the opening of Maxxi, Italy's national museum of contemporary art, the Italian Culture Ministry last Friday initiated procedures to replace the board of directors of the foundation that manages the museum with a government-appointed administrator. The decision was taken, according a terse statement issued by the ministry, after the board failed to approve the 2012 budget, which is expected to register a "significant" deficit.
At a hastily convened press conference over the weekend, Pio Baldi, the president of the Maxxi Foundation, said he had been "very surprised" by the ministry's decision, because the Maxxi "is a museum that's doing very well," with some 450,000 visitors in 2011 alone.
Financing is at the heart of the dispute. 
Maxxi's annual budget in 2011 was about $12 million, of which the museum was able to cover 59 percent through ticket sales and sponsorships, while the state contributed about $5 million. But budget cuts have drastically reduced state subsidies to museums. In the case of Maxxi, future state contributions are expected to be under 2 million euros, which is about $2.6 million, a year, and the museum will be expected to make up the difference with private sponsors. When the board was unable to raise that much, the culture ministry decided to intervene to replace it.
"The Maxxi has great potential for development and needs to aggregate private sponsors and new institutions" to increase its resources, said Mario Resca, the Culture Ministry official who oversees state museums. "This just hasn't happened."
But Maxxi officials point out that Italy offers few economic incentives or tax breaks to private sponsors of cultural initiatives, which many see as the main obstacle to getting financial support from private sources.
Mr. Resca agreed. "Italy needs to imitate the situations of other countries" and offer better tax incentives, he said.

HEADLINE: Community College Serves as a Path to Four-Year Institutions

BYLINE: LILY ALTAVENA


HIGHLIGHT: More community college students are transferring to more selective institutions to obtain bachelor's degrees. 

 BODY:
This year's graduating class at the Community College of Philadelphia includes many students who will soon enter four-year colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania and Bryn Mawr, Michael Winerip writes this week. 
Many of these students are older, like Christopher Thomas, 38, and did not immediately enter college after high school. Mr. Thomas's path was particularly winding - he ended his first year at Philadelphia with almost all A's, and one C, smudging his perfect record. His now less-than-perfect G.P.A. made him wonder if all the extra work, loans and late-night bus rides were worth the degree. Now, two years later, he is set to enter the University of Pennsylvania to earn his bachelor's degree, possibly in education, Mr. Winerip reports.
Increasingly, the students here are making that jump. Dawn-Stacy Joyner, a former hospital cook, will also attend the University of Pennsylvania. Nine women graduating this spring have been accepted to Bryn Mawr. Larry Thi, who hopes to become a teacher, transferred to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
"There's been a major acceleration the last few years," said Rod Risley, executive director of Phi Theta Kappa, the community college honor society.
It's partly the economic collapse. The Community College of Philadelphia costs $4,400 a year for city residents; the most expensive private colleges are $60,000. Getting an associate degree first can save $100,000.
"These students are choosing community colleges with the intention that this is their path to selective institutions," Mr. Risley said.
He had no trouble providing names. Casey Maliszewski went from Raritan Valley Community College in New Jersey to Mount Holyoke, and she is now a graduate student at Columbia. Tamer Shabani also went to Raritan and is at Stanford. Mark Svensson transferred from Rockland Community College to Georgetown.
The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation gives community college students scholarships of up to $30,000 to continue their education. It also gives money to four-year institutions to recruit students from community colleges, Mr. Winerip writes.
This year, we wrote about the increase in the number of wealthier students who are opting to attend two-year institutions. Perhaps there is a trend emerging.

HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Why Facebook spent all of that money, who's hiring, how to start your business on YouTube and Burger King's bacon sundae. 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: A Billion Dollars
Instagram's Kevin Systrom celebrates being 27 by selling his company to Facebook for a (and Pat Stansik celebrates being 24 by making this video). The Instagram acquisition fuels start-up fever, and Om Malik explains why Facebook spent all that money: "Facebook is essentially about photos, and Instagram had found and attacked Facebook's Achilles' heel - mobile photo sharing." Dylan Tweney explains why Instagram is worth more than your start-up. Todd Warren learned three lessons, including: "develop the simplest solution to the customer problem, then iterate on what resonates FAST." For Matthew Ingram, the acquisition proves that nothing is more important than the network.
Economy: Hazardous to Your Health
The Federal Reserve said the economy maintained its expansion in all 12 of its regions. That's nice, but a better economy causes more people to die. Small-business confidence dips, and Lance Roberts says it's because of the return of economic weakness. A small-business lending index increases slightly, and the Treasury Department is reporting small-business lending success. James Hamilton summarizes current conditions. Some economists are making dreary forecasts. Gary Shilling makes a case for another recession - which might be fine for big business. A massive, catastrophic spike in interest rates is still not happening, and Roger Arnold says QE3 is coming. Doug Short supplies an interesting graphic on how the Fed's interventions affect the markets. The government's biggest asset is student loans. Here's a chart that explains the student debt "disaster." John Hinderaker says America's "debt bomb" is worse than Europe's. These sectors are getting investor attention, and these sectors are dying. Mary Ellen Bierly tells who's hiring.
The Data: Gas Use Plunges 
Nonfarm payrolls increased 120,000 in March (pdf) but weekly unemployment claims rose. Sony loses $6.4 billion. Machine-tool orders rebound. Retail container traffic is expected to increase. Inflation-adjusted natural gas futures fall to their lowest prices since 1994. Petroleum and gas use plunges, and March car sales were the most fuel-efficient in history. Our budget deficit hits a record high, and the editors at Bloomberg say, "Don't tell Obama and Ryan, but their budgets are similar."
Marketing: Lessons From Food Trucks
A new microchip knows your location to within centimeters - so you may want to check out Brian Honigman's recommendations for marketing with location-based networks. Valeria Maltoni suggests 50 content ideas to create buzz. Here are six ideas for finding new sales leads. Food truck owners share some social media lessons. Lorna Sixsmith explains how to network on LinkedIn. Mark Schmulen has five ways to turn Facebook likes into results. Only 34 percent of Americans view Twitter favorably, but here's one really smart use of the service.

Boss of the Week: Caine
Must-see lessons in entrepreneurship (and social media) in a video about a 9-year-old who builds an arcade. Runner-up: an 8-year-old brings it against the University of North Carolina basketball team.
Start-Up: Ashton and Betty
Ashton Kutcher invests in Dwolla, and Betty White joins Twitter. If no celebrity is available, here are seven other ways to finance your start-up. A venture capitalist is seeking investors for a new fund focused on start-ups. Rieva Lesonsky explains why investors may reject your start-up pitch.

A human resources specialist says there are three things start-up founders need to know about human resources. Here's how to get your business started on YouTube. Startup Weekend participants can get a new .co domain at no cost for the first year. Neustar is helping small businesses "Kick-Start America" with the .us domain. Here's how to speak Squirrel.
Management: Wasting Time
Gary Stix says you should ask yourself this set of questions every few weeks to gauge how much damaging stress you are experiencing. Bob Ingle says New Jersey wants some of the unused billions on gift cards. A big business learns the true power of social media. Jessica Reid looks at the most common ways small-business owners waste time. Here are five wonderfully weird products small businesses created. A few teenage tycoons show that entrepreneurship knows no age limit - and neither does ignorance. Moving your mouse pad can improve your brain. Ron Schenone explains why noise can increase productivity. Linda Hill and Kent Lineback believe that good managers lead through a team. Ndubuisi Ekekwe says "companies need to help employees unplug their smartphones." A snack food pioneer dies at 87. These are the best National Hockey League playoff beards of all time.
Around the Country: Bacon Sundaes?

The British Department of Energy and Climate Change says that 30 million homes and small businesses will have smart meters by 2019. Georgia's Clarke County leads a list of top small-size communities.
Around the World: South Korea Smells the Coffee
China's inflation increases. Japan's core machinery orders rise 4.8 percent in February. A Dubai company introduces a farming system that allows farmers to use 90 percent less water. A Dunkin' Donuts bus ad sprays the aroma of coffee in South Korea. Small businesses in Toronto can score big contracts with the Pan Am Games. A new report shows that the business environment for entrepreneurs in all five economies of the East African Community improved between 2010 and 2011.
Red Tape: Enemy Strongholds
The Buffett Rule becomes an election-year battleground. A senator says "don't Buffett small businesses." Jim Geraghty argues that a 1 percent spending cut would be six times as effective as the Buffett Rule, and Ezra Klein says everything you know about the rule is wrong. Here are six overlooked small-business tax deductions (and the worst cheap shot you'll ever see). Bruce Bartlett says to really simplify the tax code we must "bypass enemy strongholds." A small-business owner takes the Internal Revenue Service to court over "outrageous" new regulations, and a senator from Texas announces a small-business taxpayer bill of rights. A report calls for doubling the nation's public health spending.
Technology: 665 Million Tablets
Here are five ways the Internet of things will be powered. Gartner predicts 665 million tablets will be in use by 2016 and more merchants are embracing direct mobile billing. A new AT&T Web site gives access to the best apps for small businesses. Stores are increasingly adding self-checkouts, which makes it more convenient for many people to shop - and steal. A 3-D chocolate printer is now available. Here are 75 open-source replacements for popular small-business software. Intel announces a program to help small-businesses improve productivity and security. Cookie sales soar as the Girl Scouts adopt smartphones and credit cards. Microsoft will be supporting Windows XP and Office 2003 for just two more years. An old man in a nursing home reacts to music.
The Week's Bests
Reason Not to Outsource. Jeff Wallingford, a supply-chain specialist, says there are six situations where manufacturing is best left in-house, including when a company's manufacturing process is the source of its competitive advantage: "You must continue to advance the art and lead the technology curve for that manufacturing process. If you stand still while others move forward, you will lose your competitive advantage. At the point that process innovation is more likely to come from outside your company than inside, you have to reconsider your strategy."
Way to Beat the Odds. Martin Zwilling says there are 10 ways entrepreneurs beat the odds, including reinforcing the team message: "Teamwork is the hallmark of high-performing start-ups. Establishing a shared identity is the first step to creating unity. The Google team stayed tight as they developed the technology, first working out of Larry Page's dorm room at Stanford, then a garage."
Get the Most From Your People. John Mills says smart talent managers look for ways to reward achievement: "Use announcements, newsletters, awards, small gifts, or even social media to highlight outstanding performances. Celebrate excellence, and then place workers in roles where they are most likely to achieve more of it."

HEADLINE: In Ad Campaign, SAP Looks Beyond Business Customers

BYLINE: TANZINA VEGA


HIGHLIGHT: The campaign will try to translate some complex technologies, generally the province of business I.T., into consumer-speak. 

 BODY:
Software companies don't have an easy time marketing themselves to a mass audience, especially when the software is a complicated business product meant for cloud computing or data analytics.
Despite that hurdle, the business software company SAP will announce a new global advertising campaign this week called "Run Like Never Before" intended to reach not just high-level executives and I.T. managers, their usual customers, but small and midsize businesses, and maybe even a stray consumer.
"It is recognizing that I.T. isn't the purchaser of all the products that we sell," said Jonathan Becher, the chief marketing officer at SAP. The campaign was created by Ogilvy & Mather, part of WPP.

The ads are meant to highlight the speed with which SAP's suite of technologies can help companies do business better. In the last few years, SAP has made a series of acquisitions to broaden its product base, including Sybase, which makes mobility and data management software, Business Objects, an analytics software company, and SuccessFactors, a cloud-computing company.
"We're talking about some pretty abstract technologies," said Chris Curry, creative director at Ogilvy & Mather. "Really what that translates to is getting new product out the door faster, allowing somebody to have a better work life," he said.
The campaign will include television, print, mobile and digital ads that will begin in the United States, Brazil and Germany on Tuesday. The ads were shot in various locations around the world including China, India and South Africa.
The television spot starts with a grinding guitar riff and shows everything from fishermen pulling in their catch to a man in the back of a taxi typing on a tablet computer and a father checking his cellphone during his son's cricket game. The messages on the screen say, "Run without warehouses," "Run 10 years of numbers in seconds" and "Run without missing out." "The imagery represents all the categories that SAP is involved in," Mr. Curry said. "It's not just people in offices."
Visitors to Yankee Stadium in New York City on Friday got a preview of the TV ad, which was shown during the game. Print ads will run in magazines like the Harvard Business Review and The Economist.

HEADLINE: Gender and the Polls

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Men's and women's attitudes diverge on a number of policy and political issues, and as Mitt Romney has courted social conservatives that gap has become more apparent, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
As everyone closely following the presidential campaign knows, recent polls show Mitt Romney facing a significant gender gap compared with President Obama, with far less support among women than men. The peculiar dynamics of this year's primaries help explain why. 
In his efforts to vanquish his Republican challengers, Mr. Romney courted social conservatives who espouse traditional gender roles. 
But deeper causes are also apparent. Republicans have gotten the short end of the stick from women in presidential elections since the 1980s partly because the economic interests of women have diverged from those of men. 
Increases in non-marriage and divorce mean that fewer men and women are pooling their income. The economists Lena Edlund, Laila Haider and Rohini Pande assert that the decline in marriage helps explain why women have become more left-wing in both the United States and in Europe.

Women now rely more heavily on their own earnings but continue to earn significantly less, on average, than men. Obviously, they have more to gain from legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex and are more directly affected by the availability and cost of contraception and abortion. 
Less obvious are differences that, ironically, grow out of the traditional gender division of labor. In general, women take more responsibility than men for the care of dependents - both in the family, where they devote more resources to young children and elderly parents, and in paid employment, where they are concentrated in education, health and social services. 
A large proportion of all public social spending, ranging from public education to Medicare and Social Security, is devoted to dependent care. Women have long favored such expenditures more than men.
Historical research by the economists John Lott and Lawrence Kenny offers considerable evidence that the extension of voting rights to women in the United States contributed to the rise of public-sector spending. A more narrowly focused study by Grant Miller shows that newly enfranchised women voted for candidates who supported new public health-care programs that significantly reduced child mortality. 
Robert Shapiro and Harpreet Mahajan have documented persistent gender differences in policy preferences and R. Michael Alvarez and Edward J. McCaffery more specific gender differences in fiscal preferences. 
Such differences tend to grow during periods of economic hardship, and they help explain Mr. Romney's political difficulties. 
An October 2011 survey of registered voters by the Pew Research Center found that 62 percent of women (compared with 52 percent of men) said the government did not do enough for children, and 65 percent of women (compared with 54 percent of men) said that it did not do enough for older people. 
By contrast, nearly identical percentages of women and men (65 percent and 64 percent, respectively) said government did too much for the wealthy.
Similarity among women does not imply unanimity. Married women are older, better educated and more likely to be white than other women. They tend to be more affluent partly because they tend to pool their income with their husbands. They are clearly more politically conservative: About 45 percent identify as or lean Republican, compared with 31 percent of single women. 
Differences of opinion between full-time mothers and those who work for pay outside the home can become tense, as in the recent brouhaha over whether Ann Romney had ever "worked a day in her life," as a Democratic consultant put it.
But it's also worth noting that men's policy priorities may be influenced by their perceptions of women's interests. The economist Ebonya Washington demonstrates that members of Congress with daughters tend to vote more liberally not only on reproductive rights but also on work-family and education policies.
Recent research by the economists Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee on Britain and Germany yields an even more startling result: raising daughters seems to lead people to be more sympathetic to left-wing parties, while raising sons seems to have the opposite effect. 
Gender may drive politics in more ways than one. Mr. Obama is the father of two daughters. Mr. Romney is the father of five sons.

HEADLINE: Citigroup's First-Quarter Net Income Falls 2%

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Citigroup, however, reported better-than-expected revenue growth on Monday, driven by steady demand for loans from consumers and businesses and an improving economic condition in the United States. 

 BODY:
Citigroup may soon get a chance to increase its dividend payout after the bank reported better-than-expected earnings and bolstered its reserves.
On Monday, Citigroup said that more than a quarter of its balance sheet is in cash or other liquid securities. Buoyed by that stronger cushion, Citigroup plans to resubmit its capital plans to the Federal Reserve, which could pave the way for a higher dividend.
It's a bright spot for the bank. In March, the Fed quashed the bank's plans to raise its dividend or increase share buybacks in a rebuff to Vikram S. Pandit, Citi's chief executive.
After the latest round of stress tests, the Fed was concerned that the bank might not have enough cash to withstand the most severe economic downturn.
The Fed's denial was a tough blow for Citi, particularly after most of the bank's rivals were allowed to raise dividend payments.
But this month, Mr. Pandit is on far firmer ground as the bank reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Monday, driven by steady demand for loans from international consumers and businesses and an improving economic condition in the United States.
Pointing out the bank's stronger capital position, Mr. Pandit told analysts that Citi planned to resubmit its capital plans to the Fed. Mr. Pandit said the bank ended the quarter with $122 billion of Tier 1 common capital, a crucial measure of the bank's health and ability to withstand sudden market swings.
In the first quarter of 2012, it had a Tier 1 ratio of 12.4 percent, which was an increase from 11.8 percent at the end of the fourth quarter.
Citi's shareholders, however, will have to be patient before seeing a dividend increase, from the current 4 cents a year. The process of resubmitting a capital plan to the Fed and winning approval could stretch for months. Mr. Pandit said it could be as late as the "end of the third quarter." In the meantime, he told analysts, Citi would "generate strong returns for our shareholders."
Much of the first quarter gains for Citi came from its investment banking business where the bank has worked hard to make up lost ground. Revenue in securities and banking was $6.65 billion, up 6 percent from last year. That is up more than 50 percent from the level it reported during its disappointing fourth quarter.
John C. Gerspach, Citi's chief financial officer, said on a conference call that its trading unit was a strong point for the bank and would continue to surge.
For Citi, the real highlight was the fixed-income revenue results, which jumped 19 percent from the previous year.
Still, Mr. Gerspach said that continuing concerns in Europe could undercut trading. "If markets roil, things will be impacted again," he said.
The bank, which is based in New York, reported that net income was down 2 percent, to $2.93 billion, or 95 cents a share from $2.99 billion, or 99 cents a share in the period a year earlier. Total revenue was $19.4 billion, down 2 percent from a year ago.
Excluding certain items, the bank said it earned $1.11 a share in the first quarter of 2012, up 7 percent from the period a year earlier. That exceeded analysts' estimates of $1.02 a share, according to a survey by Bloomberg.
Shares of Citigroup rose 1.77 percent, or 59 cents, to $34 on the earnings news Monday.
As European banks flail, Citi has gained ground. Quarterly revenue from international transaction services grew 7 percent, to $2.7 billion.
Guy Moszkowski, a bank analyst with Merrill Lynch, said in a report that Citi's trade finance business got a boost as European competitors struggled.
Citi benefited from its expansive global footprint, notching gains in Latin America and Asia. Revenue in the Latin American global consumer banking grew to $2.44 billion, up 6 percent from the first quarter of 2011.
In this nation, however, Citi is grappling with some thorny issues and trying to gain more consumer banking business. Loan balances on Citi's branded credit cards were down 6 percent, to $2.07 billion in the latest quarter. As part of its push to rebuild its national consumer banking business, the bank will continue to court customers for its Citi branded cards.
"That's going to be something that is an ongoing activity for this year," Mr. Gerspach said on the conference call. He noted that Citi would "love to put some of our cash to work in loans" but that demand remains sluggish.
Average checking account deposits are up slightly to $169 billion, from $166 billion in the period last year.
Citi is also dealing with the weight of its soured mortgage portfolio although delinquencies on loans are declining.
In the wake of the $25 billion national mortgage settlement with federal and state regulators that helped quiet allegations about dubious mortgage practices and foreclosure abuses, Citi put aside a total of $720 million to handle costs related to that litigation.
An earlier version of this article omitted a word related to the value of the national mortgage settlement. The settlement reached with several banks was for $25 billion, not $25.

HEADLINE: Lee Equity Partners to Take Edelman Financial Private

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The wealth management firm Edelman Financial said Monday that it would go private after accepting a $258 million all-cash bid from Lee Equity Partners. 

 BODY:
The wealth management firm Edelman Financial said Monday that it would go private after accepting a $258 million bid from Lee Equity Partners, the latest private equity shop to go hunting for asset managers.
The all-cash deal for $8.85 a share is a 43 percent premium over the Edelman's closing price on Friday on the Nasdaq. The deal for Edelman, which manages about $17 billion, is expected to close during the third quarter of 2012. 
"The Edelman Financial Group has achieved a strong track record and is a clear leader in the independent financial advisor field," Thomas H. Lee, president of Lee Equity Partners, said in a news release. "We are excited to partner with Edelman Financial's management team, and we look forward to supporting the company's continued expansion."
Edelman, based in Houston, employs about 500 people throughout the United States, offering an array of wealth management and financial advisory services. The company first went public in 1999, and reached a peak trading price in 2007 of about $18 a share. Since then, the share price has experienced steadily declined, though it is well above its post-financial crisis lows. 
Lee Equity Partners, a middle-market buyout firm that manages about $1 billion of assets, plans to keep Edelman's current management team intact, according to the release. 
In recent years, private equity firms including the Carlyle Group and Apollo Global Management have been snapping up asset managers in a bid to beef up their assets.

HEADLINE: Romney Talks of Ending Some Tax Deductions for Wealthy

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In comments at a private fund-raising event overheard by reporters, Mitt Romney also said he might eliminate the Department of Housing and Urban Development and shrink the Education Department. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney inadvertently offered a public preview of some of his economic plans on Sunday, revealing to high-dollar donors at a private fund-raising event that he wants to eliminate tax deductions for wealthy people who own second homes.
Mr. Romney's comments were overheard by reporters standing outside the event on a sidewalk and first reported by The Wall Street Journal andNBC News. During the event, Mr. Romney also told the donors that he might eliminate the Department of Housing and Urban Development and reduce the size of the Education Department.
Mr. Romney told the donors that the housing agency "might not be around later" and said the Education Department would be "a heck of a lot smaller" even if it wasn't eliminated altogether, The Journal reported.
"I'm going to take a lot of departments in Washington, and agencies, and combine them. Some eliminate, but I'm probably not going to lay out just exactly which ones are going to go," Mr. Romney said, according to NBC. "Things like Housing and Urban Development, which my dad was head of, that might not be around later. But I'm not going to actually go through these one by one. What I can tell you is, we've got far too many bureaucrats. I will send a lot of what happens in Washington back to the states."
The overheard comments offer a first glimpse of the kind of specific policies that Mr. Romney might pursue as president. Publicly, Mr. Romney has hinted that he would limit deductions for wealthy homeowners, but has not said how he might do that. And in his remarks Sunday, he also hinted that he might curtail deductions for state and property taxes for the wealthy.
And Mr. Romney has resisted offering many details about the cuts to government spending that would allow him to achieve the kind of deficit reductions he has projected considering the cuts in taxes that he has talked about.
Officials with the Republican campaign said Mr. Romney was just tossing out ideas at the fund-raiser, not unveiling new policies. They accused Democrats of using the incident to try to distract attention from the economic situation under President Obama.
"While President Obama is interested only in offering excuses and blaming others for his failures, Governor Romney is discussing some of the ideas he has to tackle the big issues facing America," said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney. "Governor Romney has also laid out a bold set of policy proposals that will grow our economy, cut spending and get our massive debt under control."
But Mr. Obama's campaign quickly pounced, describing Mr. Romney as willing to reveal his intentions only to well-connected donors, not to the public.
"Apparently, Governor Romney believes only high-dollar donors have a right to know what programs he will cut," wrote Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's campaign, in an e-mail to reporters. "Education. Housing. To pay for $5 trillion tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans."
Democrats have already been trying to convince voters that Mr. Romney is hiding things from voters. They point to the fact that Mr. Romney has not identified his "bundlers," the handful of donors who gather up contributions from their wealthy friends. And they have criticized Mr. Romney for releasing only two years of tax returns.
An e-mail Monday morning from Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, was headlined: "In case you're keeping count at home: Things Mitt Romney Hides."
To that list, Mr. Woodhouse added, "Now we learn policies he'd pursue as president (unless you're a high-dollar donor, of course)."
The Romney campaign quickly sought to play down the new proposals on Monday, suggesting that the candidate was simply bouncing around a few ideas with donors, not laying out new policy.
During a Romney campaign conference call focused on President Obama's tax proposals, former Senator James M. Talent of Missouri said Mr. Romney "was discussing ideas that came up at the meeting, which happens a lot when you are on the stump or doing interviews with the press."
When it became clear that questions from the news media about Mr. Romney's remarks at the Florida fund-raiser would dominate the conference call, an aide to Mr. Romney ended the session after three questions.

HIGHLIGHT: Some reading while you procrastinate on your taxes. 

 BODY:
For nearly two decades, Monsanto and corporate agribusiness have exercised near-dictatorial control over American agriculture. But public opinion is turning against Monsanto, and in November, a statewide citizens' ballot initiative will give Californians the opportunity to vote for GMO labeling (a similar measure was introduced in Vermont, but is currently stalled by cowardly legislators). This is going to be huge. By the way, a poll suggests that 60 percent of California voters would support a soda tax. Related: now we finally know what's been missing from our family dinners: Sierra Mist.
The F.D.A. announced that it will ask livestock producers, drug companies and veterinarians to curb the use of antibiotics to promote growth in food-producing animals. Voluntary, of course, but a start. I suppose. But meanwhile, a class of antibiotics that's been banned in the U.S. for poultry production is still in use. And the debate over that poultry inspection proposal is heating up, with the FSIS keen to modernize an archaic inspection system while inspectors on the front lines and some consumer groups argue that expanding regulation will not only impair food safety, but may also send more defective or unappealing chicken to consumer's plates. And a single case of food poisoning can cause health problems for years, Maryn McKenna reports in Scientific American.
An undercover investigation by the Humane Society of the United States has revealed abuses of hens at a Pennsylvania factory owned by Kreider Farms, which houses 7 million hens at its four factories. Nick Kristof wrote about the investigation for The Times.
Evidence was uncovered that points to humans cooking food as far back as a million years ago-and some scientists believe it was even further back than that. (And yet if there were ever a time to eat carpaccio )
Brightfarms, which builds hydroponic greenhouse farms, announced that it would be building the largest rooftop farm in the world...in Brooklyn. It will grow up to one million pounds of veggies like tomatoes, lettuces and herbs each year. In New Orleans, the hardworking young crew behind Our School at Blair Grocery is bringing healthy soil and fresh food to the Lower Ninth Ward.
A study published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that people who believed they were taking a harmless weight-loss supplementended up with a type of bladder cancer. Also, it's official: fad diets don't work. Your best bet is to eat less and exercise more, same as ever.
Restaurants are thefastest-growing sector of the economy: the industry has added more than 560,000 jobs since the beginning of the employment recovery, with more than 200,000 of those positions created in the last six months.
In Florida, a number of class action lawsuits have been filed against major food retailers who allegedly sell honey that technically isn't "honey" because it does not contain pollen. Honey, milk and olive oil are among the most common food frauds in the U.S.
"Saturday Night Live" skewered the processed food industry last weekend with a parody commercial for "Almost Pizza." Not unrelated: yogurt, granola bars, tomato sauce and fat-free salad dressing have more sugar than a Twinkie, a Nashville Burger King is test-marketing a bacon sundae and Taco Bell's Doritos Locos-the intersection of fast food and processed snacks-appears to have increased positive consumer perception of both brands.

HEADLINE: U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Headed Up Again

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: An improvement in the economy and an unusually warm summer led to a 3.2 percent rise in national energy consumption in 2010, the E.P.A. reports. 

 BODY:
 After dropping for two years during the recession, emissions of the gases blamed for global warming rose in 2010 as the economy heated up, the Environmental Protection Agency reports.
 Output of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses were up 3.2 percent from 2009 as the nation climbed slowly out of the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, the E.P.A. said.
"The increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in economic output resulting in an increase in energy consumption across all sectors, and much warmer summer conditions resulting in an increase in electricity demand for air conditioning that was generated primarily by combusting coal and natural gas," the agency reported in its annual inventory of greenhouse gases.

The report, produced for domestic policymakers and for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, covers emissions of the six main greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. 
 It said that emissions of those gases dropped by about 8 percent from 2007 to 2009 after 15 years of fairly steady increases. Total United States emission rose 10.5 percent from 1990 to 2010.
 President Obama has promised the United Nations that domestic greenhouse gas emissions will fall "in the range of" 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 through a combination of government policy steps, energy innovations and the deployment of low-carbon production techniques. Emissions in 2010 were 5 percent below those of 2005, indicating that the goal could be met with aggressive efforts by government and industry.

HEADLINE: Ex-Goldman Director Faces New Insider Trading Claim

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal prosecutors say that Rajat K. Gupta, a former director at Goldman Sachs and Procter &#038; Gamble, tipped Raj Rajaratnam about Procter &#038; Gamble's sales forecasts in late 2008. 

 BODY:
Rajat K. Gupta, the former director of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble who is accused of leaking secret corporate information to the convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, faces a new insider-trading claim. 
In a letter filed with the court, the government accused Mr. Gupta of leaking to Mr. Rajaratnam sales forecasts for Procter & Gamble in late 2008.
Mr. Gupta tipped Mr. Rajaratnam off about "P.& G.'s organic sales growth forecast for the October-to-December quarter prior to P.& G.'s public announcement on or about Dec. 11, 2008," said the letter, which was made public on Monday.
Last October, prosecutors charged Mr. Gupta - the former global head of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company - with leaking to Mr. Rajaratnam boardroom secrets about Goldman and Procter & Gamble.
Mr. Gupta, 63, is the most prominent business executive ensnared by the Justice Department's sweeping crackdown to root out insider trading on Wall Street and in corporate America.
With Monday's new charge, the government has now accused Mr. Gupta of providing Mr. Rajaratnam with five separate illegal tips, including advance word about Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman during the financial crisis.
In another count, prosecutors say that in 2007, Mr. Gupta participated in a Goldman board call from the offices of the Galleon Group, the hedge fund run by Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Gupta learned that Goldman's earnings, set for release the next morning, were going to be strong, the government contends. About 25 minutes after the board call, trading records show that Galleon bought at least $70 million worth of Goldman shares, allowing the fund to profit when the bank's stock rose the next day.
Gary P. Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, has said his client is innocent of all charges and has called the government's charges "totally baseless."
Mr. Gupta's trial is set for May 21 before Judge Jed S. Rakoff in the Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Rajaratnam, who was convicted last May by a jury of orchestrating a huge insider trading ring, is serving an 11-year prison term.
In a letter to Judge Rakoff, the government said that the new accusation involving Procter & Gamble was based in part on instant message and e-mails that prosecutors reviewed last week as part of the pretrial discovery process.
Unlike the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, in which the government had dozens of secretly recorded telephone conversations between the hedge fund manager and his accomplices, in the case against Mr. Gupta, the government has no direct evidence that shows him engaging in insider trading. Instead, the government plans to build a case based on circumstantial evidence - like phone bills and trading records - to establish Mr. Gupta's guilt.

HEADLINE: Romney's Favorability Is Weakest on Record, Polling Shows

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has the weakest favorability ratings on record for a presumptive presidential nominee at this stage of the campaign, according to new polling by ABC News and The Washington Post. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is facing a severe crisis of popularity.
He has the weakest favorability ratings on record for a presumptive presidential nominee at this stage of the campaign, according to new polling by ABC News and The Washington Post. The organizations have been measuring such popularity since 1984.
Mr. Romney is in a situation that pollsters call "underwater": more people view him negatively than view him positively. His favorable rating is 35 percent, and his unfavorable rating stands at 47 percent.
He was the first nominee to be underwater in the Washington Post/ABC News poll in the eight presidential primary seasons it has been surveying the subject, the poll said. The pollsters attributed the results in part on the Republican primary process, which Americans viewed negatively overall, and on Mr. Romney's unpopularity among women. 
President Obama, by contrast, is more popular than he is unpopular: 56 percent viewed him positively, while 40 percent of those polled viewed him negatively.
Mr. Obama is more popular than he has been for two years, which the pollsters ascribed to the improving economy.
The poll was taken of Americans in general, but even when accounting just for registered voters, Mr. Romney is still underwater (40 percent of registered voters view him favorably, and 48 percent view him unfavorably). He also still lags behind Mr. Obama (54 percent of registered voters view the president positively, and 43 percent view him negatively).
The good news, if you can call it that, for Mr. Romney is that Bill Clinton was almost as unpopular as Mr. Romney when he was seeking the Democratic nomination in 1992. Mr. Clinton went on to win the election. 
However, he was not underwater; in fact, his favorable and unfavorable ratings were equal, at 37 percent each.
The Washington Post/ABC News poll was was conducted April 11 to 15 among 1,009 adults and has a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points.
Recent polling has shown conflicting outcomes this year, with Mr. Obama leading in a new CNN poll, and Mr. Romney leading with 47 percent of registered voters supporting him and 45 percent supporting Mr. Obama in the Gallup daily tracking poll. 
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this post incorrectly described the Gallop poll. It is the Washington Post/ABC News poll that was was conducted April 11 to 15 among 1,009 adults and has a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points, not the Gallop poll.

BYLINE: ANDREW KOHUT


HIGHLIGHT: One way or another, the presidential election of 2012 is going to defy conventional political wisdom. 

 BODY:
With the focus now fully on the campaign between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, commentary about the issues, the voting blocs and the strategies of the two campaigns dominates political discourse. But having polled on the last 10 presidential elections, I'm struck by a meta-question about each candidate's viability that may trump all else. Obama and Romney both carry so much political baggage that one or the other will have to defy modern political history to win in November. 
For Mitt Romney, the history buster would be that no candidate in the modern polling era with personal favorability ratings as low as his has ever won the presidency. With a 29 percent rating, he is far and away the least personally popular presidential candidate since pollsters have been regularly checking favorability ratings. 
Barack Obama is much more personally popular than Romney, but his problem is that no incumbent president has ever won re-election with unemployment rates as high as they are likely to be in November. The modest decline in the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's March report - to 8.2 percent - adds to the challenge he faces. In recent times, only Ronald Reagan struggled with a comparably high unemployment rate (8 percent) at the start of his re-election year. However, it declined steadily over the course of 1984 and it stood at 7.2 percent by Election Day.
Even if Obama succeeds in making further progress on unemployment, he is not likely to mirror Reagan's experience. He will remain vulnerable on the economy more generally.
While Obama's overall job rating inched up in recent months as the public heard somewhat better reports about the condition of the economy, at Pew our March survey continued to find a 53 percent majority disapproving of Obama's handling of the economy. 
And so it has been over the course of Obama's presidency. On average, only 10 percent of Americans have rated the national economy as excellent or good. For President George W. Bush, about 30 percent rated the national economy positively in his first term. In President Clinton's first term, an average of about 20 percent rated the economy excellent or good, but the numbers were markedly higher in late 1995 as his re-election approached (30 percent). 
Perhaps tellingly, the public's rating of the economy in the Obama years comes closest to its assessment of life under the first President Bush; in 1992 only about 10 percent held a positive opinion of the national economy in the final year of George Bush's one term in office.
Mitt Romney's personal unpopularity may well be as intractable for him as public opinion about the economy is for Obama. There is no indication in the polling that presidential candidates transform their personal images over the course of a general election campaign.
As Election Day approaches, favorable ratings for past candidates have typically remained about where they were early in the campaign - or have declined. The losing candidates Michael Dukakis, Bob Dole and Bush saw their personal popularity slip at the end of the campaign. But even at their low points, they were all much more personally popular than Romney is today. 
Romney may have somewhat more potential to improve public regard for him than past candidates, however, because his image took such a hit during the nomination race. More Americans had a favorable rating of the former Massachusetts governor late last year when the public first began paying attention. His favorable rating was 36 percent in November 2011, compared with 29 percent now. And his unfavorable rating has jumped from 42 percent to 51 percent. 
Obviously, this is the consequence of a very negative primary campaign struggle. Romney's personal image even soured among Republicans, who came to see him as less in tune with the needs of people like themselves. His elitist image led him to under-perform among working class voters in almost every primary. Growing numbers of Republican voters also came to see Romney as inconsistent on the issues. He ran poorly among voters who told exit pollsters that voting for the "true conservative" was what mattered most to them.
But both candidates struggle with huge handicaps. One of the oldest axioms about presidential elections is that they are referendums on the times. And for the 69 percent of the public who continue to say they are dissatisfied with national conditions, these are bad times. That is very bad news for Obama. However, Americans don't back candidates they don't like or trust. This is Romney's challenge.
There is no track record on how voters will resolve such conflicting pressures. Core Republicans and Democrats are certainly likely to rally to their party's standard bearer, but where the swing voters are headed in November is very unclear given the political burdens both candidates carry.
The variability in the polls these days may well be an indication of how difficult it will be for many voters to choose between a president they believe has underperformed and a challenger they are uncomfortable with personally. But whatever they do will defy modern political history.

HEADLINE: How the Buffett Rule Would Affect Small Businesses

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Generally, few owners would feel the pinch, but it would be a concern for many of those who sell their businesses. 

 BODY:
On Monday afternoon, the Senate is poised to consider - if only briefly - the so-called Buffett Rule, President Obama's plan to make sure that millionaires pay at least as much of their income in tax as middle-class Americans. Supporters, however, are not likely to find the 60 votes necessary for the Senate to actually debate the bill.
As with seemingly every proposed tax increase, opponents object that the Buffett Rule will hurt small businesses. "It represents a huge tax increase on job creators," Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who leads the House Budget Committee, said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" last Tuesday. "About 80 percent of our businesses file their taxes as individuals, so they would get hit by this Buffett Rule. Everybody thinks we're just going to tax the hedge fund manager and the movie star, what you're getting is that successful small business."
The sentiment isn't strictly partisan. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, appeared on "Morning Joe" the next day to agree with Mr. Ryan. Small businesses should "have some carve-out where, if they're investing, if they're creating jobs, they don't face a doubling of their tax rates," Mr. Coons said. "I do think that's a reasonable criticism of the Buffett Rule if just applied across the board."
But would small-business owners really be subject to the Buffett Rule? The evidence suggests that, for the most part, the answer is no.
The Buffett Rule has been described as a simple requirement that people making $1 million pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes. As legislation, the Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012 is a bit more complicated than that. It is in fact a 30 percent tax on adjusted gross income, less charitable deductions (so that the tax does not discourage philanthropy). From that "tentative fair share tax," the taxpayer subtracts regular income tax liability, any alternative minimum tax owed, and payroll tax (or, for the self-employed, half of self-employment taxes). Finally, the tax phases in as adjusted gross income approaches $2 million: a taxpayer with income of $1.25 million pays only a quarter of the tax; someone who earns $1.75 million pays three-quarters of the tax.
According to calculations by the Tax Policy Center, some 217,000 "tax units" (households, basically) would be subject to the Buffett Rule in 2015, or nearly half of all households making more than $1 million, assuming the Bush tax cuts are extended. Only 76,000 units earn above $2 million and would be subject to the full brunt of the tax. (This small set of tax units would likely include Mitt and Ann Romney, who paid just 14 percent of their adjusted gross income in federal taxes in 2010.) If the Bush tax cuts expire, the capital gains rate would rise to 20 percent and all dividends would be treated as ordinary income -- and in 2015, the number of tax units subject to Buffett would fall by 100,000.
So why is this proposal not really relevant to small businesses?
First, most small-business owners do not make $1 million. (And, of course, an even tinier percentage make more than $2 million.) But even among those who do, most would still not be subject to the Buffett Rule. That's because the proposal does not indiscriminately tax million-dollar earners. Rather, it taxes million-dollar earners who are not paying an effective 30 percent tax rate, and these, typically, are people who earn most of their money from stock dividends or capital gains on stock sales, both of which are taxed at just 15 percent, according to Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, who spoke to NPR about the proposal on Wednesday.
People who earn $1 million in salary or other kinds of "ordinary income" (such as, for example, movie stars) are probably already paying at least 30 percent of that income in taxes. This would include most of even the most successful small-business owners - the vast majority of all small-business owners report their income as deriving either from sole proprietorships, partnerships or S corporations, all taxed at ordinary income tax rates. (For someone earning at least $1 million and filing individually in 2012, that's 35 percent on all of the income over $388,350.)
That said, some very successful small-business owners would undoubtedly feel the Buffett pinch. Those who have structured their companies as C corporations, which pay out their earnings as dividends, would be subject to the tax if those dividends constituted the bulk of their income. Moreover, any owner who sells a company and pockets more than $1 million would end up paying more tax, since under the present rules, the transaction is taxed at the low capital gains rate, regardless of how the businesses are structured. (Presumably, if the Buffett Rule were to take effect, we might see more owners anticipating a million-dollar gain selling their companies on the installment plan, to spread that gain over several years and avoid triggering the tax.)
Nobody wants to pay more in taxes, but the favored treatment for capital gains is informed by a presumption that lower tax rates stimulate investment. So the crucial question is whether higher tax rates do indeed discourage investment, as Mr. Ryan and Mr. Coons suggest. Across the ideological divide from the Tax Policy Center, at the conservative Tax Foundation, economist Will McBride argues that they do, for big and small companies alike. In the NPR story, he imagined a scenario in which investors dumped their stocks in December, right before the Buffett Rule took effect in January, and argued that start-ups would be starved of much-needed seed capital. "The after-tax return on investment is lower," he later explained to The Agenda, "and the expected rate of return is what drives investment."
 But what would wealthy investors do with their money instead? They would have to do something - even socking it away in a bank account would earn interest, which would be subject to ordinary income tax rates. If capital gains no longer had preferential tax rates, but suffered no higher tax rates than other kinds of income, wouldn't investment in stocks or companies still look more attractive than the alternatives? "You have additional options besides investment generally," Mr. McBride said. "If the after-tax rate of investment goes down, then consumption starts looking a lot better. And that's what we've seen over the last few decades."
Mr. Williams, for his part, doesn't think highly of the Buffett Rule, though not because it might discourage investment. "People do hold onto assets longer because of higher capital gains rates," he said in an interview. "But with the tax rates we have today, I think there's general agreement among economists that it doesn't change behavior all that much. At the margin, there's always somebody who's going to move across the line. But I've seen no economic evidence that there will be a lot of people on that margin getting out of investment if taxes go up."
Rather, he objects because the rule substitutes a complicated solution for what should be a simple fix: ending the preferential treatment for stock dividends and capital gains. "If you've got a problem with the outcome, don't put a Band-aid over it and fix the symptom, which is somebody paying too low a tax rate," he said. "Fix the whole problem. You're just complicating the tax system one more time."

HEADLINE: The Challenge of Going Vegan

BYLINE: TARA PARKER-POPE


HIGHLIGHT: As countless aspiring vegans are discovering, the switch from omnivore to herbivore is fraught with physical, social and economic challenges. 

 BODY:
From Bill Clinton to Ellen DeGeneres, celebrities are singing the benefits of a vegandiet. Books that advocate plant-based eating are best sellers. But is eliminating meat and dairy as simple as it sounds?
As countless aspiring vegans are discovering, the switch from omnivore to herbivore is fraught with physical, social and economic challenges - at least, for those who don't have a personal chef. The struggle to give up favorite foods like cheese and butter can be made all the harder by harsh words and eye-rolling from unsympathetic friends and family members. Substitutes like almond milk and rice milk can shock the taste buds, and vegan specialty and convenience foods can cost two to three times what their meat and dairy equivalents do. And new vegans quickly discover that many foods in grocery stores and on restaurant menus have hidden animal ingredients.
"The dominant social-cultural norm in the West is meat consumption," said Hanna Schsler, a researcher in the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in Amsterdam, who has studied consumer acceptance of meat substitutes. "The people who want to shift to a more vegetarian diet find they face physical constraints and mental constraints. It's not very accepted in our society not to eat meat."
Still, the numbers are substantial, according to according to a 2008 report in Vegetarian Times. Three percent of American adults, 7.3 million people, follow a vegetarian diet, and one million of them are vegans, who eat no animal products at all - no meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, even honey. (And 23 million say they rarely eat meat.)
No one knows how many people have tried and failed to switch to vegan or vegetarian diets, but the popularity of books like "The China Study" and the "Skinny Bitch" series suggests that interest is growing. New vegans often cite Robert Kenner's 2008 documentary "Food, Inc.," which offers an unsettling view of corporate farming and the toll it takes on animals, the environment and human health.
Megan Salisbury, 33, a social work student in Phoenix, says she prefers plant-based eating but can manage it only about 75 percent of the time. The vegan options at the campus cafeteria are limited and often expensive, and she has to drive 20 miles to find stores with vegan specialty foods for cooking.
"I really enjoy eating the way I do," she said. "But even a box of Gardenburgers is $4 - which doesn't seem expensive, but when you compare it to the meat counterparts, it's so much more."
Frustrating, too, is the lack of social support. When Ms. Salisbury baked vegan doughnuts to share with her family, "they said things like, 'I'm going to go eat some eggs now,' " she said. "They were very condescending. They don't understand and don't make any effort to understand."
New vegans say it's hard to give up favorite foods and adjust to the taste of substitutes for butter and dairy products. For Linda Walsh of Wilmington, Vt., who was a vegetarian for 30 years before recently switching to a vegan diet, the toughest thing was giving up cheese. "I have become vegan anyway," she said. "But I think a great vegan cheese alternative will make for many, many more converts."
Giving up favorite foods is never easy, food scientists say, for it means overriding taste preferences imprinted on the brain during a lifetime of eating. "In most American adults, meat intake has been associated since childhood with pleasurable nutritional effects," said France Bellisle an eating behavior researcher in Paris. "Liking for meats has been learned and reinforced over years. Any substitute would have to mimic the total sensory experience elicited by meats.
"It always takes more motivation to change any type of behavior than to go on with old habits," she added.
Dairy products are particularly difficult to replace, says Daniel Granato, a researcher at the Federal University of Paran, Brazil, because the intrinsic attributes of dairy foods come from proteins and fats that are difficult to mimic in a nondairy substitute. And because people start consuming these foods in infancy, the taste preference is deeply ingrained.
"Usually dairy products made with milk fat are softer and present a very pleasant viscosity and texture," Dr. Granato said. "Consumers do feel the difference between milk-based and soy-based products. And once their first reference is milk-based products, they tend to reject plant-based products made with oat and soy or other vegetable-based food."
Vegan ingredients and cooking techniques can be overwhelming for beginners, even if the changes are relatively small. Substitutes like vegetarian margarine and nutritional yeast can impart an unaccustomed nutty or cheesy flavor. Another method for making vegan foods creamy or cheesy involves soaking and blending cashews.
"The one I found weird was miso paste," Ms. Salisbury said. "I used it in stuffed shells, but I haven't really mastered what it's for, but I think it's to help consistency."
Despite the challenges of plant-based eating in a meat-based world, would-be vegans say they will keep trying. Mary Bandrowski, 50, of Bainbridge Island in Washington, says she has been eating mostly vegetarian for years, but in the past few weeks has been moving to veganism after reading "Eat to Live," by Dr. Joel Fuhrman. She is also trying to push her family to eat fewer animal foods.
"I think my whole family should do this because I think it's better for them," she said. "But my husband is the Midwest meat-and-potatoes man. Coming home to vegetable-stuffed green peppers doesn't turn him on as much as a steak and baked potato would."

HEADLINE: Solid Retail Sales Lift Large-Cap Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rose on Monday as robust retail sales data helped large-cap consumer stocks, but a 4 percent slide in Apple hurt the Nasdaq.
Retail sales for March rose 0.8 percent, higher than forecast, pushing Procter & Gamble up 1.5 percent, and Wal-Mart Stores up 1.4 percent. 
But Apple shares, which were up 43 percent this year, fell 4.2 percent, to $580.13.
Spain's rising borrowing costs and a weak New York state manufacturing report stirred concerns about Europe's debt crisis and the economic recovery in the United States.
''The market behavior is fairly manic today and investors are confused after a mixed set of data, Spanish yields, and momentum stocks like Apple losing ground,'' James Dailey, portfolio manager at the Team Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pa., said. ''The confusion is leading to anxiety, and that's why we are seeing the blue chips, the large caps, outperform.''
Other drags on the Nasdaq included a slide of 9 percent in the shares of Mattel, the toy maker, on declining quarterly sales, and a 3 percent decline in Google shares ahead of a legal battle with Oracle.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 71.82 points, or 0.56 percent, to 12,921.41. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.69 of a point, or 0.05 percent, to 1,369.57. The Nasdaq composite index fell 22.93 points, or 0.76 percent, to close at 2,988.40.
Procter & Gamble, the world's largest household products company, closed at $66.78, up 1.5 percent, and helped bolster the Dow. Wal-Mart, another Dow component, ended at $60.58, up 1.4 percent.
Spain's 10-year government bond yields climbed above the 6 percent mark on Monday for the first time since the beginning of December. Spain has acknowledged that it has probably slipped into its second recession since 2009.
''Barring an accelerated flight of assets out of the euro zone and into U.S. equities, we see little reason for equities to rally appreciably above the most recent high,'' Peter Cecchini, managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York, said.
''Having said this, we are expecting a short-term bounce, which may lead to a retest of 1,400,'' he said.
Monday's mixed session followed a recent pullback, when both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 suffered their worst two-week percentage drops since late November on increasing concerns about the euro zone's debt crisis and weaker-than-expected economic data in the United States.
Mattel's quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations as price increases hurt sales of its Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, driving its stock down 9.1 percent to $31.01.
Shares of Google slid 3 percent to $606.07 on Monday, when jury selection got under way in a dispute over smartphone technology with Oracle. Shares of Oracle gained 0.5 percent to $28.64.
Interest rates were steady on Monday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32, to 100 5/32, and the yield fell to 1.98 percent from 1.99 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Impact of Atlantic Yards, for Good or Ill, Is Already Felt

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The battle over Atlantic Yards has already raged longer than the Civil War, with eight years of protests, petitions and lawsuits seeking to halt a project that promised to reshape the heart of Brooklyn.
Even now, as the oyster-shaped basketball arena that will anchor a 22-acre housing and office complex rises against the low-slung Brooklyn skyline, die-hard opponents are still resisting. Last week they packed a hearing held by two community boards to block the arena from speedily receiving a liquor license.
But almost six months before the Barclays Center opens its doors to the Nets, Brooklyn's first major professional sports team since the lamented Dodgers, the reality is that the Atlantic Yards project has already done the very thing that critics feared and supporters promoted: transform surrounding neighborhoods prized for their streets of tree-lined brownstones and low-key living. 
Shops along the workaday stretch of Flatbush Avenue south of the arena that for generations sold unglamorous products like hardware, paint, plumbing supplies, prescription drugs, even artificial limbs, are seeing new businesses pop up that sell high-heel shoes for $3,500 a pair, revealing party dresses, exotic cheeses and, of course, high-priced martinis. Dozens of restaurants and bars, with beguiling names like Fish and Sip and Va beh' (Italian slang for ''It's all good!''), have sprouted on major thoroughfares and serene side streets.
''The neighborhood is now becoming an entertainment mecca -- anything that's hip and of the moment,'' said Robert Schulman, who fits prosthetic devices for Allied Orthopedics, which has been on Flatbush Avenue for 25 years. ''The change was slowly growing, but once the arena came into play, it was exponential. Once a week, a new restaurant or clothing store is opening up.''
The commercial avenues radiating from the arena -- through Prospect Heights, Park Slope, Boerum Hill and Fort Greene-- had already been undergoing significant changes anyway as a result of the flood of young newcomers to the borough, who have driven up real estate prices and infused the area with an often parodied mix of the trendy and precious.
Along with community gardens and farm-to-table restaurants, visitors will find a purveyor of artisanal mayonnaise, an ''eco-friendly bar'' made of recycled oak floorboards from an old dairy farm, and, not far from the arena, Bark Hot Dogs, which offers franks topped with ''baked heirloom beans.''
But the changes have been visibly accelerated by the construction of the $450 million arena, the flagship of a $4.9 billion housing and office complex to be built over 25 years and known as Atlantic Yards, stoking the fears of longtime residents and even some of the new arrivals that traditions like stoop conversations at dusk and spring bulb-planting parties may be bleeding away.
For Forest City Ratner, the developer of the project, which was strongly backed by many city leaders, the changes are evidence that the arena has already met its goal of transforming a dreary section of Brooklyn -- the Long Island Rail Road's rail yards and surrounding industrial buildings, which the company's spokesman described as '' a scar that divided the neighborhood.''
''That's a sign of economic vitality, something that's good for the borough,'' said Joe DePlasco, the Ratner spokesman.
Indeed, some here have watched the construction with excitement, including condo owners who imagine a sharp rise in home values, new shop owners who anticipated the arena in their calculations, and even some longtime merchants looking forward to a surge of foot traffic.
Among these supporters is Moussa Dia, a Senegalese immigrant who owns Versailles, a year-old custom party-dress store that has been featured on MTV, who figured fans heading to Barclays will ''notice we're here.''
''It's a beautiful piece of art, the arena across the street,'' he said. ''The face of Flatbush is changing.''
In addition to the many changes that are already visible, opponents are even more concerned about those still to come after the arena opens Sept. 28, with a concert by Jay-Z, the rapper and part owner of the Nets.
They envision their narrow blocks inundated nightly with drunken, celebrating basketball fans -- though, to be fair, victories have been few and far between for the long-struggling franchise -- and concertgoers still reveling in the music and honking cars stalled in traffic.
The 19,000-seat arena plans 220 events a year. That kind of building should never have been allowed in a residential neighborhood, said Peter Krashes, president of the Dean Street Block Association.
''Potentially,'' said Tracy Collins, a photographer who owns a brownstone on Dean Street, ''there will be fans who've had a few beers in the arena being rowdy after a win or loss walking in front of my home, keeping me awake, possibly damaging my property, leaving trash.''
Sam Schwartz, the project's traffic engineering consultant, said the arena was working to limit the numbers of drivers and pedestrians by ensuring that most of the dozen subway lines to the area empty out directly into the arena's plaza; that express trains are provided at night; and that shuttle buses at remote parking areas pick up those who choose to drive.
The concerns about crowds prompted about 100 residents to attend a community board meeting last Tuesday night to fight an application for a liquor license by Barclays and the arena concessionaire, Levy Restaurants. Residents have also been fighting other proposed drinking establishments in the area.
The 14 promised residential towers, with 6,430 apartments, and two commercial buildings are so far in the future that they are not much on residents' lips. Mr. DePlasco said that work would start this year on the first of the apartment buildings, and that others could be built two decades from now.
But the company has repeatedly scrapped or scaled back more ambitious plans for the area, including the original design by Frank Gehry.
A ruling by a state appeals court last week, stemming from one of the lawsuits over the project, may cause additional delays in putting up most of the housing -- though not in building the arena itself -- by requiring the state to conduct a new environmental impact statement.
The ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court said that the Empire State Development Corporation conducted its environmental review based on a 10-year time frame, but that a 25-year schedule could force residents to ''tolerate vacant lots, above-ground arena parking and Phase II construction staging for decades.''
Yet Danae Oratowski, chairwoman of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council, said the shift from stores selling things people need to those selling things people want was already taking its toll on organically functioning neighborhoods and complicating residents' lives.
''People who live in Prospect Heights still need to get their clothes dry cleaned and shoes repaired,'' she said, ''and these businesses won't be around in a year.''
Though some stores, like the prosthetic device shop, are protected because their owners also own the buildings and are not worried about skyrocketing rents, others, like Flatbush Hardware, already fear what will happen when their leases expire. Paul Nation, a Jamaican immigrant who owns the hardware store, is negotiating with his landlord for a new lease.
''It's ridiculous what they're asking for,'' he said.
Yagil Kadosh, who opened Kulushkat Gourmet Falafel 10 months ago and bicycles to work from his nearby home, expects an upsurge in demand once the arena opens, though he denies that the arena motivated his choice of location.
''As a businessman it's good,'' he said. ''As a resident not so much. It turns a neighborhood into Midtown Manhattan.''

HEADLINE: Son's Parties and Privilege Aggravate Fall of Elite Chinese Family

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and DAN LEVIN; Reporting was contributed by Didi Kirsten Tatlow and Edward Wong from Beijing, John F. Burns and Ravi Somaiya from London, and Eric Newcomer from Cambridge, Mass.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- As the grandson of revolutionary giants, Bo Guagua enjoyed the prestige and privilege that accompanies membership in China's ''red aristocracy.''
After a pampered childhood in the walled compounds of the Chinese capital, he was sent off for schooling in England, where he developed a reputation as an academically indifferent bon vivant with a weakness for European sports cars, first-class air travel, equestrian sports and the tango.
Mr. Bo's flamboyance, a staple of social-media gossip in China in recent years, became another liability for his father, Bo Xilai, who faces charges of corruption and abuse of power, and his mother, Gu Kailai, accused of murdering a British businessman who was also close to the young Mr. Bo.
Although Communist Party insiders say it was Bo Xilai's populist reign in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing that ultimately brought him down, Bo Guagua's high living clearly irritated party leaders, who named the son, a 24-year-old student at Harvard, in the official statement describing the reasons for his father's fall from power. 
One former government employee with party ties said the leadership tolerated a certain level of corruption among top officials or their relatives as long as it was kept out of public view. He said Mr. Bo's collegiate antics, splashed across the Internet, were emblematic of an ambitious, cocksure family who often ignored the party's conservative standards of public behavior.
The resulting buzz also drew unwanted attention to other so-called princelings, who often leverage their bloodline for financial gain but generally seek to avoid publicity lest it damage the party's image of self-sacrifice and asceticism.
''If you're discreet, they look the other way,'' the former government employee said. ''But Guagua's behavior was striking by the standards; urinating against a fence at Oxford, kissing foreign girls -- it all goes down bad in China.''
Mr. Bo is also tied to Neil Heywood, whose mysterious death in a Chongqing hotel room last November appears to have led to the Communist Party's biggest political upheaval in decades.
Mr. Heywood reportedly mentored the adolescent Mr. Bo and later helped him land a spot at the elite Harrow School in North London. It is unclear how close the two were in recent years, but China's state media have suggested that there were shared business interests and a ''conflict'' that led his mother to commit murder.
As his parents remain in detention, Mr. Bo is finding that the family name that served him so well has become something of a millstone. Given the continuing corruption investigation that could implicate him, he is unlikely to return to China anytime soon.
''I think the options for him look pretty bad,'' said Roderick MacFarquhar, a China expert at Harvard who has written about the purges that dot contemporary Chinese history.
The details of Mr. Bo's life were remarkably public. He appeared on a Chinese talk show to discuss his family and allowed himself to be photographed partying bare-chested and with young women.
A short-lived relationship with Chen Xiaodan, the granddaughter of another Communist Party pioneer, became fodder for the public after the pair was photographed vacationing in Tibet, trailed by a sizable police escort.
His celebrity stood in marked contrast to the lives of other descendants of revolutionaries. Xi Mingze -- the daughter of Xi Jinping, presumed to be China's next top leader -- also attends Harvard, but under an assumed name, and she does not have a Facebook account.
Last month, a few days before he lost his job as party chief of Chongqing, Bo Xilai was forced to respond to questions about how his modest government salary could support his son's tuition and expensive tastes. He called the accusations ''sheer rubbish,'' and insisted that Mr. Bo had won full scholarships, although he did not address the allegations in detail. ''A few people have been pouring filth on Chongqing and me and my family,'' he told reporters. ''They even say my son studies abroad and drives a red Ferrari.''
But Mr. Bo does study abroad, and American officials say he arrived in a red Ferrari last year to pick up the American ambassador to China's daughter for a date. Classmates at Harvard say they have seen him driving around in a Porsche.
Mr. Bo has lately been staying out of public view, having changed his Facebook account to make it much more private, and he declined to answer questions last week as he left his apartment in Cambridge, Mass. Those who know him say he has been studying for final exams while coping with his parents' troubles.
In interviews, many of his friends rejected the notion that he was a playboy or a poor student, and they described him as exceedingly generous. He is quick to pick up a bar tab, they said, and he liberally handed out tickets for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. ''His concern for China and its people is deep-rooted and real,'' said one friend in China who spends time with him during his frequent visits home. ''He's a big thinker. When he gets drunk, he talks about important things.''
Mr. Bo was largely shaped by his years in Britain. When he arrived, at age 12, he failed to get into Harrow, a boarding school with $45,000 annual tuition at the time. Although he told a Chinese magazine in 2009 that he spent a year studying for the Harrow entrance exam, Mr. Heywood, an old Harrovian, told friends he used his influence to land Mr. Bo a place at the school.
Mr. Bo became the first Chinese citizen at the 500-year-old institution, and by most accounts, he flourished. He took up fencing, became president of the equestrian club and developed proper English manners.
In 2006, he arrived at Oxford's Balliol College, known for its lumbering lawn tortoises and its illustrious alumni, including Aldous Huxley, Adam Smith and Herbert Asquith, a British prime minister who once described Balliol men as having ''the tranquil consciousness of an effortless superiority.''
Oxford administrators dismissed the idea that Bo Xilai's stature as a rising political star played any role in his son's admission. ''That kind of stuff just doesn't happen,'' said Ruth Collier, Oxford's head of information. ''If this young man won a place at Balliol, he got in on his merits.''
Mr. Bo pursued a degree in politics, philosophy and economics, and embraced a more public profile, appearing in the Chinese version of Esquire and earning the Big Ben Award as one of the top 10 young Chinese in Britain.
According to a friend from his Oxford days, Mr. Bo became known for his ''professional socializing,'' which included organizing a Silk Road ball for the Oxford Union, the university's premier debating society. Mr. Bo tapped into his extensive connections by arranging an appearance by the actor Jackie Chan and financial sponsorship from a minibus manufacturer in Liaoning Province, where his father had served as governor.
He also demonstrated some of his father's political drive when, in his second year, he ran for union librarian, a post equivalent to vice president. It was an all-consuming effort, friends say, and Mr. Bo broke with the tradition of low-key politicking by actively canvassing for votes on Cornmarket Street, a pedestrian boulevard in an area surrounded by Oxford colleges. He also ruffled some feathers according to several Oxford students, by asking Chinese students to join the union so they could vote for him. The campaign was unsuccessful.
While adept at throwing memorable parties, Mr. Bo was struggling with his coursework. After the union campaign, his professors forced him to take a set of exams known as ''penal collections.'' He failed, several students said, and was suspended for a year. Barred from using campus facilities, he moved into the Randolph, a Victorian Gothic hotel where he continued to hold parties, though a friend said they were more subdued.
His family was not pleased. Using their connections, they reportedly sent a group of emissaries, including the Chinese ambassador, to plead Mr. Bo's case to the master of Balliol, one faculty member said. Expulsion, it was explained, would cause his family grave embarrassment.
Although the request was denied, Mr. Bo was allowed to take his final exams a year later and passed with respectable marks, ''much to people's surprise,'' one professor said. Mr. Bo's tutors remained unimpressed and refused to write him recommendations for his application to Harvard.
But Mr. Bo was admitted to the John F. Kennedy School of Government, where tuition and living expenses can cost $90,000 a year. Administrators do not disclose information on scholarships and would not comment on whether Mr. Bo's family connections played a role in his admission. But a spokesman said the school considers a ''holistic'' approach to applicants, weighing factors like leadership potential and a commitment to public service.
Although one classmate described Mr. Bo as academically lackadaisical, others suggested that he had become more serious about his studies. Last year, he helped organize a China trip for Kennedy School students that included a visit to Chongqing. ''From my interactions with him, leaving aside all the gossip, he is a smart lad,'' one professor said. ''He seems to be a typical British public school product: smart, headstrong and self-confident.''
Despite the flashes of bravado, friends say that Mr. Bo is acutely aware that in China, the benefits of an illustrious family name can also be a detriment. His grandfather Bo Yibo was a revolutionary hero, but that did not shield him from the purges that sent him and much of his family to jail. ''I have never met my grandmother because she was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution,'' he said in a speech at Peking University in 2009.
In a interview that year with Youth Weekend, a state-run Chinese newspaper, he reflected on the other challenges of his pedigree. ''When I do well, it is naturally through my own efforts. When I do wrong, I should bear the consequences and do not want the blame to fall on my parents,'' he said. ''Although I am fully aware that my father is a good man, I do not wish to live under his shadow.''

HEADLINE: French Duo See (Well) Past Tax Rise for Richest

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- High earners who are worried that this year's Tax Day will be the last one before their rates rise have more than just the White House and Washington to blame. They can also look to two academically revered, if publicly obscure, left-leaning French economists whose work is the subtext for the battle over tax fairness.
Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty have spent the last decade tracking the incomes of the poor, the middle class and the rich in countries across the world. More than anything else, their work shows that the top earners in the United States have taken a bigger and bigger share of overall income over the last three decades, with inequality nearly as acute as it was before the Great Depression.
Known in Washington and the economics profession by the of-course-you-know shorthand ''Piketty-Saez,'' the two have been denounced on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and won mention in White House budget documents. 
Mr. Saez, 39, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has won the John Bates Clark Medal, an economic laurel considered second only to the Nobel, as well as a MacArthur Fellowship grant. Mr. Piketty, 40, of the Paris School of Economics, has won Le Monde's prize for best young economist, among other awards.
Both admire, even adore, the United States, they say, for its entrepreneurial drive, innovative spirit and, not least, its academic excellence: the two met while re-searchers in Cambridge, Mass. But both also express bewilderment over the current conversation about whether the wealthy, who have taken most of America's income gains over the last 30 years, should be paying higher taxes.
''The United States is getting accustomed to a completely crazy level of inequality,'' Mr. Piketty said, with a degree of wonder. ''People say that reducing inequality is radical. I think that tolerating the level of inequality the United States tolerates is radical.''
As much as Mr. Piketty's and Mr. Saez's work has informed the national debate over earnings and fairness, their proposed corrective remains far outside the bounds of polite political conversation: much, much higher top marginal tax rates on the rich, up to 50 percent, or 70 percent or even 90 percent, from the current top rate of 35 percent.
The two economists argue that even Democrats' boldest plan to increase taxes on the wealthy -- the Buffett Rule, a 30 percent minimum tax on earnings over $1 million -- would do little to reverse the rich's gains. Many of the Republican tax proposals on the table might increase income inequality, at least in the short term, according to William G. Gale of the Tax Policy Center and many other left-leaning and centrist economists.
Conservatives respond that high tax rates would stifle economic growth, at a minimum, and cause some businesses and high-income workers to flee to other countries. When top American tax rates were much higher, from the 1940s through the 1970s, businesses could not relocate as easily as they can now, say critics of Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez.
''I materially disagree with the idea you can raise a marginal tax rate to 70 percent and not have an impact on economic growth,'' said Ike Brannon, an economist at the American Action Forum. ''It's absurd on its face.''
But Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez argue that history is on their side: Many countries have higher tax rates -- and the United States has had higher tax rates -- without stifling growth or encouraging the concentration of income in the hands of the very rich.
''In a way, the United States is becoming like Old Europe, which is very strange in historical perspective,'' Mr. Piketty said. ''The United States used to be very egalitarian, not just in spirit but in actuality. Inequality of wealth and income used to be much larger in France. And very high taxes on the very rich -- that was invented in the United States,'' he said.
Mr. Saez added, ''Absent drastic policy changes, I doubt that income inequality will decline on its own.''
The two economists' project of mapping income inequality started two decades ago, when Mr. Saez was teaching at Harvard and Mr. Piketty teaching down the road at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Their innovation was to measure American income inequality historically. Existing data went back only to the 1970s. Tedious archival research at the Internal Revenue Service allowed them to stretch the data all the way back to 1913.
Once they had collected the data, the computation was easy. They figured out the benchmark for various income levels -- the top 10 percent, top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent of earners, for instance -- and calculated what share of income each group took each year.
What they found startled them. As in other industrially advanced countries, income inequality in the United States fell after World War II, a period that economic historians call the ''Great Compression,'' and remained stable through much of the 1970s.
But then inequality started increasing again, with the top 1 percent of earners drawing a bigger and bigger share of overall income. Their graph showing the trend became well-known: a deep U, with inequality as acute today as it was just before the depression.
When they first published their work, income inequality was mostly off the political radar screen, thanks to the 1990s boom, Mr. Saez said.
''Growing inequality was not perceived to be an issue because the economy was growing fast and even the incomes of the 99 percent were growing significantly,'' he said.
But the deep downturn of the last few years, and Mr. Obama's election, brought the issue back to the fore. Peter R. Orszag, the former Obama budget director, has said the Piketty-Saez work ''helped to point the way for the administration in its pledge to rebalance the tax code.''
Now living many time zones apart, Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez update their work with frequent e-mails, Skype conversations and data-sharing through Dropbox.
They have found that the trends have mostly continued. From 2000 to 2007, incomes for the bottom 90 percent of earners rose only about 4 percent, once adjusted for inflation. For the top 0.1 percent, incomes climbed about 94 percent.
The recession interrupted the trend, with the sharp decline in stock prices hitting the pocketbooks of the rich. But the income share of 1 percent has since rebounded. Data that the two economists released in March showed that the top 1 percent of earners got nearly every dollar of the income gains eked out in the first full year of the recovery. In 2010, the top 10 percent of earners took about half of overall income.
That has led the two economists to renew their calls for higher rates on the rich. Along with Peter Diamond, an emeritus professor at M.I.T. and a Nobel laureate, Mr. Saez has estimated the ''optimal'' top tax rates for the wealthy -- getting the most revenue from those most able to surrender it -- to be between 45 and 70 percent.
In France, Francois Hollande, the Socialist who may well succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as president, wants to raise the top marginal income tax rate to 75 percent, calling earnings over a million euros ''impossible.'' A candidate yet farther on the left suggests a top rate of 100 percent.''The debate in Washington is between the Bush-era and Clinton-era tax rates,'' said Mr. Diamond, whom Mr. Obama nominated to the Federal Reserve and Republicans blocked. ''Our finding is that the debate should be between the pre-1986 Reagan tax rate, which was 50 percent, and the rates that existed from Johnson until Reagan,'' which were higher.
''Thirty percent is three times smaller than the 91 percent of Roosevelt,'' Mr. Piketty said, responding to the Buffett Rule proposal and referring to the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who engineered the New Deal. ''And inequality is greater than in the time of Roosevelt.''

CHART: Income Earned by the Wealthiest: Work by the French economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty shows income inequality growing in the United States, with the top 1 percent of earners taking home more and more of the nation's income. The wealthiest received nearly a quarter of U.S. income before the Great Depression, but their share fell after World War II. It began rising again after top marginal tax rates decreased significantly in the 1980s. (Source: Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez

HEADLINE: A Sharp Rise in Retractions Prompts Calls for Reform

BYLINE: By CARL ZIMMER

 BODY:
In the fall of 2010, Dr. Ferric C. Fang made an unsettling discovery. Dr. Fang, who is editor in chief of the journal Infection and Immunity, found that one of his authors had doctored several papers.
It was a new experience for him. ''Prior to that time,'' he said in an interview, ''Infection and Immunity had only retracted nine articles over a 40-year period.''
The journal wound up retracting six of the papers from the author, Naoki Mori of the University of the Ryukyus in Japan. And it soon became clear that Infection and Immunity was hardly the only victim of Dr. Mori's misconduct. Since then, other scientific journals have retracted two dozen of his papers, according to the watchdog blog Retraction Watch.
''Nobody had noticed the whole thing was rotten,'' said Dr. Fang, who is a professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine. 
Dr. Fang became curious how far the rot extended. To find out, he teamed up with a fellow editor at the journal, Dr. Arturo Casadevall of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. And before long they reached a troubling conclusion: not only that retractions were rising at an alarming rate, but that retractions were just a manifestation of a much more profound problem -- ''a symptom of a dysfunctional scientific climate,'' as Dr. Fang put it.
Dr. Casadevall, now editor in chief of the journal mBio, said he feared that science had turned into a winner-take-all game with perverse incentives that lead scientists to cut corners and, in some cases, commit acts of misconduct.
''This is a tremendous threat,'' he said.
Last month, in a pair of editorials in Infection and Immunity, the two editors issued a plea for fundamental reforms. They also presented their concerns at the March 27 meeting of the National Academies of Sciences committee on science, technology and the law.
Members of the committee agreed with their assessment. ''I think this is really coming to a head,'' said Dr. Roberta B. Ness, dean of the University of Texas School of Public Health. And Dr. David Korn of Harvard Medical School agreed that ''there are problems all through the system.''
No one claims that science was ever free of misconduct or bad research. Indeed, the scientific method itself is intended to overcome mistakes and misdeeds. When scientists make a new discovery, others review the research skeptically before it is published. And once it is, the scientific community can try to replicate the results to see if they hold up.
But critics like Dr. Fang and Dr. Casadevall argue that science has changed in some worrying ways in recent decades -- especially biomedical research, which consumes a larger and larger share of government science spending.
In October 2011, for example, the journal Nature reported that published retractions had increased tenfold over the past decade, while the number of published papers had increased by just 44 percent. In 2010 The Journal of Medical Ethics published a study finding the new raft of recent retractions was a mix of misconduct and honest scientific mistakes.
Several factors are at play here, scientists say. One may be that because journals are now online, bad papers are simply reaching a wider audience, making it more likely that errors will be spotted. ''You can sit at your laptop and pull a lot of different papers together,'' Dr. Fang said.
But other forces are more pernicious. To survive professionally, scientists feel the need to publish as many papers as possible, and to get them into high-profile journals. And sometimes they cut corners or even commit misconduct to get there.
To measure this claim, Dr. Fang and Dr. Casadevall looked at the rate of retractions in 17 journals from 2001 to 2010 and compared it with the journals' ''impact factor,'' a score based on how often their papers are cited by scientists. The higher a journal's impact factor, the two editors found, the higher its retraction rate.
The highest ''retraction index'' in the study went to one of the world's leading medical journals, The New England Journal of Medicine. In a statement for this article, it questioned the study's methodology, noting that it considered only papers with abstracts, which are included in a small fraction of studies published in each issue. ''Because our denominator was low, the index was high,'' the statement said.
Monica M. Bradford, executive editor of the journal Science, suggested that the extra attention high-impact journals get might be part of the reason for their higher rate of retraction. ''Papers making the most dramatic advances will be subject to the most scrutiny,'' she said.
Dr. Fang says that may well be true, but adds that it cuts both ways -- that the scramble to publish in high-impact journals may be leading to more and more errors. Each year, every laboratory produces a new crop of Ph.D.'s, who must compete for a small number of jobs, and the competition is getting fiercer. In 1973, more than half of biologists had a tenure-track job within six years of getting a Ph.D. By 2006 the figure was down to 15 percent.
Yet labs continue to have an incentive to take on lots of graduate students to produce more research. ''I refer to it as a pyramid scheme,'' said Paula Stephan, a Georgia State University economist and author of ''How Economics Shapes Science,'' published in January by Harvard University Press.
In such an environment, a high-profile paper can mean the difference between a career in science or leaving the field. ''It's becoming the price of admission,'' Dr. Fang said.
The scramble isn't over once young scientists get a job. ''Everyone feels nervous even when they're successful,'' he continued. ''They ask, 'Will this be the beginning of the decline?' ''
University laboratories count on a steady stream of grants from the government and other sources. The National Institutes of Health accepts a much lower percentage of grant applications today than in earlier decades. At the same time, many universities expect scientists to draw an increasing part of their salaries from grants, and these pressures have influenced how scientists are promoted.
''What people do is they count papers, and they look at the prestige of the journal in which the research is published, and they see how may grant dollars scientists have, and if they don't have funding, they don't get promoted,'' Dr. Fang said. ''It's not about the quality of the research.''
Dr. Ness likens scientists today to small-business owners, rather than people trying to satisfy their curiosity about how the world works. ''You're marketing and selling to other scientists,'' she said. ''To the degree you can market and sell your products better, you're creating the revenue stream to fund your enterprise.''
Universities want to attract successful scientists, and so they have erected a glut of science buildings, Dr. Stephan said. Some universities have gone into debt, betting that the flow of grant money will eventually pay off the loans. ''It's really going to bite them,'' she said.
With all this pressure on scientists, they may lack the extra time to check their own research -- to figure out why some of their data doesn't fit their hypothesis, for example. Instead, they have to be concerned about publishing papers before someone else publishes the same results.
''You can't afford to fail, to have your hypothesis disproven,'' Dr. Fang said. ''It's a small minority of scientists who engage in frank misconduct. It's a much more insidious thing that you feel compelled to put the best face on everything.''
Adding to the pressure, thousands of new Ph.D. scientists are coming out of countries like China and India. Writing in the April 5 issue of Nature, Dr. Stephan points out that a number of countries -- including China, South Korea and Turkey -- now offer cash rewards to scientists who get papers into high-profile journals. She has found these incentives set off a flood of extra papers submitted to those journals, with few actually being published in them. ''It clearly burdens the system,'' she said.
To change the system, Dr. Fang and Dr. Casadevall say, start by giving graduate students a better understanding of science's ground rules -- what Dr. Casadevall calls ''the science of how you know what you know.''
They would also move away from the winner-take-all system, in which grants are concentrated among a small fraction of scientists. One way to do that may be to put a cap on the grants any one lab can receive.
Such a shift would require scientists to surrender some of their most cherished practices -- the priority rule, for example, which gives all the credit for a scientific discovery to whoever publishes results first. (Three centuries ago, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz were bickering about who invented calculus.) Dr. Casadevall thinks it leads to rival research teams' obsessing over secrecy, and rushing out their papers to beat their competitors. ''And that can't be good,'' he said.
To ease such cutthroat competition, the two editors would also change the rules for scientific prizes and would have universities take collaboration into account when they decide on promotions.
Ms. Bradford, of Science magazine, agreed. ''I would agree that a scientist's career advancement should not depend solely on the publications listed on his or her C.V.,'' she said, ''and that there is much room for improvement in how scientific talent in all its diversity can be nurtured.''
Even scientists who are sympathetic to the idea of fundamental change are skeptical that it will happen any time soon. ''I don't think they have much chance of changing what they're talking about,'' said Dr. Korn, of Harvard.
But Dr. Fang worries that the situation could be become much more dire if nothing happens soon. ''When our generation goes away, where is the new generation going to be?'' he asked. ''All the scientists I know are so anxious about their funding that they don't make inspiring role models. I heard it from my own kids, who went into art and music respectively. They said, 'You know, we see you, and you don't look very happy.' ''

HEADLINE: Antipoverty Tax Program Offers Relief, Though Often Temporary

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
DURHAM, N.C. -- Karen Spain spent several long months before receiving her tax refund this year in a state of suspended panic. The rent was three months late. Her car's brakes were shot. And she could no longer afford to pay her electricity bill.
So when the refund finally arrived -- a $7,200 cash infusion that was about a third of what she earned all last year as an assistant manager at an auto parts store -- it brought a certain measure of relief, both financial and psychological. That did not last long.
''Did we celebrate?'' said Ms. Spain, a 49-year-old mother of two. ''No. We maintain, that's all we do. We are just trying to keep our heads above water.''
It is tax time, the season when the country's largest antipoverty program, the earned income tax credit, plows billions of dollars into mailboxes and bank accounts of low-income working Americans like Ms. Spain. It is the most important financial moment of the year for many people in the bottom half of the wage bracket, a time to pay off old bills, make car repairs, buy children clothes and maybe make a big purchase like a refrigerator or a TV. 
As incomes among the country's lowest wage earners continue to stagnate, the credit has played a critical role in smoothing the hard edges of an unforgiving labor market for the country's most vulnerable workers and helping stem the tide of income inequality that has been rising among Americans in recent decades.
Nearly one in five filers now receive the credit -- about 28 million returns in the 2010 tax year, the most recent year figures are available -- representing the highest percentage since the program began in the 1970s, according to the Brookings Institution.
The effect has been significant. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group based in Washington, estimates the credit lifted about six million Americans out of poverty last year.
''We find clear evidence that the E.I.T.C. has significantly reduced poverty rates and income inequality,'' said Raj Chetty, an economist at Harvard who has studied the subsidy's effect across cities. ''The program is pulling up the lower end of the income distribution.''
The credit also seems to have an important psychological side effect: It makes people feel middle class.
''You get this feeling of, 'Hey, I'm like them now,' '' said Wesley Rouse, 27, a property manager in Durham.
But the boost is often temporary. Many people who receive the credit fall back into poverty over the course of the year, caught in the same cycle of low-wage work and reliance on credit that put them there in the first place.
One problem is the form the credit takes. The refund can pay as much as 40 percent of a family's annual income at once, a windfall that many experts are now arguing should be changed by paying the refund in installments over the year.
''It's feast or famine,'' said Mae Watson Grote, director of the Financial Clinic, a New York-based group that teaches financial planning to low-income New Yorkers. ''It's very hard to manage when it's a windfall.''
That cycle has the natural force of a tide at National Pawn, a shop in a working-class area of north Raleigh.
''We're all cleaned out,'' said Sundeep Joshi, the store's manager, waving his hand toward empty shelves, reflecting a whirlwind of recent purchases. But people will start to bring things back to sell as their budgets get squeezed, he said. By July, the back room is usually packed with pawned items. ''That's the story every year,'' he said.
Kathryn Edin, a professor of public policy at Harvard whose coming book, ''It's Not Like I'm Poor: How Working Families Make Ends Meet in a Post-Welfare World,'' finds that recipients spent the subsidy overwhelmingly on bills and current expenses. Less than 10 percent of the money paid out was saved, she found. ''The E.I.T.C. is one of the best social policies we've ever devised, but it does not solve the fundamental problem that you still can't live on your wages,'' she said.
For Ms. Spain, the subsidy was a lifeline. Together with other tax credits, it pushed her family income up to about $27,000, above the federal poverty threshold of $22,800 for a family of four in 2011. (Her husband, an unemployed cook, did not earn much income.)
But the money went fast. Rent ate up a third. Then came brakes and a new bumper for her 1998 Honda Civic. She paid the overdue electricity bill, reactivated her car insurance and bought some new clothes for her two girls, ages 8 and 9.
''You get these large sums, but you have to repair things, and pay back rent, and you owe on all your bills,'' Ms. Spain said. ''I'm not at the point where I can put $500 aside and just let it sit there and grow.''
That economic vulnerability has spawned an industry of lenders who hawk short-term loans at exorbitant rates to tide people over until tax time, said Peter Skillern, executive director of Reinvestment Partners, a nonprofit organization in Durham that helps low-income families file their taxes. The practice, known as ''refund anticipation lending,'' was effectively banned by federal regulators this month, but low-income filers still face an abundance of rip-off schemes and high tax preparation fees, he said.
''It's 'What can I get today versus what's coming tomorrow,' '' said Brenda Dozier, a payroll specialist who said her sister has relied on refund anticipation loans. ''I tell people, 'You made it this far, just hold on.' ''
Ms. Spain said she paid a company $550 to do her taxes last year so she could get them -- and the refund -- back fast, an expenditure she now regrets.
The credit may not permanently change people's circumstances, but researchers are finding evidence that many who receive it do not do so for very long. One recent study found that 60 percent of those who got the benefit stopped claiming it after two years. That is because people's finances tend to be fluid, moving them in and out of the program, said John Horowitz, an economist at Ball State University in Indiana, one of the authors of the study, which examined tax records from 1989 to 2006. One in two American families with children received the credit at least once during that period, he said.
Ms. Spain yearns for a time when she will no longer be eligible for the credit because she is earning more money. She remembers wistfully her former job at Nortel that paid $85,000 a year and the feeling of going to a restaurant or a movie without worrying about her budget.
''Someday we'll wait and file in April,'' she said. ''And if we need money before then, we'll just go to the bank.''

HEADLINE: Reasons for Cohabiting

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Downside of Cohabiting Before Marriage,'' by Meg Jay (Sunday Review, April 15), is proof of the truism, universally acknowledged, that cohabitation exists in the shadow of marriage. Fear-mongering about divorce tells us less about social science regarding marriage than about our worries of national moral and economic decline. 
Cohabitation is indeed the more common pathway to legal marriage, and since the 1920s it has become increasingly common to think of cohabitation as a compatibility test for marriage. It is time not to expand the tests imposed for cohabitation but to accept that there are many types of cohabitation and reasons for it.
ELIZABETH PLECK Champaign, Ill., April 15, 2012
The writer, professor emerita of history at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, is the author of the forthcoming ''Not Just Roommates: Cohabitation After the Sexual Revolution.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Goldman Director in New Insider Trading Claim

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Rajat K. Gupta, the former director of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble who is accused of leaking secret corporate information to the convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, faces a new insider-trading claim. 
In a letter filed with the court, the government accused Mr. Gupta of leaking to Mr. Rajaratnam sales forecasts for Procter & Gamble in late 2008.
Mr. Gupta tipped Mr. Rajaratnam off about ''P.& G.'s organic sales growth forecast for the October-to-December quarter prior to P.& G.'s public announcement on or about Dec. 11, 2008,'' said the letter, which was made public on Monday.
Last October, prosecutors charged Mr. Gupta - the former global head of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company - with leaking to Mr. Rajaratnam boardroom secrets about Goldman and Procter & Gamble.
Mr. Gupta, 63, is the most prominent business executive ensnared by the Justice Department's sweeping crackdown to root out insider trading on Wall Street and in corporate America.
With Monday's new charge, the government has now accused Mr. Gupta of providing Mr. Rajaratnam with five separate illegal tips, including advance word about Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman during the financial crisis.
In another count, prosecutors say that in 2007, Mr. Gupta participated in a Goldman board call from the offices of the Galleon Group, the hedge fund run by Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Gupta learned that Goldman's earnings, set for release the next morning, were going to be strong, the government contends. About 25 minutes after the board call, trading records show that Galleon bought at least $70 million worth of Goldman shares, allowing the fund to profit when the bank's stock rose the next day.
Gary P. Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, has said his client is innocent of all charges and has called the government's charges ''totally baseless.''
Mr. Gupta's trial is set for May 21 before Judge Jed S. Rakoff in the Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Rajaratnam, who was convicted last May by a jury of orchestrating a huge insider trading ring, is serving an 11-year prison term.
In a letter to Judge Rakoff, the government said that the new accusation involving Procter & Gamble was based in part on instant message and e-mails that prosecutors reviewed last week as part of the pretrial discovery process.
Unlike the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, in which the government had dozens of secretly recorded telephone conversations between the hedge fund manager and his accomplices, in the case against Mr. Gupta, the government has no direct evidence that shows him engaging in insider trading. Instead, the government plans to build a case based on circumstantial evidence - like phone bills and trading records - to establish Mr. Gupta's guilt.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Panel Unites In Anger Over a Trip To Las Vegas

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It is a remarkable moment when Congressional Democrats and Republicans turn their scorn from each other and join forces to focus it on someone else.
But that is precisely what happened on Monday when members of both parties on a Congressional oversight committee grilled the former head and other officials from the General Services Administration over profligate spending at a conference held in Las Vegas in 2010, which included taxpayer-financed hotel suites, tuxedos and Italian wine, and an appearance by a clown.
One by one, committee members took aim like heat-seeking missiles at the witnesses, although one -- Jeffrey Neely, the official who helped plan the Las Vegas event, which cost more than $800,000 -- repeatedly refused to answer questions, even one confirming his job title, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. Lawmakers criticized the officials for the huge expenditures; for a bonus received by Mr. Neely, a regional commissioner at the agency, even after the event came under scrutiny; for general outrageousness; and, in one case, for the nerve of giving revelers commemorative knickknacks made in China. 
The lavish spending, which came to light last month, seemed almost like a parody of taxpayers' worst nightmare of their dollars at work: parties, glad-handing and drinking toward no apparent end. The agency's inspector general conducted a yearlong investigation of the four-day conference, in which 300 people were flown to the M Resort Spa and Casino.
That investigation resulted in the resignation of the head of the G.S.A., Martha Johnson, as well as of Robert Peck, the chief of the Public Buildings Service, which is part of the agency, and of Ms. Johnson's top adviser, Stephen Leeds. Mr. Neely -- who Ms. Johnson said had a larger salary than she did -- and others were put on leave.
In blunt testimony, Ms. Johnson described her revulsion at the findings of the investigation, which came at her request. ''The Western Regions conference,'' Ms. Johnson said, ''which had been an economical, straightforward set of training sessions in the late 1990s, had evolved into a raucous, extravagant, arrogant, self-congratulatory event that ultimately belittled federal workers.''
The investigation found that Mr. Neely had bragged about the expenditures. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said to Mr. Neely: ''It's not your money! It's the taxpayers' money!''
The G.S.A. is essentially the federal government's landlord and manages buildings and office space. The event under investigation was the Western regional conference of the Public Buildings Service, in October 2010.
According to the report, Mr. Neely wrote of his high-flying event: ''I know I'm bad, but why not enjoy it while we can? It ain't gonna last forever.'' The planning for the conference began with numerous trips to Las Vegas, also with high price tags, to test the general fabulousness of Las Vegas as a spot for a government conference. The agency will seek to recoup the money.
Lawmakers poked at everything from Mr. Neely's bonus, which Ms. Johnson failed to explain fully, to the high cost of lunch -- mini-Monte Cristo sandwiches at $5 a pop -- to a $75,000 team-building exercise in which bikes were assembled and later donated to the Boys and Girls Clubs. ''Giving bicycles to indigent children is a beautiful thing,'' said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina. ''Lots of people do it. I just hate that you robbed yourself of the satisfaction by using other people's money to do it.''
In the silver lining department, Inspector General Brian D. Miller, who conducted the investigation -- which revealed, among other things, that some witnesses feared being ''squashed like a bug'' in retribution for their revelations -- concluded in his testimony that ''the oversight system worked.''
The other person who had a bad day was David E. Foley, a former deputy commissioner for the agency, who was criticized during the hearing for his banter in a video released by the panel that mocked the spending of taxpayer dollars. He was just doing something ''similar to a comedic roast,'' he said. But he added, ''I realize I missed an opportunity to address nearly 300 people in my organization and stress the work we do.''
Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who leads the oversight committee, said the episode underscored distrust of government. ''What has come to light surrounding G.S.A.'s activities should give pause to anyone who has opposed cutting government size and spending,'' he said.

HEADLINE: How Well, and How Poorly, We Harvest Ocean Life

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
OVERFISHING
What Everyone Needs to Know
By Ray Hilborn
168 pages. Oxford University Press. $16.95.
To hear some people tell it, the increasingly energetic and sophisticated fishing industry has left the world's oceans a shambles, with species of cod, sharks, tuna and other fish hunted almost to extinction and vast stretches of the ocean floor wrecked by bottom-scraping trawlers.
To hear some other people tell it, many depleted stocks are recovering nicely. 
Ray Hilborn, a fisheries scientist at the University of Washington, wades into this disagreement in his new book and comes out with a lucid explication of a highly tangled issue.
Each argument, he concludes, has some truth on its side. ''It depends on where you look,'' he writes. ''You can paint horror story after horror story if you want. You can paint success after success.''
He navigates the path between horror and success through scores of questions and answers, nearly all of which demonstrate how difficult it is to sort this issue out.
Take the most basic question: What is overfishing? There are several answers, the book tells us. There is ''yield overfishing,'' in which people take so many fish that they leave too few to spawn or catch too many fish before they are grown. Then there is ''economic overfishing,'' in which economic benefits are less than they could be. If too many boats chase too few fish, for example, the struggle to make a good catch leads to overspending on boats, fuel and so on.
(There is also ''ecological overfishing,'' but that is something we must live with as long as we want to eat fish, Dr. Hilborn says. Fishing by definition alters the marine environment.)
Dr. Hilborn tells us of fisheries that succeed -- like the halibut industry in Alaska -- and fish stocks managed into difficulty, and then out again, like the pollock of the Bering Sea.
And he gets into the issue of trawling, in which boats drop weighted nets to the bottom and drag them along, scraping up everything in their path. Critics liken trawling to harvesting timber by clear-cutting. For Dr. Hilborn, this analogy is not always apt, since in some areas the creatures rapidly repopulate the ocean floor.
Some countries do well by their fish, he writes, but with one exception they are relatively small: New Zealand, Iceland and Norway. The exception? The United States.
The true lesson of this book is that fisheries science is complicated; that the management of any given species must be considered in terms of its ecosystem; that fishing for one species alters the food web as a whole -- and that sometimes there is not enough data to make good recommendations.
In some cases, the only way to acquire reliable catch data is to station observers at ports or even on the boats themselves. This is now routine in many parts of the United States.
But data collection can be expensive, and many countries do it poorly. There is little reliable data from Asia, for example.
Moreover, an estimated 20 percent of the world's catch is landed illegally. ''Almost every fisherman I know has told me tales of making a big catch by some violation of the rules,'' Dr. Hilborn writes. In many areas, rule-breaking ''is an accepted way of business.''
And the rules, whatever they may be, do not apply on the high seas. Is there any hope, he asks, for managing these high-seas fisheries? ''Not much to crow about,'' he concludes, adding that on this issue he remains pessimistic.
That is one reason people debate the value of certification programs -- efforts to identify fish that are sustainably harvested and can be eaten with a clear conscience. These efforts are ''controversial,'' Dr. Hilborn writes; the fishing industry typically regards the standards as unnecessarily high.
''Overfishing'' is part of the Oxford University Press series ''What Everyone Needs to Know,'' which has already addressed nuclear energy and the Arab Spring and is planning books on reproductive politics and the legalization of marijuana.
The book is a primer. Its Q.-and-A. prose is not exactly lively. In an interview, Dr. Hilborn said he made a deliberate decision to write a book that ''everybody would agree is balanced.''
''It may be bland in places,'' he said, ''but I tried not to be contentious.''
After years of bitter argument, this noncontentious book should be welcomed by anyone who cares about fish. And that should be most of us: Worldwide, 20 percent of the world's protein intake comes from the sea. If we cannot make policies to protect this harvest, everyone will pay a price.

HEADLINE: New York's Poverty Rate Rises, Study Finds

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The number of New Yorkers classified as poor in 2010 increased by nearly 100,000 from the year before, raising the poverty rate by 1.3 percentage points to 21 percent -- the highest level and the largest year-to-year increase since the city adopted a more detailed definition of poverty in 2005.
The recession and the sluggish recovery have taken a particularly harsh toll on children, with more than one in four under 18 living in poverty, according to an analysis by the city's Center for Economic Opportunity that will be released on Tuesday. 
Families with children were also vulnerable. They had a poverty rate of 23 percent, and a significant number of households were struggling to remain above the poverty line. Even families with two full-time earners were more likely to be considered poor in 2010; their ranks swelled by 1.3 percentage points to 5 percent compared with 2009.
By the city measure, more than 1.7 million residents were poor in 2010, the last year for which an analysis could be calculated.
The center placed most of the blame on reduced earnings caused by higher unemployment during the recession, which struck in New York later than in the rest of the country. The analysis emphasized that the poverty rate would have soared higher -- to 23.7 percent over all, and to 27.6 percent for families with children -- without the expansion of government tax credits, food stamps and other benefits since 2007.
In part because of a city outreach program, the number of New Yorkers using food stamps catapulted to more than one million in 2010 from 773,000 in 2008.
Unlike the official federal poverty rate, the city's measure takes into account tax credits and benefits as well as expenses, like medical care, child care, commuting and housing. Those expenses increased the city's version of the poverty threshold for a two-adult, two-child family to $30,055 in 2010, compared with the federal threshold of $22,113.
By the federal measure, 7.7 percent of New Yorkers were living in extreme poverty, meaning below 50 percent of the poverty line. By the city's measure, 5.5 percent were in extreme poverty.
The city classified 12.4 percent of New York residents as near poor -- living at 100 percent through 124 percent of the poverty level -- compared with 5.4 percent by the federal measure.
From 2009 to 2010, according to the federal standard, the city's poverty rate increased 1.5 percentage points to 18.8 percent.
The poverty rate had declined for years from a high of 20.5 percent in 2005 but began climbing in 2008, when the recession hit. Hispanic and black New Yorkers, including children, were hit especially hard.
''Given the priority that policy makers have given to child poverty,'' the analysis by Mark Levitan, the center's director of poverty research, said, ''the rise in the poverty rate for children, from 22.9 percent in 2008 to 25.8 percent in 2010, is particularly notable.''
The analysis concluded that without government programs -- including the Bush administration's tax rebate and the Obama administration's stimulus package of unemployment benefits and tax credits -- the poverty rate would have risen even higher. The analysis recommended subsidized employment programs and expanded child tax credits to help alleviate poverty.
Robert Doar, the city's human resources commissioner, sought to emphasize city programs that helped keep the poverty rate from climbing even more.
''We have to continue applying the policy instruments we have in place,'' he said in an interview. ''Our city's economy is not stronger than the rest of the country's by accident; our success compared to the nation has been a result of Mayor Bloomberg's sound policy decisions.''
Among racial and ethnic groups, Hispanics recorded the highest poverty rate (26 percent), followed by Asians (25 percent), blacks (21.7 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (15.2 percent). Noncitizens had a higher rate (27.8 percent) than native-born (19.9 percent) and naturalized citizens (17.8 percent).
''What's happening is we're building an enormous group of people who are not working at all,'' David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty group, said in an interview. ''We may continue to see high levels of poverty even as the recession recedes.''

HEADLINE: Hard Road For Those Who Seek Veganism

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE

 BODY:
FromBill Clinton toEllen DeGeneres, celebrities are singing the benefits of a vegan diet. Books that advocate plant-based eating are best sellers. But is eliminating meat and dairy as simple as it sounds?
As countless aspiring vegans are discovering, the switch from omnivore to herbivore is fraught with physical, social and economic challenges - at least, for those who don't have a personal chef. The struggle to give up favorite foods like cheese and butter can be made all the harder by harsh words and eye-rolling from unsympathetic friends and family members. Substitutes like almond milk and rice milk can shock the taste buds, and vegan specialty and convenience foods can cost two to three times what their meat and dairy equivalents do. And new vegans quickly discover that many foods in grocery stores and on restaurant menus have hidden animal ingredients.
''The dominant social-cultural norm in the West is meat consumption,'' said Hanna Schosler, a researcher in the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in Amsterdam, who has studied consumer acceptance of meat substitutes. ''The people who want to shift to a more vegetarian diet find they face physical constraints and mental constraints. It's not very accepted in our society not to eat meat.'' 
Still, the numbers are substantial, according to according to a 2008 report in Vegetarian Times. Three percent of American adults, 7.3 million people, follow a vegetarian diet, and one million of them are vegans, who eat no animal products at all - no meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, even honey. (And 23 million say they rarely eat meat.)
No one knows how many people have tried and failed to switch to vegan or vegetarian diets, but the popularity of books like ''The China Study'' and the ''Skinny Bitch'' series suggests that interest is growing. New vegans often cite Robert Kenner's 2008 documentary ''Food, Inc.,'' which offers an unsettling view of corporate farming and the toll it takes on animals, the environment and human health.
Megan Salisbury, 33, a social work student in Phoenix, says she prefers plant-based eating but can manage it only about 75 percent of the time. The vegan options at the campus cafeteria are limited and often expensive, and she has to drive 20 miles to find stores with vegan specialty foods for cooking.
''I really enjoy eating the way I do,'' she said. ''But even a box of Gardenburgers is $4 - which doesn't seem expensive, but when you compare it to the meat counterparts, it's so much more.''
Frustrating, too, is the lack of social support. When Ms. Salisbury baked vegan doughnuts to share with her family, ''they said things like, 'I'm going to go eat some eggs now,' '' she said. ''They were very condescending. They don't understand and don't make any effort to understand.''
New vegans say it's hard to give up favorite foods and adjust to the taste of substitutes for butter and dairy products. For Linda Walsh of Wilmington, Vt., who was a vegetarian for 30 years before recently switching to a vegan diet, the toughest thing was giving up cheese. ''I have become vegan anyway,'' she said. ''But I think a great vegan cheese alternative will make for many, many more converts.''
Giving up favorite foods is never easy, food scientists say, for it means overriding taste preferences imprinted on the brain during a lifetime of eating. ''In most American adults, meat intake has been associated since childhood with pleasurable nutritional effects,'' said France Bellisle, an eating behavior researcher in Paris. ''Liking for meats has been learned and reinforced over years. Any substitute would have to mimic the total sensory experience elicited by meats.
''It always takes more motivation to change any type of behavior than to go on with old habits,'' she added.
Dairy products are particularly difficult to replace, says Daniel Granato, a researcher at the Federal University of Parana, Brazil, because the intrinsic attributes of dairy foods come from proteins and fats that are difficult to mimic in a nondairy substitute. And because people start consuming these foods in infancy, the taste preference is deeply ingrained.
''Usually dairy products made with milk fat are softer and present a very pleasant viscosity and texture,'' Dr. Granato said. ''Consumers do feel the difference between milk-based and soy-based products. And once their first reference is milk-based products, they tend to reject plant-based products made with oat and soy or other vegetable-based food.''
Vegan ingredients and cooking techniques can be overwhelming for beginners, even if the changes are relatively small. Substitutes like vegetarian margarine and nutritional yeast can impart an unaccustomed nutty or cheesy flavor. Another method for making vegan foods creamy or cheesy involves soaking and blending cashews.
''The one I found weird was miso paste,'' Ms. Salisbury said. ''I used it in stuffed shells, but I haven't really mastered what it's for, but I think it's to help consistency.''
Despite the challenges of plant-based eating in a meat-based world, would-be vegans say they will keep trying. Mary Bandrowski, 50, of Bainbridge Island in Washington, says she has been eating mostly vegetarian for years, but in the past few weeks has been moving to veganism after reading ''Eat to Live,'' by Dr. Joel Fuhrman. She is also trying to push her family to eat fewer animal foods.
''I think my whole family should do this because I think it's better for them,'' she said. ''But my husband is the Midwest meat-and-potatoes man. Coming home to vegetable-stuffed green peppers doesn't turn him on as much as a steak and baked potato would.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Call to Restore Income Tax on Suburbanites

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, will call on Tuesday for restoring New York City's long-abandoned suburban commuter tax to help stabilize the finances of the region's creaky mass transit network.
Mr. Stringer, a likely candidate for mayor, does not have the power to restore the tax in his current post and would not be able to do so even if he were to win the mayoral election next year. Any new tax would require approval by the State Legislature.
But a revival of the commuter tax, which was in place for 33 years before it was eliminated by the Legislature in 1999, has been quietly promoted for years by transportation experts who argue that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs more-dependable sources of revenue to avoid routine fare increases and service cuts. 
Mr. Stringer, who was an assemblyman in 1999 and voted against the repeal, will describe his plan in a speech on Tuesday at a meeting of a prominent civic group, the Association for a Better New York, a regular stop for the city's presumptive mayoral candidates as they try to define themselves amid a crowded field of left-leaning progressives.
The Democratic mayoral primary is more than a year away, but Mr. Stringer will not be the first candidate to try to stake out a novel position on a major policy issue. Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, for instance, delivered a speech last month on the Police Department's controversial stop-and-frisk tactics.
Mr. Stringer said in an interview on Monday that his speech would focus on transportation because of its historical role in promoting the city's economic development.
''We need to get back to an era in which public transportation is acknowledged as an essential civic responsibility,'' he planned to say in his remarks.
As proposed by Mr. Stringer, the tax, which would be levied on the income of commuters who work in, but do not live in, New York City, would generate $725 million annually, his office estimated. The money could go to mass transit services, including commuter railroads, subways and buses. The tax would be at the 1999 rate, which was 0.45 percent for most commuters.
The plan also calls for shifting revenues from taxes on real estate transactions, which are now used to pay for day-to-day transit operations, to the agency's capital budget, which finances long-term projects like the Second Avenue subway.
The agency's capital budget is determined by legislators and does not include any streams of dedicated revenue.
Mr. Stringer acknowledged in an interview on Monday that he would have to win support in Albany for his plan to work -- no easy task at a Statehouse where suburban lawmakers are in open revolt against a payroll tax meant to pay for mass transit.
''A mayor has to be willing to step up and have those conversations with Albany,'' Mr. Stringer said. ''You can't talk about long-range economic growth in this city without having a serious conversation about the future of our transportation system.''
There is also a sense in transportation circles that new financial sources will ultimately be necessary to keep the region's infrastructure afloat. The Bloomberg administration has signaled an interest in finding alternatives to its congestion pricing plan, which was not adopted. A proposal that includes tolls on the free East River bridges has recently gained renewed attention from the news media and public-policy groups.
Mr. Stringer's plan earned plaudits on Monday from transit advocates like Gene Russianoff, who described a new commuter tax as ''the holy grail on the revenue side.'' Privately, some planners conceded that in Albany, the idea would most likely remain unaddressed for some time.
Yet Mr. Stringer has found a safe way to campaign on a platform of higher taxes: since the tax would not raise taxes for city residents, none of his prospective constituents would have to pay it.

HEADLINE: 'Bad Decisions, Good Intentions'

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

 BODY:
HUNTINGDON, Tenn. -- Carroll Academy warmed up on one end of the court. Sacred Heart of Jesus, a private Roman Catholic high school in Jackson, Tenn., warmed up on the other. The thump, thump, thump of basketballs bouncing on the wood floor echoed through the vast emptiness of the Jackson Community College gym.
One side of the gym had a smattering of fans for Sacred Heart. The bleachers set aside for Carroll Academy's Lady Jaguars were virtually empty. Again.
The nine girls on the team usually outnumber their fans in the stands. 
''That tells you all you need to know,'' said Randy Hatch, the day-to-day leader of Carroll Academy, a school in Huntingdon administered by the juvenile court. ''That's why we're here. If their parents had been there all along, maybe we wouldn't be here. Right now, we're the only family they got.''
Summer, a 17-year-old senior, wore jersey No. 14. She held a basketball on her hip and looked downcourt. Though one of her juvenile offenses involved fighting, the white scar over her right eye was a result of an unintentional head butt from an opposing player a month earlier, in early January. Summer had wobbled to the bench, bleeding, and passed out into her coach's arms. An ambulance carried her to the hospital down the street. Carroll Academy lost that game, 62-4.
Summer watched Sacred Heart's warm-up shots carom off the rim. For once, she saw no imposingly tall or overtly talented girls.
''We can win this game, if we try hard,'' Summer said with the breezy lilt of a songbird.
'Oh, No. Carroll Academy.'
Summer's bedroom -- the one at her grandmother's house in the hills outside of town, with the bed she usually shares with her son and sometimes with her mother -- has wood paneling and a bare light bulb attached to a ceiling fan. The room is stranded between childhood and adulthood.
There are pictures of Summer as a little girl, a sweet grin under freckled cheeks. She used to do ballet, play soccer and softball, and participate in beauty pageants. There is an ''It's a Boy!'' banner on the wall and a Pack 'n Play playpen in the corner.
It was a Friday night, and 8-month-old DaMarion was sprawled on the unmade bed. The house smelled of cigarette smoke. The curtains were mostly drawn, and there was a mattress in the dining room.
''Before I got pregnant, I wanted to join the Air Force,'' Summer said. ''After I do that, that would help me go to college.''
It was probably a long shot before she became pregnant. Summer's parents separated when she was in fourth grade. Her mother no longer works. Her father has six children with four women, and a stepdaughter with his live-in girlfriend.
Summer is familiar with soup kitchens and eviction notices. A couple of years ago, with her father and a brother, she lived in the loft of a barn with no heat, electricity or water, she said. They took showers in the owner's nearby house. They moved into a sister's trailer for a while. Eventually, they moved to a trailer in nearby McKenzie. Summer sometimes spent nights with cousins in what some call the projects, a den of poverty.
''I never blame anyone else for the choices I make,'' Summer said. ''But I do think if I was in a better environment, I'd be a better person.''
Drinking turned to drug use -- marijuana at 14, and lots of experimenting with everything from cocaine to hydrocodone, Summer said. She has crushed and snorted Xanax and Adderall. She can list street prices of various drugs and explain where to find them.
Last spring, she got into fights on consecutive days, the second one at school. That got her into the juvenile court system. She was placed on probation and under house arrest.
She was already pregnant, by a longtime boyfriend, a former Carroll Academy student who is now 21. His only job since high school was a short stint at the drive-in restaurant Sonic.
The baby arrived last summer, two months early and weighing 3 pounds 8 ounces. While the baby was in the neonatal care unit, Summer could be found out drinking with friends, smoking pot and occasionally snorting Xanax, she admitted.
She missed five of the first days of school last fall, just as DaMarion came home. Summer and her father, leaving for work as a welder every morning before dawn, were told that one more absence would land her in trouble as a truant. After a long weekend of parties, while her mother watched the baby, Summer woke up on a Monday afternoon to see the bus dropping friends off after school.
''I thought, 'Oh, no,' '' Summer said. '' 'Carroll Academy.' ''
Deep into the basketball season, Summer had been at Carroll Academy for six months. There were a few hiccups, including two failed drug tests for marijuana, but her grades and behavior at school were good. She was seen as a bit of a leader, especially on the basketball team. To other girls, she had an alluring mix of street credibility and sisterly sweetness.
''Bad decisions, good intentions,'' Summer said. ''That's my saying.''
Summer packed a bag for the weekend: clothes for her, diapers and clothes for DaMarion. She buckled the baby into a car seat and arrived at her father's house in McKenzie, where he had just returned from work.
Like most parents of teenagers at Carroll Academy, Summer's father has conflicted feelings about the school. He appreciates that it keeps Summer occupied and creates structure and discipline. He does not like some of the demands on his time, like the requirement that he pick up Summer after basketball practices and games. For people struggling to keep jobs and houses, everything from the time constraints to the gas money can be a burden.
Yet because the students are juveniles, the parents are part of the court orders, too. And school administrators frequently use the threat of jail to get the parents to adhere to their commands. Sometimes it is more than a threat.
But if Summer had stayed in public school?
''She probably would end up in jail, to be honest,'' her father said. ''I hate to say it.''
Small Breakthroughs
Like Summer, Tonya Lutz, the coach, thought that Carroll Academy might be able to beat Sacred Heart. But a full-court press flustered the Lady Jaguars.
Destiny, the point guard, could not dribble through the traps. Her teammates, including a seventh grader and four others who would not score a point all season, did not have the intuition or experience to get open or otherwise attract the attention of defenders.
Destiny's arms flailed wildly with each stolen ball. Her cheeks filled with exasperation, and her eyes scanned the bench for answers. Carroll Academy trailed, 10-0, after one quarter and by 29-8 at halftime.
Patrick Steele, Carroll Academy's security director, followed the girls into the locker room. He warned Destiny about her attitude.
Lutz closed the door. It did not stop the sound of Sacred Heart's coach screaming at his players in the next room.
''You all are playing down to the competition!'' he yelled.
The competition, Carroll Academy, heard every insult. A couple of the girls, including Summer, had tears in their eyes.
Lutz simmered, then boiled.
''You want to get out there with that coach?'' she hollered. ''You're ready to cry! You're ready to cry!''
The coaches took turns shouting at their teams, a song-and-answer routine through thin walls. When one paused, the other answered, as if part of an opera.
Lutz, who played point guard on a state championship team in high school, showed Destiny how to step through a defensive trap. She asked a girl to stand up as a prop, then aggressively stepped around her, knocking her into the laps of teammates. She pushed aside another with her backside to demonstrate rebounding technique.
''Use your rear end,'' she said. ''God gave you one. Use it.''
Lutz finally dismissed the players. As the team quietly headed back out to the floor, she stopped.
''Real coaches do that,'' Lutz said of the opposing coach, screaming at his team despite a 21-point halftime lead. ''I like that.''
Carroll Academy was on its way to losing, 54-15. But early in the third quarter, when the ball went out of bounds under the basket, Lutz ordered an inbounds play that the team had practiced. She reminded Summer to set the screen.
''Yes, ma'am,'' Summer said.
Summer set the screen. Destiny broke open and received the pass. Her shot swished.
Lutz smiled. Sometimes, it clicks.
THE LADY JAGUARS: Part 3: Carroll Academy is a day school in Huntingdon, Tenn., operated by the Carroll County Juvenile Court and financed mostly by the state's Department of Children's Services. The region is beset by high unemployment, rampant prescription drug abuse and the proliferation of methamphetamine labs. The Carroll County Juvenile Court judge, who has authority over the school, and Carroll Academy's director gave The New York Times unrestricted access to explore the school through its girls basketball team, whose players have little experience with organized sports and myriad troubles outside of school. For this five-part series, The Times spoke with the girls, many of their parents and relatives, school administrators and coaches.

HEADLINE: Echoes of the End of the Raj

BYLINE: By KWASI KWARTENG. 
Kwasi Kwarteng, a Conservative member of the British Parliament, is the author of ''Ghosts of Empire: Britain's Legacies in the Modern World.''

 BODY:
London
THE Arab Spring, the threat of Iran as an emerging nuclear power, the continuing violence in Syria and the American reluctance to get involved there have all signaled the weakness, if not the end, of America's role as a world policeman. President Obama himself said in a speech last year: ''America cannot use our military wherever repression occurs.''
America's position today reminds me of Britain's situation in 1945. Deep in debt and committed to building its National Health Service and other accouterments of the welfare state, Britain no longer could afford to run an empire. 
Moreover, Britain, which so proudly ruled the waves a generation ago, was tired; it lacked the willpower to pursue its imperial destiny. America's role as an imperialist is even more fragile, as it never had Britain's self-confident faith in its own imperial destiny. Americans have always been ambivalent about the role of global hegemon.
Today, American retreat is not motivated by traditional isolationism, but by practical necessity. Like post-World War II Britain, contemporary America no longer has the financial resources to maintain an empire -- one which, in America's case, was pursued only halfheartedly in the first place. Deficits and debt have been more damaging to dreams of empire than any genuine shift in ideology.
My own parents grew up in the Gold Coast of Africa, as British power ebbed, so I feel I have a direct connection with this phenomenon of collapsing empires. The Gold Coast, of course, became Ghana in 1957, the year after the Suez crisis. Today I am a member of Parliament, so I have a double perspective on empire.
Much as the Second World War has been identified as the end of the British Empire, future historians may well see the financial crisis of 2008 as the end of the American empire. Yet, the retreat of American power, particularly in the Middle East, has potentially left the world considerably more unstable and uncertain.
America is a much smaller figure than the colossus that seemed to bestride the world in 1989, when an article titled ''The End of History?'' could, paradox though it was, be taken seriously.
The suspicion has always lingered that America was a less than enthusiastic imperial power. It never sought to administer foreign lands directly and indefinitely, even though the presence of American bases in Japan, Germany, Britain and, more lately, in Saudi Arabia did look like soft imperialism.
During the cold war, America saw itself as the leader of the ''free world,'' a claim to moral leadership as bold as that of any empire in history. Its dominion relied on the force of alliance, direct assistance and social and economic example, rather than occupation. Only in the last 10 years has America intervened militarily to decide who rules in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. This assumption of responsibility as a global policeman was nothing if not the act of an empire. Yet Americans were always reluctant to admit this.
It was striking that, during this period, neoconservatives espoused a more overt imperialism. American reluctance to wield the sword of Britannia was the core of their irritation at their country's foreign policy. They exhorted the United States, like a slow, sluggish pupil, to play a role for which it had no natural inclination.
A hesitancy to get involved in the messy details of international politics has been a feature of the American body politic since independence. George Washington's famous admonition to ''avoid foreign entanglements'' is one of history's most notorious false quotations -- a three-word compression of a more subtle thought about avoiding Europe's squabbles. Nowhere, in fact, does that phrase appear in the great Farewell Address of 1796. Yet subsequent leaders have followed the accepted version of Washington's remarks. Later, Woodrow Wilson preached self-determination abroad, and the Vietnam War taught Americans that their powers were limited. Today, the neoconservatives seem like quaint figures from a past that many Americans would rather forget. In 23 years we have gone from the ''end of history,'' a world in which liberal capitalism and democracy seemed utterly dominant, to President Obama's rather limp declaration about the limits on what America can do.
The financial crisis and mounting indebtedness have finally led to an end to American imperial behavior. It is unlikely, even if the economy recovers, that the country will enter campaigns with the buoyancy and naivete of its invasion of Iraq in 2003.
The history of the British Empire suggests that any form of empire is misguided. First, empire is too expensive. The rise of China and the emerging world has meant that, even if America rebounds, its economy's relative size will be smaller. Surely it will not be as preponderant as it was in 1945 and 1989. This alone makes multilateral action more likely than solitary leadership.
Second, as the British discovered, maintaining an empire requires too many calculations and too much knowledge -- experience, even -- for any one power in today's world even to attempt it.
Iraq and Afghanistan should have taught America those lessons.

HEADLINE: U.S. Candidate Is Chosen to Lead the World Bank

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The World Bank on Monday named as its next president Jim Yong Kim, a global health expert and the president of Dartmouth College, a widely expected appointment that continues the longstanding tradition of an American leading the Washington-based development institution.
While the selection of Dr. Kim by the bank's 25-member executive board was no surprise, the board had, for the first time, considered more than one candidate for the job, a reflection of the increasing clout of emerging market nations on the global stage. 
That increasing clout will be one of the major dynamics Dr. Kim will have to negotiate when he takes the helm of the bank on July 1. In a statement, Dr. Kim said he promised to ''seek a new alignment of the World Bank Group with a rapidly changing world'' during his tenure as president.
Cash-rich emerging economies like China, Brazil and India are driving much of the world's growth in the wake of the global recession. They are becoming major investors in and lenders to poorer developing economies. Moreover, major charitable groups like the Gates Foundation have become increasingly powerful in some of the World Bank's core areas, like global health.
That has left the World Bank without a single strong mandate or mission, some aid experts said. ''The World Bank doesn't have any obvious role in the current world environment,'' said William R. Easterly, a director of New York University's Development Research Institute. ''It's in a state of crisis, losing its traditional market share.''
But that does not mean that the World Bank should abandon the newly powerful emerging markets and focus only on the very poor in developing nations, experts including Professor Easterly say, particularly given that a majority of the world's poor now live in those emerging economies. Rather, experts said Dr. Kim will need to continue to modernize the bank, to ensure it can provide the financing and advice necessary to lift millions of people out of poverty, regardless of where they live.
''The world doesn't need another aid agency,'' said Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Center for Global Development, an influential Washington research organization. ''It needs to have an agency with this broader function, to deal with domestic political and development challenges in middle-income countries.''
Some watchers had theorized that in choosing Dr. Kim, who has spent much of his career working with those in dire poverty, the United States might be signaling a shift in the bank's mission, focusing more on very poor countries and less on emerging markets. But since his nomination, Dr. Kim has stressed that he intends to keep the bank's mandate as broad as possible.
In a statement on Monday, Dr. Kim said that he wants to build a bank that ''delivers more powerful results to support sustained growth, prioritizes evidence-based solutions over ideology, amplifies the voices of developing countries and draws on the expertise and experience of the people we serve.''
In recent years, the bank has bolstered emerging economies' power within the institution, a trend Dr. Kim has promised to continue and encourage. In 2010, the bank's board increased the relative voting share of emerging economies, and promised to revisit the issue periodically.
Those changes have not yet resulted in a non-American rising to the top of the organization, and many developing countries had objected that choosing Dr. Kim as president would continue the long American dominance over the institution.
But in the World Bank board's deliberations on Monday, major emerging economies like China and India backed Dr. Kim's candidacy, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid disturbing diplomatic relations. Still, the representative for several African countries had objected, and the consensus was not unanimous, the source said.
Aid experts also said that Dr. Kim might face the question of how to deal with problems that span several countries, whereas many of the World Bank's facilities are designed to work one-on-one with individual governments.
''There are some really great challenges beyond the scale of an individual country,'' said Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. He cited major roadway projects, adaptations to global warming and smoking-cessation programs as examples.
''The World Bank tends to negotiate programs country by country, and the results are pretty mediocre,'' he said. ''The bank needs a far more strategic and thematic approach.''
Ms. Birdsall of the Center for Global Development echoed that assessment. ''The bank is unique in that it can work with countries to set priorities across countries, across sectors, across issues,'' she said. ''We need an institution with that competence.''
Dr. Kim is a lauded global health expert, a doctor and anthropologist by training. He is a founder of Partners In Health, a nonprofit group that runs community-focused programs in poor countries. He also worked at Harvard and the World Health Organization, where he headed a program to deliver antiretroviral treatments to people living with H.I.V./AIDS. Since 2009, he has been the president of Dartmouth.
Dr. Kim is the first World Bank president to come from a developing economy. His family came to the United States from an impoverished and war-torn Korea. In a recent interview, Dr. Kim said, ''What I bring to the bank, which is a very special bank, is this unshakable optimism that countries can go down the same path I saw Korea go down.''
The White House selected Dr. Kim for his hands-on experience in poor countries. Senior administration officials said President Obama was drawn to him as a practitioner, rather than a foreign-policy hand or a banker, like previous World Bank presidents.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Top Forecasts, Jumping 0.8% in March

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, the Commerce Department said on Monday, topping analysts' expectations and suggesting economic growth in the first quarter was not as bad as expected. 
The gain in retail sales handily beat economists' expectations for rise of only 0.3 percent and indicated sturdy consumer spending in the first three months of the year.
''Warm weather can explain some of the increase, but it is apparent that households are feeling more confident and are more willing to open their pocketbooks, despite higher gasoline prices,'' Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh, said.
Analysts are optimistic that the economy grew at an annual rate of at least 2.5 percent in the January to March period, up from a rate of less than 2 percent that many had expected earlier in the quarter.
The economy grew at a 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter. But the rising optimism over the economy was tempered by a report showing manufacturing in New York state slowed sharply this month as shipments of goods weakened.
Factories, however, hired more workers and received higher prices for their goods, giving the report a mixed tone.
The New York Federal Reserve Bank said on Monday its ''Empire State'' manufacturing activity index fell in April to 6.56, the lowest reading in five months, from 20.21 in March.
Another report showed confidence among home builders slipped in April for the first time in seven months amid expectations of a slower sales rate in the next six months.
The rise in sales last month was broad-based, even though Americans paid 27 cents more per gallon of gasoline than they did the prior month.
So far, Americans appear to be taking rising gasoline prices in stride, thanks to a mild winter that has pushed down natural gas prices and cut household heating bills.
For now, economists said the signs of strength in consumer spending reduce the chances of further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve through bond purchases, or quantitative easing, even though job growth slowed in March.
''The sales data indicates, at the moment, that no additional quantitative easing is needed. It's simply just not necessary,'' Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York, said.
Motor vehicle sales extended the prior month's gains. However, the 0.9 percent rise in sales was at odds with data from dealers showing a decline in unit sales.
Excluding autos, retail sales climbed 0.8 percent last month after advancing 0.9 percent in February.
Elsewhere, high gasoline prices pushed up receipts at service stations. There were sturdy increases in the sales of clothing, furniture, building materials and garden equipment, restaurants and bars, electronics and appliances.
Excluding autos and gasoline, sales advanced 0.7 percent in March, adding to the prior month's 0.5 percent gain.
A second report from the Commerce Department showed business inventories in February increased 0.6 percent to a record $1.58 trillion as auto dealers restocked to meet increased demand for motor vehicles from consumers.
Business sales increased 0.7 percent to a record $1.24 trillion in February, after advancing 0.4 percent the prior month. At February's sales pace it will take 1.28 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from January.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
10 P.M. (13, 49) THE REAL CSI Who doesn't enjoy armchair sleuthing alongside the fictional forensics experts in shows like ''CSI''? But in real life the field of forensics has few uniform standards and sometimes relies on unproven science. In this ''Frontline'' episode (above, Joanna Grivetti of the Richmond, Calif., police), part of the ''Post Mortem'' collaboration between ProPublica and the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley, Lowell Bergman looks at the murder trial of Casey Anthony, the Madrid terrorist bombing and capital cases in rural Mississippi to examine how flaws and inconsistencies in some of the best-known forensic tools can undermine the search for justice. The investigation follows a study by the National Academy of Sciences. 
7 P.M. (HBO) THE DILEMMA (2011) Vince Vaughn stars as Ronny, and Kevin James is Nick, best buddies enthralled by beautiful women (Jennifer Connelly and Winona Ryder), and business partners who are designing an engine that combines fuel efficiency with muscle-car brawn and noise. But what is Ronny to do when, amid planning the perfect proposal for his girlfriend, he spies Nick's seemingly devoted wife in a lip lock with another man (Channing Tatum)? '' 'The Dilemma,' written by Allan Loeb and directed by Ron Howard -- hardly a name associated with frat-boy yukfests -- is not entirely what it appears to be,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''It is less a macho comedy than what you might call a bromantic melodrama, an unabashed weepie with enough beer, sports, fistfights and cars to reassure the snuffling he-men in the audience that their tears are not ... well, you know.''
8 P.M. (FX) FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL (2008) In this breakup comedy produced by Judd Apatow and directed by Nicholas Stoller, a doughy, underachieving musician (Jason Segel, right) encounters his ex-girlfriend (Kristen Bell), the star of a television series, with her rock 'n' roll lover (Russell Brand) at a resort in Hawaii. Good thing the receptionist (Mila Kunis) has a soft spot for losers. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott said that the film's ''overall jollity is streaked with some raw emotions, including jealousy, heartache and humiliation.''
8 P.M. (Fox) GLEE They should be dancing: the choristers salute ''Saturday Night Fever.''
9 P.M. (The Weather Channel) TURBINE COWBOYS Workers face extreme weather, dizzying heights and possible electrocution to build and maintain wind turbines.
9 P.M. (ABC Family) CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC (2009) An advice columnist (Isla Fisher) at a financial magazine is, unbeknownst to her dishy editor (Hugh Dancy), drowning in debt -- and about to have her cover blown by a pesky collector. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis said the film had ''rather less contempt for its female characters than most recent so-called chick flicks,'' which is understandable because Ms. Fisher is ''professionally adorable.''
10 P.M. (Sundance) PUSH GIRLS They're sexy, ambitious and living with disabilities in Hollywood. This new series, which has its official premiere on June 5, follows Angela, a model recently separated from her husband; Auti, a dancer and rapper who hopes to become pregnant; Mia, a former competitive swimmer eager to get back into the pool; and Tiphany, who is searching for her life's calling, as they cope with being paralyzed.
11 P.M. (CUNY) THE STOLER REPORT Michael Stoler discusses the effect of gay marriage on the New York City economy with a panel that includes Ian Reisner, a principal in the Out NYC hotel, and Donald Frank, a matrimonial lawyer at Blank Rome.
1:30 A.M. (Flix) ANTONIA'S LINE (1995) Part fable, part pastoral fantasy, this winner of the Oscar for best foreign film, written and directed by Marleen Gorris, follows the magically feminist bloodline of Antonia (Willeke van Ammelrooy, left), a Dutch matriarch, as she reflects, over the course of a single day, on her life after World War II. Els Dottermans portrays Danielle, Antonia's daughter, an introvert who isn't too shy to stab the village rapist with a pitchfork. Carolien Spoor, Esther Vriesendorp and Veerle van Overloop play Danielle's intellectually precocious daughter, Therese, at various points in her life. And Elsie de Brauw is Lara, Therese's tutor, with whom Danielle falls in love as she imagines her to be a living version of Botticelli's Venus. ''While the film rejects and even mocks ideas of organized religion, it has a solid faith in nature and destiny, as well as in the fundamental goodness of its women,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The Times.

HEADLINE: Exxon and Russia's Oil Company in Deal for Joint Projects

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Exxon Mobil and the Russian state oil company Rosneft signed a strategic agreement on Monday that will open American domestic oil and gas fields to Russian investment for the first time.
For Exxon Mobil, the deal offers expanded access to Russia's offshore Arctic fields as it strains to find new reserves. But the agreement also means that Exxon will be wading more deeply into Russia's risky business environment.
The deal is potentially even more significant for Russia, which will gain at least some access to modern drilling techniques developed in American shale fields over the last decade. Since the days of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin has been eager to exploit giant nonporous rock fields in western Siberia, but the fields have proved unproductive using conventional vertical drilling techniques. 
The Russian prime minister Vladimir V. Putin signaled the importance of the agreement, the broad outlines of which were agreed to last August, by hosting the signing ceremony at his home near Moscow.
The agreement will form joint ventures in the frigid Kara Sea north of Siberia and the Black Sea, with initial exploration plans costing an estimated $3.2 billion. The Kara Sea prospect alone is estimated to hold 36 billion barrels of recoverable reserves, well more than the American company's entire reserve base of oil and gas.
Meanwhile, a Rosneft subsidiary will acquire minority shares in two shale and nonporous rock oil fields in West Texas and western Canada and more than a dozen oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico operated by Exxon Mobil.
''Today Rosneft and Exxon Mobil enter offshore projects of unprecedented scale,'' said Eduard Y. Khudainatov, Rosneft's president. ''In so doing, we lay the foundation for a long-term growth of the Russian oil and gas industry.''
The deal has been in the making for months, but Exxon Mobil, which is based in Irving, Tex., had warned that it could not complete major investments in Russia's Arctic without first receiving assurances of a fair, long-term taxation regime. Mr. Putin appeared to try to put that concern to rest last week when he announced the canceling of high taxes on exports from new offshore fields for five to 15 years, depending on the scale of the project.
By creating what he called ''globally competitive conditions,'' Mr. Putin was looking to attract investment in Russian oil and gas projects from Exxon Mobil, Total of France and Statoil of Norway to ensure the continued production of roughly 10 million barrels of oil a day as domestic consumption climbed. High oil prices have been a boon to the Russian economy.
Energy specialists said that because Rosneft will be a minority investor in American fields, Exxon Mobil can control how much technology will be accessible to the Russians.
''They will only see what is happening through the boardroom,'' said David L. Goldwyn, a former State Department coordinator for international energy affairs. Nevertheless, the deal ''gives Exxon access to the Arctic and gives Russia access to Exxon's sophisticated project management, capital discipline and technologies,'' he said. ''These have not been the hallmarks of Russian national oil companies.''
Western oil companies have long desired to invest more deeply in Russia, which is virtually tied with Saudi Arabia as the biggest oil producer in the world. But Russia has reneged on oil deals before, and the politics that surround the rough-and-tumble Russian business sector can be unpredictable.
Rosneft's effort to complete a similar strategic partnership with BP collapsed last year. The British company had a separate joint venture with another group of Russian investors, who sued and blocked the Rosneft deal in an international court. It was an embarrassment for Mr. Putin, who had publicly endorsed the BP-Rosneft arrangement, and for BP, which was trying to regain momentum after its giant Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.
Six years ago, the Kremlin compelled Royal Dutch Shell to sell half of a Sakhalin Island offshore development project to Gazprom, a state company, after Shell spent more than $20 billion on the project.
The Exxon-Rosneft deal represents a major new Russian investment in the United States. The Russian oil company Lukoil has a network of gas stations around the country, and Lukoil has expressed interest in investing in American oil and gas fields. But until now, the Russians had not followed Chinese, Australian, Canadian and several European companies in investing in American shale fields.
''Russia's current fields are maturing and the country needs to develop a new generation of fields,'' said Adnan Vatansever, a specialist in the Russian energy sector at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
''This deal may help the Russians learn how to develop them, and it will take some time and expertise to do that,'' he said.
Until now, Exxon's top investment in Russia has been a production sharing agreement on Sakhalin Island, which waived local taxes and provided the Russian government a share of the produced oil. Exxon Mobil reduced its involvement in Russia after its effort to buy a piece of the Russian oil company Yukos was upended by the arrest in 2003 of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who owned Yukos at the time.
''Today really is a historic day,'' said Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil's chief executive, at the signing ceremony. ''It marks the beginning of a new and broader relationship between our companies.''

HEADLINE: Aides Play Down Romney's Talk on Taxes for Wealthy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Senior advisers to Mitt Romney said Monday that Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, was merely tossing around ideas, not making policy announcements, when his chat with donors about some significant changes to the tax code was overheard by reporters at a fund-raiser this weekend.
Campaign surrogates and officials played down Mr. Romney's candid talk about tax changes for the wealthy, including ending mortgage interest deductions for second homes, eliminating deductions for state and local taxes, as well as closing or merging federal agencies that deal with education and housing. 
Those remarks to a backyard gathering of high-dollar donors in Palm Beach, Fla., on Sunday night were overheard by reporters for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, prompting a day of explanation by Mr. Romney's campaign and a new opening for attack by President Obama's campaign and the Democrats.
Advisers to Mr. Obama used Mr. Romney's comments as evidence that he and his campaign regularly hide the truth from the public. Democrats have made clear they intend to portray Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, as willing to reveal his intentions only to well-connected donors, not to the public.
''Apparently, Governor Romney believes only high-dollar donors have a right to know what programs he will cut,'' wrote Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's campaign, in an e-mail to reporters. ''Education. Housing. To pay for $5 trillion tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.''
In trying to convince voters that Mr. Romney is hiding things from voters, Democrats point to the fact that he has not identified his ''bundlers,'' the handful of major donors who gather up contributions from their wealthy friends. And they have criticized Mr. Romney for releasing only two years of tax returns.
''Mitt Romney has made a disturbing habit of hiding the truth,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, on a conference call with reporters organized by the Democratic National Committee. ''It's safe to predict that this was a hot-mike moment that will linger.''
At a Tea Party meeting in Philadelphia on Monday night, Mr. Romney sought to shift the focus from his remarks about taxes to President Obama's push for the ''Buffett Rule,'' a proposal requiring that the very wealthy pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
Mr. Romney declared that Mr. Obama, through tax policies, federal spending and expansion of regulations, has shown hostility toward entrepreneurial spirit.
''The reason this president has such a hard time understanding what it takes to get the economy going again is he doesn't understand the power and impact of economic freedom,'' Mr. Romney said.
Romney campaign officials said he was not unveiling new policies at the Sunday fund-raiser. They accused Democrats of using the episode to try to distract attention from the economic situation under Mr. Obama.
At the fund-raiser, Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, offered candid and casual observations that did not appear intended for wider public consumption.
Mr. Romney, for instance, remarked that Fox News was watched by ''true believers,'' and that the Republican Party needed to broaden its appeal to women and independents, according to NBC. And Mrs. Romney said that she ''loved'' the fallout generated when a Democratic political operative said that Mrs. Romney had ''never worked a day in her life.''
''It was my early birthday present for someone to be critical of me as a mother, and that was really a defining moment,'' NBC quoted her as saying.
Mr. Romney told the donors that the housing agency ''might not be around later'' and said the Education Department would be ''a heck of a lot smaller,'' if not eliminated altogether. And he said that the party must do more to woo Hispanic voters.
''We have to get Hispanic voters to vote for our party,'' Mr. Romney said, adding that if Mr. Obama wins big among Hispanics it ''spells doom for us.''
Publicly, Mr. Romney has hinted that he would limit deductions for wealthy homeowners, but has not said how. And he has resisted offering many details about the cuts to government spending that would allow him to achieve the kind of deficit reductions he has projected, considering the tax cuts he has discussed.
In an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC News taped Monday, Mr. Romney said he had chosen his former chief of staff to oversee the process of picking a running mate, and joked that Mr. Obama should ''start packing.'' Mr. Romney predicted that Mr. Obama would ''do everything possible to divert from the attention being focused upon his record as president and the failure of his economic policies.'' Mrs. Romney expressed confidence that her husband would win, calling it ''Mitt's time.''

HEADLINE: The White House Argument

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
I've been critical of President Obama's budgets. I've argued that while I like the way Obama preserves spending on things like scientific research and programs for the vulnerable, he doesn't do enough to avoid a debt crisis.
I've based that argument on certain facts. President Obama's 2013 budget will add roughly $6 trillion to the nation's debt over the next 10 years. By 2022, Americans will be spending $915 billion on interest payments on the debt alone, a number far larger than that year's entire defense budget. 
If you look further out, the situation is worse. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, by 2050, Representative Paul Ryan's budget would cut total public debt to 10 percent of G.D.P. Current law would put debt at 42 percent of G.D.P. Under the Obama budget, debt would skyrocket to 124 percent of G.D.P.
Extremely senior members of the administration believe these sorts of criticisms are completely unfair and vastly underestimate their fiscal hawkishness. In this column, I thought it only fair that I provide you with a summary of their arguments.
First, their goals. They argue that it's foolish to try to solve the debt problem with some drastic magic bullet all at once. It's smarter to stabilize the debt while also looking after other needs, like protecting the vulnerable and investing in things that boost growth and mobility.
They argue that the president's 2013 budget is a step toward fiscal stability that will also pave the way for bigger steps in the years ahead. They estimate that their budget would produce $5 trillion in budget savings over a decade. It would raise $1.5 trillion in new revenue by raising taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year.
There would also be a broad range of spending cuts. These include the $1.7 trillion in cuts the administration agreed to in the budget deals with Republicans over the summer, and several others (including the somewhat gimmicky $617 billion ''cut'' by not fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for another decade).
Further, the president is parsimonious when it comes to domestic spending. The White House has prepared a series of charts to illustrate the administration's fiscal discipline. The most interesting concerns domestic discretionary spending, which is spending on things like education, welfare and social support. Going back to 1962, domestic spending has hovered around 3.3 percent of G.D.P. In big-spending years (the Jimmy Carter years), it rose to about 4.4 percent. In low-spending years (Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's second terms), it fell to about 2.9 percent of G.D.P.
During Obama's presidency, domestic spending topped out at 4 percent of G.D.P. But, in the Obama budget, over the next 10 years, that spending would fall to 2.2 percent, much lower than anything Reagan achieved. Under Paul Ryan's budget, by the way, that spending would fall to 1.8 percent, which the Obama administration regards as savagely low.
These officials say the administration has also made modest but important progress in controlling Medicare spending, the biggest debt driver. The budget raises some Medicare premiums on high-income retirees and increases some deductibles. White House officials say they have taken enormous heat from the left for putting some structural Medicare reforms on the table -- cutting benefits, raising eligibility ages and changing cost-of-living adjustments. Republican leaders, they point out, have not done anything that brave.
Over all, they continue, the president's budget stabilizes the debt in a way that is relatively gimmick-free. Annual federal deficits, which are at about 8 percent now, would come down to around 3 percent between 2015 and 2022.
The total federal debt is now at about 74 percent of G.D.P. Under Obama's plan, it would rise to 78.4 percent of G.D.P. in 2014 and then stabilize at about 76.5 percent from 2018 to 2022.
Basically, what we're looking at is a period of stability, administration officials say, which would soothe credit markets and give us time to make further adjustments. This, they conclude, is responsible prudence.
I'm not going to pass my own comprehensive judgment on this here. I'll just say that my conversations reaffirm my conviction that Obama is a pragmatic liberal who cares about fiscal sustainability, who has been willing to compromise for its sake, but who has not offered anything close to a sufficient program to avoid a debt crisis.
But we have a campaign in front of us. If the president is truly committed to a strategy for progressive fiscal stability, as Bill Clinton was, he'll make that the center of his campaign. He'll earn a mandate. He'll win over independents who want fiscal discipline but worry about the way Republicans get there.
If he doesn't have a passion for fiscal stability, he'll campaign on side issues and try to win by scaring everybody about the other side.
We'll see.

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans Block Debate on 'Buffett Rule'

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Monday blocked a move to open debate on the so-called Buffett Rule, ensuring that a measure pressed for months by President Obama and Senate Democrats to ensure that the superrich pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent will not come to a decisive vote.
But the fierce debate preceding the 51-45 vote -- the Democrats were nine votes short of the 60 they needed -- set off a week of political wrangling over taxes that both parties insist they are already winning. 
Senate Democrats intend to return repeatedly to the legislation, named after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has complained that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. On Thursday, House Republicans will counter with a proposed tax cut for businesses that they say would spur job creation but would cost the Treasury almost exactly what the Democrats' tax increase would raise.
Republicans say they like that contrast, and their language ahead of the vote on a motion just to take up the Buffett Rule was harsh and aimed squarely at Mr. Obama, who first proposed a 30-percent tax rate floor for anyone earning at least $1 million a year last September. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, went to the Senate floor and all but called Mr. Obama a liar.
''By wasting so much time on this political gimmick that even Democrats admit won't solve our larger problems, it's shown the president is more interested in misleading people than he is in leading,'' Mr. McConnell said of the Buffett Rule push.
Democrats said they saw that as a sign of weakness. Pointing to a Gallup poll from last week that indicated 60 percent of Americans supported the proposal, including 63 percent of political independents, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called the Republican response ''proof positive'' that ''for first time in decades, maybe generations, they're on the defensive on their signature issue,'' taxes.
After he made that comment, a CNN poll was released putting support at 72 percent, including 53 percent of Republicans.
With taxes due on Tuesday, a Washington debate on the tax code this week was inevitable, but the escalating attacks reflect the peculiarities of this election year. Democrats have known for weeks that the Buffett Rule would not win the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster, but they pressed forward in part to try to make the Republicans' likely presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, the face of economic ''unfairness.''
Mr. Romney paid an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent on $21.7 million in income in 2010, the only full year's tax returns he has released. The Obama re-election campaign and the Democratic National Committee again pressed Mr. Romney on Monday to release more than a decade's worth of tax returns, something his campaign has refused to do.
''I don't think he's going to want this present inequity to remain when he is a prime example of it,'' Mr. Schumer said.
In the Senate, all the Republicans but Senator Susan Collins of Maine voted against allowing debate on the Buffett Rule. Every Democrat but Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas voted to allow it. Four senators did not vote.
Republicans relished a debate on their turf, accusing Democrats of trying to raise taxes on investments and capital to feed their appetite for government spending. They portrayed the Buffett Rule as a gimmick and political show vote, whose revenue impact would not even dent the trillion dollar budget deficit.
Instead, the House will vote on a bill by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, to give businesses with fewer than 500 employees a 20 percent tax cut this year. Mr. Cantor says that while the Buffett Rule would raise taxes on ''job creators,'' his bill would spur job growth by easing the tax burden on small businesses.
Republicans and Democrats have created mirror-image arguments to take into the election year. The Cantor bill would cost the Treasury $46 billion. The Senate Democratic bill would raise $47 billion over 10 years -- but $160 billion if the Bush era tax cuts for the affluent are extended.
Democrats argued for more fairness in the tax code. Their legislation would establish a 30-percent floor for households earning $1 million a year.
A White House statement on Monday supporting the Senate bill said ''one in four taxpayers with annual income greater than $1 million today pays a lower tax rate than millions of hardworking middle-class households.''
Republicans argued that no one's taxes should be raised while the economy is struggling to regain its footing. The House bill would offer a tax cut to small businesses, but it is drawn so broadly that it would benefit anyone with income through partnerships and other ''pass-through'' entities.'' Almost half the benefit would accrue to the households with income over $1 million, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee immediately went after the two most vulnerable Senate Republicans running for re-election this year, Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts and Dean Heller of Nevada, accusing them of standing by billionaires while their party tries to cut Medicare. And they vowed the measure would continue to come up this year.
''Sometimes special interests can take a punch or two, and it's only the threat of public persistence that can move an issue along,'' said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, the author of the legislation.
But Republicans were just as much on offense. The National Republican Congressional Committee said vulnerable House Democrats could ''either focus on growing small businesses by providing them tax relief to create jobs or help his party leaders raise taxes to fuel their spending addictions.''

HEADLINE: Citi Beats Profit Estimates As Loan Demand Climbs

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Citigroup may soon get a chance to increase its dividend payout after the bank reported better-than-expected earnings and bolstered its reserves.
On Monday, Citigroup said that more than a quarter of its balance sheet is in cash or other liquid securities. Buoyed by that stronger cushion, Citigroup plans to resubmit its capital plans to the Federal Reserve, which could pave the way for a higher dividend.
It's a bright spot for the bank. In March, the Fed quashed the bank's plans to raise its dividend or increase share buybacks in a rebuff to Vikram S. Pandit, Citi's chief executive. 
After the latest round of stress tests, the Fed was concerned that the bank might not have enough cash to withstand the most severe economic downturn.
The Fed's denial was a tough blow for Citi, particularly after most of the bank's rivals were allowed to raise dividend payments.
But this month, Mr. Pandit is on far firmer ground as the bank reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Monday, driven by steady demand for loans from international consumers and businesses and an improving economic condition in the United States.
Pointing out the bank's stronger capital position, Mr. Pandit told analysts that Citi planned to resubmit its capital plans to the Fed. Mr. Pandit said the bank ended the quarter with $122 billion of Tier 1 common capital, a crucial measure of the bank's health and ability to withstand sudden market swings.
In the first quarter of 2012, it had a Tier 1 ratio of 12.4 percent, which was an increase from 11.8 percent at the end of the fourth quarter.
Citi's shareholders, however, will have to be patient before seeing a dividend increase, from the current 4 cents a year. The process of resubmitting a capital plan to the Fed and winning approval could stretch for months. Mr. Pandit said it could be as late as the ''end of the third quarter.'' In the meantime, he told analysts, Citi would ''generate strong returns for our shareholders.''
Much of the first quarter gains for Citi came from its investment banking business where the bank has worked hard to make up lost ground. Revenue in securities and banking was $6.65 billion, up 6 percent from last year. That is up more than 50 percent from the level it reported during its disappointing fourth quarter.
John C. Gerspach, Citi's chief financial officer, said on a conference call that its trading unit was a strong point for the bank and would continue to surge.
For Citi, the real highlight was the fixed-income revenue results, which jumped 19 percent from the previous year.
Still, Mr. Gerspach said that continuing concerns in Europe could undercut trading. ''If markets roil, things will be impacted again,'' he said.
The bank, which is based in New York, reported that net income was down 2 percent, to $2.93 billion, or 95 cents a share from $2.99 billion, or 99 cents a share in the period a year earlier. Total revenue was $19.4 billion, down 2 percent from a year ago.
Excluding certain items, the bank said it earned $1.11 a share in the first quarter of 2012, up 7 percent from the period a year earlier. That exceeded analysts' estimates of $1.02 a share, according to a survey by Bloomberg.
Shares of Citigroup rose 1.77 percent, or 59 cents, to $34 on the earnings news Monday.
As European banks flail, Citi has gained ground. Quarterly revenue from international transaction services grew 7 percent, to $2.7 billion.
Guy Moszkowski, a bank analyst with Merrill Lynch, said in a report that Citi's trade finance business got a boost as European competitors struggled.
Citi benefited from its expansive global footprint, notching gains in Latin America and Asia. Revenue in the Latin American global consumer banking grew to $2.44 billion, up 6 percent from the first quarter of 2011.
In this nation, however, Citi is grappling with some thorny issues and trying to gain more consumer banking business. Loan balances on Citi's branded credit cards were down 6 percent, to $2.07 billion in the latest quarter. As part of its push to rebuild its national consumer banking business, the bank will continue to court customers for its Citi branded cards.
''That's going to be something that is an ongoing activity for this year,'' Mr. Gerspach said on the conference call. He noted that Citi would ''love to put some of our cash to work in loans'' but that demand remains sluggish.
Average checking account deposits are up slightly to $169 billion, from $166 billion in the period last year.
Citi is also dealing with the weight of its soured mortgage portfolio although delinquencies on loans are declining.
In the wake of the $25 billion national mortgage settlement with federal and state regulators that helped quiet allegations about dubious mortgage practices and foreclosure abuses, Citi put aside a total of $720 million to handle costs related to that litigation.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Should Couples Live Together Before Marriage?

BYLINE: LILY ALTAVENA and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Student Opinion | Tell us what you think about the "cohabitation effect." Would you want to live with your significant other before marriage? 

 BODY:
In "The Downside of Cohabiting Before Marriage," Meg Jay, a therapist, writes about new research that shows more and more couples are living together. Dr. Jay counseled one client, "Jennifer," who had been living with her boyfriend for four years when they got married. Less than a year later, she was looking for a divorce lawyer. Dr. Jay writes:
 Cohabitation in the United States has increased by more than 1,500 percent in the past half century. In 1960, about 450,000 unmarried couples lived together. Now the number is more than 7.5 million. The majority of young adults in their 20s will live with a romantic partner at least once, and more than half of all marriages will be preceded by cohabitation. This shift has been attributed to the sexual revolution and the availability of birth control, and in our current economy, sharing the bills makes cohabiting appealing. But when you talk to people in their 20s, you also hear about something else: cohabitation as prophylaxis.
In a nationwide survey conducted in 2001 by the National Marriage Project, then at Rutgers and now at the University of Virginia, nearly half of 20-somethings agreed with the statement, "You would only marry someone if he or she agreed to live together with you first, so that you could find out whether you really get along." About two-thirds said they believed that moving in together before marriage was a good way to avoid divorce.
But that belief is contradicted by experience. Couples who cohabit before marriage (and especially before an engagement or an otherwise clear commitment) tend to be less satisfied with their marriages - and more likely to divorce - than couples who do not. These negative outcomes are called the cohabitation effect.
Researchers originally attributed the cohabitation effect to selection, or the idea that cohabitors were less conventional about marriage and thus more open to divorce. As cohabitation has become a norm, however, studies have shown that the effect is not entirely explained by individual characteristics like religion, education or politics. Research suggests that at least some of the risks may lie in cohabitation itself.
Students: Tell us what you think about the "cohabitation effect." Would you live with your significant other before marriage? Why or why not? What should couples talk about before moving in together, whether before or after marriage? Why do you think that, according to this writer, couples who live together are less likely to be satisfied with their marriage? Are there ways that cohabitation could benefit a couple? What evidence do you have from your own life or the lives of your friends or family that supports or refutes the "cohabitation effect"?

HEADLINE: Young People Tire of Old Economic Models

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Young people press for approaches to pursuing progress that can fit on a finite planet. 

 BODY:
At the recent United Nations conference on "gross national happiness," a scattering of young participants looked on with a clear sense of urgency as mainly graying dignitaries, economists, scholars and others pondered ways to gauge progress that go beyond traditional monetary measures. One was Christopher Stampar, a sophomore from the University of Miami who works for the nonprofit group Nourish 9 Billion. He received one of the most enthusiastic rounds of applause when he let it slip that he was 19. Read his blog post on the experience here.
Also on hand was Michael Sandmel, who is graduating this year from New York University and involved with the organization U.S. Youth for Sustainable Development. After the one-day session, which included briefings from economic luminaries including Jeffrey Sachs and the economics Nobelist Joseph Stiglitz, he reacted this way in an e-mail message:
It's great to see new paradigm slowly making its way into the mainstream. I think this is demonstrated quite well by the comments made by professors Sachs and Stiglitz, neither of whom, even four years ago, I would have expected to reference the Easterlin Happiness Paradox or the Planetary Boundaries Framework.
But he added that his generation was not taking a transition for granted, pointing to the student-organized Transition to a New Economy conference that had just been held Harvard:
We had around 140 attendees from universities around the country. Many of us study in mainstream neoclassical economics departments where interdisciplinary ecological-economics, and the questioning of G.D.P. growth as a primary (or, depending on who you ask, desirable) objective, is still very much fringe thinking. I don't attempt to speak for all of my peers, but I know that many of us share an enormous frustration with the way in which our supposedly leading institutions teach us about the economy in a way that is myopic, ahistorical, and devoid of nearly any critical conversation about sustainability or human well being. 
This is particularly troubling as we regularly see our schools accredit future leaders in business, finance, and government, sending them into a world of 21st century problems with a 20th century toolkit. Many of us have been involved in our local Occupy movements, including Occupy Harvard, and have been trying to use the crisis as an opportunity to push an agenda of plausible alternatives to unsustainable and inequitable finance-dominated capitalism. Many of us will be getting together again in June for the Strategies for a New Economy conference at Bard College and will be in Brazil for the Rio+20 conference and the events surrounding it. 
He put me in touch with Rina Kuusipalo, the Harvard student who was one of the organizers of the campus economics meeting. She sent the note below: 
Traveling in from Appalachia, Brazil, London, and ranging from arrested labor justice campaigners to U.N. climate negotiations youth organizers and a Deutsche Bank analyst, 140 students and young people gathered at the "Transition to a New Economy Conference," which was an effort to create holistic alternatives to the current economic system -- a discourse cracked open by Occupy Wall Street.
For the conference, we invited in fifteen mentors, including Gar Alperovitz, a founder of the Harvard Institute of Politics and author of "America Beyond Capitalism," ecological economist Josh Farley who works to measure happiness in Bhutan, and Juliet Schor, who used to teach Marxist economics at Harvard, before the transformation of the Economics Department to a near sole focus on neoclassical economics.
Our group of organizers are Harvard students, many of whom spent considerable time at Occupy Boston in Dewey Square and also pitched tents here on Harvard Yard. Other students got involved in the protests against the Keystone XL pipeline. However, we also have to acknowledge that we were among those being blamed for systemic disrepair. Harvard's classrooms are full of the future "1%". Yet, students are in many ways confronted by an intellectual dictatorship of no alternatives. Immense frustration with this state of affairs led many of us to participate in a walkout from the Ec 10 introductory course taught by former Bush economic adviser and prolific textbook author Greg Mankiw.
[an open lettera Times Op-Ed articlea Harvard Crimson editorial]
The dominant narrative says that environmental restraint must be limited and gradual, while social spending must be contained, otherwise the economy will not grow and we will all suffer. This kind of thinking is pervasive, dangerous, and outdated. Infinite growth in a finite world is impossible, growth based on speculative finance is unstable, and since the 1960's, GDP growth and self-reported well-being have been completely uncorrelated phenomena. In this sense holistic, deep-reaching change of both thought, education and practice is needed. Indeed, we were brought together by an increasing realization that our global economic troubles aren't just a few bad apples; the problem is indeed the apple tree.

HEADLINE: Bill Porter, Designer of Pontiac GTO, Moves to a New Biorhythm

BYLINE: PHIL PATTON


HIGHLIGHT: Biomorphs, vehicles that resemble observable forms in nature, were the subject of a presentation delivered recently by Mr. Porter in Philadelphia. 

 BODY:
Bill Porter, the former General Motors designer credited with the 1968 Pontiac GTO, has become something of a trend spotter in retirement. On April 13, at a meeting of the Society of Automotive Historians, he explained in the lecture, "The New Biomorphs: An Emergent Trend on the Automotive Design Scene," what had caught his eye in recent years.
The society, which includes academic historians, independent writers and researchers, gathered last week in the Merion Room of the Sheraton Suites Philadelphia Airport, chosen for its proximity to the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum, which the members visited.
Mr. Porter, widely regarded among the most articulate and respected alumni of G.M. design, headed the Pontiac and Buick studios and was credited with cars like the GTO, 1970 Firebird and the 1995 Buick Riviera. He also helped G.M. transition from bolt-on metal bumpers to the Endura vinyl type.
"At the 2009 Detroit auto show, I had a sort of epiphany," Mr. Porter said at the introduction of his presentation. "I saw a whole new kind of forms inspiring today's designers rather than the speed forms that inspired my generation." He argued that designs today were dominated by forms adopted from nature, like marine animals, leaves, flowers, flames and faces. He referenced forerunners to the trend as far back as Art Nouveau, with the architecture of Victor Horta, as well as examples of midcentury modern furniture like Isamu Noguchi's coffee tables or Eero Saarinen's tulip armchair.
"The Mazda Taiki concept of 2008 resembles a cartilaginous fish, a ray for instance," he said, referencing one of the Japanese automaker's Nagare designs. Other examples, like the BMW Gina of 2008, resemble bats with skin stretched across bones.
He noted that Bill Mitchell, his former boss, modeled the 1961 Mako Shark Corvette concept, which would lead to the Corvette Sting Ray, on a shark and marlin he caught on a deep-sea fishing expedition.
But the earliest pure biomorphic example Mr. Porter cited was the Focus concept of 1992 by Ford Ghia. With its bulbous body, bubble taillights and flagellalike surround bars, the concept, designed by Taru Lahti, resembled a sea animal. In 2002, when Ford sold a number of concepts to benefit charity, the Ghia Focus brought the greatest price, at $1,107,500.
The historians, whose membership numbers about 900, gather every other year to hear the presentation of papers on topics that have included the history of Cadillac advertising and the importance of two-tone paint schemes.
Robert Ebert, a Studebaker buff and professor emeritus of economics at Baldwin-Wallace College in Ohio, delivered a talk on Harold Churchill, president of the Studebaker-Packard Corporation. Mira Wilkins, professor of economics at Florida International University, spoke about the history of foreign investment in the American automobile industry.
Talk attendees came from around the world, including three from the University of Aachen, in Germany, who anchored Friday afternoon's presentations.
